5000|$|Federal jurisdictions may {{presume that}} either federal or local {{government}} authority prevails {{in the absence}} of a defined rule. In Canada, there are areas of law where provincial governments and the federal government have concurrent jurisdiction. In these cases the federal law is held to be paramount. However, in areas where the Canadian constitution is silent, the federal government does not necessarily have superior jurisdiction. Rather, an area of law that is not expressly mentioned in Canada's Constitution will have to be interpreted to fall under either the federal <b>residual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> found in the preamble of s. 91—known as the Peace, Order and Good Government clause—or the provinces <b>residual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of [...] "Property and Civil Rights" [...] under s. 92(13) of the 1867 Constitution Act. This contrasts with other federal jurisdictions, notably the United States and Australia, where it is presumed that if legislation is not enacted pursuant to a specific provision of the federal Constitution, the states will have authority over the relevant matter in their respective jurisdictions, unless the state's definitions of their statutes conflicts with federally established or recognized rights.|$|E
40|$|At first blush, {{the subject}} matter of this paper would seem a {{particularly}} anomalous topic for discussion at a conference devoted to the jurisprudence of the U. S. Court of International Trade (“CIT”). After all, among the some four thousand published decisions the CIT has issued since its creation in 1980, relatively few have involved causes of action predicated explicitly on the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). One might reasonably ask why we should bother devoting an entire panel discussion to an issue that so infrequently commands the CIT’s attention. The first answer is that all is not as it seems, and the just quoted statistic regarding the frequency of APA claims at the CIT is, in fact, misleading. Although very few complaints lodged under the CIT’s <b>residual</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> explicitly cite the APA {{as the basis for the}} plaintiff’s cause of action, there is a compelling statutory argument, supported by the Federal Circuit’s recent en banc decision in Motion Systems Corp. v. Bush, that the overwhelming number of claims filed under the CIT’s jurisdictional statute (“§ 1581 (i) ”) are necessarily predicated on the APA. The second answer is that even if one were to take issue with that conclusion, it is worth considering whether the increase in the number of highprofile actions explicitly predicated on the APA in recent years re- flects a potential structural change in the content of the Court’s docket, or rather is merely coincidental. To address these issues, this paper first presents a brief statutory analysis of the relationship between APA claims and the CIT’s § 1581 (i) jurisdiction, followed by a survey of the CIT’s § 1581 (i) jurisprudence and broad categorization of the types of complaints invoking the Court’s jurisdiction under that provision. This paper then analyzes the recent cases in which APA claims have featured prominently at the CIT, and closes with some thoughts regarding to what degree, if any, these cases reflect a structural change in the nature of claims likely to be brought before the CIT in the future...|$|E

50|$|The kings, who had {{the power}} to {{dispense}} justice and hand down judgments as the court of last resort, delegated this judicial power to royal courts and parlements. But the French king still retained the power to override them at will. Specifically, French kings maintained their privilege to decide major issues and hand down judgements when administrative acts were in dispute. The judgments of the King’s Council of State were regarded as being issued under the King's <b>residual</b> proper <b>jurisdiction</b> (justice retenue), that is, the sovereign's reserved power to dispense justice in certain matters. Legal advisors also assisted the King in developing new laws and, by delegated jurisdiction, directly exercised sovereign rights (jura regalia).|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of complementarity {{is the cornerstone}} of the establishment of the International Criminal Court as well as one of the key factors for its successful operation.   Having said that, the qualities of being flexible and adaptable make the task of interpreting the {{principle of}} complementarity extremely sensitive and technically tricky.   According to the current wording of the principle of complementarity in the Rome Statute, the ICC could factually exercise primacy over the national jurisdiction, if a loose interpretation of the principle is adopted, or conversely being <b>residual</b> to national <b>jurisdictions,</b> if the principle was strictly interpreted. While the principle of complementarity {{was at the heart of}} the negotiating process for the establishment of the International Criminal Court, the emerging practice of the Court to date has left the vast majority of the questions on complementarity unanswered, even the few issues which the Court has touched upon are not immune from criticism. This thesis will thus strive, through an in-depth analysis of the past, present and practice of the principle of complementarity and its corollary issues, to offer workable answers as well as constructive criticism.   Guided by the central objective of ending impunity for the core crimes through criminal justice, this thesis, in interpreting the principle of complementarity, will follow a balanced approach which, while unequivocally favours national prosecutions where possible, it adopts a broadening interpretation when national jurisdictions are genuinely unavailable or ineffective.   To this end, this thesis eventually presents the principle of complementarity as a managerial principle which promotes for the effective investigation and prosecution of the core crimes through the adoption of different policies which encourage, inter alia, a division of labour between the International Criminal Court and domestic jurisdictions, and enable states to carry out proceedings and overcome dilemmas of ‘inability’ or ‘unwillingness’ without the role of the International Criminal Court being limited in such incidents to excluding national jurisdiction.

40|$|Both the US and the EU are {{systems in}} which the law on {{international}} {{jurisdiction in civil matters}} shows a certain degree of uniformity against a background of different state legislations in that field. There are substantial differences between the EU and the US concerning the means used to create uniform standards or rules on jurisdiction and the scope of uniform law. Personal jurisdiction in the US is considered a constitutional issue and the key factor of uniformity is the case-law of the US Supreme Court concerning the limits imposed by the constitutional due process clause on state legislation. Those standards are mandatory to federal and state courts and they apply both to purely international cases and to US interstate cases. Moreover, they apply regardless of the nationality and domicile of the parties, even if those factors are not located in the US. However, the standards developed by the Supreme Court on personal jurisdiction are vague and the application of those standards by state courts has proven a source of uncertainty and complex litigation in many cases. There are almost no federal rules on personal jurisdiction and the long-arm statues enacted by most States are intended to reach the limits of due process and therefore they do not provide further legal certainty. In contrast with that approach, the EU has focused on uniformization by means of the enactment of common rules on jurisdiction which contribute to the mutual recognition of judgments between Member States and become a key factor to guarantee the proper functioning of the internal market and to achieve further integration in the EU. This approach is based on rules which set out common grounds of jurisdiction that must be applied in a uniform way in all Member States in order to provide a high level of legal certainty. To achieve that goal the ECJ case-law interpreting the unified rules plays an essential role. Legal certainty is a key objective of the unified rules on jurisdiction {{as a consequence of the}} role assigned to those rules in the integration process. The EU approach to international jurisdiction based on comprehensive legislative rules has advantages when compared with the US situation especially in the context of legal integration, as American scholars have acknowledged. However, the further development of the EU model should improve some of its features which are neither positive nor necessary to achieve the goals assigned to the uniform jurisdictional rules in the integration process. The development of common standards on procedural fairness in the EU should require the revision of some discriminatory aspects. Especially the application of the exorbitant fora established in the legislations of some Member States (Annex I Regulation 44 / 2001) to persons not domiciled in the EU and the prohibition of review of jurisdiction of the court of origin in the recognition of judgments should be reviewed. Moreover, the coexistence in the EU model of uniform rules of universal scope (such as Regulation 44 / 2001 and 2201 / 2003) with national rules which only are applied by reference of the uniform rules (art. 4 Regulation 44 / 2001 and art. 14 Regulation 2201 / 2003 concerning <b>residual</b> <b>jurisdiction)</b> is a factor of additional complexity, which could be overcome if the uniform rules were to be applied to all situations, removing totally national rules in the unified areas. That development would be in accordance with the nature of the EU Regulations in this field –especially Regulation 44 / 2001 - as a unified and coherent system of rules on jurisdiction, as acknowledged by the ECJ in his Opinion 1 / 03 of February 7 2006 in order to establish that the conclusion of international agreements on jurisdiction in the areas covered by the regulations falls entirely within the exclusive competence of the EC.
