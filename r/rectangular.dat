5|$|R×C denotes a <b>rectangular</b> {{region with}} R rows and C columns.|$|E
5|$|A tulou is a large, {{enclosed}} and fortified earth building, <b>rectangular</b> or circular, {{with very}} thick load-bearing rammed earth walls {{between three and}} five stories high.|$|E
5|$|Altar 1 {{is found}} {{at the base of}} Stela1. It is <b>rectangular</b> in shape with carved molding on its side.|$|E
5|$|Although m1 {{is nearly}} <b>rectangular,</b> the width {{at the front}} is still smaller than the width at the back. There is a strong anteroconid. A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid nearly to the metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the width at the front is virtually equal to the width at the back, so that the tooth is about <b>rectangular.</b> The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly <b>rectangular.</b> There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a larger one at the back.|$|E
5|$|Capon Chapel is a single-story, <b>rectangular,</b> front gable log building, {{covered with}} white-painted wooden {{clapboard}} siding, {{and topped with}} a green standing seam metal roof, along with metal snow guards.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son Henry, 2nd Earl of Orkney (c. 1375-1422) {{built a new}} <b>rectangular,</b> {{round-cornered}} keep at the south-west corner.|$|E
5|$|Human {{occupation}} continued {{throughout the}} Iron Age. A stone enclosure was constructed around 300 BC with timber revetting, and ploughing ceased within the hilltop site. Excavations {{have shown the}} signs of four and six post <b>rectangular</b> buildings which were gradually replaced with roundhouses. Large ramparts and elaborate timber defences were constructed and refortified over the following centuries. Excavation revealed round and <b>rectangular</b> house foundations, metalworking, and a possible sequence of small <b>rectangular</b> temples or shrines, indicating permanent oppidum-like occupation. Excavations were undertaken by local clergyman James Bennett in 1890 and Harold St George Gray in 1913, followed by major work led by archaeologist Leslie Alcock from 1966–1970. He identified a long sequence of occupation on the site {{and many of the}} finds are displayed in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The finds from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, exploring the ramparts and southwestern gate structure, represent one of the deepest and most complex Iron Age stratigraphic sequences excavated in southern Britain.|$|E
5|$|In Shetland an {{alternate}} {{form of the}} banner (black raven on a <b>rectangular,</b> red field) is used as the symbol of Up-Helly-Aa, a festival that celebrates the Islands' Norse heritage.|$|E
5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into <b>rectangular</b> balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain {{distance}} lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight <b>rectangular</b> balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5|$|Monument 141 is a <b>rectangular</b> altar {{dating to}} the Late Preclassic. It {{is located in the}} West Group on Terrace6.|$|E
5|$|Southeast Plaza Structure 1 is a <b>rectangular</b> {{platform}} {{with at least}} two levels. It has been dated to the Late Classic Period.|$|E
5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a <b>rectangular</b> area a by b, and any common divisor c {{that divides}} both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} {{rectangle}} {{can be divided into}} segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 <b>rectangular</b> area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 <b>rectangular</b> area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E
5|$|The Reformatory School and Cottages (1855 datestone) on Walnut Lane, is a two-storey {{building}} with three windows, now converted in cottages, that surrounds a <b>rectangular</b> courtyard. The school originally cost £255 to build.|$|E
5|$|The cemetery's headstones are {{oriented}} both to {{the east}} and to the west. The majority are simple in design, inscribed with birth and death dates, and consist of a combination of rounded, arched stones, <b>rectangular</b> stones, and pyramidal-shaped obelisks that appear to be cut from limestone. In the cemetery's southern section are several small <b>rectangular</b> stones that probably serve as footstones. Beginning around 1950, the gravestones erected in the cemetery became more intricate with polished granite surfaces lying atop rough-cut stone foundations.|$|E
5|$|The dome, {{octagonal}} in shape, stands prominently {{on top of}} {{the centre}} of the cella. It was supported by four now-destroyed columns which were located directly beneath it. The integrated bell tower has been built {{on top of the}} narthex, as was customary in contemporary Byzantine church architecture, and extends from the <b>rectangular</b> main structure. The bell tower was originally <b>rectangular,</b> though it is now partially ruined. It was reached from the south by means of a stone staircase.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Staffa, {{contains}} Fingal's Cave {{made up of}} massive <b>rectangular</b> columns of Paleogene basalt.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} a modern looking <b>rectangular</b> {{structure}} with orange brick and clear glass which is adjacent to Glenn Jackson Plaza and Hudson's Bay, with the Mill Race flowing by on the north side. The north and south faces are clear glass, while the other two sides are brick. The exterior walls taper slightly outward on the brick sides of the building. Bricks on these sides were laid horizontally, while the overhanging roof line contains bricks that were laid vertically. A glass-enclosed stairwell and the main entrance near the northwest corner are the only parts that jut out from the primarily <b>rectangular</b> building.|$|E
5|$|A collector's edition The Nightmare Before Christmas-themed Jenga {{game was}} issued with orange, purple and black blocks with Jack Skellington heads on them. The set {{comes in a}} coffin-shaped box instead of the normal <b>rectangular</b> box.|$|E
5|$|Danish country vicarages {{from this}} period tended {{to be built in}} the same style as farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is Kølstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in {{north-eastern}} Funen. The house itself is a thatched half-timbered building with a large <b>rectangular</b> courtyard flanked by outhouses.|$|E
5|$|Disk-shaped LC {{molecules}} can orient {{themselves in}} a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. The columns themselves may be organized into <b>rectangular</b> or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium's {{original}} scoreboard was a black, non-descript, <b>rectangular</b> {{unit with}} a two line reader panel. In 1985, it {{was moved to}} beside the left field foul pole {{to make room for}} a new <b>rectangular</b> 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3m) high with a fully animated reader panel. The original unit was then used as an out-of-town scoreboard, displaying the scores of other baseball games. When the guitar display was installed in 1993, the original scoreboard was removed and replaced by the second scoreboard, which became the new out-of-town board. From 2008 to 2014, the out-of-town scoreboard was not used to display scores; instead it was used only as a support for additional advertising signage.|$|E
5|$|Group 18 Structure 3 is a <b>rectangular</b> {{platform}} {{located on}} the south side of the plaza. The core consists of large pieces of rubble that suggest some kind of older substructure. The platform has been dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{a matrix}} is a <b>rectangular</b> array of numbers or other data. In physics, a matrix {{model is a}} {{particular}} kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves the notion of a matrix in an important way. A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century {{established}} patterns continued, with T-shaped churches with steeples on the long side, as at New Church, Dumfries (1724–27), and Newbattle Parish Church (1727–29). William Adam's Hamilton Parish Church (1729–32), was a Greek cross plan inscribed in a circle, while John Douglas's Killin Church (1744) was octagonal. Scots-born architect James Gibbs was highly influential on British ecclesiastical architecture. He introduced a consciously antique style in his rebuilding of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, with a massive, steepled portico and <b>rectangular,</b> side-aisled plan. Similar patterns in Scotland {{can be seen at}} St Andrew's in the Square (1737–59), designed by Allan Dreghorn and built by the master mason Mungo Nasmyth, and at the smaller Donibristle Chapel (completed 1731), designed by Alexander McGill. Gibbs' own design for St. Nicholas West, Aberdeen (1752–55), had the same <b>rectangular</b> plan, with a nave-and-aisles, barrel-vaulted layout with superimposed pedimented front. After the Toleration Act of 1712, episcopalians began building a limited number of new chapels including Alexander Jaffray's St Paul's chapel in Aberdeen (1721), the meeting house designed by McGill in Montrose, an Edinburgh chapel opened in 1722 and St Andrew's-by-the-Green in Glasgow (1750–52), which adopted a simpler version of Gibbs' pedimented <b>rectangular</b> plan.|$|E
5|$|Near the baptistery is a {{separate}} <b>rectangular</b> mortuary chapel (ermita de difuntos) built in 1859. A road from the mortuary chapel leads to the cemetery with stone fences. At {{the middle of the}} cemetery is a stone chapel and an ossuary at its back.|$|E
5|$|Structure 6 is a stepped <b>rectangular</b> {{platform}} {{forming the}} middle of the alignment on Terrace3. It was first built in the Middle Preclassic but reached is greatest extent during the Late Preclassic {{and the beginning of the}} Early Classic. It is one of the most important ceremonial structures in the Central Group.|$|E
5|$|Structure B7 was a small, well-proportioned <b>rectangular</b> {{structure}} {{south of}} the main Group A plaza, between {{the north end of}} the ballcourt (B1) to the east and Structure B9 to the west. This structure was likely to have been an altar shrine.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of Sudoku falls into two main areas: analyzing {{the properties of}} (1) completed grids and (2) puzzles. Also studied are computer algorithms to solve Sudokus, and to develop (or search for) new Sudokus. Analysis has largely focused on enumerating solutions, with results first appearing in 2004. There are many Sudoku variants, partially characterized by size (N), and the shape of their regions. Unless noted, discussion in this article assumes classic Sudoku, i.e. N=9 (a 9×9 grid and 3×3 regions). A <b>rectangular</b> Sudoku uses <b>rectangular</b> regions of row-column dimension R×C. Other variants include those with irregularly-shaped regions or with additional constraints (hypercube) or different constraint types (Samunamupure).|$|E
5|$|The east {{window in}} the chancel is {{in the shape of}} a pointed arch and dates from the 15th century; it has three lights topped with cinquefoils and a hood mould. On the north side of the nave there is a <b>rectangular</b> window from 1865. The 16th-century south {{transept}} has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th-century arch, and the east window is small and <b>rectangular,</b> using some dressings from the 14th century. The wide opening between the transept and the rest of the church is spanned with a large wooden beam.|$|E
5|$|The first {{structural}} {{relic of}} prehistoric man was excavated in 1973 at Cefn Glas near the watershed of the Rhondda Fach river. The {{remains of a}} <b>rectangular</b> hut with traces of drystone wall foundations and postholes was discovered; while carbon dating of charcoal found at the site dated the structure as late Neolithic.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the Mark 37 director (pictured) was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the <b>rectangular</b> windows on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the <b>rectangular</b> antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target.|$|E
5|$|The head is a <b>rectangular</b> {{section of}} the cloth which is worn at the front. The head section can be at {{the middle of the}} cloth, or placed at one or both ends. The papan inside of the head can be used to {{determine}} whether the cloth is kain panjang or sarong.|$|E
5|$|The second, newer {{room has}} also been fully {{restored}} as a schoolroom and is currently {{being used as a}} museum. The <b>rectangular</b> room features a half chimney, partial original oak floors, and original blackboards which are set lower for smaller children.|$|E
5|$|The type-A plug has an {{elongated}} <b>rectangular</b> cross-section, inserts into a type-A receptacle on a downstream port on a USB host or hub, and carries both power and data. Captive cables on USB devices, such as keyboards or mice, will be terminated with a type-A plug.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no obvious}} visual {{evidence}} of the linear features usually associated with farm fields in the land surrounding Chetro Ketl, but in 1929 aerial black-and-white images by Charles Lindbergh revealed {{what appeared to be}} a <b>rectangular</b> plot. In the early 1970s the National Park Service (NPS) developed a remote sensing program to further investigate the area using color video imagery. When enhanced and viewed in black-and-white, the video revealed a well-defined grid pattern within a larger <b>rectangular</b> section of land near Chetro Ketl. The NPS employed two types of ground level remote sensing devices to search for magnetic and soil anomalies in the alluvium of the canyon floor. A soil density study proved inconclusive, but a magnetometer identified a <b>rectangular</b> feature , roughly the same size as those seen in Lindbergh's aerial photographs. The NPS researchers proposed that water had deposited iron-bearing clays in the plots, with the center showing the strongest magnetic evidence. Subsequent comparisons with older data reinforced their conclusion. They determined that had the plots been under heavy alluvium they would not have been detected.|$|E
5|$|Though most of {{the square}} has been built up, {{part of it is}} still officially the Freedom Square, and is now in a <b>rectangular</b> form. The square now covers from the corner of Palazzo Ferreria to the first column across of the {{subjected}} parliament, and to the Spanish steps next to the City Gate.|$|E
