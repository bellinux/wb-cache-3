Second, social and political structures are not absent in the Maghreb, rather they are quite discernable and can be seen as continuations and mim-icking of existing structures.

40|$|In recent times, {{there have}} been apprehensions as to whether outlays under Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) result from an {{oblivious}} ‘one-size-fits-all ’ decision resulting in ‘equal ’ distribution of resources or targeted in an equitable manner across various states, and within states, across districts and blocks based on informed decisions.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis dealt with the attentional blink: a phenomenon that provides {{a window into the}} temporal and functional architecture of the processes mediating the selection and transfer of visual information into awareness. The main empirical hallmark of the attentional blink is the finding of an impairment in responses to the second of two stimuli presented briefly and within half a second of each other. The types of stimuli and tasks across which such impairments have been found to occur are diverse. For example, an attentional blink can be triggered by making a speeded pitch discrimination response to a low or a high pitched beep (Jolicoeur, 1999) and it can impair performance on tasks as simple as detecting a pop-out search target (Joseph, Chun & Nakayama, 1997). One of the main goals of the research summarized in this chapter was to challenge the inevitability of the impairment in report of the second target presented during the attentional blink. To this end, different manipulations were applied to tasks requiring report of two masked, visual targets, in an attempt to facilitate the transfer of T 2 to visual awareness. In summary, the present research revealed the following characteristics of the processes involved in selecting and consolidating visual stimuli that are presented in rapid succession. First, an attentional blink is triggered when a masked stimulus that attracts attention either because it has to be identified or because it cannot be ignored and therefore produces contingent attentional capture (see Chapter 4). This is evidenced by a marked impairment in the identification of second targets presented within a period of approximately 500 ms after the presentation of this first stimulus. The impairment in second target identification can be attenuated or even fully prevented by precuing the arrival of the second target with an item that matches the target specification for T 2 (Chapters 2 and 3). Whether or not a precuing manipulation will produce full recovery or only attenuation of the impairment in T 2 report may depend on the temporal interval separating the onset of the cue and that of the target. Effective precues are items that match the visual characteristics of the targets, whereas categorical precues and memorized distractor precues do not produce enhanced report of T 2. The attentional blink does not affect the ability to <b>reorient</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of spatial attention to a location different than the one where the first target was presented. In particular, similar impairments in second target report are observed regardless of whether this target is presented at the same or at a different location than the first target (Chapter 4). RSVP targets are not more likely to be reported when they are held in memory (Chapter 5). Instead, surprisingly, report of these targets was found to impaired relative to report of non-memorized targets...|$|E
30|$|The current {{day and age}} {{has seen}} {{immigration}} and human mobility become representative of globalization, with an inherent lack of control over boundaries and impacts on economics and welfare. With our current interpretative frameworks, we usually see these phenomena meet with opposition, both because of the diversity they brings and because they falls prey to the nationalist agenda. In this context, interculturalism can help generate answers where a boundless multiculturalism or rigid national civism may have difficulties. This is probably {{one reason why the}} ICP can be seen to represent a challenge to both policy paradigms. Rootless cosmopolitan global citizens are despised by nationalists as much as they are by boundless multiculturalists. The post-M period where the diversity debate lays, illustrates that European societies have fallen to some sort of vicious circle. In the age of populism, to use Kymlicka’s words (Kymlicka, 2016), multicultural master narratives nurture anti-immigrant arguments and feelings, or even radical views of national civic integration, ranking duties as a condition sine qua non of rights. The contacts-based approach of the ICP can thus be seen as an opportunity to break this vicious circle, by bridging the tension between the MCP and the NCP. This position of an arbiter must be taken seriously, since it can <b>reorient</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of both policy paradigms and invite them to centre their views on contact between people from different backgrounds, including nationals. We can perfectly consider that both the MCP and the NCP are diversity strategies to ensure the necessary conditions for contact. Multiculturalism’s concern about equality and power sharing and the civic integrationist concern about minimum standards of language and knowledge on tradition and values are contributing ultimately to the promotion of “contact zones”. But the contacts-based approach is not consubstantial to the other two policy paradigms. This follows the need to abandon this old-fashioned universalist view of diversity policies as being a single comprehensive and integral way to manage the Unity and Diversity nexus. In an ideal distribution of functions, the MCP would be in charge of protecting diversity while the NCP would be tasked with defending unity (however this Unity needs to be rebooted incoporating diversity). The contacts-based approach of the ICP cannot be successful if a minimum (but limited) range of multicultural and national civic conditions are not met. But the fact that MCP and NCP are able to create the conditions for contact {{does not necessarily mean that}} it will happen. Consequently, there is a need for a policy the main target of which is to encourage contact among people. It is here that we can find interculturalism’s main scope for legitimization. The golden rule of intercultural citizenship (Zapata-Barrero, 2016 b) is that through contacts people socialize in diversity and develop feelings of membership. There cannot be integration and inclusion without contact with other people with different backgrounds. It is through contact that people develop trust and solidarity, it is through contact that people develop a new public culture, a culture of diversity. Taking this building block of the ICP, in the current research agenda we are now in the phase of looking for factors to consolidate the policy paradigm, as markers of European identity (Zapata-Barrero, 2017 a).|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{networking}} in Canada, {{like most}} of the developed world, involves significant use of media to maintain relationships. This is not the use of media for faraway alters where in person contact is difficult, but media use within the very fabric of everyday life alongside in person contact.

So instead of suggesting another response to the issue of so-cial isolation, this thesis <b>reorients</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> towards a different question: under what conditions are alters accessible and how does multiple media use affect this accessi-bility? Rather than suggest that new media simply offer “more ” social accessibility, I contend that they complicate social accessibility by offering individuals increasingly differentiated ways to habitually maintain contact with each other. The result of this differentiation is that while individuals might be able to maintain contact with more alters (or at least just as many) in the abstract sense, they end up maintaining contact with the most accessible alters rather than alters with whom one has the strongest ties...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, urban {{greening}} has been conceptualized, and subsequently marketed, {{as a way}} of making cities more sustainable. Urban greening has been actualized in large global cities, regional centers, and also in many cities in the Global South, where it has been touted as a potential solution to the urban heat island (UHI) effect and {{as a way of}} reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. This involves planting street trees and installing curbside gardens, bioswales, green walls, green roofs, and the redevelopment of former industrial zones into urban parklands. This paper questions the assumption that this “greening” of the city must necessarily lead to positive environmental impacts. While such infrastructure itself might be constructed with environmental principles in mind, wider questions concerning the production of such landscapes, and the consumption-orientated lifestyles of those who inhabit these urban landscapes, are seldom considered. Moreover, green aesthetics and environmental sustainability are not always as mutually inclusive as the concepts might suggest, as aesthetics are often a dominating influence in the process of planning green urban environments. This review <b>reorients</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> on <b>the</b> way in which the UHI effect and CO 2 emissions have been framed by utilizing Foucault's (1980) “regimes of truth,” where environmental issues are contextualized within the “colonised lifeworld” of free-market forces.

One of the areas where the new doctrine has greatest potential importance is in cases involving children, particularly cases involving physical and sexual abuse. The importance derives from the fact that hearsay statements to family members, doctors and nurses, forensic investigators, and family members is often critical evidence in the prosecution. 	Despite the radical change in doctrine, the pattern in the caselaw involving statements by children in the wake of both Crawford and Davis is one largely of continuity in results from those under the discredited analysis of Ohio v.

The one exception is for statements from children to police officers and those closely analogous—where exclusion under Crawford and Davis is now relatively uniform.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} ways Kānaka Hawaiʻi (Hawaiians) living in California and Oregon {{in the nineteenth}} century incorporated western North America into Kanaka conceptions of ‘āina (land) by looking at gold-mining communities, families, and the ways Kānaka maintained connections with the Hawaiian Islands. It shows that Kānaka included western North America within concepts of ‘āina by viewing the ocean {{as an extension of the}} ‘āina, defining physical spaces, working the land, establishing social and familial relationships, and linking experiences and stories to specific sites. It also shows that Kānaka maintained and formed new connections with the Hawaiian Islands through family relationships, travel, cultural practices, communication, and the reach of the Hawaiian Kingdom. This study examines the writings of Kānaka living in gold-mining communities to begin to uncover their experiences in western North America as well as their views of the region. Their writings and compositions show that Kānaka developed knowledge of and formed intimate relationships with the ‘āina of the gold-mining regions. By studying these sources, this dissertation also shows that Kānaka viewed western North America as an ‘āina malihini (strange, unfamiliar land) lacking the genealogical connections of their ‘āina hānau (land of one’s birth, homeland) and emphasizing the importance of the ‘āina of the Hawaiian Islands. Although there are numerous kanikau (grief chants) and other writings composed by Kānaka living in gold-mining communities and published in Hawaiian-language newspapers, these sources often only provide glimpses into the composers’ lives and experiences. This dissertation combines research from various archives and sources, especially Hawaiian-language newspapers, to begin to uncover these often neglected histories. This study provides a different approach to studying western North American histories by <b>reorienting</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of <b>the</b> region to Kanaka Hawaiʻi concepts of ‘āina and how Kānaka, an immigrant population that was neither European nor American, lived within this diverse, contested region by imposing their understandings of place on the land and by forming relationships and communities with American Indians while being challenged by the increasing White American population...|$|R

By approaching these issues through the lens of political theology (as distinct from either political or constitutional theory), hope to show that some of the most significant embodiments of conscience in the American colonies can neither be squared with an individualistic liberalism (as some on the left are prone to do) nor appropriated in the service of arguments that collapse the distinction between church and state (as some on the right are prone to do). I have in mind the political practices of Roger Williams and William Penn. Both are important figures in American political thought, both were known to many of the Founders, and both have drawn increased attention in recent scholarship. Both were also deeply theological thinkers—and their political practices cannot be given sense outside of the theological narratives within which those practices arose. My engagement with Williams and Penn is not confined to their arguments. Both men lived out their political practices in an era much different than our own. For this reason, identifying the theological context of Williams and Penn is only a first step. An equally important objective of this essay is to frame the ongoing relevance of their contributions. To this end, I link the theological politics of Williams and Penn to two contemporary theologians, John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas. I then suggest a way to connect the theological insights of Yoder and Hauerwas back to Williams and Penn through the work of constitutional scholar H. Jefferson Powell. This essay sketches these connections as a roadmap to future work. It is offered as an opening round of what I hope will evolve into an extended discussion about the contribution of these five theological thinkers to our understanding of religious freedom and the intersection of theology, political theory, and law...|$|R
40|$|DissertationFirst dissertation: Rewriting the {{creative}}: {{toward a}} happenings theory of creative composition. This dissertation explores {{the relationship between}} composition and creative writing {{in the light of}} the binary of rhetoric and poetics, and addresses the issue of creativity in composition by proposing a happenings theory of creative composition. The proponents of the notion of creative composition call for bringing the two writing fields closer based on the assumption that creative writing would help make composition more creative, hence the term “creative composition. ” Wendy Bishop wants to erase altogether the line that divides the two fields, and Doug Hesse advocates for making a place for creative writing in composition studies. This approach disregards the fact that creative writing in the university is about certain genres of writing, just as composition is about other genres. That is, the term “creative” in creative writing does not necessarily invoke creativity any more than any other form of writing does. I maintain that we need to acknowledge the epistemological differences that constitute the two fields as two distinct writing disciplines and that, in order to practice composition creatively, composition studies needs to build on the theories and practices that are conducive to creativity rather than on the creative writing field and the genres that are practiced in it. Building on Geoffrey Sirc�'s formulation of English composition as a Happening, I work with Gregory Ulmer’s notion of choral writing and Byron Hawk’s renewed emphasis on vitality in composition to constitute the Happening as a theory of creative strategies. Thus this research <b>reorients</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of <b>the</b> existing conversation on creative composition away from creative writing and its genres to composition theories and pedagogies that are creative. Second dissertation: The last monarchist: stories from Nepal. The nine stories in this dissertation depict individuals’ desperate efforts to keep their dreams intact in times of a national crisis. They are set in remote villages of Nepal and Kathmandu at the turn of this century, at the time when the Himalayan country transitioned from a monarchical state to a new republic as a result of a ten-year-long communist rebellion. On one level, these stories stand as a testament to a bloody war waged in the birthplace of the Buddha, for good or ill.
