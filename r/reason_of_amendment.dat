40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to point out}} the {{increase}} of the amount of the petty cases, to analyze its reasons, to describe the development of the relevant legislation and case law and to deal with some main legal arguments related to the issue of the reimbursement of the costs of proceedings in petty cases. The reason for my research is mainly its topicality and rapid evolution in a few past years. The boom of the mass claim recovery realized by the specialized "debt companies" was the <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> the legislative <b>amendments</b> and led to the ground-breaking decisions of the Constitutional Court, which resulted in the repeal of the regulation No. 484 / 2000 Coll. The thesis is composed of the introduction, four chapters and conclusion. The introduction is focused on the <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> my choice of the topic and on the definition of the specific kind of petty cases my thesis is related to. Chapter Two provides the general overview of the institute of reimbursement of costs of proceeings, examines the varieties of the costs of proceedings, explicates the general principles the reimbursement of costs of proceedings is based on, explores the remedies and deals with the reimbursement of costs of enforcement proceedings. Chapter Three describes the growing amount of the petty cases, analyzes its reasons and reviews [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{drafting}} and operation of amending legislation {{in the light of}} two paradigms of statute law. Part One examines the paradigm which developed in Great Britain in the nineteenth century. That paradigm emphasized the fragmentary character of the statute law. Ilbert analysed the techniques <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> and concluded in favour of the use <b>of</b> indirect <b>amendment</b> and against the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment.</b> Another paradigm <b>of</b> statute law developed in the United States, Canada and Australia in the nineteenth century. It emphasizes the potential coherence of the statute law and tries to realise this potential through statute revision and the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment.</b> The consequences <b>of</b> the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment</b> for the operation of amending enactments are examined. The thesis also considers the argument that the use of re-enactment as a technique <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> is undesirable because it opens up for parliamentary <b>amendment</b> more <b>of</b> the act proposed to be amended than do other techniques <b>of</b> <b>amendment.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Application of {{fertilizers}} such as urea, {{diammonium phosphate}} (DAP) and muriate of potash in soil adversely affected the spore germination <b>of</b> Arthrobotrys dactyloides. <b>Amendment</b> <b>of</b> soil with urea at {{the concentrations of}} 1. 0 %, 0. 5 % and 0. 1 % completely inhibited spore germination and direct trap formation on the conidium, whereas muriate of potash delayed and reduced the spore germination even at the lowest concentration.
