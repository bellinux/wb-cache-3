5|$|GreenSky London, a {{biofuels}} plant {{under construction}} in 2014, aimed to take in some 500,000 tonnes of municipal <b>rubbish</b> and change the organic component into 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel, and 40 megawatts of power. By the end of 2015, it was hoped all British Airways flights from London City Airport will be fuelled by waste and <b>rubbish</b> discarded by London residents, leading to carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road. Unfortunately, the £340m scheme was mothballed in January 2016 following low crude oil prices, jittery investors {{and a lack of}} support from the UK government.|$|E

5|$|Modern Life Is <b>Rubbish</b> was a {{moderate}} chart {{success in the}} UK; the album peaked at number 15, while the singles taken from the album charted in the Top 30. Applauded by the music press, the album's Anglocentric rhetoric rejuvenated the group's fortunes after their post-Leisure slump. Modern Life Is <b>Rubbish</b> is {{regarded as one of}} the defining releases of the Britpop scene, and its chart-topping follow-ups—Parklife and The Great Escape—saw Blur emerge as one of Britain's leading pop acts.|$|E

5|$|Botanical gardens {{must find}} a {{compromise}} between the need for peace and seclusion, {{while at the same}} time satisfying the public need for information and visitor services that include restaurants, information centres and sales areas that bring with them <b>rubbish,</b> noise, and hyperactivity.

Some gardens are now heritage landscapes that are subject to constant demand for new exhibits and exemplary environmental management.|$|E

5000|$|A critic must {{be capable}} of <b>rubbishing</b> his {{personal}} friends and praise artists he personally dislikes. He should, if need be, harm himself.
