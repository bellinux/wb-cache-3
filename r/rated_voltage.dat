25|$|The <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> {{includes}} a safety margin against the electrolyte's {{breakdown voltage at}} which the electrolyte decomposes. The breakdown voltage decomposes the separating solvent molecules in the Helmholtz double-layer, f. e. water splits into hydrogen and oxide.

25|$|Because the {{thickness}} of the effective dielectric is proportional to the forming voltage, the dielectric thickness can be tailored to the <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of the capacitor. For example, for low voltage types a 10V electrolytic capacitor has a dielectric thickness of only about 0.014µm, a 100V electrolytic capacitor of only about 0.14µm. Thus, the dielectric strength also influences the size of the capacitor. However, due to standardized safety margins the actual forming voltage of electrolytic capacitors is higher than the <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of the component.|$|E

Standardized measuring condition for electrolytic capacitors is an AC measuring method with a frequency of 100 to 120Hz. Electrolytic capacitors differ from other capacitor types, whose capacitances are typically measured at 1kHz or higher. For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5V for types with a <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of ≤2.5V or 2.1 to 2.5V for types with a <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of >2.5V may be applied during the measurement to avoid reverse voltage.|$|E
