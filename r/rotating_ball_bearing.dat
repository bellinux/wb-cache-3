A prototype system is set up, consisting of a <b>rotating</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> shaft and an exemplary sensor circuit mounted on the shaft. Three possible transformer configurations are analyzed theoretically and experimentally regarding the self-inductance, the coupling factor and the losses in the litz wire.

40|$|We {{have built}} and tested a 3. 7 -m {{diameter}} liquid mirror that <b>rotates</b> on a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> We have carried out extensive optical tests. We find {{that although the}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> has a poor quality, {{the quality of the}} mirror, with mercury layers 1 -mm thick, is surprisingly good. Taken at face values the instantaneous Strehl ratios indicate a mirror, that is not quite diffraction limited but usable for astronomical applications. However, the large coning error of the bearing (1. 5 arcseconds P-V) induces an excessive wobble, considerably worsening the time averaged PSF.

It originally aired April 9, 2009, in the United States on Comedy Central {{as part of the}} one-hour series premiere along with [...] "Wench Trouble", the show's pilot episode. The episode was filmed in Budapest, Hungary. The producers strived to create the fantasy setting with an authentic tone. In keeping with the time period, the costumes were created with no zippers or velcro, and the weapons were created by an armorer who specializes in creating ancient weapon replicas. To prepare for the Pagan ritualistic dance, actress India de Beaufort was taken to a Hungarian strip club outside Budapest and received hours of instruction on how to pole dance. However, the training did not fully prepare Beaufort because she trained on a stripper pole that <b>rotated</b> on <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> so it would move with the dancers as they spun around, but the pole used in the episode was a tree that stayed solidly in place. Additionally, the floor was wet with dew the day of filming, so Beaufort slipped and fell repeatedly during filming. Beaufort said she was nervous performing the dance, especially in front of her peers, but that it was ultimately a fun experience.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{rotor system}} {{supported}} by an angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> displays very complicated non-linear behaviour due to non-linear Hertzian contact force. The non-linear force and moment {{caused by the}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> are calculated {{on the basis of}} the relationship between deflection, and five-degree-of-freedom dynamic equations of the rotor <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system are established. The Newmark-β method and the Newton–Raphson method are used to solve the non-linear equations. The dynamic characteristics of angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> are computed, considering the non-linear vibration of the rotor system. Taking angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> QJS 208 ACQ 4 C 1 /HNP 4 as an example, the effects of the vibration of the rotor system on bearing dynamic characteristics are analysed. The results show that the spin-to-roll ratio of balls, the slide ratio of the cage, and stiffness of the bearing all vary obviously with the non-periodic vibration range of the rotor; initial contact angle and axial load of the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> change the non-linear dynamic nature of the rotor system and dynamic characteristics of the <b>bearing.</b> The rotor <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system can work stably by choosing the structural and operation parameters reasonably...|$|R
