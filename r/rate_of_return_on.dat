5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to grow in height throughout the 1920s. In part this {{was the result of}} improvements in technology: steel-frame structures had become increasingly efficient, while improvements in elevator design made taller buildings easier to ascend. Commercial factors were at work too, as growing commercial demand pushed up rents, enabling taller projects, while the higher offices attracted more sunlight, permitting the charging of premium rents. The tallest buildings could also acquire publicity for their owners, in turn making it easier to find and keep the best tenants. Furthermore, the higher the cost of the underlying real estate, the taller a building needed to be to generate a suitable return on the investment, and the minimum sensible commercial height for a skyscraper project grew to between 40 and 45 stories. 70 story skyscrapers became relatively common, although an influential 1930 study demonstrated that the best <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> a skyscraper was to build it 63 stories high, returning an annual profit of 10.25 percent.|$|E

25|$|With the {{election}} of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 the water and sanitation sector initially remained public, but the government attempted to make the enterprises operate more along commercial lines. As a result, {{the number of employees}} in the sector declined from 61,000 in 1976 to 52,000 in 1985, real operating costs declined, tariffs were increased above the inflation rate and the share of self-financing of investments increased. However, government regulators also cut back on investments. While the industry became profitable, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> assets based on replacement cost values remained low at less than 2%. As part of the attempt to commercialise the service providers, the Water Act 1983 reduced the number of Board members of the water authorities.

40|$|Innovation {{based on}} R&D {{has emerged as}} a major factor {{determining}} the competitive performance of business firms. However, R&D activities may have an observable impact on economic performance not only in the firms performing those activities, but may "spill over" to other firms, possibly located in other industries or nations. The past two decades witnessed the evolution of a large body of economic literature attempting to quantify own <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> R&D within an industry as well as <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> external R&D. Although in most cases direct comparison of the estimates presented in those studies is impossible, a large number of studies indicates significant and substantial <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> both <b>on</b> own and external R&D capital. Moreover, there is evidence that social <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> considerably exceed private <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> The present study reports first estimates <b>of</b> own <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> R&D in Austrian manufacturing. Contrary to the estimation results for the 1970 s, significant positive own <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> R&D were estimated for the 1980 s. This result seems to be due to high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> the development component of R&D expenditure. At present, research on international R&D Spill-overs is much less developed than that on interindustry Spill-overs. However, recent advances in economic theory – in particular the development of endogenous growth theory – provide a new and consistent framework to analyze the impact of transborder knowledge Spill-overs on key macro-economic variables. So far, this literature has treated knowledge either as a purely "national" or "international" public good. The present study outlines the results derived from a new endogenous growth model allowing for interaction between "national" and "foreign" knowledge capital ("absorptive capacities"). These developments are expected to lead to new testable models of international R&D Spill-overs. It is no surprise that the scarce empirical evidence regarding international R&D Spill-overs presented so far is mixed. However, recent studies tend to support the hypothesis that substantial international R&D Spill-overs do in fact exist. The study concludes that the existence and spatial structure of R&D Spill-overs is relevant for the design of efficient R&D subsidies at the national or international level.

25|$|A {{different}} way to understand the aggregation problem does not involve the Classical pricing equations. Think about {{a decrease in the}} r, the return on capital (corresponding to a rise in w, the wage rate, given that initial levels of capital and technology stay constant). This causes a change in the distribution of income, the nature of the various capital goods demanded, and thus a change in their prices. This causes a change in the value of K (as discussed above). So, again, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> K (i.e., r) is not independent of the measure of K, as assumed in the neoclassical model of growth and distribution. Causation goes both ways, from K to r and from r to K. This problem is sometimes seen as analogous to the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results (e.g., by Mas-Colell 1989) in general equilibrium theory, which shows that representative agent models cannot be theoretically justified, except under restrictive conditions (see Kirman, 1992 for an explanation of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results as an aggregation problem). Note that this says that it's not simply K that is subject to aggregation problems: so is L.|$|E
500|$|In 1898, Knut Wicksell {{proposed}} a monetary theory centered on interest rates. His analysis used two rates: the market interest rate, {{determined by the}} banking system, and the real or [...] "natural" [...] interest rate, determined by the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> capital. In Wicksell's theory, cumulative inflation will occur when technical innovation causes the natural rate to rise or when the banking system allows the market rate to fall. Cumulative deflation occurs under the opposite conditions causing the market rate {{to rise above the}} natural. Wicksell's theory did not produce a direct relationship between the quantity of money and price level. According to Wicksell, money would be created endogenously, without an increase in quantity of hard currency, as long as the natural exceeded the market interest rate [...] In these conditions, borrowers turn a profit and deposit cash into bank reserves, which expands money supply. This can lead to a cumulative process where inflation increases continuously without an expansion in the monetary base. Wicksell's work influenced Keynes and the Swedish economists of the Stockholm School.|$|E

40|$|The EU {{new member}} states (NMS) have been {{recipients}} of substantial net capital inflows {{in the form of}} FDI. Economic policy makers and development strategists often regard them as the pillar of the development and neglect their potential long run consequences: inevitable deficit in the investment balance. FDI however affects current account balance also indirectly by improving or deteriorating trade balance which might overweigh negative direct effects, moderate them, or add to the deterioration of the current account balance. Capital outflows through the investment account in NMS have been increasing rapidly. Namely, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> FDI are twice the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> portfolio investments and three times the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> loans.
