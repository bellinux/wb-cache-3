However, uncertainty {{about the risk of}} unanticipated effects on non-target organisms {{is one of the major}} concerns surrounding the release of biological control agents. This Brief has been prepared with the intention of: • aiding scientists within the CGIAR, national programs and universities who develop, adopt or promote biological methods to control pests, pathogens and weeds; • informing about the legal requirements in different countries for the import, release and commercialization of these agents; and • increasing understanding among decision-makers in regulatory agencies of the risks and benefits associated with biological control programs. This document also provides a list of various biological control agents adopted in different countries, as well as those currently under development, as a ready reference to new users. Biopesticides composed of non-living ingredients like plant products (e. g. neem extracts) or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are not considered in this review. It is hoped that this document will facilitate the harmonization of regulatory procedures for import, production and release of biological control agents across countries in developing regions of the world and enable <b>rapid</b> <b>interventions</b> in situations of pest invasion and outbreak. This in turn will stimulate further research towards alternatives to chemical pest control methods, through biological control or the development and large scale application of readily available products, to the benefit of farmers, the environment, and society as a whole.

40|$|The NCETM {{identified}} three areas which were deemed of particular significance {{in providing a}} mastery curriculum- developing deep knowledge, consolidating particular skills and ensuring <b>rapid</b> <b>interventions</b> take place {{in order to address}} misconceptions in a timely manner. The focus of this dissertation was to research the capacity a form of written feedback (mastery marking) had in providing one of these three areas depending on the child's progress towards achieving a lesson's learning objective. A range of qualitative methods were used to gather relevant data. The data collected from focus groups, whole class discussions and examinations of written feedback was then analysed. This led to particular themes being identified. These included the changing perceptions of children regarding feedback, task type, frequency and delivery and barriers for teachers to contest against when trying to provide 'mastery marking'. Findings suggest that mastery marking did provide children with more opportunities to demonstrate deep knowledge depending on the group they were in. An increased amount of time for children to respond to written feedback was also a result of the intervention. It also brought about written feedback which was more specifically tailored to the individual needs of the children. Particular constraints for the teachers had an impact on their uptake and implementation of the intervention. The implications for this study appear to be that teachers can provide increasingly effective written feedback but particular constraints can curtail their ability to do this as regularly and as accurately as they would like. In order to enhance the quality and regularity of written feedback, {{there appears to be a}} need to mitigate these barriers where possible. </p...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to explore unhealthy sex behavior and the interventions for its control in IDUs. A qualitative method was employed. Six districts in Tehran with a population of 400, 000 were selected. These districts differed in socioeconomic characteristics, urban structure, IDU prevalence and crime rates. A total of 81 key informants from different sectors and 154 IDUs were selected by purposeful, opportunistic and snowball sampling, and interviewed individually or in groups. Ethnographic observations were done to study life situation in the subjects. In one district no cases of IDU were found. In others, sexual promiscuity in IDUs was reported to be common. IDUs report sexual relationship to be more common with sex wrkers. In most of these areas, access to commercial sex is believed to be easy. Sex workers, themselves are commonly drug users, half of them are actually IDUs. Safe sex (e. g., use of condoms) is not a common habit. Homosexual relationship seems to be uncommon in IDUs and there were no reports of condom use in this type of contact. According to IDUs, dealing with this problem would require financial support and drug distribution for preventing sex work, and settlement and organization of sex workers as a prelude to effective sex education and promotion of condoms. "nExpansion of injecting drug use and its relationship with blood-borne infections in recent years necessitates <b>rapid</b> <b>interventions</b> for controlling injection drug use and the associated risks.

The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is on the evaluation of management in traffic safety, {{and how it is}} applied, using the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) as a case study. Road Traffic Management in South Africa {{is in a state of}} crisis. The constitution provides for concurrency with respect to road traffic management, however, no mechanism has been implemented for co-operation and coordination. It has been found that the current institutional arrangements are not conducive to co-ordination and <b>rapid</b> <b>interventions.</b> Due to the scarcity of resources and the desire to streamline the institutional arrangements, an innovative model has been developed which will perform road traffic management collectively, the Road Traffic Management Corporation, RTMC. The implementation of the RTMC will require full co-operation and acceptance by all the various departments concerned, from National Government level, through to Provincial levels, and the Local Authorities. Before the Corporation can be implemented, the funding needs to be secured, and the source of the funding must be stable and committed. The implementing of such a corporation will be delicate, and organizational structure needs to be clear to all parties. At this early stage of the RTMC, the methods of management already used by the RTMC need to be compared to proper management principles, to ensure that the RTMC will have the best structure to ensure its success. Any uncertainties or concerns that may exist among those involved at lower levels can be communicated to top-level management implementing the corporation. By conducting an independent, external investigation, any short falls can be identified which may have been over looked previously. This dissertation aims to ensure that the RTMC adheres to the relevant management principles, focussing on the objective of improving road safety. A questionnaire is devised for the National Department of Transport, so that an independent view of the vision of the RTMC can be acquired. The organizational structure proposed by the RTMC is examined and evaluated to determine the relationship, communication channels, functions and responsibilities, which are intended between the various levels of management and stakeholders. The funding of a corporation such as the RTMC is considered, as the source of such funds needs to be secured before the RTMC can be implemented. A preliminary budget prepared for the RTMC is compared to what funding has been made available. The main objective of the RTMC is to improve road safety. Therefore, the process it intends to use is evaluated to determine whether the goals it intends to achieve through this process are realistic. The engineering function required to improve road safety will also be evaluated in terms of what can be done by engineers to improve the safety on South African roads...|$|E

In terms of analytical approaches, complementing the Discursive Institutionalism (a branch of new institutionalism) with the historicist and critical theory represents an innovative blend and thereby a new contribution to the scholarship on Europeanisation of higher education. The analysis is based on a particular set of ideational rules and discursive regularities that emerge in the context of Europeanisation of higher education and follow a particular logic of communication. The institutions are viewed both as structures – a context that constrains, or enables, the agents, and as constructs that are contingent to agents’ thoughts, words and action. The ideational dynamism was contextualised in the change and continuity of the historical structures and thereby the study accounted for the larger picture of the social world and the spirit of the time. The interpretation of the field data suggests that to a certain extent Europe continues to adhere to roles and purposes attributed to higher education in the liberal humanist spirit of the time and the welfare-state programmatic hegemony. These ideas remain embedded in the historical structure. In the analysed policy arenas they act as guardians against radical and <b>rapid</b> <b>interventions</b> into the higher education sector.

Kljub temu, da smo priča zatonu nacionalne države, ohranja pomembno vlogo v utemeljitvi nacionalnih kulturnih tvorb, zlasti v smislu norm in vrednot, ki osmišljajo družbeno in kulturno življenje. Analiza logike komunikacije v evropskem političnem prostoru je pokazala, da visoko šolstvo namreč še vedno povezujemo z vrednotami in načeli, kot so enakost, emancipacija, napredek človeštva, demokratizacija. Toda dinamika reform na evropski ravni nakazuje obsežnejše spremembe v odnosu med družbenimi silami in s tem spreminjanje institucionalnega ogrodja družbe. Akterji v vlogi agentov vztrajno spreminjajo institucionalni okvir s tem, ko skozi spretno diskurzivno strategijo in ob tektonskih spremembah v historičnih strukturah institucionalizirajo kognitivne ideje oziroma normalizirajo velike idejne premike. Ideje, ki jih je moč zaznati v diskurzu gospodarstva in družbe znanja, postavljajo visoko šolstvo v vlogo motorja gospodarskega razvoja. V tem imaginariju država ohranja visoko stopnjo interesa za vzdrževanje regulacijskih mehanizmov, financiranja in evalvacije uspešnosti univerz. Raziskava pa je pripeljala do interpretacije še enega, vzporednega idejnega trenda – do ideacije visokega šolstva kot dobičkonosne storitve na čezmejnih trgih. Odpiranje globalnega trga storitev predstavlja gospodarsko priložnost za transnacionalne oblike izobraževanja. Zaznati je moč globalnega strukturiranja visokega šolstva na osnovi hierarhije univerz in geografske zgostitve visoko kotirajočih raziskovalnih univerz. Ideacija visokega šolstva kot tržnega blaga izhaja iz tektonskih premikov v historičnih strukturah – v razmerjih med spreminjajočimi se gospodarskimi odnosi, idejnimi tokovi. Ti se razvijajo v smeri vzpona hegemonije ideje trga in transnacionalnih ekonosmkih ter družbenih odnosov.

40|$|Dans cette étude, on propose un modèle {{hydraulique}} capable de contribuer à la gestion des eaux de la rivière Sebou {{au niveau}} de la retenue d'un barrage de garde situé à l'intérieur de la plaine agricole du Gharb. Le modèle hydraulique élaboré (MHS. 1) est du type filaire et utilise un schéma de différences finies. L'écoulement est influencé par la présence du barrage à l'aval et de nombreuses grandes stations de pompage utilisées pour l'irrigation le long du tronçon étudié. Cependant, les données relatives à la quantité d'eau pompée {{au niveau de}} ces stations ainsi que par les particuliers sont rarement disponibles. Ainsi, une attention particulière a été attribuée à l'estimation du pompage vue son importance quantitative. Les résultats du calibrage et de la validation du modèle pour des périodes de basses eaux de l'année 1997 sont très satisfaisants. Le modèle donne les valeurs du niveau d'eau aux stations de pompage et permet de suivre l'évolution de la réserve de la retenue du barrage. Ce code regroupe dans un seul outil des données provenant de différentes sources et utilisées pour la première fois dans un modèle hydraulique. Il représente un atout considérable pour les organismes publics gestionnaires des ressources hydriques. The studied reachThe Sebou River (600 km) is an important river in Morocco and its waters are solicited for several different uses. The Sebou has an average bottom slope of 10 - 4, variable geometry and many meanders. The flow is characterised by considerable annual and seasonal variations (Figure 2). The studied reach is situated between the town of Belksiri and the Lalla Aïcha dam. Flow {{is influenced by the}} presence of two dams, the Al Wahda upstream and the Lalla Aïcha in the downstream reach. The first dam was constructed on the Ouergha River, which has a torrential regime. The second dam comprises five principal and two secondary radial floodgates and these gates are opened from the bottom. This dam is completely opened during the period of high flows. The maximum flow during this season is 1800 m 3 / s. The dam has a catchment area of 2700 km 2. The maximum volume of the dam reservoir is 37 Mm 3. Its length of influence is about 120 km. During the dry season, the floodgates are partially closed in order to increase the water level upstream. The maximum level upstream of the dam is 6. 5 m NGM (the bottom is at - 1 m). This situation facilitates the pumping of water for agriculture, allowing the irrigation of 15, 600 hectares of rice. A volume of 200 Mm 3 of water is mobilised annually, which, before the construction of the dam, was lost to the Atlantic Ocean. The hydraulic model MHS. 1 The hydraulic model MHS. 1 is based on a modification (essentially the representation of the topography and the outputs) of the DYNHYD 5 model. It solves the one dimensional Saint-Venant equations of continuity and momentum (equations 1 and 2). The Manning coefficient used in the momentum equation is evaluated initially by the empirical formula (Formula No. 3) proposed by Chow. The factor n 0 is evaluated from granulometric measurements that were carried out from upstream to downstream in the studied reach. The others coefficients were evaluated from observations of the river in aerial photos, from the cross sectional areas and available photos, and from field visits. MHS. 1 uses a network called ''Link-Node''. The equations of continuity and momentum, expressed in a finite difference manner, give respectively equations 4 and 5. These equations are solved using a Runge-Kutta procedure. Discretisation of the studied reachThe discretisation of the studied reach was performed using aerial photos achieved by the ORMVAG (L'Office Régionale de la Mise en Valeur Agricole du Gharb) in 1983. These photos were taking in a dry period where the river was nearly dry. This situation permitted a good stereoscopic visualisation of the river morphology. The river reach was divided into 529 grids with a length varying between 50 and 900 m. Data on cross sectional areas from the ORMVAG and other sources were used. Near the town of Souk Tlat (Figure 1), we exploited a new technique called ''Numeral photogrammetry'', which allowed us to reconstitute many cross sectional areas. This technique uses principally stereoscopic pairs of aerial photographs and photogrammetry software. The remaining cross sectional areas were evaluated from observations on aerial photos and from field visits. Evaluation of the pumped waterOne of the important factors that affect flow in the studied reach is the intensive pumping of waters along the river. The pumped water was divided into two types. The first type corresponded to the ten central stations managed by the ORMVAG (Fig. 1). The data of this first type were neither centralised nor easily available. Only the data at the important S 2 station were readily available. The second type corresponded to water pumped by individuals and is less quantified than the first type. Two major hypotheses were adopted. First, the pumped flow at the S 2 station was assumed to be equal to 25 % of the total flow pumped by all the ORMVAG stations. The stations were classified into three classes according to their theoretical capacity (Table 1). This hypothesis allowed the estimation of the unknown pumped flow at the nine other stations. We further assumed that in the neighbourhood of each station, the flow pumped by individuals was equal to the flow pumped by the station. This latter hypothesis was adopted {{on the basis of a}} field investigation in a 7 km characteristic reach. Figure 3 shows the evolution of the overall pumped flow evaluated for the months of June and July 1997. These two months were used respectively for the validation and calibration of the model. Calibration and validation of MHS. 1 The Manning coefficient, estimated initially by the Chow formula (3), varied along the studied reach. It ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 04 s/m 1 / 3, with a mean value of 0. 037 s/m 1 / 3. In the calibration procedure, the Manning coefficient was modified to the same degree along the studied reach because we assumed that the sources of errors involved in its evaluation are identical for all the grids. Along the studied reach, the only available measured data are the water levels at the S 2 station and upstream of the dam. The period chosen for the calibration was from 07 / 01 / 1997 to 07 / 30 / 1997. The upstream boundary (at the Belksiri hydrological station) was given as values of the water level as a function of time (Figure 4). The downstream boundary was given as values of the discharge (flow through the dam gates) as a function of time (Figure 5). Figures 6 and 7 give the results of the calibration (month of July). The Manning coefficient decreased for all the reaches by 0. 008 s/m 1 / 3. These figures show good agreement between the calculated and the observed water level at the S 2 station and near the dam. In order to confirm the results of the calibration test, we proceeded with a validation test of the model for the period from 06 / 04 / 1997 to 06 / 30 / 1997. The results are also satisfactory (Figure 6 and 7, month of June). Figure 8 shows the evolution of the water level on 12 / 06 / 1997. The water level profile remains parallel to the bed profile for the zones situated very far from the dam (the downstream end). From the 45 th kilometre (between stations S 7 and S 8, see Figure 1), we begin to detect the effect of the dam, characterised by an increase in the water level (and therefore an increase in depth). Figure 9 show the evolution of stream velocity from the upstream to downstream regions on 12 / 06 / 1977. Great variations in velocity can be seen due to the changes in river geometry. Also, these variations tend to decrease downstream, reflecting the effect of the dam. Figure 10 represents the evolution of the water reserve available for the whole reach during the months of June and July. It shows a series of decreases in this variable due to the pumping of water. The reserve reaches very low levels (15 Mm 3) compared to its maximal capacity, which is 37 Mm 3. Also, there is an interrelationship between the evolution of the reserve, and pumped water and the flow differences between upstream and downstream. The reserve increases when the upstream-downstream flow difference is greater than the pumped flow. Inversely, when the pumped water is greater, the water reserve decreases. Finally, in this study we proposed a mathematical model that can provide the stages at all locations of the studied reach, specifically at the pumping stations. Water reserve availability can also be provided at any moment, allowing <b>rapid</b> <b>interventions</b> when this variable begins to decrease dramatically. However, more measured water levels at different stations could improve the present results. Also, other considerations must be included such as hydroelectric energy production in dams upstream and river characteristics. Thus, a multipurpose model of the river must be used. More hydraulic data can improve the accuracy of the present model...|$|E
