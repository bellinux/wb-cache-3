5|$|The {{monument}} underwent {{an extensive}} restoration project between 1998 and 2001. During {{this time it}} was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves (who was also responsible for the interior changes). The project included cleaning, repairing and <b>repointing</b> the monument's exterior and interior stonework. The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was encased in glass to prevent vandalism, while new windows with narrower frames were installed (to increase the viewing space). New exhibits celebrating the life of George Washington, and the monument's place in history, were also added.|$|E
5|$|In August1998, {{the station}} {{building}} was leased to Amtrak for 99years by the borough of Elizabethtown for $1 per year after ownership {{was transferred to}} the borough; ownership of the platforms and right-of-way was retained by Amtrak. Renovations began in August2009 and were funded by $9.3million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The station was cited by U.S. Senator Tom Coburn as an example of pork barrel spending in the stimulus bill. Elevators were built and the station's two platforms were raised, per the requirements of Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The platforms were also lengthened to accommodate longer trains. Canopies were erected over the platforms to provide protection from the elements for waiting passengers. The station building was completely remodeled, including restoration of the original wood furnishings, replacement of broken slate roof tiles, and masonry <b>repointing.</b> The completed station was unveiled in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May4, 2011.|$|E

40|$|The Authors, 2015. The {{definitive}} {{version of}} this article is published in The Stephenson Conference- Research for Railways, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 2015 The <b>REPOINT</b> project, led by Loughborough University, has been active since March 2011. It seeks to improve the reliability, safety and maintainability of track switching technology, with the aim of increasing network capacity and lowering operating costs. To do this, the project is exploring combining mature concepts from other industries such as fault tolerance, line-replaceable units and passively safe design, with novel mechanical arrangements, in order to bring about a step change in performance. One design, based around a stub-switch arrangement, has showed particular promise and is the currently the subject of three patent applications covering the novel mode of operation. A laboratory-scale demonstrator of all key subsystems is currently under construction, under funding from the FutureRailway. org team. This is integrated with test and monitoring equipment, alongside a rapid-prototyping control system. This first-generation design will be used to prove the concept of operation and to develop the associated control and monitoring technology. The goal {{of this paper is to}} provide an overview of the <b>REPOINT</b> project to date, and the design and operation of the proposed novel <b>REPOINT</b> design. This paper firstly introduces the <b>REPOINT</b> project and highlights of the proposed novel design. It then discusses the simulation, modelling and design of the demonstrator rig, and the associated test and development equipment. The conclusions highlight the progress so far – on the <b>REPOINT</b> project and the Demonstrator rig - and comment upon potential next steps towards network deployment...|$|R
5|$|In 1847–8 {{several of}} the old houses {{associated}} with the cathedral {{on the west side}} were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. Structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, mullions, and decorative ribs in the window in the north-east wall of the chapterhouse (Fig. 15). By 1913, <b>repointing</b> the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century buttressing (Fig. 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (Fig. 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig. 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (Fig. 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (Fig. 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 21).|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further <b>repointing</b> on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E
25|$|Repairs {{were carried}} out in 2012 by HMDW Architects and PAYE Stonework, due to unsafe, falling brickwork, {{particularly}} due to Freeze-thaw erosion in the cold winter of 2009. The scope of work included terracotta replacement across the south elevation and tower, areas of <b>repointing</b> in lime mortar, replacement of steel lintels in the south elevation and the installation of a lightning conductor.|$|E

25|$|The {{exterior}} {{was again}} cleaned and restored, {{starting with the}} west facade on Vanderbilt Avenue and gradually working counterclockwise. The project involved cleaning the facade, rooftop light courts, and statues; filling in cracks, <b>repointing</b> stones on the facade, restoring the copper roof and the building's cornice, repairing the large windows of the Main Concourse, and removing the remaining blackout paint applied to the windows during World War II. The result of the restoration, which was completed in 2007, was a cleaner, more attractive, and structurally sound exterior, and the windows now allow much more light into the Main Concourse.|$|E
500|$|St. Seiriol's Church, {{which was}} the centrepiece of the monastery, {{is now part of}} the Rectorial {{benefice}} of Beaumaris, within the Diocese of Bangor. [...] The church was given a grant by the Welsh Assembly Government of £20,570 in May 2004. This was to repair the leadwork, the rainwater goods, <b>repointing</b> and limewashing of the tower roof and the superstructure of the building. Another building in Penmon, the Priory House (which is set around the cloister court of the church), received £21,600. This was to repair the chimneys, the walls, the windows and the roof of the house.|$|E
500|$|The {{house is}} built of {{two types of}} Bath Stone, and is highly picturesque, bristling with turrets and {{possessing}} an elaborate roof. The combined effect of the architecture and chosen materials {{has been described by}} journalist Sir Simon Jenkins as [...] "severe". During restoration, stonemasons either conserved or, on occasion, copy-carving new sections, carving new mouldings to replace standard architectural elements that formed the weathering, as well <b>repointing</b> most of the miles of lime pointing. All stone was accurately matched to the original, with Veyzeys quarry near Tetbury providing Cotswold oolitic limestone. The house, which includes the servants' wing and the chapel, was made a Grade II* listed building in 1973, and has since been upgraded to Grade I.|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} work-in, the {{remainder}} of the stone floor was boarded, again using double-grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The windshaft, the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint. A new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak [...] long by [...] diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and <b>repointing</b> with gauged mortar.|$|E
500|$|Between the two work-ins, {{the rear}} dormer was {{completed}} and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start {{to be made}} on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work-in. The boards for the cap are ½ inch (13mm) thick and [...] wide at the petticoat, tapering towards the top. A new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft, not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass, and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position, producing a sturdy structure. The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position. <b>Repointing</b> of the brickwork of the tower continued, with nearly half of it completed {{at the end of the}} second work-in.|$|E
2500|$|The {{old stone}} work may only need {{cleaning}} or sandblasting, {{but it may}} need more. [...] Firstly, the building exterior (facade) needs to be inspected for unsafe conditions. [...] Next, the building walls need to be inspected for water leakages. [...] The most likely needs are mortar restoration (<b>repointing),</b> applying consolidants to the old stone, or replacing pieces of stone that are deteriorated (damaged) beyond the point of any repair. The <b>repointing</b> is the removal of existing damaged mortar from the outer portion of the joint between stone units and its replacement by new mortar matching {{the appearance of the}} old. [...] The consolidants re-establish the original natural bonding between the stone particles that weathering has removed. [...] Deteriorated pieces of stone work are replaced with pieces of stone that match the original as much as possible. Exterior dimension stone will often change color after exposure to weather over time. For example, Indiana Limestone will weather from a tan to an attractive light yellow. Interior dimension stone can sometimes change its shade a little over time too. For both, it may not be possible to find an exact match, even from the original quarry. [...] Stone will often change its appearance from location to location in the same quarry. [...] If the dimension stone renovationist is truly fortunate, the original builder put aside some spare pieces of the stone for future need.|$|E

2500|$|All of {{the walls}} show {{extensive}} <b>repointing</b> and other repairs to the brick and mortar. These may be of late nineteenth- or twentieth-century origin as Meade reports in an 1838 visit that few repairs were evident. The present edifice, however, shows alterations to {{almost all of the}} surfaces: south wall of porch; west wall of porch; upper right part of south wall; south wall under window and lower left corner; vertical line between window and eastern doorway; water table between window and eastern doorway; chancel wall on east; chancel gable; chancel water table; north wall of chancel around small window; north gable apex; west wall lower left; north wall of nave west wall of nave.|$|E
50|$|The {{restoration}} and <b>repointing</b> of the stonework {{was completed in}} 2000.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{essential}} that the mortar used for <b>repointing</b> have similar performance characteristics to the original mortar used in a building. Such performance characteristics include permeability, compressive strength, and coefficient of thermal expansion. For instance, if a soft lime-based mortar was originally used, the most appropriate <b>repointing</b> mortar is likely to also contain {{a large amount of}} lime.|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} {{large-scale}} works were undertaken at the cathedral in 1996.

50|$|<b>Repointing</b> is {{the process}} of {{renewing}} the pointing, which is the external part of mortar joints, in masonry construction. Over time, weathering and decay cause voids in the joints between masonry units, usually in bricks, allowing the undesirable entrance of water. Water entering through these voids can cause significant damage through frost weathering and from salt dissolution and deposition. <b>Repointing</b> is also called pointing, or pointing up, although these terms more properly refer to the finishing step in new construction.|$|E

Track switching provides necessary flexibility to a rail network, allowing vehicles to change routes when necessary. Track switches, however, have historically been prone to failure. To increase asset reliability, a concept for a novel design of switch has been developed which allows multi-channel actuation through a novel actuation and locking mechanism, under a project titled 'Repoint'. This paper describes a mathematical model of the operation a novel <b>Repoint</b> track switch. The model was derived from a first principles physical analysis of the <b>Repoint</b> concept design. The structure of the model mimics the physical structure of the design. Each physical component has an individual sub-model. The model {{has been used to}} estimate the actuator drive requirements for a case study mainline switch installation. It has been found that a <b>Repoint</b> track switch could be run from an existing UK signalling power supply. It is anticipated that this model will be used as the basis for a control system design activity for a technology demonstrator installation currently under construction...|$|R
