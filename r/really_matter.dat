5|$|Woodward’s own {{judgment}} {{of the war and}} of Bush doesn’t <b>really</b> <b>matter.</b> In the course of four books he has given readers the conversations and documents we need to reach our {{own judgment}}s. He has also, however unevenly and imperfectly, supplied enough synthesis and analysis to make that judgment genuinely informed. Sure, these books can be a slog. But they stand as the fullest story yet of the Bush presidency and of the war that is likely to be its most important legacy.|$|E
5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not <b>really</b> <b>matter</b> whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth, and {{first half of}} the twentieth century, doctors were taught that babies did not {{experience}} pain, and were treating their young patients accordingly.

25|$|He {{considered}} it {{the task of}} the artist to create beauty. How the artist did this did not <b>really</b> <b>matter.</b> But originality was no virtue; personality was. Great music, like Beethoven’s, is admired because the composer’s personality shines through; Beethoven’s daring originality is now only of historical interest. However, Ryelandt was highly critical of atonality, claiming that the modernists’ “empty game of sound combinations brings us no interior enrichment at all,” and that the value of works like Honegger’s “unforgettable” Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher lay chiefly in their tonal passages.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon was not slowed or blocked or {{interfered}} with on his march to Frankfurt, where {{he arrived in}} the afternoon of 31 October 1813. Militarily the battle was a clear victory for Napoleon. Wrede failed to block Napoleon's path, although the allied forces of Russians, Prussians and Austrians had cut Napoleon's line of retreat. However Napoleon evaded the maneuver. The Kingdom of Bavaria wanted with this battle to support militarily its shift to the allied side. It did not <b>really</b> <b>matter</b> to the Bavarian politicians and military whether the battle was won or lost—as long as it took place. Overall, 4,500 French soldiers and 9,000 allied soldiers {{were lost in the}} battle. However, the allies were able to capture around 10,000 French stragglers. On 5 November 1813 Alexander I marched with his troops into Frankfurt.|$|E

500|$|Trademarks and {{characteristics}} that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include polyrhythms, polymetered riff cycles, rhythmic syncopation, rapid key and tempo changes and neo-jazz chromatics. Hagström notes that [...] "it doesn't <b>really</b> <b>matter</b> {{if something is}} hard to play or not. The thing is, {{what does it do}} to your mind when you listen to it? Where does it take you?" [...] A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a [...] "breath controller" [...] device. Haake is known for his cross-rhythm drumming with [...] "jazzlike cadence". The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between hardcore-style shouts and [...] "robotic" [...] death metal vocals.|$|E

[...] Shikasta gave rise to a religious cult in America. Lessing {{said in an interview that}} its followers had written to her and asked, [...] "When are we going to be visited by the gods?", and she told them that the book is [...] "not a cosmology. It's an invention", and they replied, [...] "Ah, you're just testing us".|$|E

[...] Hi-5 toured Australia in early 2010, establishing a connection with more regional locations throughout the country.

500|$|Contrasting {{with the}} {{drawn-out}} melody over the verses, the choruses present a fast progression of chords – specifically, E major, B minor 7, G major, C7 and F7. In the first chorus, Harrison comments that, given {{the inadequacy of}} his publishing arrangement, [...] "It doesn't <b>really</b> <b>matter</b> what chords I play". Author Ian Inglis interprets this line as mirroring the singer's complaint to Beatles biographer Hunter Davies in the late 1960s, regarding the futility of the band's live performances when their screaming fans never listened to the music the Beatles were playing. Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] as the first example of its composer [...] "pushing back at the Beatles as an organization he found wanting", a theme Harrison returned to in 1968 with [...] "Not Guilty", with his comments on the group's internal discord.|$|E

And we define an unterplanet as one {{that has not been}} able to do so," [...] and then a few paragraphs later, [...] "our Solar System clearly contains 8 überplanets and a far larger number of unterplanets, the largest of which are Pluto and Ceres." [...] While this may appear to contradict Stern's objections, Stern noted in an interview with Smithsonian Air and Space that, unlike the IAU's definition, his definition still allows unterplanets to be planets: [...] "I do think from a dynamical standpoint, there are planets that <b>really</b> <b>matter</b> in the architecture of the solar system, and those that don't. They're both planets. Just as you can have wet and dry planets, or life-bearing and non-life-bearing planets, you can have dynamically important planets and dynamically unimportant planets." ...|$|E

500|$|Bell {{has been}} {{associated}} with the idea that [...] "nerdy is the new cool", and she explained, [...] "what was previously perceived as nerdy is now viewed as original. What I like about nerdiness, geekiness, is it doesn't <b>really</b> <b>matter</b> what you're into—it just means you're not a follower." [...] She has also said, [...] "I love nerds. Comic-Con junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow. Isn't that funny? The tables have turned." [...] Vanessa Juarez of Entertainment Weekly commented that Bell's roles on Veronica Mars, Heroes and as a Star Wars fanatic in Fanboys have [...] "solidif her placement {{at the center of the}} geek universe", while Rodney Rothman stated, [...] "I guess she's cornered the market on losers." [...] Bell's work is often compared to Sarah Michelle Gellar's portrayal of the title character on the cult television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter stated that Bell was [...] "arguably the television successor [...] when it comes to fighting bad guys." [...] Bell is sometimes confused with Lauren Conrad from the show The Hills. [...] "Yeah, sometimes fans yell, 'Hey, Lauren' to me, but usually from a distance," [...] said Kristen.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{presents}} Eli as an androgynous boy, castrated {{centuries before}} by a sadistic vampire nobleman. The film handles {{the issue of}} Eli's gender more ambiguously: a brief scene in which Eli changes into a dress offers {{a glimpse of a}} suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration. When Oskar asks Eli to become his girlfriend, Eli tries to tell Oskar [...] "I'm not a girl". An actress plays Eli's character, but her voice was considered to be too high pitched, so it was dubbed by voice actress Elif Ceylan. According to an interview with the director, as the film was originally conceived, flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail, but these scenes were eventually cut. In the end, Ajvide Lindqvist was satisfied with the adaptation. When Alfredson showed him eight minutes of footage for the first time, he [...] "started to cry because it was so damn beautiful". He subsequently described the film as a [...] "masterpiece". [...] "It doesn't <b>really</b> <b>matter</b> that [...] didn't want to do it the way I wanted it in every respect. He could obviously never do that. The film is his creative process", he said.|$|E

There was no intent to cancel, and the show went ahead as planned. Though Bono had few difficulties through the opening quartet of [...] "Mofo", [...] "I Will Follow", [...] "Gone", and [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", his voice gave out during [...] "Last Night on Earth". In 2006, The Edge suggested that Bono's vocal troubles had been caused by laryngitis or by the stress of the previous few months of touring, though he later remarked that [...] "it didn't <b>really</b> <b>matter</b> that our lead singer was under the weather because every member of the audience seemed to join in on every song.
