40|$|In {{recent years}} {{concerns}} about the degree of competition {{in the provision of}} telecommunications call termination services have emerged. While the general consensus is that call origination {{is becoming more and more}} competitive, regulatory attention to call termination has widened in scope beyond the incumbent public telephone operators, leading to direct regulation of mobile termination charges in some countries and a debate on whether regulation should also be extended to "non-dominant" networks. This paper assesses whether these concerns are justified, extending the analysis to review the economic literature on <b>reciprocal</b> <b>setting</b> of termination charges between network operators. We conclude that while ex ante regulation of call termination simplifies the work of regulators it does not appear justifiable in all circumstances.

40|$|If A {{is a set}} {{of natural}} numbers {{containing}} 0, then there is a unique nonempty “reciprocal ” set B of natural numbers (containing 0) such that every positive integer can be written in the form a+b, where a ∈ A and b ∈ B, in an even number of ways. Furthermore, the generating functions for A and B over F 2 are reciprocals in F 2 [[q]]. We consider the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>set</b> B for the set A containing 0 and all integers such that σ(n) is odd, where σ(n) is the sum of all the positive divisors of n. This problem is motivated by Euler’s pentagonal number theorem, a corollary of which is that the set of natural numbers n so that the number p(n) of partitions of an integer n is odd is the <b>reciprocal</b> of the <b>set</b> of generalized pentagonal numbers (integers of the form k(3 k ± 1) / 2, where k is a natural number). An old (1967) conjecture of Parkin and Shanks is that the density of integers n so that p(n) is odd (equivalently, even) is 1 2. Euler also found that σ(n) satisfies an almost identical recurrence as that given by the pentagonal number theorem, so we hope to shed light on the Parkin-Shanks conjecture by computing the density of the <b>reciprocal</b> of the <b>set</b> containing the natural numbers 1 with σ(n) odd (σ(0) = 1 by convention). We conjecture this particular density is 1 32 and prove that it lies between 0 and 1 16. We finish with a few surprising connections between certain Beatty sequences and the sequence of integers n for which σ(n) is odd. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{advanced}} {{in this essay}} is that stem cells-particularly those in the nervous system-are components {{in a series of}} inborn 'programs' that not only ensure normal development, but persist throughout life so as to maintain homeostasis in the face of perturbations-both small and great. These programs encode {{what has come to be}} called 'plasticity'. The stem cell is one of the repositories of this plasticity. This review examines the evidence that interaction between the neural stem cell (as a prototypical somatic stem cell) and the developing or injured brain is a dynamic, complex, ongoing <b>reciprocal</b> <b>set</b> of interactions where both entities are constantly in flux. We suggest that this interaction can be viewed almost from a 'systems biology' vantage point. We further advance the notion that clones of exogenous stem cells in transplantation paradigms may not only be viewed for their therapeutic potential, but also as biological tools for 'interrogating' the normal or abnormal central nervous system environment, indicating what salient cues (among the many present) are actually guiding the expression of these 'programs'; in other words, using the stem cell as a 'reporter cell'. Based on this type of analysis, we suggest some of the relevant molecular pathways responsible for this 'cross-talk' which, in turn, lead to proliferation, migration, cell genesis, trophic support, protection, guidance, detoxification, rescue, etc. This type of developmental insight, we propose, is required for the development of therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disease and other nervous system afflictions in humans. Understanding the relevant molecular pathways of stem cell repair phenotype should be a priority, in our view, for the entire stem cell field...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{research}} {{continues to}} {{play a significant role}} in meeting the multiple innovation challenges in agriculture. If this role is to be fulfilled, provision needs to be made for effective translation of research outputs, where translation is understood to be the process whereby science becomes part of useful knowledge for decision making. There is increasing interest in enhancing translation in the European agricultural innovation, research and policy context, and specifically in making it a more collaborative process. This new attention calls for a reorientation of how the concept is understood, theorised and operationalised. This paper considers these needs and specifically asks how can interactive innovation approaches be integrated with science-driven approaches to enhance translation; and how can this help to reveal the constituent translation processes? An interactive stakeholder methodology is described drawing on three agricultural case studies examined in the xx project which aims to make translation of existing bodies of scientific knowledge more effective. Analysis to date shows how this interactive methodology enables a communicative and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>set</b> of translation processes to evolve which comprise: identification, prioritisation, articulation, searching, retrieval, extraction and synthesis, and evaluation of innovation issues and solutions. These insights allow us to move beyond an understanding of translation as science- or innovation-driven to envisaging co-translation, where multiple processes interact in a fluid middle-ground, and where the actors involved develop the capacity to jointly analyse innovation issues and solutions. From the perspective of the EU's policy ambitions to stimulate collaborative translation, operationalising translation needs re-thinking with respect to requirements for new mind-sets and skills, and in particular for committed and well-resourced intermediaries who can foster these multi-actors approaches...|$|R
40|$|Italian art {{has long}} been {{identified}} with its nation, {{in spite of the}} complex history of Italian migration and exile, which many of its prominent artists have also experienced. This may be because Italian art has enjoyed a privileged position as a leading and somewhat self-contained centre of art and culture for many centuries. Yet, in the present globalising world, it is becoming increasingly difficult for any nation to maintain cultural identity, Italy included. This paper is both a recognition and an exploration of a significant connection between Italian art and a non-European culture. It focuses on the work of a young Italian artist, Simone Legno, who works through his US-based label Tokidoki, with Japan as his artistic inspiration. We avoid considering Legno’s work as a unilateral projection of Western fantasies of the Orient, focusing instead on a complex and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>set</b> of cultural and economic influences between Japan, Italy and the USA. Japanese anime and manga are relevant to Legno's work not only for their impact on his design, but also for the emotional attachment that references to Japan can produce in consumers in Italy and other countries, consumers who grew up with Japanese anime and manga. We also challenge the centre-periphery conception of Europe-Asia relations, particularly when commenting on the recent phenomena of globalisation. Legno’s mixture of Italianess and exotic Orientalism has built bridges in the global market between Western companies and Asian consumers, as well as between Asian companies and Western consumers. We conclude that Tokidoki’s success lies in its hybridisation in a global context: the creation of new cultures of feminity by an Italian designer arising out of Japanese artistic forms of production and distribution within an economy dominated by US and multinational enterprises...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of conductive sulphide {{in an otherwise}} highly-resistive host rock is the ideal situation for exploring using high-frequency electromagnetic methods. The FARA radio imaging (RIM) system was deployed to explore the rock properties between two boreholes MAC 104 and MAC 100 G, which are about 182 m apart, on the Nickel Rim South property (MacLennan Township) 22 km northeast of Sudbury. Tomographic data were collected and processed at 625 kHz and 1250 kHz. One data set has the transmitter in MAC 100 G and the receiver in MAC 104; the other “reciprocal” data set has the transmitter in MAC 104 and the receiver in MAC 100 G. The amplitude data were reduced, edited, and processed to generate tomograms employing the SIRT algorithm. Separate tomograms were created for the <b>reciprocal</b> data <b>sets</b> in the ImageWin software. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence that perturbations in the ImageWin processing parameters have on the resulting tomograms. The sensitivity study of the tomograms along with the information obtained from the value of fit analysis {{can be used to}} select appropriate processing parameters. Finally, the two <b>reciprocal</b> <b>sets</b> of conductivity values were averaged and imported into Geosoft to create a final tomogram for the panel. The resistivity values of the studied zone obtained from the FARA modeling package agree fairly well with the conductivity data set generated by the ImageWin modeling package when compared using the Geosoft and GOCAD visualization software. Differences between the two tomograms are attributed to the different solver methods employed by FARA and ImageWin and the statistical analysis used for averaging the attenuation value over ray paths. Furthermore, it is shown that the tomographic results are consistent with the location of conductive zones that were identified using down-hole geophysical logging. The main focus of the project is to understand how the radio imaging (RIM) data is processed with the ImageWin software to construct an attenuation tomogram. This research showed that both tomograms created by ImageWin and FARA illustrate the same pattern with two conductive zones at the same depth; however, the values of conductivity are slightly different. The FARA resistivity values obtained for the upper zone is a factor of two lower than the resistivity calculated by ImageWin. The resistivity values obtained for the lower zone using the FARA processing is a factor of eight lower than the resistivity calculated by ImageWin. Also, there is a slight discrepancy in the orientation of the upper and lower zones on the two tomographic images generated using the two processing packages. In the tomograms generated by FARA software both upper and lower zones are continuous linear zones from one hole to the other with dips from MAC 104 towards MAC 100 G, whereas in the tomograms created by ImageWin the upper and lower zones are less linear and do not have obvious dips.

40|$|Optic ataxia is {{characterized}} by an impaired visual control of the direction of arm reaching to a visual target, accompanied by defective hand orientation and grip formation. In humans, optic ataxia is associated with lesions of the superior parietal lobule (SPL), which also affect visually guided saccades {{and other forms of}} eye-hand coordination. In the last 10 years, anatomical and physiological studies of the SPL have shed new light on the role of parietal cortex in the control of combined eye-hand movements to visual targets, and on the underlying distributed network which links parietal to frontal cortex. A main emerging functional feature of SPL neurones seems to be their capacity to combine, in a spatially congruent fashion, different directional eye- and hand-related information, that any coding scheme so far proposed, considers essential for the composition of motor commands for reaching. This integration occurs within the global tuning field of parietal neurones, is context-dependent and involves eye and hand information that shares the same directional properties. Depending on task demands, this integration of signals can result in the representation of different reference frames for coordinated eye-hand movements. The dynamic operations occurring within the global tuning fields might depend, at least in part, on the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>sets</b> of association connections linking the SPL and the premotor areas of the frontal lobe. From this picture, the SPL emerges as both a main source of visual input to the frontal cortex and a key structure for visuomotor integration based on re-entrant signalling and, therefore, as a crucial node in the visual control of movement. It is hypothesized that in parietal patients, the directional errors that characterize reaching are a consequence of the breakdown of the combination of directional eye and hand information within the global tuning fields of parietal neurones. In these patients, the spatial match among information about target location, eye and hand position, and movement direction would be prevented, so as to impair the composition of visually guided eye-hand movements. This breakdown could be dependent, at least in part, on the failure of a re-entrant frontoparietal signalling, an obvious consequence of the degeneration of the cortico-cortical systems linking parietal and frontal cortex. Cortico-cortical connections are, in fact, essential for shaping the dynamic properties of cortical neurones...|$|R
40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungus Aspergillus nidulans has two genes encoding alpha-tubulin, tubA and tubB, which are differentially required at distinct stages {{during the life}} cycle. The tubA gene is required during vegetative growth for mitosis and nuclear migration (B. R. Oakley, C. E. Oakley, and J. E. Rinehart, Mol. Gen. Genet. 208 : 135 - 144, 1987; P. Doshi, C. A. Bossie, J. H. Doonan, G. S. May, and N. R. Morris, Mol. Gen. Genet. 225 : 129 - 141, 1991). The tubB gene is not required for any detectable aspect of vegetative growth or asexual reproduction but is essential during sexual development prior to the first meiotic division (K. E. Kirk and N. R. Morris, Genes Dev. 5 : 2014 - 2023, 1991). In this study, we determined whether the role of each alpha-tubulin gene {{is to provide a}} specific isotype necessary for a particular microtubule function or whether either alpha-tubulin isotype, if present in sufficient quantities, can participate effectively in all types of microtubule. Strains carrying a deletion allele of tubB (tubB delta) produce no ascospores from a cross. When one copy of a plasmid containing the region upstream of the tubB gene fused to the tubA coding region was integrated into a tubB delta strain, ascosporogenesis proceeded beyond the tubB delta block and resulted in the formation of sexual spores. However, irregular numbers of spores formed in some asci during development, and the ascospores had greatly diminished viability and aberrant morphologies. These defects were nearly corrected when two additional copies of the tubA coding region were integrated into the tubB delta strain. These results indicate that the tubA alpha-tubulin isotype can form functional microtubules during sexual development in the absence of tubB protein. In a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>set</b> of experiments, we examined whether upregulation of tubB can complement the tubA 4 mutation, which causes supersensitivity to benomyl during vegetative growth. When tubA 4 strains integrated a plasmid containing an alcohol-inducible promoter joined to the tubB coding region and subsequently overexpressed the tubB isotype, the benomyl supersensitivity normally caused by the tubA 4 allele was relieved. These results indicate that when enough tubB alpha-tubulin is supplied, strains lacking functional tubA isotype can still form microtubules which effectively carry out mitosis and nuclear migration.

40|$|It {{has become}} {{accepted}} orthodoxy in Literature and Science studies that {{relations between the}} two domains are a “two way street,” and that literature and culture do not meekly reflect the new findings of their dominant partner, science, but are actively engaged in a dynamic, <b>reciprocal</b> <b>set</b> of relations with scientific practice and the development of scientific ideas. It is an attractive position (and one to which I have always subscribed), but such reciprocity is decidedly easier to track in historical context, before the consolidation of structures of institutional and professional science, than in the current period. The call for the AHRC “Science in Culture” large grants scheme was thus challenging: applicants were asked not merely to analyse reciprocal relations between science and culture, but to work directly with scientists, and to develop new insights and new methodologies for both sides. A tall order! Over the years I have participated in numerous workshops and conferences with scientists, trying to discover common ground, but never engaged directly in collaborative research. Originally Gowan Dawson and I had been envisaging a strictly historical project, addressing all those thousands of scientific and medical journals which lie mouldering in library basements (and are still largely untouched by digitisation). As historians we are familiar with the “big names”, those journals like the Lancet, the BMJ or Nature which have survived into the present day, and whose dominance in the historical record is now reaffirmed by the digitisation of back numbers, making it easier for scholars to work with them. But what about all those local natural history journals, or medical or public health journals which have faded from historical memory? Our aim, in working with these journals, was to uncover the networks which operated within Victorian science and medicine, and to rewrite in the process the metropolitan and professional focus of much historiography. Yet, such work would not involve any interaction with contemporary science. I had become aware, however, of the emerging phenomenon of “citizen science,” particularly as supported by Zooniverse, the online citizen science platform run by Chris Lintott in the Dept of Astro-Physics at the University of Oxford. It was clear that there were interesting parallels between, for example, the armies of people who participated in the development of natural history in the nineteenth century, and the “citizens” who now go online to help analyse scientific data, whether of astronomical phenomena, cancer cells, or the behaviour of wildlife. In the resulting AHRC project, “Constructing Scientific Communities: Citizen Science in the 19 th and 21 st Centuries,” based at the Universities of Oxford and Leicester, and run in conjunction with our partners the Natural History Museum, London, the Royal Society, and the Royal College of Surgeons, England, we uncover forgotten histories of large-scale participation in science, and the role of journals in helping to create and consolidate these communities. We also bring such historical knowledge to bear on current practice, exploring ways in which earlier models of scientific communication and community building can help to inform the rapidly changing world of science in the digital age. In addition, the project has also created its own citizen science projects: Science Gossip and Orchid Observers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} a minimal {{neural network model}} of the {{cerebellum}} may be embedded within a sensory-neuro-muscular control system that mimics known anatomy and physiology. With this embedding, cerebellar learning promotes load compensation while also allowing both coactivation and <b>reciprocal</b> inhibition of <b>sets</b> of antagonist muscles. In particular, we show how synaptic long term depression guided by feedback from muscle stretch receptors can lead to trans-cerebellar gain changes that are load-compensating. It is argued that the same processes help to adaptively discover multi-joint synergies. Simulations of rapid single joint rotations under load illustrates design feasibility and stability.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fundamental concepts {{of a social}} reasoning mechanism, designed {{to be part of}} an agent's internal model, in a multi-agent systems (MAS) context. It enables an agent to reason about the others using information about their goals, actions, resources and plans. Every agent stores this information in a data structure called external description. We have formally defined and implemented the concepts of external description, dependence relation, and dependence network. One of the main contributions of this work is that an agent can infer his dependence on others using either his own plans or those of the others. As a result, we have defined a preliminary taxonomy of dependence situations regarding the goal being analysed (unilateral, mutual or <b>reciprocal)</b> and the <b>sets</b> of plans used in this reasoning mechanism (mutually or locally believed). We have used this model to build a dependence network simulator, called DEPNET, which is also briefly described in this paper [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{functioning}} of the mammalian brain depends upon the precision and accuracy of its neural connections, and nowhere is this requirement {{more evident than in}} the neocortex of the cerebral hemispheres. The neocortex is a structure that is divided both radially, from the pial surface to the white matter into six cell layers, and tangentially into more than 40 different cytoarchitectural areas (Brodmann 1909). For instance, within the cerebral hemispheres, sets of tangential axonal connections link neurons within a given cortical layer to each other and also link neurons of different cortical areas; sets of radial connections link neurons of different layers together. In addition, the major input to the neocortex arises from neurons in the thalamus, which in tum receive a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>set</b> of connections from the cortex. These connections are highly restricted: In the radial domain, thalamic axons make their major projection to the neurons of cortical layer 4, and the neurons of cortical layer 6 project back to the thalamus. Connections are also restricted tangentially, in that neurons located in specific subdivisions of the thalamus send their axons to specific cortical areas. For instance, neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus connect with primary visual cortex, whereas those situated in the ventrobasal complex connect with somatosensory cortex. There are also local patterns of connections within a given cortical area, for example, the ocular dominance columns in primary visual cortex of higher mammals, or the barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex (Woolsey & van der Loos 1970). The ocular dominance columns are {{based on the fact that}} the inputs of LGN axons representing the two eyes are segregated from each other in layer 4 and their terminal arbors are clustered together in patches (LeVay et al 1980). A primary question is how these sets of connections form during development. The purpose of this review is to consider this question as it pertains specifically to the formation of connections between thalamus and cortex [for a more general review of the formation of connectivity, see Goodman & Shatz (1993) ]. Several major steps are involved in this developmental process. First, the constituent neurons of the thalamus and cortex must be generated. Next, axons must grow along the appropriate pathways and select the appropriate targets. In the visual system, this means that LGN axons must grow up through the internal capsule, bypass many other inappropriate cortical areas, and then select visual cortex. Finally, the axons must enter the cortical plate, recognize and terminate within layer 4, and segregate to form ocular dominance columns. Thus, in addition to the general problems of pathfinding and target selection faced by all developing neurons, thalamic neurons are faced with a series of tangential and radial decisions as they form the final pattern of connections within neocortex: they must choose the correct cortical area and the correct layer, and must restrict the extent of their terminal arbors. In addition, similar problems must be solved by the neurons of cortical layer 6 as they grow towards and invade their thalamic targets. A growing body of evidence suggests that the formation of connections between thalamus and cortex requires the presence of a specific and transient cell type, subplate neurons. These neurons are present early in development, but by adulthood the majority have disappeared. Here we consider their life history and review the evidence for their role in the patterning of connections...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Double {{fertilization}} in {{flowering plants}} {{occurs when the}} two sperm cells, carried by the pollen tube, are re-leased in a synergid cell of the embryo sac and then fertilize the egg and the central cell. Proteins on the surfaces of the sperm, egg, central, and synergid cells might be important for guidance and recognition/fusion of the gametes. Here, we present functional analyses of Arabidopsis GEX 3, which encodes a plasmamembrane-localized protein that has homologs in other plants. GEX 3 is expressed in both the vegetative and sperm cells of themale gametophyte and in the egg cell of the female gametophyte. Transgenic lines in which GEX 3 was down-regulated or overexpressed, using the Arabidopsis GEX 2 promoter, had reduced seed <b>set.</b> <b>Reciprocal</b> crosses and imaging after pollination with a reporter line showed that, in both cases, the defect causing reduced seed set occurred in the female. In the antisense lines, micropylar pollen tube guidance failed. In the overexpression lines, fertilization of mutant ovules was mostly blocked because pollen tube guidance failed, although, occasionally, non-viable embryos were formed. We conclude that properly regulated expression of GEX 3 in the egg cell of Arabidopsis is essential for pollen tube guidance...|$|R

A {{variety of colors}} and an extended flowering period are demanded by local and overseas markets. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop procedures for a Boronia heterophylla breeding program through intraspesific hybridization. This may yield progeny with desirable characteristics, ideally increased vigor, and a range of flower colors and flowering times. Nine pollination combinations were attempted, each self pollination and all <b>reciprocal</b> crosses. Seed <b>set</b> varied from 17 to 95 %. Embryo rescue (was employed to produce hybrid plants using half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal media and it was most successful (75 %) 5 - 6 weeks after pollination. All shoots multiplied on media containing MS salts + NAA (0. 1 mg/l) + BA (0. 4 mg/l). All shoots transferred to medium containing half strength MS salts + NAA (4 mg/l) produced roots. Plantlets were acclimatized to sterile potting mix (in a small chamber within a glass house. This intraspecific hybridization system was very successful and plants were obtained for all pollination treatments except for selfed ‘Moonglow'. Embryo rescue may provide a system for germinating other species with difficult to germinate or dormant seed...|$|R
40|$|Based {{upon the}} tight-binding {{formalism}} {{a model of}} a high-T c superconductor with isotropic and anisotropic attractive interactions is considered analytically. Symmetry facets of the group C 4 v are included within a method of successive transformations of the <b>reciprocal</b> space. Complete <b>sets</b> of basis functions of C 4 v irreducible representations are given. Plausible spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconducting states are classified with regard to the chosen basis functions. It is displayed that pairing interaction coefficients and the dispersion relation, which can be characterized by the parameter η= 2 t 1 /t 0, have a diverse and mutually competing influence on the value of the transition temperature. It is also shown {{that in the case of}} a nearly half-filled conduction band and an anisotropic pairing interaction the spin-singlet d-wave symmetry superconducting state is realized for small values of the parameter η, whereas in the opposite limit, for sufficiently large values, the spin-triplet p-wave symmetry superconducting state has to be formed. This result cannot be obtained within the Van Hove scenario or BCS-type approaches, where the p-wave symmetry superconducting state absolutely dominates. The specific heat jump and the isotope shift as functions of the parameter η are assessed and discussed for the d-wave symmetry singlet and the p-wave symmetry triplet states.

40|$|Most of the {{economically}} important traits in animal breeding programs are quantitative in nature. Detecting major genes and/or blocks of genes influencing these traits {{has been made}} possible by the availability of hypervariable DNA markers. In this study, phenotypic variations related to growth and body girth in the two domesticated strains of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus L.) at Icy Waters Ltd. (Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada) were examined and then quantitative trait loci for growth were identified using a genome wide scan approach. Twelve crosses involving the pure strains (Tree River and Yukon GoldTM), the reciprocal hybrids, and the <b>reciprocal</b> backcrosses were <b>set</b> up with ten families per cross. After 18 months of rearing in the hatchery environment under identical culture conditions, it was observed that backcrosses with a 75 % Tree River genome contribution ((YGfxTRm) fxTRm) grew fastest and possessed greatest variance. A total of 198 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, from various salmonid species, covering 41 linkage groups on the current Arctic charr linkage map were tested for a genome scan. Sixty two highly polymorphic markers were chosen to perform a genome wide scan on a hll-sib backcross family, namely 6 - 1 0, to detect genetic factors responsible for the variation of growth in Arctic charr. These markers cover 28 of the 46 linkage groups in the currently available, low-resolution genetic map of Arctic charr.
