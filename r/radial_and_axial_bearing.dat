40|$|Typically, fully active magnetically {{suspended}} systems require one <b>axial</b> <b>and</b> two <b>radial</b> magnetic <b>bearings.</b> Combining <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> functions into {{a single}} device allows for more compact and elegant packaging. Furthermore, {{in the case of}} high-speed devices such as energy storage flywheels, it is beneficial to minimize shaft length to keep rotor mode frequencies as high as possible. Attempts have been made to combine <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> functionality, but with certain drawbacks. One approach requires magnetic control flux to flow through a bias magnet reducing control effectiveness, thus resulting in increased resistive losses. This approach also requires axial force producing magnetic flux to flow in a direction into the rotor laminate that is undesirable for minimizing eddy-current losses resulting in rotational losses. Another approach applies a conical rotor shape to what otherwise would be a radial heteropolar magnetic bearing configuration. However, positional non-linear effects are introduced with this scheme and the same windings are used for bias, <b>radial,</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> control adding complexity to the controller and electronics. For this approach, the amount of axial capability must be limited. It would be desirable for an integrated <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> magnetic <b>bearing</b> to have the following characteristics, separate inputs for <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> control for electronics and control simplicity, all magnetic control fluxes should only flow through their respective air gaps and should not flow through any bias magnets for minimal resistive losses, be of a homopolar design to minimize rotational losses, position related non-linear effects should be minimized, and dependent upon the design parameters, be able to achieve any radial/axial force or power ratio as desired.

Plant design and pump selection are usually based on steady state design conditions. However, the opening or closing of valves, or the starting or tripping of pumps, in the system can generate high unsteady pressures that can damage piping and components in the system along with the pumping machinery itself. These unsteady pressures can result in large forces that are reacted at the pump nozzles. These loads can lead to casing failures or extrusion of the flange gasket.

The concept of a Halbach magnetically levitated electric aircraft motor will help reduce harmful emissions, reduce the Nation s dependence on fossil fuels, increase efficiency and reliability, reduce maintenance and decrease operating noise levels. Experimental hardware systems were developed in the GRC Engineering Development Division to validate the basic principles described herein and the theoretical work that was performed. A number of Halbach Magnetic rotors have been developed and tested under this program. A separate test hardware setup was developed to characterize each of the rotors. A second hardware setup was developed to test the levitation characteristics of the rotors. Each system focused around a unique Halbach array rotor.

40|$|The {{object of}} this project {{is to develop a}} new {{methodology}} to improve bearing condition monitoring and diagnosis, based on embedded sensing approach. The presented study involves work in four areas. ^ First is investigation of the embedded sensing approach. Studies of the bearing structure dynamics and defect-related vibrations reveal the important characteristics of defect signals. The sensor placement strategy of embedded sensing is verified through theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiment test. The embedded sensing enables the acquisition of bearing signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is critical to the reliable defect detection. ^ Second is the feasibility investigation of the embedded sensing approach through a wireless sensing module design. The miniaturized sensing module, configured as an accelerometer or dynamic load sensor, have an on-board signal conditioner and a wireless transmitter. It has been designed, prototyped, bench-scale tested, and structurally integrated into a customized bearing test bed for on-line bearing monitoring. A combination of surface mount (SMT) and thick-film hybrid technologies has been used {{to reduce the size of}} the sensing module. ^ Third is the defect signal extraction for the embedded sensing approach. A new signal processing technique has been developed in order to improve the effectiveness of the defect feature extraction. It combines the wavelet analysis on the time-scale domain and the analysis on the frequency domain. Experimental studies have shown that it is more effective in detecting the existence of a small bearing defect of 0. 25 mm in diameter, as compared to the frequency-domain analysis or the wavelet analysis alone. ^ Fourth is the defect evaluation. To enable automated bearing defect evaluation, a bearing health index is introduced from the quantization of defect severity. Under different bearing operation conditions (e. g. speed, <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> loads), <b>bearing</b> defects are evaluated through a backpropagation neural network.

40|$|The {{number of}} high speed {{applications}} is sharply increasing {{in the last}} years so that the problem of the choice of the most suitable bearing must be handled. Considering the rotating machines, during the past ten years, high speed turbomolecular pumps have been mass produced showing that the high speed technology is mature. Since friction, wear, maintenance and lifetime represent the main issues of high speed applications, magnetic bearings, which are a contact free devices, could be considered as a possible solution. A magnetic bearing is a contact free bearing wherein the load is carried by magnetic forces. The magnetic field is generated {{in such a way that}} it provides necessary stiffness and damping to make the rotor hover safely during operation. Magnetic bearings are characterized by no wear, no maintenance and furthermore they don't require lubrication. The present work deals with a particular category of magnetic bearing: the electrodynamic bearings. The most interesting aspect of electrodynamic bearings is that levitation can be obtained by passive means, thus no electronic equipment, such as power electronics or sensors, are necessary. Therefore, electrodynamic suspensions are an advantageous alternative to active magnetic suspensions: they are less complex, less subject to failure, and possibly far lower in cost. On the other hand, the main drawback of electrodynamic bearings is that a stable levitation is provided only when the speed is above a threshold value, which opens stability issue at low speeds. Presently, the design of electrodynamic bearings is based on the force-to-angular speed characteristic obtained for a fixed eccentricity. Although this characteristic describes the behaviour of the bearing in quasi-static conditions, it is not suitable for dynamic conditions where the rotor is animated by a nonsynchronous whirl, or even a non periodic motion about the stator axis. A model that could take explicitly into account both the quasi-static and the dynamic conditions is still lacking. Therefore the first objective of the present work is to develop an analytical model of <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> electrodynamic <b>bearings</b> able to describe both quasi-static and dynamic behaviours. In this way not only the static characteristics such as achievable stiffness and force, but also the dynamic performance of a system involving electrodynamic bearings can be evaluated and used as design criteria. The developed models of <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> electrodynamic <b>bearings</b> have been experimentally validated. Two test rigs, the first based on a radial electrodynamic bearings, the second characterized by the presence of an <b>axial</b> electrodynamic <b>bearing,</b> have been designed and built to this end. Since the electrodynamic bearings are intrinsically unstable devices, the stability issue is examined in the dissertation. So far, the most common solution to achieve the stability is to add non-rotating damping between the rotor and the stator. It is natural to obtain the stability by adding non-rotating damping between the rotor and the stator. Nevertheless, this strategy is not as easy to apply as it seems, given that the stabilizing device must be contactless, consistently with the electrodynamic bearings issue. Although effective, this solution could imply the installation of a dedicated magnet on the rotor with a consequent increase of the rotor weight and complexity and the rising of some concerns about the mechanical resistance, and a conductor where eddy currents can arise on the statoric part of the system. In the dissertation a new stabilizing technique for electrodynamic bearings is proposed. Instead of introducing damping between the rotor and the non-rotating part of the bearing, the author propose to introduce an elastic and dissipative element between the statoric part of the bearing and the case of the machine. The innovative aspect of the proposed solution is that the stabilizing dissipation is introduced into the statoric part of the electrodynamic bearing, which does not rotate. The main advantages of this configuration are: reduced complexity from the constructive point of view since no rotating parts are involved; an easier tuning of the stabilizing system main parameters; an extremely effective contribution to the stability; conventional and low cost devices are suitable for the implementation of the proposed stabilizing system. The wide variety of practical solutions that can be adopted for the proposed stabilization techniques, such as rubber bushings or squeeze film dampers for example, is an indicative parameter of the true possibility of applying it in industrial applications. The impact of the proposed solution on the rotor stability is investigated, and it is demonstrated that a damping device between the rotor and the statoric part is no longer necessary. Although electrodynamic bearings are quite complex devices, they are still lacking a clear design procedure, therefore a procedure addressed to optimize the design of electrodynamic bearings for industrial applications could be useful. Since the developed models, able to describe the quasi-static and dynamic behaviours of electrodynamic bearings, have been experimentally validated, they can be assumed as useful tools oriented to the design of these devices. Therefore, at the end of the dissertation, a design procedure based on those models is presented. The developed models and the proposed stabilizing technique make the electrodynamic bearings ready for the industrial application...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} based {{on one of my}} own ideas and {{describes}} the development of a propulsion system for a conceptual motorcycle. The main idea is to mount the drivetrain within a hubless wheel and thus fully integrate these two together. The project began with a comprehensive collection of information. This collection mainly focused on an investigation of the traditional automotive drivetrain, tracing different transmission input elements and an investigation of their relative functions. Two visits to the Air Force Museum in Linköping were performed, where the primarily aim was to study different radial engine's physical dimensions. The work with the hubless wheel and the work with the drivetrain were separated in order to facilitate the development of the whole work. Therefore two main problem determinations and one divided specification of conditions were established {{as the basis for the}} construction sub-functions. After the reduction of different design solutions concerning the sub-functions, which mainly were carried out through logical reasoning and discussions, two rather similar proposals of solutions remained as a base for further development of the project. The final drivetrain was based on an Australian radial engine from Rotec Engineering, Rotec R 3600, which was combined with a hybrid module from the German manufacturer ZF Sachs. This combination reduces the need for a torque converter in the driveline. During start-up the driveline will instead use the the electrical motors high torque at low speeds, which reaches about 770 Nm in this case, and then switch to the combustion engine at higher speeds. The included hybrid technology reduces fuel consumption by almost 15 % and also provides the ability to convert braking energy into electrical energy to recharge the batteries. The hybrid technology also offers the ability to connect the electric motor to the drivetrain as an extra "boost" when there is a need for faster acceleration at higher speeds. The work with the hubless wheel resulted in the development of nine separate shafts mounted on the outside of the fixed inner rim. Four <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> two <b>axial</b> <b>bearings</b> were mounted to each shaft. This makes it possible for the outer rim, the tire and the disc brake to rotate freely outside the inner rim. The bearings were selected and dimensioned through a self-developed model concerning possible loads and stresses. Finally the drivetrain was concentric and vibration damped mounted inside the hubless wheels inner rim via a self-developed engine suspension. The impulsion is transferred from the drivetrain to the outer-rim by the spoke system. This system was also designed to reduce vibrations from spreading from the engine to the rest of the construction. The final construction was integrated and visualized as a conceptual motorcycle by Erik Evers, a former student at Luleå University of Technology. The following further development of the project is proposed: Complete the rear wheel mounting to the motorcycle. Determine the final axial center of gravity of the driveline when mounted in the rear wheel. Further develop the engine mount to encompass eight attachment points distributed over two different planes in the inner rim. Develop of one or more drive shafts interconnecting the driveline components. Examine the possibility of transition to fuel injection and digital ignition for better engine operation. Complete the seal between the two rims in the hubless wheel for increased resistance to dirt and moisture. Validerat; 20121028 (anonymous...|$|R

Radial Halbach magnetic bearings are based on the same principle as that of <b>axial</b> Halbach magnetic <b>bearings,</b> differing in geometry as the names of these two types of <b>bearings</b> suggest. Both <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> Halbach magnetic <b>bearings</b> are passive in the sense that unlike most other magnetic bearings that have been developed in recent years, they effect stable magnetic levitation without need for complex active control. <b>Axial</b> Halbach magnetic <b>bearings</b> were described in <b>Axial</b> Halbach Magnetic <b>Bearings</b> (LEW- 18066 - 1), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 7 (July 2008), page 85. In the remainder of this article, the description of the principle of operation from the cited prior article is recapitulated and updated to incorporate the present radial geometry. In simplest terms, the basic principle of levitation in an axial or radial Halbach magnetic bearing is that of the repulsive electromagnetic force between (1) a moving permanent magnet and (2) an electric current induced in a stationary electrical conductor by the motion of the magnetic field. An axial or radial Halbach bearing includes multiple permanent magnets arranged in a Halbach array ("Halbach array" is defined below) in a rotor and multiple conductors in the form of wire coils in a stator, all arranged so the rotary motion produces an axial or radial repulsion that is sufficient to levitate the rotor. A basic Halbach array (see Figure 1) consists of a row of permanent magnets, each oriented so that its magnetic field is at a right angle to that of the adjacent magnet, and the right-angle turns are sequenced so as to maximize the magnitude of the magnetic flux density on one side of the row while minimizing it on the opposite side. The advantage of this configuration is that it makes it possible to approach the theoretical maximum force per unit area that could be exerted by a given amount of permanent-magnet material. The configuration is named after physicist Klaus Halbach, who conceived it for use in particle accelerators. Halbach arrays have also been studied for use in magnetic-levitation ("maglev") railroad trains. In a radial Halbach magnetic bearing, the basic Halbach arrangement is modified into a symmetrical arrangement of sector-shaped permanent magnets mounted on the outer cylindrical surface of a drum rotor (see Figure 2). The magnets are oriented to concentrate the magnetic field on their radially outermost surface. The stator coils are mounted in a stator shell surrounding the rotor...|$|R

The direct imaging {{capacity of a}} triple-grating spectrometer equipped with an iCCD camera allows investigating <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> profiles. The obtained radial ne(r) values match a Bessel function, even if the plasma column is strongly contracted. The axial profile is linear, depending on the pressure. However, {{the end of the}} plasma column shows a discontinuity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} the influence of <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> clearance in the revolute joints on the overall performance of a circuit breaker. A circuit breaker mechanism is made of seven links, seven revolute joints with clearance in both <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> direction, four unilateral contacts with friction, and it has forty-two degrees of freedom. The Moreau-Jean nonsmooth contact dynamics (NSCD) numerical method is used to perform the simulations. The numerical results are validated by careful comparisons with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The sound {{distribution}} {{for a single}} wafer megasonic cleaner was characterized by wafer cleaning tests, visual observations, sound measurements and modeling results. The cleaner consists of a horizontal wafer spinner and a megasonic transducer/transmitter assembly. Sound is transmitted from the transducer assembly to a horizontal quartz rod through a liquid meniscus to the wafer. The sound can travel in both <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> directions from the quartz rod. By varying parameters of the transducer and transmission components, the degree of <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> sound transmission from quartz rod can be controlled...|$|R
40|$|Single-blade {{centrifugal}} impellers {{for sewage}} systems undergo both unsteady <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> thrusts. Therefore, {{it is extremely}} important {{for the improvement of}} pump reliability to quantitatively grasp these fluctuating hydrodynamic forces and determine the generation mechanism behind them. In this study, we conducted component analyses of <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> thrusts of closed, single-blade centrifugal pumps with different blade outlet angles by numerical analysis while considering leakage flow. The results revealed the effect of the blade outlet angle on the components of <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>axial</b> thrusts. For increased flow rates, the time-averaged values of the pressure component were similar for all impellers, although its fluctuating components were higher for impellers with larger blade outlet angles. Moreover, the fluctuating inertia component of the impeller with a blade outlet angle of 8 ° decreased as the flow rate increased, whereas those with 16 ° and 24 ° angles increased. Therefore, the radial thrust on the hydraulic part was significantly higher for impellers with high blade outlet angles...|$|R
