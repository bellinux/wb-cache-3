40|$|Over 2500 wells on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) will at {{some point}} have to be {{permanently}} plugged and abandoned. As the drill rig rate contributes to 40 - 50 % of the total plug and abandonment (P&A) cost, the potential savings in shifting operations towards a <b>rigless</b> approach could be significant. The main objective during a P&A operation is to restore cap rock functionality, by creating a cross-sectional barrier. The conventional way of plugging wells on NCS {{is to use a}} rig, to allow pulling tubing, section milling or perforate, wash and cement operations to be executed. This thesis presents an alternative approach to P&A using well intervention equipment in combination with some emerging high-energy technologies intended for <b>rigless</b> P&A. Wireline and coiled tubing with associated equipment and tools are used together with an electric plasma miller and/or thermite to create a cross-sectional barrier in a through tubing and X-mas tree P&A operation. A case study is presented where three wells are plugged using a <b>rigless</b> approach. The wells have an increasing P&A complexity, where lack of annular barrier traditionally requires a rig. The case study identified several challenges with the presented <b>rigless</b> approach. A through tubing operation will leave the tubing as a major restriction in the well. All tools have to pass through the tubing before reaching the required plugging interval. Azimuthal bond logging tools intended for logging production casing cement will have particular difficulty passing tubing of 5 - 1 / 2 ” and smaller. Additionally, placing enough thermite to comply with current NORSOK D- 010 specifications was found challenging. New revisions of NORSOK D- 010 should allow the implementation of new technology and <b>rigless</b> P&A to open up for a leaner approach to P&A. The majority of the wells studied were not fully suited for a complete <b>rigless</b> P&A operation, but the approach could be used to install permanent reservoir barriers. By completing parts of the plugging operation using well intervention equipment, the P&A scope for a rig could be minimized and thereby potentially saving cost...|$|E

Mostly, in the mature gas reservoirs, a big attention {{must be given to}} well interventions for maintaining or increasing the production. Because of the workover operation risks and costs, the oil companies prefer as much as possible <b>rigless</b> jobs to accomplish well stimulation like reperforation or several coil tubing operations (acidizing, fracturing etc). In our rehabilitation programs for many gas reservoirs, our company accomplished successfully more stimulation jobs. In this paper, we will present some case studies and results obtained after several <b>rigless</b> operations which assure long term production increases. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|Plugging and Abandonment (P&A) {{has long}} been given little im- portance in the oil {{industry}} as the activity does not generate values, and preparing for it to be efficiently carried out was overshadowed by the interest of providing an optimal well design for production of hydrocarbons. Moreover, P&A lay too far in the future and was thought of as a fixed and minor cost. This thesis deals with well construction, completion design and innovative abandonment technology as a way to reduce P&A expenditure. Slim well construction, monobore well completion and slen- der riser technology are investigated. <b>Rigless</b> abandonment methods involving wireline and coiled tubing for plugging both platform and subsea production wells are reviewed and compared. A <b>rigless</b> tech- nique is a technique which does not make use of heavy intervention rigs but of low specication or light well intervention vessels. Specif- ically, one of these techniques is given particular attention in this thesis, namely through-tubing abandonment. This technique com- plies with existing P&A standards, and is fully <b>rigless.</b> Data from a selected well program taken from a future subsea development is used as a case to illustrate the through-tubing abandonment con- cept and a plugging recommendation is carried out. Further, its risks and requirements are discussed. This development will be on the Brynhild field operated by Lundin Petroleum. Two tool designs for enhancing the capabilities of a light well intervention vessel to perform through-tubing abandonment are presented. The results are that the well construction and completion tech- niques discussed are benecial for a cost effective P&A and that through-tubing P&A is feasible with today's technology. However, specialized equipment needs to be used to meet various challenges. <b>Rigless</b> abandonment involves cheaper rig cost, but also more com- plex and delicate operations and this risk needs to be assessed and mitigated when planning for such an abandonment. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{demonstrate}} how seismic waves propagate in wells, and to investigate the potential of using borehole seismic {{as an alternative to}} conventional cement plug verification. An alternative verification method might be necessary to perform full plug and abandonment (P&A) operations from riserless light well intervention (RLWI) vessels. Testing, verification and monitoring of technical barrier elements are important to maintain well integrity. The barrier situation has to be kept under control in all phases of a well's lifetime. The focus on long-term integrity is increasing as more wells are getting ready to be plugged and abandoned. New and more effective P&A solutions are desired by the industry. <b>Rigless</b> P&A operations would save time and cost, but current technology does not allow RLWI vessels to do the entire operation. The work in this thesis is based on previous work where it is suggested how to place cement plugs in a well using a vessel. To act {{as a part of the}} barrier envelope, the plug needs to be verified and tested according to the NORSOK D- 010 requirements. Tagging is often used for cement plug verification. Conventional tagging operations are not possible from RLWI vessels, and this thesis suggests borehole seismic as an alternative solution for cement plug verification. The alternative verification method is based on generating pressure waves using a seismic source, and detecting the reflection from the cement plug using receivers run on wireline. By doing this it might be possible to verify both the top of the plug and the cement integrity. To investigate the wave propagation and reflections from the plug, well models were created in MATLAB. The models were imported to the Madagscar software, and a 2 D finite difference method was used to model the wave propagation. The wave response from different cement plug scenarios are simulated by adjusting the models and input parameters. These scenarios include plugs with varying degree of cement settling and mud contamination. To confine the simulation time and to avoid numerical instabilities, the model had to be simplified. This has increased the uncertainty in the results. Using the simulation result, the depth of the top of the plug and the wave velocity in the cement were calculated with small errors. Knowing the cement velocity might make it possible to determine the grade of cement hydration. When mud contaminated the top of the plug, the top was not easily identified. The precision of the results is dependent on the frequencies used in the simulations. Tube waves are expected to have great importance when using borehole seismic for plug verification. The result could not identify these types of waves. A reason for this might be that the modeling is in 2 D while the well is 3 D. To make final conclusions on the potential of the alternative verification method, new simulation tools fitted for well modeling should be developed. Field experiments could also give valuable results. The optimal frequency range for cement plug verification has to be determined through a more detailed study. Solving the verification challenge is only one step on the way towards completely <b>rigless</b> P&A operations. Remaining challenges include problems related to tubing removal, logging behind several casing strings, and control line identification and removal. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} called Downhole Tubing Disposal {{developed}} by Oilfield Innovations for performing <b>rigless</b> permanent plug and abandonment is presented. Instead of pulling the production tubing, the tubing is weakened with longitudinal cuts which enables crushing of the tubing into the available liquid {{space of the}} constraining casing, effectively providing an unobstructed casing length where cement plugs can be set. By eliminating the requirement for a drilling rig, significant cost savings can be achieved. Evaluation of a full-scale experiment with a 2 3 / 8 ” tubing is given, and the plans for conducting a full-scale experiment with 4 ½” tubing is presented and discussed. Furthermore, a small-scale experiment was performed with the main objective being investigation {{of the influence of}} cutting pattern and radial clearance between compaction tube and constraint. The discussions from the three experiments are combined and further developed in terms of a real case of Downhole Tubing Disposal. No studies on chaotic crushing of constrained tubes have been found in the literature except for an experiment conducted by the inventors of Downhole Tubing Disposal. The data on the matter were therefore limited, which motivated the small-scale experiment. This experiment clearly shows that weakening a tube with longitudinal cuts reduces its axial compressive strength, and an increasing number of cuts further reduces this strength. Moreover, the compaction ratio increased significantly at moderate loads when more than two cuts were used. Calculations revealed that while a smaller constraining tube gave a reduced compaction ratio, the occupied cross-sectional area of the constraining tube increased at high loads. At moderate loads, the occupied cross-sectional area was identical for the different constraining tubes...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThere {{will be a}} wave of wells {{needing to}} be {{abandoned}} in the North Sea over the next decades. The abandonment operation is known as Plug and Abandonment, or just P&A. As P&A has no value creation, {{it is very important}} that these operations are conducted as effective as possible. Currently, operations are mainly completed using conventional methods, and for P&A to be economically sustainable in the future there is a great need for new technology and methods. In addition, regulators can play a part in achieving more effective operations by tailoring requirements and guidelines. In Norway, P&A operations are still based on a standard released in 2004, meaning that there is a potential for improvements. In this thesis the standard that governs P&A operations in Norway was analysed and compared with the guidelines used on UK sector to find ways of improving NORSOK D- 010. UK sector has more experience with regards to P&A, and use a guideline published in 2012. This ended in several proposed changes in NORSOK D- 010, but also suggestions for additional guidelines for the NCS. To show how alternative technology and methods can be used to improve P&A operations several solutions were presented, including all phases of well abandonment, both for platform and subsea wells. In addition rigs and vessels used in P&A were described, as one of the most important future goals is performing operations <b>rigless.</b> For platform P&A the goal is performing offline operations, meaning eliminating the use of the derrick. For subsea abandonment there exist a great potential in moving operations away from the traditionally used semi-submersibles, and to smaller and significantly cheaper light well intervention vessels (LWIs). Technology and vessels use were later combined in several example cases to give an overview over how operations can improve. In the future operators must be willing to utilize alternative technology in the field, and continue to push for research and development on newer technology to solve the many challenges in P&A operations...|$|E
