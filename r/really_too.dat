In response to the tragedy numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss. Some still wanted to climb but there was <b>really</b> <b>too</b> much controversy to continue that year. One of the issues that triggered the work action by Sherpas was unreasonable client demands during climbs.|$|E

500|$|After two earlier {{unsuccessful}} auditions for the show, Evancho {{was accepted}} as a contestant on the fifth season of NBC's America's Got Talent (AGT) by placing first in its 2010 YouTube competition. On August 10, 2010, Evancho performed the aria [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] in the show's quarter-final round. The judges' reactions were effusive. Afterwards, commentators queried whether her performance had been lip-synched. On the next evening's live show, Evancho sang an impromptu voice exercise {{to demonstrate that the}} broadcast was of her live voice. In an interview, judge Howie Mandel addressed the issue: [...] "hat people are ... really saying [...] that it's <b>really</b> <b>too</b> good to be true." ...|$|E
500|$|The huge cost of {{developing}} the 747 and building the Everett factory meant that Boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate. During the final months before delivery of the first aircraft, the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project. Had this been refused, Boeing's survival would have been threatened. The firm's debt exceeded $2 billion, with the $1.2 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies. Allen later said, [...] "It was <b>really</b> <b>too</b> large a project for us." [...] Ultimately, the gamble succeeded, and Boeing held a monopoly in very large passenger aircraft production for many years.|$|E
500|$|Alapalooza {{contains}} seven original songs {{among its}} twelve tracks, although [...] "Young, Dumb & Ugly" [...] and [...] "Frank's 2000" [...] TV" [...] {{were meant to}} be stylistic parodies of AC/DC and the early work of R.E.M., respectively. For the former, Yankovic wanted to parody the heavy metal music genre {{while at the same time}} avoiding a repetition of what had already been done by Spinal Tap. [...] He ended up disliking the final product because he sang it [...] "in a register that was <b>really</b> <b>too</b> high for [...] singing voice". The latter was a song about consumerism and modern electronics that described the neighborhood's envy of the eponymous character's new television.|$|E

No doubt inspired by the finicky, claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac, the cast tries (with unfortunate success) to be more French than the French, especially Chevalier. The exception is Gingold, who inhabits, as always, a world of her own." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there. As soon as I {{realized there was}} no one to hand it to I started to run toward the line and tried to cover it up and just get down and I slid right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was <b>really</b> <b>too</b> bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I guess (I was) more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. [...] "I'm <b>really</b> <b>too</b> old to {{be trying}} to outscore 18-year-olds", O'Neal said, {{referring}} to the then 23-year-old Howard. [...] "It's not really my role anymore." [...] O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. [...] "I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was [...] "very disappointed cause [...] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight." [...] O'Neal responded, [...] "Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching." [...] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since [...] "everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back." [...] In a 2006 interview in TIME, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would [...] "Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass." ...|$|E

2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's <b>really</b> <b>too</b> much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E
