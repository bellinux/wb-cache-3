5|$|Eye {{problems}} are also possible in some Labradors, particularly progressive <b>retinal</b> atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy and <b>retinal</b> dysplasia. Dogs which {{are intended to}} be bred should be examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist for an eye score.|$|E
5|$|A 1999 {{study of}} Cavaliers {{conducted}} by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems. They include hereditary cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, microphthalmia, progressive <b>retinal</b> atrophy, and <b>retinal</b> dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal <b>retinal</b> dysplasia, and generalized progressive <b>retinal</b> atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|Progressive <b>retinal</b> atrophy (PRA) is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} that affect a dog's eyesight and can lead to blindness. It has been documented in a large number of different dog breeds including both the American and English Cocker Spaniels. The two types of Cockers are susceptible to a specific type of PRA called Progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), symptoms include night blindness leading to total blindness between the ages of three and five. PRCD is the most widespread hereditary <b>retinal</b> disease which may lead to blindness in dogs.|$|E
5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus {{are large}} and {{are at the top}} of the head. They are similar in {{structure}} to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. The cornea is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive <b>retinal</b> cells cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a <b>retinal</b> pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} ocular {{conditions}} to which the Field Spaniel has a predisposition. These include cataracts, <b>retinal</b> atrophy and <b>retinal</b> dysplasia. Hip dysplasia has appeared in British lines of Field Spaniels. In a health {{survey conducted by the}} Kennel Club (UK), the primary cause of death in Field Spaniels was cancer, with the second most frequent cause being old age. The median lifespan for the breed was found to be eleven years and eight months, which is five months higher than the median age for all dog breeds.|$|E
25|$|Tractional <b>retinal</b> {{detachment}} – A tractional <b>retinal</b> detachment {{occurs when}} fibrous or fibrovascular tissue, {{caused by an}} injury, inflammation or neovascularization, pulls the sensory retina from the <b>retinal</b> pigment epithelium.|$|E
25|$|Future {{treatments}} {{may involve}} <b>retinal</b> transplants, artificial <b>retinal</b> implants, gene therapy, stem cells, nutritional supplements, and/or drug therapies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinal</b> {{dysplasia}} is an {{eye disease}} affecting the retina. It {{is usually a}} nonprogressive disease and {{can be caused by}} viral infections, drugs, vitamin A deficiency, or genetics. <b>Retinal</b> dysplasia is characterized by folds or rosettes (round clumps) of the <b>retinal</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinal</b> {{micropsia}} {{is characterized}} {{by an increase in}} the distance between <b>retinal</b> photoreceptors and is associated with decreased visual acuity.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} <b>retinal</b> {{detachment}} include severe myopia, <b>retinal</b> tears, trauma, family history, {{as well as}} complications from cataract surgery.|$|E
25|$|Very {{recently}} the orphan OA1 receptor has been de-orphaned. Studies showed that L-DOPA is the specific ligand for the OA1 receptor. L-DOPA is {{a by-product of}} melanin biosynthetic pathway. During melanin synthesis, L-DOPA is released to the retina in the <b>retinal</b> pigment epithelium and is necessary for specific stages of <b>retinal</b> development. Activation of the OA1 receptor by L-DOPA leads to the secretion of a neurotropic factor by the <b>retinal</b> pigment epithelium that helps in normal <b>retinal</b> development.|$|E
25|$|Floaters {{can occur}} when eyes age and in rare cases, {{floaters}} {{may be a}} sign of <b>retinal</b> detachment or a <b>retinal</b> tear.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinal</b> detachment* {{is caused}} in dogs by genetic {{disorders}} such as <b>retinal</b> dysplasia or Collie eye anomaly, trauma, inflammation or cancer. Reattachment may occur spontaneously or with medical or surgical therapy.|$|E
25|$|In some eyes, <b>retinal</b> vessels form small nodules on {{the surface}} of the retina, known as angiomas. These can bleed and be {{attached}} to the vitreous humour. The attachment can cause traction <b>retinal</b> detachment.|$|E
25|$|Like most {{invasive}} surgical procedures, however, vitrectomy {{carries a}} risk of complications, including: <b>retinal</b> detachment, anterior vitreous detachment and macular edema – which can threaten vision or worsen existing floaters (in the case of <b>retinal</b> detachment).|$|E
25|$|Adaptive optics {{was first}} applied to flood-illumination <b>retinal</b> imaging to produce images of single cones {{in the living}} human eye. It has also been used in {{conjunction}} with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy to produce (also in living human eyes) the first images of <b>retinal</b> microvasculature and associated blood flow and <b>retinal</b> pigment epithelium cells in addition to single cones. Combined with optical coherence tomography, adaptive optics has allowed the first three-dimensional images of living cone photoreceptors to be collected.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>retinal</b> {{detachment}} usually {{occurs in}} just one eye, there is a 15% chance of it developing in the other eye, and this risk increases to 25–30% in patients {{who have had a}} <b>retinal</b> detachment and cataracts extracted from both eyes.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia {{can result}} from <b>retinal</b> edema causing a {{dislocation}} of the receptor cells. Photoreceptor misalignment seems to occur following the surgical re-attachment for macula-off rhegmatogenous <b>retinal</b> detachment. After surgery, patients may experience micropsia {{as a result of}} larger photoreceptor separation by edematous fluid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinal</b> detachment: {{estimated}} at 0.36 percent.|$|E
25|$|These unique {{features}} specialize {{the ribbon}} synapse to enable extremely fast, precise and sustained neurotransmission, which {{is critical for}} the perception of complex senses such as vision and hearing. Ribbon synapses are found in <b>retinal</b> photoreceptor cells, vestibular organ receptors, cochlear hair cells, <b>retinal</b> bipolar cells, and pinealocytes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinal</b> {{detachment}} can be mitigated in {{some cases}} when the warning signs are caught early. The most effective means of prevention and risk reduction is through education of the initial signs, and encouragement for people to seek ophthalmic medical attention if they have symptoms suggestive of a posterior vitreous detachment. Early examination allows detection of <b>retinal</b> tears {{which can be treated}} with laser or cryotherapy. This reduces the risk of <b>retinal</b> detachment in those who have tears from around 1:3 to 1:20. For this reason, the governing bodies in some sports require regular eye examination.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{complications}} of cataract surgery include <b>retinal</b> detachment and endophthalmitis. In both cases, patients notice a sudden decrease in vision. In endophthalmitis, patients often describe pain. <b>Retinal</b> detachment frequently presents with unilateral visual field defects, blurring of vision, flashes of light, or floating spots.|$|E
25|$|The goal of {{gene therapy}} studies is to virally {{supplement}} <b>retinal</b> cells expressing mutant genes {{associated with the}} Retinitis Pigmentosa phenotype with healthy forms of the gene; thus, allowing the repair and proper functioning of <b>retinal</b> photoreceptor cells {{in response to the}} instructions associated with the inserted healthy gene. Clinical trials investigating the insertion of the healthy RPE65 gene in retinas expressing the LCA2 Retinitis Pigmentosa phenotype measured modest improvements in vision; however, the degradation of <b>retinal</b> photoreceptors continued at the disease-related rate. Likely, gene therapy may preserve remaining healthy <b>retinal</b> cells while failing to repair the earlier accumulation of damage in already diseased photoreceptor cells. Response to gene therapy would theoretically benefit young patients exhibiting the shortest progression of photoreceptor decline; thus, correlating to a higher possibility of cell rescue via the healthy inserted gene.|$|E
25|$|Another {{health hazard}} is <b>retinal</b> haemorrhages, which can damage {{eyesight}} and cause blindness. Up to {{a quarter of}} Everest climbers can experience <b>retinal</b> haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and ended up dying in the death zone.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{field and}} acuity tests measure {{and compare the}} size of the patient's field of vision and the clarity of their visual {{perception}} with the standard visual measurements associated with healthy 20/20 vision. Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and <b>retinal</b> (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP <b>retinal</b> degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, <b>retinal</b> layer morphology, and <b>retinal</b> pigment epithelium physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E
25|$|The <b>retinal</b> {{toxicity}} of vigabatrin {{can be attributed}} to a taurine depletion.|$|E
25|$|Without {{adequate}} {{amounts of}} <b>retinal,</b> regeneration of rhodopsin is incomplete and night blindness occurs.|$|E
25|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} is {{the result}} of damage to the small blood vessels and neurons of the retina. The earliest changes detected in the retina in diabetes leading to diabetic retinopathy include a narrowing of the <b>retinal</b> arteries associated with reduced <b>retinal</b> blood flow; dysfunction of the neurons of the inner retina, followed in later stages by changes in the function of the outer retina, associated with subtle changes in visual function; dysfunction of the blood-retinal barrier, which protects the retina from many substances in the blood (including toxins and immune cells), leading to the leaking of blood constituents into the <b>retinal</b> neuropile. Later, the basement membrane of the <b>retinal</b> blood vessels thickens, capillaries degenerate and lose cells, particularly pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (leading to loss of blood flow and progressive ischemia, and microscopic aneurysms which appear as balloon-like structures jutting out from the capillary walls, which recruit inflammatory cells; and advanced dysfunction and degeneration of the neurons and glial cells of the retina.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} if surgery is {{beneficial}} for asymptomatic <b>retinal</b> breaks or lattice degeneration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinal</b> {{gene therapy}} holds great promise in {{treating}} {{different forms of}} non-inherited and inherited blindness.|$|E
25|$|Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of {{inherited}} <b>retinal</b> degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{retinopathy}} increases risk of <b>retinal</b> hemorrhage due to minor {{mask squeeze}} or equalizing procedures.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} {{during pregnancy}} has effects upon the fetus such as accelerating its <b>retinal</b> development.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>retinal</b> detachment in otherwise normal eyes is around 5 new cases in 100,000 persons per year. Detachment is more frequent in middle-aged or elderly populations, with rates of around 20 in 100,000 per year. The lifetime risk in normal individuals is about 1 in 300. Asymptomatic <b>retinal</b> breaks {{are present in}} about 6% of eyes in both clinical and autopsy studies.|$|E
25|$|A <b>retinal</b> burn {{resulting}} in permanent damage from scarring is also {{caused by the}} concentration of direct thermal energy on the retina by the lens. It will occur only when the fireball is actually in the individual's field of vision and would be a relatively uncommon injury. <b>Retinal</b> burns may be sustained at considerable distances from the explosion. The height of burst, and apparent size of the fireball, a function of yield and range will determine the degree and extent of <b>retinal</b> scarring. A scar in the central visual field would be more debilitating. Generally, a limited visual field defect, which will be barely noticeable, {{is all that is}} likely to occur.|$|E
