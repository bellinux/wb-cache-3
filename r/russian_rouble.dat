40|$|AbstractWe propose an {{interpretation}} of the currency crisis and the stability of the national currency, project the consequences of the currency crisis for the Russian economy, and define perspective directions of stabilizing the <b>Russian</b> <b>rouble.</b> Events in the Russian currency market are defined as a currency crisis based on the statistical data on the dynamics of the US dollar against the <b>Russian</b> <b>rouble</b> in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. The author's vision of the current currency crisis in Russia was formulated. The factors of internal and external instability of the <b>Russian</b> <b>rouble</b> were determined. Possible impacts of the current monetary crisis in Russia were evaluated in comparison with the consequences of the <b>Russian</b> <b>rouble</b> collapse and denomination in 1997 - 1998. The paper shows results of analyzing producers’ prices elasticity by the real effective exchange rate of the rouble. We propose measures aimed at the improvement of Russia's monetary policy to ensure the stability of the Russian currency. The presently observed rapid strengthening of the <b>Russian</b> <b>rouble,</b> which is similar in its speed to the previous devaluation, sets targets for the further research of the causes of the volatility amplification in the Russian currency market, as well as studying the consequences of sudden and multidirectional exchange rate fluctuations {{so that they can be}} minimized...|$|E

In light of this, it becomes interesting to investigate the position of agro-producers both in comparison to producers from other domestic sectors and relatively to its main foreign competitors. An analysis of the recent dynamics (from 2000 to 2014) of the {{real effective exchange rate}} of <b>Russian</b> <b>rouble</b> serves in the present study as an indicator of price competitiveness, which determines relative position of domestic producers in external markets. The actual competitive state of Russian agro-producers is analyzed by the means of revealed comparative advantage indices proposed by Balassa, Vollrath and Lafay. The calculations have shown that the entire analyzed period can be generally characterized as the period of significant real appreciation of the <b>Russian</b> <b>rouble</b> and the reason behind this is the difference in inflation rates in Russia and its main foreign trade partners. This predetermined the relatively low price competitiveness of agro-producers, which was mostly confirmed by calculated values of Balassa Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index, Vollrath Revealed Competitiveness index (VRC) and Lafay Trade Specialization index (LFI). The short-term real depreciations of the rouble did not have any expected substantially positive impacts on their competitive position...|$|E
