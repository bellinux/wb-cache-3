25|$|The plane {{perpendicular}} to the axis of angular momentum and passing {{through the center of}} mass is sometimes called the invariable plane, because the direction of the axis <b>remains</b> <b>fixed</b> if only the interactions of the bodies within the system, free from outside influences, are considered.

25|$|The {{reason is}} that there is a cutoff used to define H, and the cutoff defines the {{shortest}} wavelength. Fluctuations of H at wavelengths near the cutoff can affect the longer-wavelength fluctuations. If the system is scaled along with the cutoff, the parameters will scale by dimensional analysis, but then comparing parameters doesn't compare behavior because the rescaled system has more modes. If the system is rescaled in such a way that the short wavelength cutoff <b>remains</b> <b>fixed,</b> the long-wavelength fluctuations are modified.|$|E

25|$|The Poisson {{distribution}} can {{be derived}} as a limiting case to the binomial distribution {{as the number of}} trials goes to infinity and the expected number of successes <b>remains</b> <b>fixed</b> — see law of rare events below. Therefore, it can be used as an approximation of the binomial distribution if n is sufficiently large and p is sufficiently small. There is a rule of thumb stating that the Poisson distribution is a good approximation of the binomial distribution if n is at least 20 and p is smaller than or equal to 0.05, and an excellent approximation if nnbsp&≥nbsp&100 and npnbsp&≤nbsp&10.|$|E
25|$|The {{extraordinary}} size of Olympus Mons {{is likely}} because Mars lacks mobile tectonic plates. Unlike on Earth, the crust of Mars <b>remains</b> <b>fixed</b> over a stationary hotspot, and a volcano {{can continue to}} discharge lava until it reaches an enormous height. Like the basalt volcanoes on Earth, Martian basaltic volcanoes are capable of erupting enormous quantities of ash. The basalt found on Earth and Mars are very similar in composition. Due to the gravity on Mars, there are less buoyant forces on the magma {{rising out of the}} crust. Also, the magma chambers are thought to be much larger and deeper than the ones found on Earth.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 the {{astronomer}} Karl Schwarzschild pointed out an observation about double stars. The motion of two stars orbiting {{each other is}} planar, the two orbits {{of the stars of}} the system lie in a plane. In the case of sufficiently near double star systems, it can be seen from Earth whether the perihelion of the orbits of the two stars remains pointing in the same direction with respect to the solar system. Schwarzschild pointed out that that was invariably seen: the direction of the angular momentum of all observed double star systems <b>remains</b> <b>fixed</b> with respect to the direction of the angular momentum of the Solar system. The logical inference is that just like gyroscopes, the angular momentum of all celestial bodies is angular momentum with respect to a universal inertial space.|$|E

25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as reflection coefficient) of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no {{as if there were}} no birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However it is in fact an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly around that {{of the ordinary}} ray, which <b>remains</b> <b>fixed.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to this criticism, {{the electoral}} college reduces {{elections}} to a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any voting problems within a particular state. For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by voter suppression methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally disfranchising specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement {{has no effect on}} the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count <b>remains</b> <b>fixed</b> in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend {{the electoral college}} system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.|$|E
