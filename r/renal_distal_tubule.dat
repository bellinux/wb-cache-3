40|$|Cultured Na(+) -transporting epithelia from {{amphibian}} <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule</b> (A 6) were impaled with microelectrodes {{and analyzed}} at short-circuit and after transepithelial voltage perturbation {{to evaluate the}} influence of voltage on apical and basolateral membrane conductances. For equivalent circuit analysis, amiloride was applied at each setting of transepithelial potential. At short-circuit, apical and basolateral membrane conductances averaged 88 and 497 microS/cm 2, respectively (n = 10). Apical membrane conductance, essentially due to Na(+) -specific pathways, decreased after depolarization of the apical membrane. The drop was considerably larger than predicted by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) constant-field equation. This suggests decrease in permeability of the apical Na+ channels upon depolarization. Basolateral membrane conductance, preferentially determined by K+ channels, increased after hyperpolarization of the basolateral membrane. This behavior {{is contrary to the}} prediction of the GHK constant field equation and reflects inward rectification of the K+ channels.

One group of Na+:Cl- cotransporters is specifically inhibited by the benzothiadiazine (thiazide) class of diuretic agents and can be distinguished from Na+:K+: 2 Cl- cotransporters based on a lack of K+ requirement and insensitivity to sulfamoylbenzoic acid diruetics like bumetanide. We report here the isolation of a cDNA encoding a thiazide-sensitive, electroneutral sodium-chloride cotransporter from the winter flounder urinary bladder using an expression cloning strategy. The pharmacological and kinetic characteristics of the cloned cotransporter are consistent with the properties of native thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporters in teleost urinary bladder and mammalian <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule</b> epithelia.

Furosemide-treated animals were offered saline as {{drinking}} fluid to replace urinary losses. Effects of naCl intake were evaluated using free-flow micropuncture, in vivo microperfusion, and morphometric techniques. Dietary NaCl restriction did not affect NaCl delivery to the early distal tubule but markedly increased {{the capacity of the}} distal convoluted tubule to transport Na and Cl. Chronic furosemide infusion increased NaCl delivery to the early distal tubule and also increased the rates of Na and Cl transport above the rates observed in low NaCl diet rats. When compared with high NaCl intake alone, chronic furosemide infusion with saline ingestion increased the fractional volume of distal convoluted tubule cells by nearly 100 %, whereas dietary NaCl restriction had no effect. The results are consistent with the hypotheses that (a) chronic NaCl restriction increases the transport ability of the distal convoluted tubule independent of changes in tubule structure, (b) high rates of ion delivery to the distal nephron cause tubule hypertrophy, and (c) tubule hypertrophy is associated with increases in ion transport capacity.

40|$|A thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter {{contributes}} importantly to mammalian salt homeostasis by mediating Na-Cl transport {{along the}} <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule.</b> Although {{it has been}} accepted that thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransport occurs predominantly along the distal convoluted tubule in rats and mice, sites of expression in the rabbit have been controversial. A commonly accepted model of rabbit distal nephron transport pathways identifies the connecting tubule, not the distal convoluted tubule, as the predominant site of thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransport. The thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter has been cloned recently. The present experiments were designed to localize sites of thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter mRNA expression along the rabbit distal nephron. Nonradioactive in situ hybridization with a thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter probe was combined with immunocytochemistry with an antibody that recognizes distal convoluted tubule cells and with a Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger antibody that recognizes only connecting tubule cells. The results indicate that thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter mRNA is highly expressed by cells of the distal convoluted tubule and not by connecting tubule cells. Segments that stain with the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger antibody (connecting tubules) do not demonstrate thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter mRNA expression. We conclude that the predominant site of thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter mRNA expression in rabbit distal nephron is the distal convoluted tubule and that sites of mRNA expression of electroneutral Na and Cl transport are similar in rabbits, rats, and mice...|$|E

In this study, we examined whether enhancement of ATRAP in the <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubules</b> affects sodium handling {{and blood pressure}} regulation in response to high salt (HS) loading, using ATRAP transgenic mice on a salt-sensitive C 57 BL/ 6 J background. Methods and Results-—Renal ATRAP transgenic (rATRAP-Tg) mice, which exhibit renal tubule–dominant ATRAP enhancement, and their wild-type littermate C 57 BL/ 6 J mice on a normal salt diet (0. 3 % NaCl) at baseline were subjected to dietary HS loading (4 % NaCl) for 7 days. In rATRAP-Tg mice, the dietary HS loading–mediated blood pressure elevation was suppressed compared with wild-type mice, despite similar baseline blood pressure. Although renal angiotensin II level was comparable in rATRAP-Tg andwild-typemice with and without HS loading, urinary sodium excretion in response to HS loading was significantly enhanced in the rATRAP-Tg mice. In addition, functional transport activity of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel was significantly decreased under saline volume–expanded conditions in rATRAP-Tg mice compared with wild-type mice, without any evident change in epithelial Na+ channel protein expression. Plasmamembrane AT 1 Rexpression in the kidney of rATRAP-Tgmicewas decreased comparedwithwild-typemice. Conclusions-—These results demonstrated that distal tubule–dominant enhancement of ATRAP inhibits pathological renal sodium reabsorption and blood pressure elevation in response to HS loading.

40|$|Sodium {{transport}} {{across the}} apical membrane, via amiloride sensitive sodium channels, is the limiting step of sodium absorption in transporting epithelia with high intercellular electrical resistance, {{such as the}} distal parts of the colon and of the renal tubule. Several types of amiloride sensitive sodium channels have been functionally characterized: one of them (type I) with high selectivity and low conductance for sodium is {{under the control of}} aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone. This channel has been cloned (2) : it is formed of three subunits, alpha, beta and gamma. The distribution of these subunits has been examined in several epitheliums at the mRNA (in situ hybridization) and protein (immunocytochemistry) levels. All three subunits are expressed in the most superficial cells of the distal colon, in principal cells of the <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule</b> and cortical collecting duct, in striated ducts of serous acini of salivary glands, and in excretory ducts of sweat glands. Immunocytochemistry established the apical localization of the channel subunit proteins. No expression was detected in other cell types of these tissues. These results highlight the crucial role of the type I amiloride sensitive sodium channel in the control of sodium homeostasis at the level of tight, aldosterone-sensitive epitheliums. Furthermore, novel questions are opened, in view of the sodium channel being a member of a highly conserved family of mechanoreceptors, and of its implication in some human genetic diseases...|$|E

It was found that neutral red is a cytoplasmic toxin which causes reproducible and characteristic changes in the ergastoplasm, the zymogen granules, the mitochondria, and possibly in the Golgi complex. Ergastoplasmic membranes and granules and zymogen granules lose definition and become continuous with the cytoplasmic matrix.

The ability of the mitochondria to concentrate the cation, neutral red, taken with its well known ability to concentrate the cationic Janus dyes and methylene blue, and its probable role in concentrating those cationic dyes which have been used to demonstrate the "vacuome," is interpreted to signify that one of the functions of mitochondria may be to concentrate intracellar cations...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Prerious {{evidence}} shows that salt-sensitive (S) rats have a net increase in plasma mlneralo-corticoid activity due to l&-hydroxy-ll-deoxycorticosterone and decreased urinary kallikrein excretion com-pared to salt-resistant (R) rats. Since minermlocorticolds stimulate urinary kallikrein excretion, these results are inconsistent. This inconsistency was {{explained by the fact}} that, while R rats responded normally to treat-ment with deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by an Increase in urinary kallikrein excretion, S rats showed no change in urinary kallikrein even when treated with 10 mg of DOC/day for 24 days. S and R rats responded iden-tically to DOC with changes in muscle electrolytes and relative hypertrophy of the <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule.</b> Other measures of chronic mlneralocorticoid response in S rats beside kallikrein were, therefore, intact. It was found that S rats were capable of responding to Na deficient diet with an increase in urinary kallikrein comparable to R rats. It was argued, therefore, that mineralcocorticoid receptor mechanisms and distal-tubular cell respon-siveness are intact in S rats. Mild glomerular and tubular scarring was found in S rats and the severity of renal lesions was increased by DOC treatment in S rats. These lesions correlated well with blood pressure and pro-telnuria. No such lesions were present in control or DOC treated R rats. It was suggested that failure of urinary kallikrein to respond to DOC in S rats may be a secondary phenomenon resulting from renal damage...|$|E
40|$|Dietary {{potassium}} (K(+)) intake has antihypertensive effects, prevents strokes, {{and improves}} cardiovascular outcomes. The underlying mechanism for these beneficial effects of high K(+) diets may include vasodilation, enhanced urine flow, reduced renal renin release, and negative sodium (Na(+)) balance. Indeed, several studies demonstrate that dietary K(+) intake induces renal Na(+) loss despite elevated plasma aldosterone. This review briefly highlights the epidemiological and experimental evidences {{for the effects}} of dietary K(+) on arterial blood pressure. It discusses the pivotal role of the <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule</b> for the regulation of urinary K(+) and Na(+) excretion and blood pressure and highlights that it depends on the coordinated interaction of different nephron portions, epithelial cell types, and various ion channels, transporters, and ATPases. Moreover, we discuss the relevance of aldosterone and aldosterone-independent factors in mediating the effects of an altered K(+) intake on renal K(+) and Na(+) handling. Particular focus is given to findings suggesting that an aldosterone-independent downregulation of the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter significantly contributes to the natriuretic and antihypertensive effect of a K(+) -rich diet. Last but not least, we refer to the complex signaling pathways enabling the kidney to adapt its function to the homeostatic needs in response to an altered K(+) intake.

As in most other epithelia, the apical membrane represents the major resistive barrier. Transcellular, apical and basolateral membrane conductances (gc, go and gi respectively), obtained from 22 acceptable microelectrode studies, averaged 61, 80 and 292 microS/cm 2, respectively. There was a highly significant correlation between short-circuit current (Isc) and go, whereas gi was unrelated to Isc. The Isc, which averaged 4. 1 microA/cm 2, was almost completely blocked by amiloride. This was associated with fast hyperpolarization; the intracellular potential (Vsc) increased from - 69 to - 83 mV and the fractional apical resistance rose to nearly 100 %. Using the values of Vsc during amiloride at normal and high [K+], an apparent transference number for K+ at the basolateral membrane of 0. 72 can be calculated. This value corresponds with the decrease in gi to about 25 % of the control values after blocking the K+ channels with Ba 2 +. The nature of the remaining conductance is presently unclear. The cellular current decreased during high [K+] and Ba 2 +, in part resulting from reduction of the electrochemical gradient for apical Na+ uptake due to the depolarization.

We studied the role of stress-inducible genes Heme Oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), HSP 27, HSP 40, and HSP 70 in the kidney following a 4 hour period of brain death. Methods Brain death was induced in rats (n= 6) by inflating a balloon catheter in the epidural space. Kidneys were analysed for HSPs using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results RT-PCR data showed {{a significant increase in}} gene expression for HO- 1 and HSP 70 in kidneys of brain dead rats.

We have examined kidneys from 21 human fetuses of various ages using an immunohistological method for substances related to the ABO blood group system, various cytokeratins including those detected by the monoclonal antibody PKK 2, and Tamm-Horsfall protein. The ureteric bud and connecting piece expressed the type 1 precursor chain of ABO antigens mostly early in gestation, the H antigen of the ABO system mostly later in gestation, and cytokeratins detected by PKK 2. The induced nephrons after the S-shaped body stage expressed Tamm-Horsfall protein. In the adult renal tubule, distal from the macula densa, it was already known that there is a sharp junction between the segment expressing Tamm-Horsfall protein and the more distal segment that expresses the H antigen and cytokeratins detected by PKK 2. The finding that the ureteric bud and connecting piece express the same antigens as this segment while the S-shaped body eventually expresses Tamm-Horsfall protein is consistent with the concept that (1) the connecting piece arises from the ureteric bud, not the S-shaped body, and (2) the junction of ureteric bud derivatives and metanephric blastema derivatives is on the distal side of the macula densa at the distal end of Tamm-Horsfall staining...|$|E
40|$|Gitelman's syndrome, an {{autosomal}} recessive renal tubulopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in the thiazide-sensitive NaCl co-transporter (NCC) of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), {{is characterized by}} mild renal Na(+) wasting, hypocalciuria, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemic alkalosis. For gaining further insights into the pathophysiology of Gitelman's syndrome, the impact of NCC ablation on the morphology of the distal tubule, on the distribution and abundance of ion transport proteins along its length, and on renal tubular Na(+) and Ca(2 +) handling in a gene-targeted mouse model was studied. NCC-deficient mice had significantly elevated plasma aldosterone levels and exhibited hypocalciuria, hypomagnesemia, and compensated alkalosis. Immunofluorescent detection of distal tubule marker proteins and ultrastructural analysis revealed that the early DCT, which physiologically lacks epithelial Na(+) (ENaC) and Ca(2 +) (TRPV 5) channels, was virtually absent in NCC-deficient mice. In contrast, the late DCT seemed intact and retained expression of the apical ENaC and TRPV 5 as well as basolateral Na(+) -Ca(2 +) exchanger. The connecting tubule exhibited a marked epithelial hypertrophy accompanied by an increased apical abundance of ENaC. Ca(2 +) reabsorption seemed unaltered in the distal convolution (i. e., the DCT and connecting tubule) as indicated by real-time reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry for TRPV 5 and Na(+) -Ca(2 +) exchanger and micropuncture experiments. The last experiments further indicated that reduced glomerular filtration and enhanced fractional reabsorption of Na(+) and Ca(2 +) upstream and of Na(+) downstream of the DCT provide some compensation for the Na(+) transport defect in the DCT {{and contribute to the}} hypocalciuria. Thus, loss of NCC leads to major structural remodeling of the <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule</b> that goes along with marked changes in glomerular and tubular function, which may explain some of the clinical features of Gitelman's syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Lindane, or γ-hexachlorocyclohexane, is a {{chlorinated}} hydrocarbon pesticide that was banned from U. S. production in 1976, but until recently {{continued to be}} imported and applied for occupational and domestic purposes. Lindane is known to cause central nervous system (CNS), immune, cardiovascular, reproductive, liver, and kidney toxicity. The mechanism for which lindane interacts with the CNS has been elucidated, and involves antagonism of the γ-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine (GABAA/BZD) receptor. Antagonism of this receptor results in the inhibition of Cl- channel flux, with subsequent convulsions, seizures, and paralysis. This response makes lindane a desirable defense against arthropod pests in agriculture and the home. However, formulation and application of this compound can contribute to human toxicity. In conjunction with this exposure scenario, workers {{may be subject to}} both heat and physical stress that may increase their susceptibility to pesticide toxicity by altering their cellular stress response. The kidneys are responsible for maintaining osmotic homeostasis, and are exposed to agents that undergo urinary excretion. The mechanistic action of lindane on the kidneys is not well understood. Lindane, in other organ systems, has been shown to cause cellular damage by generation of free radicals and oxidative stress. Previous research in our laboratory has shown that lindane causes apoptosis in distal tubule cells, and delays renal stress response under hypertonic stress. Characterizing the mechanism of action of lindane under conditions of physiologic stress is necessary to understand the potential hazard cyclodiene pesticides and other organochlorine compounds pose to exposed individuals under baseline conditions, as well as under conditions of physiologic stress. We demonstrated that exposure to lindane results in oxidative damage and dysregulation of glutathione response in <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule</b> (MDCK) cells. We showed that under conditions of hypertonic stress, lindane-induced oxidative stress resulted in early onset apoptosis and corresponding down-regulated expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xL. Thus, the interaction of lindane with renal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) is associated with attenuation of cellular protective proteins, making the cell more susceptible to injury or death. ...|$|E

Similar to glucose, AGEs did not induce TGF-beta 1 mRNA in <b>distal</b> <b>renal</b> <b>tubule</b> cells [MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells]; however, TGF-beta 1 bioactivity was increased significantly. This result indicated post-translational regulation. Since TSP- 1 (thrombospondin- 1) has been demonstrated to activate latent TGF-beta 1 in a variety of systems, the following experiments were performed. We found that AGEs dose-dependently increased both intracellular and extracellular levels of TSP- 1. Purified TSP- 1, like AGEs, increased the cellular protein content. Furthermore, anti-TSP- 1 neutralizing antibodies attenuated the AGE-induced increase in TGF-beta 1 bioactivity and hypertrophy. Thus TSP- 1 might mediate AGE-induced <b>distal</b> <b>renal</b> <b>tubule</b> hypertrophy. In addition, we observed several putative transcription factor binding sites in the TSP- 1 promoter, including those for AP- 1 (activator protein- 1), CREB (cAMP response element binding protein), NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB), SRF (serum response factor) and HSF (heat-shock factor), by sequence mapping. We used an enhancer assay to screen possible transcription factors involved. We showed that AP- 1 and CREB were specifically induced by AGEs; furthermore, TFD (transcription factor decoy) for AP- 1 could attenuate the AGE-induced increases in TSP- 1 levels and cellular hypertrophy. Thus regulation of TSP- 1 might be critical for hyperglycaemic <b>distal</b> <b>tubule</b> hypertrophy. Furthermore, TSP- 1 TFD might be a potential approach to ameliorate diabetic renal hypertrophy...|$|R

We hypothesized that renal distress could be imposed by an augmented aldosterone-induced protein turnover challenging cellular protein degradation systems of the renal tubular cells. Cellular accumulation of specific protein aggregates in rat kidneys was assessed after 7 days of aldosterone administration. Aldosterone induced intracellular accumulation of 60 s ribosomal protein L 22 in protein aggregates, specifically in the <b>distal</b> convoluted <b>tubules.</b> The mineralocorticoid receptor inhibitor spironolactone abolished aldosterone-induced accumulation of these aggregates. The aldosterone-induced protein aggregates also contained proteasome 20 s subunits. The partial de-ubiquitinase ataxin- 3 was not localized to the <b>distal</b> <b>renal</b> <b>tubule</b> protein aggregates, and the aggregates only modestly colocalized with aggresome transfer proteins dynactin p 62 and histone deacetylase 6. Intracellular protein aggregation in <b>distal</b> <b>renal</b> <b>tubules</b> {{did not lead to}} development of classical juxta-nuclear aggresomes or to autophagosome formation. Finally, aldosterone treatment induced foci in renal cortex of epithelial vimentin expression and a loss of E-cadherin expression, as signs of cellular stress. The cellular changes occurred within high, but physiological aldosterone concentrations. We conclude that aldosterone induces protein accumulation in dista...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{occurrence}} of hemorrhagic syndrome in man, caused by contact with Lonomia obliqua caterpillars, {{has been reported}} in Southern Brazil in the past 10 years. the L. obliqua venom causes a severe consumptive coagulopathy, which can lead to hemorrhagic syndrome. L. obliqua prothrombin activator protease (Lopap) is a 69 -kDa prothrombin activator serine protease isolated from L. obliqua caterpillar bristle extract, which is able to evoke thrombus formation, unclottable blood, and fibrinogen depletion when injected into the blood stream of rats. the purified protein generated thrombin from prothrombin, able to clot purified human fibrinogen and plasma. A decrease in platelet count and inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation were observed, as well as leukocyte infiltration in the lungs. Ln addition, we observed congestion and hemorrhage in renal glomeruli and necrosis in <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubules.</b> These data support the hypothesis that Lopap contributes to the clinical syndrome caused by human contact with L. obliqua, most probably through prothrombin activation, resulting in a consumption coagulopathy.

40|$|The Rab GTPase-activating protein TBC 1 D 4 (AS 160) {{controls}} trafficking of the {{glucose transporter}} GLUT 4 in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells. TBC 1 D 4 is also highly {{abundant in the}} <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule,</b> although its role in this tubule is so far unknown. In vitro studies {{suggest that it is}} involved in the regulation of renal transporters and channels such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2), and the Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase. To assess the physiological role of TBC 1 D 4 in the kidney, wild-type (TBC 1 D 4 (+/+)) and TBC 1 D 4 -deficient (TBC 1 D 4 (-/-)) mice were studied. Unexpectedly, neither under standard nor under challenging conditions (low Na(+) /high K(+), water restriction) did TBC 1 D 4 (-/-) mice show any difference in urinary Na(+) and K(+) excretion, urine osmolarity, plasma ion and aldosterone levels, and blood pressure compared with TBC 1 D 4 (+/+) mice. Also, immunoblotting did not reveal any change in the abundance of major renal sodium- and water-transporting proteins [Na-K- 2 Cl cotransporter (NKCC 2) NKCC 2, NaCl cotransporter (NCC), ENaC, AQP 2, and the Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase]. However, the abundance of GLUT 4, which colocalizes with TBC 1 D 4 along the distal nephron of TBC 1 D 4 (+/+) mice, was lower in whole kidney lysates of TBC 1 D 4 (-/-) mice than in TBC 1 D 4 (+/+) mice. Likewise, primary thick ascending limb (TAL) cells isolated from TBC 1 D 4 (-/-) mice showed an increased basal glucose uptake and an abrogated insulin response compared with TAL cells from TBC 1 D 4 (+/+) mice. Thus, TBC 1 D 4 is dispensable for the regulation of renal Na(+) and water transport, but may play a role for GLUT 4 -mediated basolateral glucose uptake in distal tubules. The latter may contribute to the known anaerobic glycolytic capacity of distal tubules during renal ischemia...|$|E
40|$|The {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} (ENaC) {{plays a major}} role in the regulation of sodium balance and BP by controlling Na � reabsorption along the <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule</b> and collecting duct (CD). ENaC activity is affected by extracellular nucleotides acting on P 2 receptors (P 2 R); however, there remain uncertainties over the P 2 R subtype(s) involved, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible, and their physiologic role. This study investigated the relationship between apical P 2 R and ENaC activity by assessing the effects of P 2 R agonists on amiloride-sensitive current in the rat CD. Using whole-cell patch clamp of principal cells of split-open CD from Na �-restricted rats, in combination with immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR, we found that activation of metabotropic P 2 R (most likely the P 2 Y 2 and/or 4 subtype), via phospholipase C, inhibited ENaC activity. In addition, activation of ionotropic P 2 R (most likely the P 2 X 4 and/or 4 / 6 subtype), via phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase, either inhibited or potentiated ENaC activity, depending on the extracellular Na � concentration; therefore, it is proposed that P 2 X 4 and/or 4 / 6 receptors might function as apical Na � sensors responsible for local regulation of ENaC activity in the CD and could thereby help to regulate Na � balance and systemic BP.

40|$|Calcium {{transport}} {{through the}} luminal membrane of the distal tubule. I. Interrelationship with sodium. Calcium (Ca 2 +) transport by isolated luminal membranes from rabbit <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubule</b> has been characterized. Ca 2 + uptake by these membrane vesicles exhibited saturation kinetics. In {{the absence of}} sodium (Na+) in the incubation medium, a low affinity system was observed with a KmCa 2 + of 2. 83 ± 0. 64 mM and Vmax of 3. 03 ± 0. 48 pmoL/µg/ 10 sec. A second type of kinetics was also detected with a high affinity and a low velocity (KmCa 2 + 0. 04 ± 0. 01 mM, Vmax 1. 18 ± 0. 22 pmol/µg/ 10 sec). The luminal membranes from proximal tubules showed a single system with a KmCa 2 + of 0. 49 ± 0. 20 mM and Vmax of 1. 26 ± 0. 17 pmol/µg/ 10 sec. The presence of Na+ sharply decreased Ca 2 + uptake by the high affinity system of the membranes from distal tubules, increasing the KmCa 2 + to 0. 07 mM ± 0. 01 (P < 0. 01) and decreasing the Vmax to 0. 27 pmol/µg/ 10 sec (P < 0. 005). This effect of Na+ was concentration-dependent, with a half-maximal effect at 38 mM Na+ and a Hill coefficient of 0. 9. In contrast, Na+ {{had no effect on}} Ca 2 + transport through the luminal membranes of proximal tubules nor on the low affinity system of the distal tubule. The composition of the intravesicular medium also influenced Ca 2 + uptake by the membranes from distal tubules. Compared to mannitol, trans-Na+ or K+ significantly reduced Ca 2 + transport. Finally, cis-K+ induced an increase in this transport. As found with Na+, the effect of K+ was concentration-dependent, with a Hill coefficient of 0. 42. It is concluded that: 1) the luminal membrane of the distal tubule fundamentally differs from the brush border membrane of the proximal tubule; 2) Na+ has an inhibitory effect on Ca 2 + uptake when applied {{on either side of the}} distal tubule membrane, and therefore probably binds at two different sites of the carriers in the membrane; 3) trans-K+ inhibits whereas cis-K+ enhances Ca 2 + transport in this membrane; and 4) the actions of Na+ and K+ are not dependent upon any exchange mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The <b>renal</b> <b>distal</b> <b>tubules</b> and {{collecting}} ducts {{play a key}} role in the control of electrolyte and fluid homeostasis. The discovery of highly calcium selective channels, Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 5 (TRPV 5) of the TRP superfamily, has clarified the nature of the calcium entry channels. It has been proposed that this channel mediates the critical Ca(2 +) entry step in transcellular Ca(2 +) re-absorption in the kidney. The regulation of transmembrane Ca(2 +) flux through TRPV 5 is of particular importance for whole body calcium homeostasis. In this study, we provide evidence that the TRPV 5 channel is present in rat cortical collecting duct (RCCD(2)) cells at mRNA and protein levels. We demonstrate that 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) is involved in the regulation of Ca(2 +) influx in these cells via the epithelial Ca(2 +) channels TRPV 5. By combining whole-cell patch-clamp and Ca(2 +) -imaging techniques, we have characterized the electrophysiological properties of the TRPV 5 channel and showed that treatment with 20 - 50 nM E(2) rapidly (< 5 min) induced a transient increase in inward whole-cell currents and intracellular Ca(2 +) via TRPV 5 channels. This rise was significantly prevented when cells were pre-treated with ruthenium red and completely abolished in cells treated with siRNA specifically targeting TRPV 5. These data demonstrate for the first time, a novel rapid modulation of endogenously expressed TRPV 5 channels by E(2) in kidney cells. Furthermore, the results suggest calcitropic effects of E(2). The results are discussed in relation to present concepts of non-genomic actions of E(2) in Ca(2 +) homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|The amiloride-sensitive {{epithelial}} sodium channel, ENaC, is a heteromultimeric protein made up {{of three}} homologous subunits (alpha, beta and gamma) (1, 2). In vitro, assembly and expression of functional active sodium channels in the Xenopus oocyte is strictly dependent on alpha-ENaC [...] the beta and gamma subunits by themselves are unable to induce an amiloride-sensitive sodium current in this heterologous expression system (2). In vivo, ENaC constitutes the limiting step for sodium absorption in epithelial cells that line the <b>distal</b> <b>renal</b> <b>tubule,</b> <b>distal</b> colon and the duct of several exocrine glands. The adult lung expresses alpha, beta and gamma ENaC (3, 4), and an amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium reabsorption has been documented in upper and lower airways (3 - 7), {{but it is not}} established whether this sodium transport is mediated by ENaC in vivo. We inactivated the mouse alpha-ENaC gene by gene targeting. Amiloride-sensitive electrogenic Na+ transport was abolished in airway epithelia from alpha-ENaC(-/-) mice. Alpha-ENaC(-/-) neonates developed respiratory distress and died within 40 h of birth from failure to clear their lungs of liquid.
