The thesis begins with defining the industrial rights as a term {{and its relation to}} the broader area of intellectual property rights. The main international classifications of industrial property rights are introduced along with the basic principles of their international protection. The thesis subsequently approaches the historical introduction to the examined issues beginning in antiquity and progressing until the great industrial revolution of the nineteenth century which has led to the adoption of The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. The general provisions of The Paris Convention and The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights are dealt with in a separate chapter, including the historical basis of both treaties, their main principles and contribution to the international protection of intellectual property generally, and industrial property specifically.

This is resulting in additional large-scale hunger in the region. Harnessing the potential of trade by putting in place appropriate policies to ensure affordable food for millions of people is the need of the hour. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an understanding of how climate change, food security, and trade interact and build the capacity of all relevant stakeholders to develop and implement holistic responses.

40|$|Background: The tourism cluster-approach is {{considered}} to be an appropriate strategy in emerging economies and less developed areas. Due to scarce resources and a great number of structural problems of rural areas in Montenegro, uniting all stakeholders and attractions into a competitive tourism cluster would ensure that the area could operate and become an effective and efficient rural tourism destination. Objectives: The objective {{of this paper is to}} highlight the key challenges of rural tourism clustering and provide new data and a wider understanding of the tourism-cluster approach in Montenegrin rural areas. Methods: Using the extensive literature, available secondary data from government bodies, NGOs, foreign development agencies, <b>relevant</b> <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> and primary data collected from rural tourism operators in Montenegro, the paper investigates key challenges and factors associated with (in) efficiency of Montenegrin theme trails. Results: Several management and marketing issues are identified regarding the cluster approach implementation. Special importance and significance of information technologies and intelligent systems have been recognized in sense of cost-effective marketing implementation. Most Montenegrin trails are still in the first phase of cluster development, whereas just two of them have experienced a significant improvement in cooperative behaviour. Conclusions: Key benefits of the cluster approach are noted and clearly defined, but in the case of the Montenegrin rural tourism sector, these potentials are still, to a large extent, underused...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of Non-Refoulement {{is a concept}} that is very well known in the framework of International protection applicable to refugees and or asylum seekers. Non Refoulement is a concept in which State shall not expel or return (“refouler”) a refugee or asylum seeker in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The {{principle of}} Non Refoulement is generally relevant to the protection of human rights, especially in relation with the freedom of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In the context of International refugee law, the principle of Non Refoulement is a fundamental concept and considered as the back-bone of the whole frameworks of International protection for refugee and asylum seeker. This article discussed three aspects relevant to the principle of Non Refoulement, namely : the existence of such a principle in the existing International legalsystem, the character of the principle of Non Refoulement as Jus Cogens, and the condition of which the benefit of such a principle may not be applied. It is obvious that the principle of Non- Refoulement has been accepted by International community as explicitly established in International legal instruments and consistently implemented in the practice of State and the <b>relevant</b> <b>International</b> <b>organisations.</b> Such a principle is accepted by International community and gained ground as Jus Cogens in the International legal system, consequently States individually or collectively shall not derogate in a manner whatsoever, otherwise it is modified by a subsequent norm of general International law having the same character. However, should there are reasonable grounds, the benefit of the present principle may not be granted to a refugee...|$|R
40|$|The purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{research}} the role of marketing concept in the process of the sustainable rural tourism development. Design – The special focus is given to analysis of the factors that influence the implementation of marketing philosophy in tourism and its specifics in area of rural tourism. Methodology – Using available secondary and primary data from government bodies and <b>relevant</b> <b>international</b> <b>organisations,</b> several factors are identified that affect the implementation of marketing philosophy in area of rural tourism. Followed by qualitative analysis, these factors are analyses in details in order to provide the ideas for future development. The development of information technology, competition and growth in its global character, the new buyer and the need for sustainable development are just some of the factors that determine a new way of keeping the rural tourism business. Approach – Implementation of marketing philosophy in rural tourism is examined on the level of tourist destination, due to importance of cooperation and coordination on this macro level for the sustainable development of the rural tourism. Findings – Key findings indicate that marketing in rural tourism should be seen as a means to achieve development of strategic goals of rural tourist destinations, such as: long-term prosperity, guest satisfaction, profit maximization, extension of the tourist season, neutralizing the negative social impacts, stabilization of employment, support and further diversification of existing economic activity, temporal and spatial redistribution of tourist demand etc. Therefore, marketing cannot be understood simply as propaganda or simply as printing leaflets, but as a platform for defining business objectives and strategies, and creation of tourist products which deliver unique experience to consumers and generate profit for rural tourism destination. The originality of this research – The originality comes from the analysis of the specifics of marketing implementation in rural touris...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the World Trade Organization, and the need to base trade restrictions that exceed those recommended by the <b>relevant</b> <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> on a scientific assessment of the risks to human, animal or plant health, import risk analysis has been recognised as a discrete scientific discipline. As such, import risk analysis has seen the trends in methodologies typical of an emerging scientific discipline. The OIE International Animal Health Code chapter on import risk analysis has recently been revised, and the changes made reflect an international move toward a closer adherence to the requirements of the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the so-called SPS Agreement. This thesis examines the SPS Agreement and other pertinent components of the current regulatory environment for trade in animal products. The thesis also examines risk analysis methodologies. Fifty-five sample qualitative and quantitative import risk analyses were obtained for review. Methodologies reported in these analyses were evaluated in conjunction with those advocated in the current and previous OIE Code chapters on import risk analysis. The OIE International Aquatic Animal Health Code was also included in the review, since many of the sample analyses were carried out for aquatic animals or products. These evaluations led to a synthesis of existing methodologies for import risk analysis, and the identification of key areas for continued research and development. An expert system was designed and implemented to enable the results of the evaluations to be conveyed to risk analysts. It was envisaged that delivering these results by way of an expert system would enable analysts to carry out risk analyses efficiently and in a structured manner. The expert system was designed in a modular format and by using the object-orientated paradigm. This approach enabled expert knowledge to be stored efficiently, and meant that the system could be easily updated as research in the specified areas continued. The design also meant that the system could be extended to pest risk analysis, or to non-biological disciplines such as actuarial and project risk analysis...|$|R

In October 2014, {{the first version of}} the entirely innovated and revised DB-ALM was publicly launched that provoked several positive reactions at International conferences. Completion is foreseen in 2017, progressively phasing out the previous version data sector by data sector. Several initiatives have been taken to ensure the state-of-the-art for both the scientific content and technological development. The online information content is continuously updated with current emphasis on the methods originating from EU funded research projects and/or undergoing validation studies towards international acceptance. The online information content covers today: 325 method descriptions (168 Summaries and 157 Protocols) linked to 82 method evaluations with 3017 test compounds, 9231 results, and experts` contact details. Further development refers particularly to the innovation of the content management system in addition to the public DB-ALM internet version. The Method Summary is the main data sector of the DB-ALM, providing the key-features of the comprehensively described methods, with regularly updated conent and revised nomenclature. This ensures a harmonised framework for adequately describing alternative methods in an OECD accepted format, robust and flexible for various types of alternative approaches to testing of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices or biologicals. A further consolidation and growing interest in the DB-ALM was observed with a steady increasing user community and usage, amounting to a total of nearly 5, 000 individual registrations from 82 countries, as well as an enhanced usage with over 40, 000 accesses to the DB-ALM through the internet during the last calendar year. DB-ALM is, for example, referenced in OECD Test Guidelines and Guidance documents; scientific books and cited in scientific article, in addition to website references of <b>relevant</b> <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> in and outside of Europe.

40|$|Since 2010, five newly {{emerging}} economies collectively {{known as}} 'BRICS' (Brazil, India, Russia, China and South Africa) {{have caught the}} imagination, and scholarly attention, of political scientists, economists and development specialists. The prospect of a unified geopolitical bloc, consciously seeking to re-frame international (and global) health development with {{a new set of}} ideas and values, has also, if belatedly, begun {{to attract the attention of}} the global health community. But what influence, if any, do the BRICS wield in global health, and, if they do wield influence, how has that influence been conceptualized and recorded in the literature?; We conducted a systematic literature review in (March-December 2012) of documents retrieved from the databases EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, Global Health, and Google Scholar, and the websites of <b>relevant</b> <b>international</b> <b>organisations,</b> research institutions and philanthropic organisations. The results were synthesised using a framework of influence developed for the review from the political science literature.; Our initial search of databases and websites yielded 887 documents. Exclusion criteria narrowed the number of documents to 71 journal articles and 23 reports. Two researchers using an agreed set of inclusion criteria independently screened the 94 documents, leaving just 7 documents. We found just one document that provided sustained analysis of the BRICS' collective influence; the overwhelming tendency was to describe individual BRICS countries influence. Although influence was predominantly framed by BRICS countries' material capability, there were examples of institutional and ideational influence - particularly from Brazil. Individual BRICS countries were primarily 'opportunity seekers' and region mobilisers but with potential to become 'issue leaders' and region organisers.; Though small in number, the written output on BRICS influence in global health has increased significantly since a similar review conduct in 2010 found just one study. Whilst it may still be 'early days' for newly-emerging economies influence in global health to have matured, we argue that there is scope to further develop the concept of influence in global health, but also to better understand the ontology of groups of countries such as BRICS. The BRICS have made a number of important commitments towards reforming global health, but if they are to be more than a memorable acronym they need to start putting those collective commitments into action.
