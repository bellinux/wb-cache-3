40|$|Altered multisensory {{integration}} {{has been}} reported in autism; however, little is known concerning how the autistic brain processes spatio-temporal information concerning tactile stimuli. We report a study in which a crossed-hands illusion was investigated in autistic children. Neurotypical individuals often experience a subjective <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> temporal order <b>judgments</b> when their hands are stimulated while crossed, and the illusion is known to be acquired in early childhood. However, under those conditions where the somatotopic representation is given priority over the actual spatial location of the hands, such reversals may not occur. Here, we showed that a significantly smaller illusory reversal was demonstrated in autistic children than in neurotypical children. Furthermore, in an additional experiment, the young boys who had higher Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores generally showed a smaller crossed hands deficit. These results suggest that rudimentary spatio-temporal processing of tactile stimuli exists in autistic children, and the altered processing may interfere with the development of an external frame of reference in real-life situations...|$|R

5000|$|In {{this case}} I think an {{exercise}} of pendent-party jurisdiction over Symm would be demonstrably wrong under Aldinger, supra, and Owen, supra. The civil action created by § 1973bb is plainly limited to suits brought against States and political subdivisions. Accordingly, the special grant of three-judge-court jurisdiction contained in the statute is similarly limited. The other jurisdictional statutes invoked by the United States provide no independent basis of three-judge-court jurisdiction over Symm. Since the District Court could, in my opinion, have quite readily attributed Symm's actions as voting registrar to Waller County, a party statutorily authorized to be named and in fact named as a defendant, I would reverse the judgment against Symm and remand {{the case to the}} District Court for further proceedings against the county. While the injunctive relief ordered against Symm is contrary to Aldinger, supra, and Owen, supra, injunctive relief against Waller County, if the District Court decides such relief is appropriate, would be fully authorized and equally efficacious in vindicating the right of Prairie View students. In the absence of such relief, I would think that any student could bring an action against Symm under 28 U. S. C. § 1343. This analysis may all seem very [...] "legalistic" [...] and [...] "technical," [...] but since the case is here on direct appeal, {{we have no choice but}} to examine the question of federal jurisdiction. Upon such examination, I believe Aldinger, supra, and Owen, supra, require <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>judgment</b> entered by the District Court.|$|R

I cannot but think that the early editions of Shakspeare and Milton would have met with more rapid and general acceptance, but for the barrenness of their respective title-pages; and I believe that, even now, a publisher of the works of either of those justly distinguished men would find his account in procuring their admission to the membership of learned bodies on the Continent,--a proceeding no whit more incongruous than the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>judgment</b> against Socrates, when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond the reach of antidotes, and when his memory had acquired a deserved respectability.

5000|$|On September 10, 2014, {{in a split}} {{decision}} by a three-judge panel, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's order dismissing Rudin’s federal habeas corpus case despite what it acknowledged to be serious issues with her representation and prosecution, both pre- and post-conviction. The Court deemed that it was compelled to deny her petition, {{while at the same}} time acknowledging that it was [...] "troubled" [...] by the case. Excerpts from the Opinion's Conclusion:We are troubled by the outcome of this case for many reasons. Margaret Rudin's direct appeal and collateral review proceedings have been pending in either state or federal court for a combined total of 13 years. She has potentially meritorious claims that she has suffered prejudice at the hands of her own attorneys' egregious misconduct. Yet she has never had an opportunity to present those claims in court.Rudin’s defense counsel, Amador, indisputably engaged in egregious professional misconduct during the course of her underlying criminal trial. On direct appeal <b>of</b> her <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> conviction, the Nevada Supreme Court acknowledged that Rudin’s trial was plagued not only with inadequacies on the part of defense counsel, but also with prosecutorial misconduct and legal error on the part of the State and the court. Although two members of the Nevada Supreme Court found the record sufficiently clear as to the “inherent prejudice created by counsel” to require immediate <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> Rudin’s <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> conviction, a majority of the court declined to address the effect of those errors, finding them more appropriate for resolution on collateral review.At this point, Rudin is still in prison, having served 13 years of her life sentence for murder. We know from the state post-conviction court that the State’s “proof of guilt that trial was not a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination.” We also know from the post-conviction court that, had Rudin been represented by competent counsel, the jury’s verdict may have been different. Thus, what we do not know is whether Rudin is lawfully imprisoned. And, regrettably, that is something we may never know.|$|R
40|$|Like {{a ghostly}} specter, modernity's {{greatest}} art form, cinema, haunts and invades Salman Rushdie's critical {{as well as}} creative corpus. The haunting presence is not limited just to cinema's visual presence; it is there through its sonic style as well. No better proof of this is available than in Rushdie's own notes and papers. In the Emory University Salman Rushdie archive, ten great films are mentioned on a single typed sheet (written quite possibly at the time Rushdie had finished a first draft of The Satanic Verses [1988] – that is, in February–March 1988). The films noted on Rushdie's list were made between 1954 and 1965 – a period marked by a modernist, cosmopolitan, art-house aesthetics that pushed the European avant-garde (with its surrealist foundations) to the limit. One of the striking features of these films, which include Fellini's 8 ½(1963) and Godard's Alphaville (1965), is the space given to cities. But their representation is not simply visual; there is a symphonic architecture about them, as music both mediates and provides extradiegetic acoustics for the mechanical sounds of the city (cars, trains) and the organic sounds of the human world. Visual literalism works with sonic literalism as cities reconfigure cinema aesthetics. Rushdie's Emory list, with its avant-garde, city bias, resurfaces in The Satanic Verses as it receives near replication in Saladin Chamcha's list of his favorite films. Responding to Gibreel Farishta, Saladin Chamcha (“Spoono”) offers a list of films that are all “conventional cosmopolitan”: “Potemkin, Kane, Otto e Mezzo, The Seven Samurai, Alphaville, El Angel Exterminador. ” Gibreel is critical of Saladin's choices (“You've been brainwashed…. All this Western art-house crap,” he says) because his own “top ten of everything came from ‘back home,' and was aggressively lowbrow. Mother India, Mr India, Shree Charsawbees. ” In a curious <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgment,</b> Gibreel tells Saladin that his conventional cosmopolitan choice reflected a head “so full of junk… you forgot everything worth knowing” (454) [...] ...|$|R
