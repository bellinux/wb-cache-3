Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near Shutter <b>Rock</b> <b>on</b> the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding out where they were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream {{was a major}} {{commercial}} success. The {{strong influence}} of heavy metal and progressive <b>rock</b> <b>on</b> the album helped to legitimize alternative rock to mainstream radio programmers and {{close the gap between}} alternative rock and the type of rock played on American 1970s Album Oriented Rock radio.|$|E

5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone <b>Rock,</b> <b>on</b> the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E
5|$|During summer 2009, Billy Talent toured North America with Rise Against and Rancid. On February 26, {{the band}} was {{announced}} for Download festival in the U.K. They also played in Columbus, Ohio at <b>Rock</b> <b>on</b> the Range in May 2009. During the Melbourne Soundwave show, Kowalewicz announced they would tour Australia again in August. Billy Talent also played at Reading and Leeds Festivals 2009. Following the twin festivals the band toured the U.K. in late October/early November {{before moving on to}} tour the U.S. in support of their new album. In an interview with UpVenue, bassist Jonathan Gallant announced that the Canadian tour would begin in winter 2010 but would be an extensive one.|$|E

5|$|In {{support of}} the Welcome to the Universe Tour, Thirty Seconds to Mars hosted an episode of MTV2's T-Minus <b>Rock</b> <b>on</b> October 25, 2006 at the MTV Studios, Times Square in New York City. MTV Overdrive {{streamed}} a tour diary featuring the band's experiences with footage recorded at various concerts. MTV2 filmed a special of the Welcome to the Universe Tour depicting Thirty Seconds to Mars, Head Automatica and Cobra Starship, which aired on November 4, 2006. It also recorded a television special featuring the bands touring alongside Thirty Seconds to Mars. Footage recorded during the Welcome to the Universe Tour was released on the deluxe edition of the band's album A Beautiful Lie on December 5, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{work began}} on the <b>rock</b> <b>on</b> 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the sailing vessel Pharos and began to unload the barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock. After only two days the site had to be {{abandoned}} as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume the punishing schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4am and 8pm. Fearing sea sickness, many of the man preferred to attempt {{to sleep on the}} damp rocks than on the ever-rolling Pharos.|$|E
5|$|The album's cover art {{and track}} listing were {{released}} on July 8, 2008. Slipknot began its All Hope Is Gone World Tour the following day—the tour {{was their first}} since 2005. The band initially toured with the Mayhem Festival across the United States, through August 16, 2008. Afterward, Slipknot was scheduled to appear at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in England, the Two Days a Week Festival in Austria, and the Area4 Festival in Germany. However, the European tour dates were canceled due to Jordison breaking his ankle. Slipknot performed at the <b>Rock</b> <b>on</b> the Range Festival on May 16 and 17, 2009 then headlined the Download Festival in England during the summer, {{the first time they}} had headlined the festival.|$|E

40|$|Access to the {{interior}} of <b>rocks</b> <b>on</b> Mars is an important goal for understanding Mars petrology and geologic history. The spectral signature of the potentially diverse mineralogy of <b>rocks</b> <b>on</b> Mars is veiled by the ubiquitous dust and may be further hidden by weathered rind. We have developed a rock crusher and sample distribution system {{under the auspices of}} NASA s PIDDP program. We call it the SPADE : the Sample Processing and Distribution Experiment. Its purpose is to access {{the interior}}s of <b>rocks</b> <b>on</b> Mars and prepare samples for analysis by a suite of in situ instruments...|$|R
5|$|The {{context-sensitive}} button mechanic {{allows one}} button {{to serve a}} variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the <b>rock</b> <b>on</b> the ground if he is standing still.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the adult}} Guianan cock-of-the-rock {{consists}} mainly of fruits meaning they are frugivorous. Up to 65 species of fruit {{have been reported in}} their diet, primarily from canopy trees or lianas. Three quarters (75%) of the fruit eaten by the Guianan cock-of-the-rock at one study site were either black- or red-coloured fruit. In the British Guiana, Thomas E. Gilliard found papayas growing {{at the base of a}} huge <b>rock.</b> <b>On</b> top of the rock were perched females that were nesting. He found that no other papayas were growing in that part of the forest and speculated that the perched females ate papayas in the forest where they are native and dropped the seeds below where they were nesting.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Grand Canyon area {{includes}} one of {{the most}} complete and studied sequences of <b>rock</b> <b>on</b> Earth. The nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers exposed in the Grand Canyon and in the Grand Canyon National Park area range in age from about 200million to nearly 2billion years old. Most were deposited in warm, shallow seas and near ancient, long-gone sea shores in western North America. Both marine and terrestrial sediments are represented, including fossilized sand dunes from an extinct desert. There are at least 14 known unconformities in the geologic record found in the Grand Canyon.|$|E

5|$|The sea otter's use {{of rocks}} when hunting and feeding makes {{it one of}} the few mammal species to use tools. To open hard shells, it may pound its prey with both paws against a <b>rock</b> <b>on</b> its chest. To pry an abalone off its rock, it hammers the abalone shell using a large stone, with {{observed}} rates of 45 blows in 15 seconds. Releasing an abalone, which can cling to rock with a force equal to 4,000 times its own body weight, requires multiple dives.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{runs through}} {{an area with}} complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsnøy Basement <b>Rock</b> <b>on</b> the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the {{creation}} of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to mylonite. In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro. At the lowest point, the tunnel runs through a section of phyllite, which continues to be the dominant species until the tunnel reaches Otterøya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises again through more phyllite.|$|E
5|$|Two {{films of}} the concert tour were made. The Guns, God and Government DVD was {{released}} on October 29, 2002 by Eagle Rock Entertainment, and featured live footage taken from several different performances in Los Angeles, Russia, Japan, and throughout Europe. It also included a 30-minute behind-the-scenes featurette, The Death Parade, with guest appearances from Ozzy Osbourne and Eminem. This was followed seven years later by a Blu-ray titled Guns, God and Government – Live in L.A. Released by Eagle <b>Rock</b> <b>on</b> November 17, 2009, it depicts the band's entire sixteen-song set from their January 13, 2001 performance at the Grand Olympic Auditorium—the final headlining show of the North American leg of the tour.|$|E
