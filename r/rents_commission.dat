50|$|Another {{factor that}} lead to the class discontent was the {{emergence}} of a landed intermediate class of lesser nobles (Chowdhurys and Taluqdars), whose existence contrary to the rules of the Permanent Settlement. The madhyasvatvas or intermediate interests acquired their rights by purchase, and not inheritance. According to the law, theses madhyasvatvas did not exist. The law courts were giving conflicting judgements as regards the rights and liabilities of the intermediate classes and also of the peasants. The government tried to accommodate this class by enacting the Rent Act in 1859. To improve relations between landlord and tenant, a <b>Rent</b> <b>Commission</b> was set up in 1880. By the recommendations and observations of the <b>Rent</b> <b>Commission,</b> the Bengal Legislative Council enacted Act III of 1885 which defined rights and obligations of intermediate tenancies and raiyati tenancies. In 1905, Bengal was partitioned and then the Government of India Act of 1919 and 1935 were enacted. Finally in 1947, Bengal was further partitioned once again before the Indian Independence Act 1947 was enacted that separated the old Indian Empire into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Dominion of India in the month of August of the same year.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the prime}} {{differences}} between traditional real estate and internet real estate is often, {{the absence of the}} middleman, known as a broker or a real estate agent. At times, real estate agents may be present, still dealing with customers directly from the web. Real estate agents often profit by absorbing a certain percentage of the final sale or <b>rent</b> price as <b>commission.</b> There are cases where commission percentage hits a figure of 6% in America. Internet real estate reduces the cost of an agent and conserves time spent relaying amongst three parties.|$|R
25|$|The Harbour Commission's {{plans to}} expand the usage of the airport ran into {{opposition}} at Toronto City Council, which reversed its support of the expansion and withheld a building permit for the Harbour Commission to build the new terminal.

5000|$|In Coachella's early years, art {{was mostly}} {{recycled}} {{from the previous}} year's Burning Man festival, due to smaller budgets. Between 2010 and 2015, Goldenvoice shifted its focus from <b>renting</b> pieces to <b>commissioning</b> them specifically for the festival, increasing their budget. Artists are given access to the grounds just 10 days before the festival, giving them a tight timeframe in which to assemble their pieces. Due to {{the high cost of}} re-assembly, only about half of them appear again outside of Coachella. Describing the festival's importance to art, Cynthia Washburn of art collective Poetic Kinetics said, [...] "With all the exposure here, I think Coachella is becoming as attractive for artists as it is for the musicians." [...] In 2013, Clemente considered about 300 art proposals, the most in the festival's history for the time. Poetic Kinetics has designed several giant moving art installations for past Coachella festivals, including a snail in 2013, an astronaut in 2014, and a caterpillar that [...] "metamorphosized" [...] into a butterfly in 2015.|$|R
5000|$|Al-Bayoumi met {{the hijackers}} at a {{restaurant}} after their landing; he claims he met them by accident. He invited the two hijackers to move to San Diego with him, and they did. Al-Bayoumi found them an apartment, co-signed the lease, and advanced them $1,500 {{to help pay for}} their <b>rent.</b> The 9/11 <b>Commission,</b> however, concluded that [...] "neither then nor later did Bayoumi give money to either Hazmi or Mihdhar." [...] Al-Bayoumi also helped the two obtain driver's licenses, rides to Social Security, and information on flight schools. Al-Bayoumi says he was being kind to fellow Muslims in need, and had no idea of their plans. But according to Newsweek magazine a former top FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, [...] "We firmly believed that he had knowledge the 9/11 plot, and that his meeting with them that day was more than coincidence." [...] Other FBI officials, however, concluded that al-Bayoumi was not a witting accomplice of the hijackers. [...] As one FBI official explained, [...] "We could not find any contact between him and terrorists, any involvement (with al-Qaeda). There was nothing to indicate he's any different from any of the hundreds of people who had contact with the hijackers, who were unwitting {{to the fact that they}} were going to be hijackers. It just wasn't there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Beyond business, Arthur Lundrigan was {{a leading}} adviser to Premier Joseph Smallwood and in 1969 there was {{speculation}} {{that he would be}} a strong contender to succeed Smallwood if he chose to run, being publicly mentioned as a potential successor by the then-Premier himself. [...] This connection was not without controversy, however. In 1972 a Royal Commission was appointed by newly elected Premier Frank Moores to investigate allegations that the liquor commission was paying [...] "exorbitant" [...] rents, which was chaired by former Lieutenant-Governor Fabian O'Dea. The Commission's report in July 1972 found that Premier Smallwood, Lundrigan, and former deputy minister Oliver Vardy were shareholders in a company that held seven buildings being rented to the liquor corporation. [...] A week later two of Moores' ministers traveled to Toronto to meet with John Robinette to advise on what action could be taken against the implicated parties. [...] No charges were ever brought. While Oliver Vardy would later be charged with fraud, breach of public trust, and accepting kickbacks for separate scandals, no charges were ever brought against Lundrigan or against anyone related to the Royal Commission's findings on liquor <b>commission</b> <b>rents.</b> Premier Moores was even reported as saying that had he known what would have come of the commission he would never have appointed it in the first place.|$|R
