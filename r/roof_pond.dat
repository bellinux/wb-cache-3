A basic system consists of a roof-mounted water bladder with a movable insulating cover. This system can control heat exchange between interior and exterior environments by covering and uncovering the bladder between night and day. When heating is a concern the bladder is uncovered during the day allowing sunlight to warm the water bladder and store heat for evening use. When cooling is a concern the covered bladder draws heat from the building's interior {{during the day and}} is uncovered at night to radiate heat to the cooler atmosphere. The Skytherm house in Atascadero, California uses a prototype <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> for heating and cooling.|$|E

5000|$|In the summer, a <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> system cools the {{building}} {{during the day}} using a shading insulator, or [...] "shinsulator" [...] to reflect solar energy away from the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> and minimize the heat gathering that occurs. At night, the shinsulator can be retracted to allow the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> to release stored energy into the environment. Throughout the winter, the system {{can be used to}} heat {{the building}} by absorbing solar energy during the day with the shinsulator retracted. At night, the shinsulator can be repositioned over the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> to minimize heat loss to the environment, allowing gathered energy to radiate into the building.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{construction}} industry, the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) defines <b>roof</b> <b>ponding</b> as [...] "water that remains on a roof surface longer than 48 {{hours after the}} termination {{of the most recent}} rain event".|$|R
50|$|Ponding is the (typically) {{unwanted}} pooling of water, typically {{on a flat}} <b>roof</b> or roadway. <b>Ponding</b> water accelerates {{the deterioration}} of many materials, including seam adhesives in single-ply roof systems, steel equipment supports, and particularly roofing asphalt. On low-slope asphalt <b>roofs,</b> <b>ponding</b> water allows the oil solvent components of the asphalt to leach out and evaporate, leaving the roof membrane brittle and susceptible to cracking and leaking in the ponding location.|$|R

Through deliberate research in literature, field work and analytic work in form of thermal simulations, it is shown that thermal comfort can be achieved by means of nocturnal convective cooling and <b>roof</b> <b>ponds.</b> Additionally the cooling loads are reduced by 87 % in the case of night time cooling...|$|R
50|$|A <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> {{passive solar}} system, {{sometimes}} called a solar roof, uses water stored {{on the roof}} to temper hot and cold internal temperatures, usually in desert environments. It typically is constructed of containers holding 6 to 12 in (150 to 300 mm) of water on a flat roof. Water is stored in large plastic bags or fiberglass containers to maximize radiant emissions and minimize evaporation. It can be left unglazed or can be covered by glazing. Solar radiation heats the water, which acts as a thermal storage medium. At night or during cloudy weather, the containers can be covered with insulating panels. The indoor space below the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> is heated by thermal energy emitted by the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> storage above. These systems require good drainage systems, movable insulation, and an enhanced structural system to support a 35 to 70 lb/ft2 (1.7 to 3.3 kN/m2) dead load.|$|E
50|$|Direct radiant cooling - In a {{building}} designed to optimize direct radiation cooling, the building roof {{acts as a}} heat sink to absorb the daily internal loads. The roof acts as the best heat sink {{because it is the}} greatest surface exposed to the night sky. Radiate heat transfer with the night sky will remove heat from the building roof, thus cooling the building structure. Roof ponds are an example of this strategy. The <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> design became popular with the development of the Sky thermal system designed by Harold Hay in 1977. There are various designs and configurations for the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> system but the concept is the same for all designs. The roof uses water, either plastic bags filled with water or an open pond, as the heat sink while a system of movable insulation panels regulate the mode of heating or cooling. During daytime in the summer, the water on the roof is protected from the solar radiation and ambient air temperature by movable insulation, which allows it to serve as a heat sink and absorb the heat generated inside through the ceiling. At night, the panels are retracted to allow nocturnal radiation between the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> and the night sky, thus removing the stored heat. In winter, the process is reversed so that the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> is allowed to absorb solar radiation during the day and release it during the night into the space below.|$|E
50|$|A shading insulator, or shinsulator, is used {{to cover}} a thermal mass (e.g. <b>roof</b> <b>pond)</b> and {{insulate}} the thermal mass as needed, either by re-radiating escaping heat back down towards the thermal mass, or by reflecting solar heat off the panel, reducing heat gathering by the thermal mass.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{function}} of the cladding system {{is to provide a}} weathertight building envelope, suitable for the intended use of the building.Trapezoidal metal roof sheets with through fix fasteners are generally suitable for slopes of 4% or steeper. This limit is critical to the performance of the cladding. For shallower pitches, down to 1.5%, a fix system with no exposed through fasteners, special side laps and preferably no end laps should be used. For low pitch <b>roof,</b> <b>ponding</b> is a potential problem that must be considered at the design stage {{in order to avoid the}} deleterious effects of prolonged soaking and the increased loading, due to the weight of the water.|$|R
50|$|With {{the angles}} of {{incidence}} of sunlight during the day, roof ponds are only effective for heating at lower and mid-latitudes, in hot to temperate climates. <b>Roof</b> <b>pond</b> systems perform better for cooling in hot, low humidity climates.

40|$|A {{passive solar}} heating and cooling {{technique}} with a sizable potential impact but lacking widespread recognition is the <b>roof</b> <b>pond.</b> Much testing and evaluation of <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> systems occurred during the 1970 's and 1980 's. In 1984 {{much of the work}} in roof ponds was summarized in a book by Rockwell International (1). For various reasons none of the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> systems which can survive severe climates requiring cooling and heating have not been widely accepted. In 1982, a variant of traditional roof ponds was codeveloped by Richard Bourne of the Davis Energy Group and Bing Chen. The Nebraska Modified <b>Roof</b> <b>Pond</b> (NMRP) would retain the advantages of traditional roof ponds while obviating marry of the concerns associated with them. Construction of a test room began in the spring of 1982 and was completed during that summer. Since that time the NMRP has been undergoing a series of tests and evaluations This paper presents the results from an analysis of the hourly cooling results and seeks to separate the radiative from the convective-evaporative component. The test room was set up as a calorimeter so that the total cooling could be readily ascertained while the water temperature of the pond is fixed.

40|$|The {{phase change}} {{of water from}} liquid to vapor {{is one of the}} most {{energy-intensive}} physical processes in nature, giving it immense potential for cooling. Diverse evaporative cooling strategies have resulted worldwide, including <b>roof</b> <b>ponds</b> and sprinklers, courtyard fountains, wind catchers with qanats, irrigated green roofs, and fan-assisted evaporative coolers. These methods all require water in bulk liquid form. The evaporation of moisture that has been sorbed from the atmosphere by hygroscopic materials is equally energy-intensive, however, yet has not been examined for its cooling potential. In arid and semi-arid climates, hygroscopic earth buildings occur widely and are known to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures, but evaporation of moisture from their walls and roofs has been regarded as unimportant since water scarcity limits irrigation and rainfall; instead, their cool interiors are attributed to well-established mass effects in delaying the transmission of sensible gains. Here, we investigate the cooling accomplished by daily cycles of moisture sorption and evaporation which, requiring only ambient humidity, we designate as “intrinsic” evaporative cooling. Connecting recent soil science to heat and moisture transport studies in building materials, we use soils, adobe, cob, unfired earth bricks, rammed earth, and limestone to reveal the effects of numerous parameters (temperature and relative humidity, material orientation, thickness, moisture retention properties, vapor diffusion resistance, and liquid transport properties) on the magnitude of intrinsic evaporative cooling and the stabilization of indoor relative humidity. We further synthesize these effects into concrete design guidance. Together, these results show that earth buildings in diverse climates have significant potential to cool themselves evaporatively through sorption of moisture from humid night air and evaporation during the following day’s heat. This finding challenges the perception of limited evaporative cooling resources in arid climates and greatly expands the applicability of evaporative cooling in contemporary buildings to water-stressed regions...|$|R

The first experiment (fig. 1) was to test the overall response of the system by forcing the temperature in storage to a preset value and observe its decay / curve with ponding and spray.

The water in the <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> was heated electrically to about 500 C and then permitted to cool in various ways. With the pump on in experiments 1 and 2 the convection and evaporation losses were considerably larger than the radiative losses; at the elevated water temperatures the evaporative and convective losses were significantly higher than at the lower water temperatures; the convective-evaporative losses when ponding and ponding with spray are comparable. The losses from the system without active cooling strategies are mainly due to evaporation thru or refluxing in the cracks of the floating insulation and to convection...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} the periodic heat transfer through thermal storage walls and <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> systems subjected to periodic solar radiation and atmospheric air on one side and in contact with room air at constant temperature (corresponding to air-conditioned rooms) on the other. A one-dimensional heat conduction equation for temperature distribution in the walls and roof has been solved using the appropriate boundary conditions at the surfaces; explicit expressions for the periodic heat flux through storage walls and the roof have been derived. Numerical calculations for the periodic heat flux into the room have been made in order to assess the relative thermal performance of storage walls and <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> systems in both winter and summer. It is found that a thermal storage mass wall is preferable for longer heat storage times while a water wall is suitable for rapid heat dissipation into the living space. For New Delhi, a <b>roof</b> <b>pond</b> system comprised of water-concrete-insulation, in ascending order of thickness, in the summer and in descending order of thickness in the winter, is found to be most desirable, whereas a combination with an ascending order of thickness is more appropriate for a typical cold climate like that of Boulder, Colorado, USA. ...|$|E
