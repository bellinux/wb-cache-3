5|$|Recumbent bicycles. Long-wheelbase recumbents {{require a}} good <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> as the CG {{is near the}} rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{crossed the}} line to win his second race of the season, with Rosberg {{following}} him home in 2nd and Vettel completing the podium with 3rd. Pastor Maldonado had an eventful race. On lap 33, while running in seventh position ahead of teammate Romain Grosjean, he missed the pit entry and lost time, dropping several positions. He then proceeded to spin his car on lap 39 as he attempted {{to make up for}} lost time, and on lap 48 he had a collision with Jenson Button following a long battle for position, damaging his car and retiring with <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> failure a few laps later. The stewards later deemed Button to be at fault for the incident.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> cooling ducts are added, {{and a full}} NISMO tuned {{suspension}} is installed, including a hollow 17.3mm rear stabilizer bar from the NISMO performance division.|$|E
50|$|A {{proportioning}} valve {{may be used}} to reduce the pressure to the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> under heavy braking. This limits the <b>rear</b> <b>braking</b> to reduce the chances of locking up the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes,</b> and greatly lessens the chances of a spin.|$|R
50|$|A {{line lock}} is {{a device that}} allows the front brakes to lock {{independently}} of the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> via a switch. The device is an electric solenoid that controls a valve which allows the brakes to be controlled individually, this allows the front brakes to be locked and the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> to be open. This allows the driver to spin the rear wheels without wasting the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes.</b> This method {{is referred to as}} line lock and is popular among enthusiasts who like to do burnouts frequently.|$|R
50|$|For the 1921 Indianapolis 500 small <b>rear</b> wheels <b>brakes</b> {{only were}} fitted. Subsequently, Isotta Fraschini-type front wheel brakes {{actuated}} by hand lever, <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> actuated by right pedal.|$|R
25|$|Canada– Laws vary by province, and are {{controlled}} by highway and traffic acts. In Ontario and in Québec, a <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> is required, and not having one may subject the rider to a fine.|$|E
25|$|Control cables are routed along mounts {{on the top}} tube, or {{sometimes}} inside the top tube. Most commonly, this includes the cable for the <b>rear</b> <b>brake,</b> but some mountain bikes and hybrid bicycles also route {{the front and rear}} derailleur cables along the top tube.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} {{to place}} the front brake lever on the left in right-side-driving countries, and vice versa, because the hand on the side nearer {{the centre of the}} road is more commonly used for hand signals, and the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> can not pitch the bicyclist forward.|$|E

25|$|The Majestic's four-wheel Lockheed-servo-assisted Dunlop {{disc brakes}} were {{regarded}} as a first for a British production car. It was the first saloon car without any claim to a sportscar nature to be equipped with disc brakes. An emergency or handbrake was provided by fitting special pads to the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> discs which were operated by cables and rods.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{improvements}} in the chassis include Tokico radial brake calipers, allowing smaller discs and therefore lower unsprung weight, translating into superior handling. Increased front braking power necessitated a sturdier lower triple clamp. The <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> caliper {{was moved to the}} top of the disc, giving a cleaner visual appearance. New 17inch wheels were designed, using Bridgestone BT-015 radials taken almost directly from the GSX-R1000.|$|E
25|$|Equipped almost identically to CSX2522, {{this second}} example had {{aluminum}} valve covers, a tuned air cleaner, a Smiths heater, seat belts, front and <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> cooling ducts, a hood scoop, brake cooling scoops, side exhausts and a painted roll bar (2522’s roll bar was chromed). Suspension options included Koni shock absorbers, {{front and rear}} anti-sway bars, unpolished six-inch magnesium pin-drive wheels, and Goodyear Blue Streak Sports Car Special tires.|$|E

50|$|As in the Triumph 2000 model line, unitary {{construction}} was employed, as was fully independent suspension - MacPherson struts in front, semi-trailing arms at the <b>rear.</b> <b>Braking</b> was by front disc and <b>rear</b> drum <b>brakes,</b> while steering was power-assisted rack and pinion.|$|R
25|$|Newly {{available}} for the Mustang GT for 2010 were two performance packages. The 3.73 Axle Package featured higher performance front brake pads, a more aggressive 3.73:1 rear axle, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system. The Track Package featured higher performance front and <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> pads, stabilizer bars and rear lower control arms from the GT500, uniquely tuned shocks and struts, Pirelli summer tires (includes automatic upgrade to 19-inch wheels), a 3.73:1 rear axle with carbon plates in the differential, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system.|$|E
25|$|The {{front axle}} was drop forged {{as a single}} piece of {{vanadium}} steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated band brakes acting {{on the inside of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.|$|E
25|$|A {{rim band}} brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of a}} stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a <b>rear</b> <b>brake,</b> but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic brakeforce {{distribution}} (EBD or EBFD) or electronic brakeforce limitation (EBL) is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies {{the amount of}} force applied to each of a vehicle's wheels, based on road conditions, speed, loading, etc. Always coupled with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), EBD can apply more or less braking pressure to each wheel {{in order to maximize}} stopping power whilst maintaining vehicular control. [...] Typically, the front end carries the most weight and EBD distributes less braking pressure to the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> so the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> do not lock up and cause a skid. In some systems, EBD distributes more braking pressure at the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> during initial brake application before the effects of weight transfer become apparent.|$|R
50|$|Electronic brakeforce {{distribution}} varies {{the pressure to}} the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> during heavy load or hard braking, enhancing driver control.|$|R
50|$|The front brakes have a {{diameter}} of 309 mm and the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> have {{a diameter}} of 310 mm.|$|R
25|$|Both four-door {{sedan and}} five-door station wagon {{variants}} were available as before, although trim levels {{were limited to}} SLX and GS. The SLX was aimed at fleet markets, fitted with power steering, a radio cassette player, a remote boot and fuel cap release, and electric side-view mirrors. The sedan-only SLX V6 added four-wheel disc brakes over the 2.2 model's front-disc, rear-drum layout, with anti-lock brakes (ABS) on the V6 available as an option. Wagons without ABS fitted made do with a load-sensing valve mechanism to control <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> lock-up. The higher GS trim built on the SLX level, adding 60/40 split-fold rear seats, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, tachometer, central locking and a more luxurious interior upholstery style.|$|E
25|$|Sonic Super 4 is a {{race car}} concept that {{demonstrates}} Chevrolet's new small car performance potential, based on Sonic with Ecotec 1.4L turbo engine and six-speed manual transmission. It includes Chevrolet racing graphics, Carbon fiber lower splitter, Carbon fiber rocker panel extensions, Carbon fiber rear diffuser, Tinted headlamps and taillights, Concept Z-Spec high wing rear spoiler, Tow hooks, 18x7.5-inch satin black wheels with street-legal racing tires, SCCA-approved 1¾ -inch chrome moly roll cage, SCCA-approved inner and outer window nets, Z-Spec pedal kit, Racing instrumentation, Racing seat with five-point harness, Fire suppression system, Rearview camera system, Racing steering wheel with quick disconnect, Adjustable coil-over struts and spring kit, four-piston front brake calipers with two-piece drilled rotors, two-piston <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> calipers with one-piece drilled rotors, Low-restriction air intake and filter, Two-inch cat-back straight-pipe exhaust.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton was {{the fastest}} {{driver in the}} third (and final) {{practice}} session, which was held in chilly but bright weather conditions, {{with a time of}} one minute and 37.107; Rosberg struggled with a brake issue until the session's closing minutes and went faster in the first and second sectors but an untidy final sector caused by an glazed left <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> disc only allowed him to improve his best time by one thousand of a second and the result meant he was second-fastest. Massa was third-fastest; his teammate Bottas was fourth, Alonso fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Hülkenberg was seventh-quickest, Adrian Sutil eighth, Räikkönen ninth and Button completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Upon switching settings on his car's steering wheel, Hamilton spun under braking at turn 12, and Rosberg ran wide at the eleventh and twelfth corners. Vergne's session was prematurely ended when his engine cut out.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} include electric motor-based power steering, revised aerodynamics, low-rolling resistance 225/45R17 tyres, and electric actuation of the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Brakes: Brakes are {{controlled}} Wilwood six piston front and four piston <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> with controlled calipers, rotors and pedal box.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to make rear-wheel drive burnouts easier by installing [...] "line locks", devices which allow fluid pressure on the front brakes to be maintained while releasing the pedal to free the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes.</b> This is especially useful in a manual transmission vehicle, in which it can be quite difficult to manipulate the clutch, brake and gas pedals simultaneously. Line locks also reduce wear to the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes,</b> a common problem otherwise.|$|R
25|$|The 75 {{featured}} {{some unusual}} technical features, {{most notably the}} fact that it was almost perfectly balanced from front to rear. This was achieved by using transaxle schema — mounting the standard five-speed gearbox in the rear connected to the rear differential (rear-wheel drive). The front suspension was a torsion bar and shock absorber combination and the rear an expensive de Dion tube assembled with shock absorbers; these designs were intended to optimize the car's handling; moreover the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> discs were fitted at the centre of the rear axle, near the gearbox-differential group. The engine crankshaft was bolted directly to the two-segment driveshaft, which ran the length of the underside from the engine block to the gearbox and rotated at the speed of the engine. The shaft segments were joined with elastomeric 'doughnuts' to prevent vibration and engine/gearbox damage. The 2.0 L Twin Spark and the 3.0 Litre V6 were equipped with limited slip differential.|$|E
500|$|Klein held {{a patent}} (...) for an {{improved}} {{method of routing}} cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame. The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> cable through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.|$|E
500|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>brake</b> of {{an upright}} bicycle can only produce about 0.25g (~2.5m/s2) {{deceleration}} at best, {{because of the}} decrease in normal force at the rear wheel as described above. All such bikes with only rear braking are subject to this limitation: for example, bikes with only a coaster brake, and fixed-gear bikes with no other braking mechanism. There are, however, situations that may warrant rear wheel braking ...|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Wherrett courted {{controversy}} on Torque, {{after he}} raised issues about the <b>rear</b> <b>braking</b> on the HJ model Holden Kingswood.|$|R
50|$|After the race, Hamilton had {{to modify}} the cooling of the <b>rear</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{otherwise}} the car would never last the 24-hour period.|$|R
5000|$|A {{combined}} {{braking system}} (CBS), also called linked braking system (LBS), is a system for linking front and <b>rear</b> <b>brakes</b> on a motorcycle or scooter. [...] In this system, the rider's action of depressing one of the brake levers applies both front and <b>rear</b> <b>brakes.</b> The amount of each brake applied may be determined by a proportional control valve.This is distinct from integrated brakes, where applying pressure to brake pedal only includes application of some front brake.|$|R
