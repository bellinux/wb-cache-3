Krishnamurti introduced Americans to an eclectic fusion of occultism consisting of [...] "Vedanta teachings of the divinity of the self" [...] infused with Western psychologies of self-reliance. D. T. Suzuki provided Americans with a foundational knowledge of Zen, a central aspect of Buddhist teachings. Both Krishnamurti and Suzuki provided SBNRs with the understanding that the essence of spirituality is comprised in the immediate, temporal and highly mystical experiences of human reality that paradoxically transcend the triviality of everyday existence. The goal of Zen is not to cause individuals to perceive a different sense of [...] "reality" [...] from their current one, but rather to awaken its practitioners to the sacred nature of temporality. Many SBNRs were drawn to Zen ideologies because their actualization can only be achieved through personal spiritual experiences rather than logical thought or rationality.|$|E
