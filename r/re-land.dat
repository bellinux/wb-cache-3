50|$|Millan has {{inspired}} several young researchers {{as a positive}} influence on women in the area of space physics. A former student and project manager for the SpaceX launch, Julianna Scheimann, made efforts to <b>re-land</b> the first stage booster and has worked for the SES-9 launch. Scheimann worked with Milan on the very early BARREL prototype payloads and conducted her senior thesis on the BARREL piggyback test flight.|$|E

25|$|Tortoise {{departed}} Plymouth on 26 October {{and arrived}} at Hobart on 19 February 1842, having travelled via the Cape. She had embarked 400 male prisoners, of which three were <b>re-landed</b> and three died on the voyage, and so disembarked 394. The 96th Regiment of Foot provided 103 officers and men {{to serve as the}} guard force. There were also some 50 soldiers' wives and children on board.|$|R
5000|$|The {{owner of}} any goods removed under the {{provisions}} of this regulation or his agent shall, if so required by the proper officer of customs, produce evidence that such goods have been exported or re-exported and shall pay the customs duty leviable on any part of such goods —:(a) not accounted for {{to the satisfaction of}} the proper officer of customs; or:(b) if they are found to have been illegally <b>re-landed</b> in Singapore.|$|R
5000|$|On August 10, 2019, Earth {{received}} a signal, which {{was confirmed by}} hundreds of different scientists to be from an alien life form. The message: [...] "Let us meet on Mars on July 7, 2035". With this, a space agency representing all of Earth was formed, named ST&RS. From there on, many different events occurred quite quickly, such as the <b>re-landing</b> {{of people on the}} moon in 2022 and the construction of many new space stations. Later on, the Space Academy was founded as a way to train upcoming generations of ST&RS.|$|R
50|$|The Boeing 757 {{left the}} runway at high speed, {{approximately}} 1000 m {{from the second}} touchdown point. It then ran 343 m across flat grassland beside the runway, before going diagonally over a substantial earth mound adjacent to the airport boundary, becoming semi-airborne as a result. Beyond the mound it hit a number of medium-sized trees and the right engine struck the boundary fence. The aircraft then passed through the fence, <b>re-landed</b> in a field and both main landing gears collapsed. It finally stopped after a 244 m slide across the field, 1900 m from the second touchdown.|$|R
60|$|That, in {{the room}} of all this, our cargo being well bought and well sorted, {{would come to the}} Philippine Islands at once, without any landing or <b>re-landing,</b> and without any of all the {{additions}} of charge to the first cost, as those by the way of New Spain had upon them; so that, if we were to sell them at the Philippine Islands a hundred per cent. cheaper than the Spaniards usually sold, yet we should get abundantly more than we could on the coast of Peru, though we had been allowed a free trade there.|$|R
60|$|AFTER the {{departure}} of the different detachments, or brigades, as they are called by the fur traders, the Beaver prepared for her voyage along the coast, and her visit to the Russian establishment, at New Archangel, where she was to carry supplies. It had been determined in the council of partners at Astoria, that Mr. Hunt should embark in this vessel, for the purpose of acquainting himself with the coasting trade, and of making arrangements with the commander of the Russian post, and that he should be <b>re-landed</b> in October, at Astoria, by the Beaver, {{on her way to the}} Sandwich Islands and Canton.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas {{was finally}} transported to Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania) on August 5th, 1837 out of Spithead aboard the ship Susan. The Ship Master was Henry Neatby {{and the ship}} surgeon was Edward Hilditch. The voyage lasted 108 days: 300 persons embarked, 1 <b>re-landed,</b> 6 died en route, and 293 were landed safely in Van Diemen's Land. The Surgeon's Report said that Thomas was “well behaved on Board". 2 The Con18 Description List of Male Convicts puts Thomas' height at 5'3". His {{complexion}} was [...] "fresh", his head and face [...] "round", his hair dark brown, his forehead [...] "high", his eyes grey and his nose small. It was noted that he had [...] "2 moles" [...] {{at the side of}} his cheek.|$|R
25|$|Re Fong Thin Choo (1991), {{involved}} regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, which {{stated that}} the owner of goods or his agent could be required by a customs officer to produce evidence that the goods had been exported or re-exported, and if the goods were not accounted for to the customs officer's satisfaction or {{were found to have}} been illegally <b>re-landed</b> in Singapore, the owner was liable to pay customs duty on them. The High Court held that the goods not having been exported was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require the owner to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|R
5000|$|On January 7, 2006, the Coast Guard found 15 Cubans who {{had climbed}} onto a piling {{on the old}} Seven Mile Bridge in the Florida Keys. The old bridge had been cut off from land because {{it was no longer}} in use and the United States Coast Guard argued that since the {{refugees}} could not walk to land, their feet were still [...] "wet". The decision to repatriate the Cubans was made by the Coast Guard's legal office in conjunction with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Coast Guard stated that the Cubans [...] "were determined to be wet-feet and processed in accordance with standard procedure." [...] In retaliation to the Cubans being returned, Ramón Saúl Sánchez led a hunger strike against the policy, and on January 18, the White House agreed to meet with Sánchez {{at some point in the}} near future. After eleven days, the hunger strike was ended, and Sánchez has yet to meet with White House officials. On February 28, 2007, a federal judge ruled that the United States government had acted unreasonably when it sent home the 15 Cubans. The judge ordered the government to make its best effort to help the immigrants return to the United States. Fourteen of the 15 Cubans <b>re-landed</b> on December 15, 2006 and were given migrant visas.|$|R
5|$|Only part of Captain King’s force, {{including}} 35 of Lieutenant Angus's 70 sailors, {{succeeded in}} making a landing at the Red House. Under fire from the defenders, the invaders charged Lieutenant Lamont’s detachment of the 49th Regiment. The sailors, armed with pikes and swords, closed in for hand-to-hand fighting. Lamont's troops drove back the attackers three times but King made a fourth assault which hit the British left flank and overwhelmed them; capturing Lamont and killing, taking or dispersing all of his men. The victorious Americans {{set fire to the}} post, spiked the guns and set off back to the landing-point, where they expected their boats to have <b>re-landed</b> in order to evacuate them. However, in the moonless darkness, King’s force became dispersed and split into two parties: one led by King and the other by Lieutenant Angus. Angus returned to the landing-point and found only four of the party’s ten boats there. Unaware that the six missing boats had not in fact landed, Angus assumed that King had already departed, and he re-crossed the river in the remaining boats. When King’s party reached the landing-point, they found themselves stranded. A search downriver found two unattended British boats, in which King sent half of his men, and the prisoners that he had captured, over the Niagara while he waited with his 30 remaining men for more boats to come from Buffalo and pick him up.|$|R
