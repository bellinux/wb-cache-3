25|$|In August 2008, the London Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy {{announced}} that {{the withdrawal of the}} bendy buses would take place, starting in 2009. So as to reduce additional costs to TfL, the buses would be withdrawn as their 5-year operating contracts came up for renewal, with the replacement types being decided by operators. Options for replacement would not preclude such measures as tri-axle buses. However, research has indicated that removing articulated vehicles may not be without cost; London Travel Watch undertook a study in September 2008 which found that to replace articulated vehicles on three bus routes, and maintain overall <b>route</b> <b>capacity,</b> would cost an additional Â£12.6m per annum, due to the additional vehicles necessitated.|$|E
2500|$|Haltom {{turned his}} {{attention}} to developing a system that could operate with shorter timings, thereby allowing the individual cars to be smaller while preserving the same overall <b>route</b> <b>capacity.</b> Smaller cars would mean less weight at any given point, which meant smaller and less expensive guideways. To eliminate the backup at stations, the system used [...] "offline" [...] stations that allowed the mainline traffic to bypass the stopped vehicles. He designed the Monocab system using six-passenger cars suspended on wheels from an overhead guideway. Like most suspended systems, it suffered from the problem of difficult switching arrangements. Since the car rode on a rail, switching from one path to another required the rail to be moved, a slow process that limited the possible headways.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1967, workers laid [...] of {{guideway}} rail {{for about}} $2.5million. The rails {{consisted of two}} I-beams for the running wheels, with an optional rack gear on the bottom that could be engaged to allow the cars to climb higher graded areas. The cars sat between the rails, hanging down between them, with doors on top that opened and closed automatically to keep the ore from falling out when in motion. Major portions of the network were enclosed in rectangular tubes {{to protect them from}} the elements, especially snow. The cars could be loaded at [...] without stopping, and traveled at up to [...] on straight sections of the track. Cars were normally linked to form small trains to increase <b>route</b> <b>capacity,</b> but could be detached to operate independently, all under the control of a single operator.|$|E

50|$|<b>Route</b> <b>capacity</b> {{is often}} {{calculated}} and {{applied in the}} management and design of rail systems. For railways with very high passenger loads, the maximum possible <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> is an important factor. A common unit for <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> is people per hour (pph), which can for metro style systems can {{be as high as}} 80,000. <b>Route</b> <b>capacity</b> can also be expressed as number of vehicles per hour, such as 20 trains per hour (tph). Route capacities in rail lines with two tracks are almost always the same in either direction.|$|E
50|$|Increasing <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> for a {{rail system}} {{requires}} substantial investment in infrastructure. Increasing <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> for a railway from, for example, 12 trains per hour, to 20 per hour, {{can be a}} very substantial project requiring substantial budgets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Route</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{the maximum}} number of vehicles, people, or amount of freight than can travel a given route in a given amount of time, usually an hour. It may be limited by the worst {{bottleneck}} in the system, such as a stretch of road with fewer lanes. Air traffic <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> is affected by weather. For a metro system, <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> is generally the capacity of each vehicle, times the number of vehicles per train, times the number of trains per hour (tph). In this way, <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> is highly dependent on headway. Beyond this mathematical theory, capacity may be influenced by other factors such as slow zones, single-tracked areas, and infrastructure limitations, e.g. to useful train lengths.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor the {{problems}} of evacuation with several exits under the limiting condition of fire smoke and <b>routes</b> <b>capacity,</b> an evacuation model combining of heuristic algorithm and network flow control was established in this study. Taking into account of <b>routes</b> <b>capacity</b> constraints, the aim of emergency evacuation is to minimize the total evacuation time for all people. The optimal evacuation path group, evacuation time {{and the number of}} evacuation in the evacuation network can be acquired through updating the evacuation network constantly and finding optimal routes iteratively. An example was presented to show the effectiveness and feasibility of this model and algorithm, and {{it can be used to}} explore the method to determine the optimal evacuation plan, while the actual routes inequality was not established...|$|R

50|$|Initial {{studies by}} the TRRL {{demonstrated}} <b>route</b> <b>capacities</b> greater than Cabtrack, less construction for the same capacity, and better fare box returns. The studies examined vehicles with 14 to 20 passengers running on elevated tracks with 30 second minimum headways, maximum speeds of 55 km/h and average speeds including stops of 40 km/h. Several potential development sites were considered, including London's Docklands area and between Croydon and New Addington.|$|R
50|$|Rail systems {{vary greatly}} in {{performance}} and <b>route</b> <b>capacity,</b> with metro systems having the highest capacity. Tram and light rail systems have in theory very high route capacities, {{but in practice}} route capacities of 12 trains per hour is a practical upper limit. For High Speed Rail a <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> of up to 18 trains per hour may be possible. The Punggol metro line in Singapore uses a moving block system to achieve a headway of 90 seconds, so the <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> is 40 trains per hour. <b>Route</b> <b>capacity</b> for a commuter rail system is typically around 12 to 16 trains per hour, which is lower than a metro, as the trains are longer, and the traffic is often mixed with other rail services such as freight and intercity trains. By contrast the Alameda Freight Corridor in Los Angeles has a <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> of 150 freight trains per day, which is high in comparison to other rail freight systems, but low compared to metros.|$|E
50|$|The <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> of freight rail {{systems is}} often {{limited by the}} {{terminal}} to which the freight is heading. Large terminals {{will be able to}} accept more freight trains, but a <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> of 15 freight trains per hour would be very unusual.|$|E

50|$|<b>Route</b> <b>capacity</b> {{depends on}} the number of {{passengers}} using a system, if only because this will affect the length of station stops. Much of the <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> in an existing rail system will be used for existing timetabled rail movements. This is described as used capacity. What capacity remains to be allocated to additional trains is called available capacity.|$|E

50|$|External factors affect <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> in {{different}} ways. Severely overcrowded highways {{will reduce the}} capacity of bus services. Severe snowfalls will reduce the capacity of highways and freeways, and high winds will make landing and departing airports difficult. In many cases <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> will vary day to day depending on external factors. Rail systems are more rarely affected by external factors.|$|E
50|$|The {{city bus}} routes are spread citywide {{and also to}} {{neighboring}} cities. Majority of city bus consist of ordinary route. Limited bus services which skips minor stops is used on Long <b>routes,</b> high <b>capacity</b> <b>routes</b> and routes that provides connectivity beyond Indore city. The buses have colour strips appended to routes. Green coloured buses connect Indore with Mhow. Some buses like yellow and orange go beyond Indore region to Pithampur and Gandhinagar area. Buses with magenta strip mostly serve BRTS and provide connection AB Road and buses coloured blue serve Rajwada region. The ICTSL uses CNG powered buses for its operation.|$|R
50|$|As {{traffic was}} {{increasing}} through the years, <b>Route</b> 2 <b>capacity</b> was overloaded, {{with plenty of}} vehicles and accidents.

50|$|The {{maximum speed}} or average speed of rail traffic {{will have no}} impact on the <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> where all train {{services}} are of the same type, and the stopping patterns are the same. Whilst slower trains will mean passengers take longer to reach their destination, the number of trains moving past a specific point will remain the same. <b>Route</b> <b>capacity</b> at a particular period of time can be observed by an observer standing on a station platform. A slower rail system will require more rolling stock to maintain a high throughput of trains. The speed of traffic will affect the required headway between trains (it is not simply proportional to the speed) and will thus affect the <b>route</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
50|$|For example, a headway of 4 minutes {{translates}} into a <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> of 15 trains per hour.|$|E

Discusses their use in other situations...|$|R
50|$|Stations in {{a railway}} system, and where train are {{required}} to stop to pick up or drop off passengers, serves to reduce the <b>route</b> <b>capacity.</b> This is particularly the case where trains of different stopping patterns are moving one after another through a rail system. Dwell time, known as layover in the US, is the time taken from the opening of train doors at a station, to their closing again. Dwell times strongly influence <b>route</b> <b>capacity</b> in a rail system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Route</b> <b>capacity</b> is maximised for any {{rail system}} {{when all the}} rail traffic is the same type. Mixing {{different}} types of trains, or even different stopping patterns, {{will result in a}} substantial reduction of capacity. Where different types of trains are mixed together this is sometimes called heterogeneity. In this context different types of trains means those that are slower than other trains, for example, freight and passenger trains. Freight trains often accelerate and brake more slowly than passenger, and have lower top speeds. Also passenger trains that have different stopping patterns, such as a local all stops service, when mixed with a limited or express service, will result in a reduction of <b>route</b> <b>capacity.</b> <b>Route</b> <b>capacity</b> is not lost where all the trains on one route stop at all stations, but only where trains with different stopping patterns are mixed together.|$|E
50|$|Adding {{additional}} <b>route</b> <b>capacity,</b> so {{the effect}} of bottlenecks is reduced. Capacity constraints are common in many transport systems, and adding capacity is normally {{an effective way to}} reduce delays.|$|E
50|$|On 3 October 2009, East Thames Buses {{was sold}} to London General, which {{included}} a five-year contract to operate <b>route</b> 108. Increased <b>capacity</b> will be introduced on route 108 in 2014.|$|R
25|$|When {{there is}} a bus driving on this <b>route,</b> the <b>capacity</b> of the lane will be more and will {{increase}} when the traffic level increases. And because the capacity of a light rail system is {{higher than that of}} a bus, there will be even more capacity when {{there is a}} combination of cars and light rail. Table 3 shows an example of peak passenger capacity.|$|R
50|$|Any {{assessment}} {{of the effectiveness of}} a transport network includes a calculation of what capacity is used, how it is used, and whether it is used effectively. For instance, overloaded routes may need to be upgraded, or capacity provided by other <b>routes.</b> Unused <b>capacity</b> can represent an opportunity to move more people or goods: as the capacity exists no additional investment is needed. Many transport networks have unused capacity.|$|R
