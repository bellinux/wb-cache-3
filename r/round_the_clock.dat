5|$|As well as {{maintaining}} its training program, No.1 OTU {{was required to}} periodically release instructors, students and aircraft for maritime patrols to protect Australian shipping lanes. In April 1943, six Hudsons were attached to No.32 Squadron at Camden, New South Wales, for convoy escort and anti-submarine duties. A year later, four Beauforts were deployed to Mount Gambier, South Australia, {{to carry out a}} two-day escort for the Dutch transport ship Van Ruys. Beauforts from No.1 OTU were also ordered to locate and destroy the German U-Boat U-862, which had shelled the Greek tanker Illosis off Kingston, South Australia, on 9December 1944. Although the submarine was not sunk, it was apparently frightened off by the presence of the Beauforts and aircraft from other RAAF units in the vicinity. No.1 OTU's intensive training regime included night flying, so that it operated almost <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> Flying effort reached a peak in August 1944, when 132 aircraft made 2,479 flights, instructing 221 students. The unit had by this time logged over 100,000 flying hours. It trained a total of 2,150 aircrew on Beauforts during the war, and suffered 147 aircraft accidents on instructional and operational fights in Australia and New Guinea, resulting in the loss of 131 aircrew killed or missing. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of all the RAAF's operational training units; No.1 OTU was dissolved in December 1945.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} {{development was}} the Zone Call procedure in 1915. By this time maps were 'squared' and a target location could be reported {{from the air}} using alphanumeric characters transmitted in Morse code. Batteries were allocated a Zone, typically {{a quarter of a}} mapsheet, and it was the duty of the RFC signallers on the ground beside the battery command post to pick out calls for fire in their battery's Zone. Once ranging started the airman reported the position of <b>the</b> ranging <b>round</b> using <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> code, <b>the</b> battery adjusted their firing data and fired again, and the process was repeated until the pilot observed an on-target or close <b>round.</b> <b>The</b> battery commander then decided how much to fire at the target.|$|R

5000|$|A {{technical}} knockout (TKO or T.K.O.), or stoppage, is declared {{when the}} referee or official ring physician decides that a fighter cannot safely continue the match. In boxing, for a KO to occur a fighter must fail {{to beat the}} count, so TKO refers to any situation when the referee, cornerman, physician, or fighter stops the fight any time during a round {{when there is no}} ten count, most notably when a fighter has been knocked down three times in one <b>round,</b> which ends <b>the</b> match in most regions. The referee can stop the fight at any time if they feel a fighter cannot safely continue, for example if a fighter has been down once and isn't doing enough to defend themselves when they get back up. In boxing, if a fighter is knocked down and the referee stops the bout without a count, this also counts as TKO. However, TKO can only occur when the fight is stopped by <b>the</b> referee, mid <b>round</b> while <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> is running or between <b>rounds</b> when <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> is stopped. <b>The</b> exception is if a fight is stopped between rounds by a fighter's corner pulling him out or the fighter quitting, this counts as [...] "referee technical decision" [...] (RTD) which, like TKO, counts as a knockout in a boxer's record. In both boxing and MMA the referee declares TKO when a fighter is not intelligently defending himself while being repeatedly struck. In amateur boxing, a knockout is scored as [...] "referee stopped contest" [...] (RSC), and a technical knockout ("outclassed") can also be declared if a fighter is behind by 15 points in a bout.|$|R

25|$|The Soviet Army's officer-to-soldier {{ratio was}} {{extremely}} top-heavy, partially {{in order to}} compensate for the relatively low education level of the military manpower base and the absence of professional NCOs. Following WorldWarII and the great expansion of officer education, officers became the product of four-to-five-year higher military colleges. As in most armies, newly commissioned officers usually become platoon leaders, having to accept responsibility for the soldiers' welfare and training (with the exceptions noted above). Young officers in Soviet Army units were worked <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> normally receiving only three days off per month. Annual vacations were under threat if deficiencies emerged within the unit, and the pressure created enormous stress. Towards the end of the Soviet Union, this led to a decline in morale amongst young officers.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Zhou Qun studied {{under the}} tutelage of his father and became well-versed in {{astronomy}} and divination. As he was born in a wealthy family with scores of servants, he built an observation tower in his residence, and ordered his servants to take shifts to observe the sky <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and keep him updated. Whenever there was something unusual, he would rush to the tower to see it for himself, regardless of whether it was in the day or at night. He was thus able to predict future events based on his observations. Sometime between 194 and 214, when Liu Zhang was the Governor of Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), he recruited Zhou Qun to serve in his administration as an Assistant Officer for Education (師友從事).|$|E

In the campaign since 22 June, it had accounted for 915 Soviet aircraft, 823 on the ground. Still, some 100,000 Red Army soldiers escaped by Kesselring's estimate.

As well as using his 101st and 104th motorised regiments, each with three heavy and one light battalion, supported the Second Panzer Army. It was used to protect the ground forces, and claimed 500 Soviet aircraft between the 22 August and 9 September, but was also used against ground targets. It claimed 360 Soviet vehicles in the same period.|$|E

500|$|From 1961 onwards, Card and USNS Core {{regularly}} docked in Saigon {{to unload}} heavy artillery, M-113 armored personnel carriers, aircraft, helicopters and ammunition for the South Vietnamese government.

To facilitate the arrival of Card and other American ships which pulled into Saigon, the South Vietnamese military often deployed navy vessels to conduct patrols around the port, while the surrounding shores were protected by an elite Army of the Republic of Vietnam ("ARVN") airborne battalion. The port itself was guarded <b>round</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> by South Vietnamese police, as undercover South Vietnamese agents operated across the river in the Thu Thiem area to disrupt Viet Cong activities there.
