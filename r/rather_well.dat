5|$|In rural Australia, meat ants are {{important}} to farmers as they place animal carcasses on their nests. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass will be consumed and reduced to bones. However, Iridomyrmex ants are sometimes considered pests, due to these ants entering human houses to feed on food and soil disturbance. Eradication of nests can be difficult, as nests can be repopulated from a rival colony or adjoining nests which were not affected. Particular species have adapted <b>rather</b> <b>well</b> to urbanisation; during the early days in Canberra, newly constructed suburbs provided new nest sites for meat ants, and populations flourished. Other factors include plantations enriched with valuable food sources and home gardens. Workers also cause problems {{for those who are}} Citrus producers; they will affect the biological control of Hemiptera insects, specifically those who produce honeydew.|$|E
25|$|Lucy {{is usually}} found with her sidekick {{and best friend}} Ethel Mertz. A former model from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Ethel tries to relive her glory days in vaudeville. Ricky is more {{inclined}} to include Ethel in performances at his nightclub because, unlike Lucy, she can actually sing and dance <b>rather</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{reputation}} for the contrary, the Salon d'Automne in 1905 was <b>rather</b> <b>well</b> {{received by the}} press, including critical praise for the Ingres and Manet retrospectives. The artists exhibiting were {{for the most part}} known, even the most innovative who a few months before exhibited at the Berthe Weill Gallery. However, a few critics reacted violently, both in the daily press aimed at a wide audience; and in the specialized press, some of whom were active advocates of symbolism, and vehemently detested the rise of the new generation.|$|E

50|$|The {{nineteen}} historically significant Capes are briefly described below.

All but four are actually within the municipal bounds of Wells; the others are in Ogunquit.|$|R
25|$|The Great Depression hit Italy very hard. As {{industries}} {{came close}} to failure they were bought out by the banks in a largely illusionary bail-out—the assets used to fund the purchases were largely worthless. This led to a financial crisis peaking in 1932 and major government intervention. The Industrial Reconstruction Institute (IRI) was formed in January 1933 and {{took control of the}} bank-owned companies, suddenly giving Italy the largest state-owned industrial sector in Europe (excluding the USSR). IRI did <b>rather</b> <b>well</b> with its new responsibilities—restructuring, modernising and rationalising as much as it could. It was a significant factor in post-1945 development. But it took the Italian economy until 1935 to recover the manufacturing levels of 1930—a position that was only 60% better than that of 1913.|$|E
25|$|Her {{remains were}} found in Vilnius Cathedral after a flood in 1931. To {{preserve}} her body during the long summer trip from Kraków to Vilnius, it was covered {{in a mixture of}} ash and burnt lime. While the wooden coffin rotted away, the lime hardened and formed a protective shell that preserved her bones <b>rather</b> <b>well.</b> She was buried with regal symbols (silver gilded crown, silver scepter, golden orb with a cross) and jewelry (long gold necklace, three gold rings; one of them, gifted to her by Sigismund Augustus, was covered with black vitreous enamel and had three stones – brilliant, ruby, and emerald). These and other artifacts were kept at Vilnius Cathedral, but they disappeared during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the turmoil}} {{brought on by}} the {{depression}} and new competition, the Reading Terminal Market remained afloat during the 1930s. By some accounts, the market did <b>rather</b> <b>well.</b> According to George H. Eltien, then superintendent, the market was shipping phone orders to 38 states, Canada, and Mexico throughout the decade. Pressure from supermarkets was not hurting all of the merchants. Ten of the market's 64 merchants had been there since its founding in 1892. In 1930, the Reading Terminal Market Merchants Association established as an effort to promote and advertise the market and avoid losing any more business. The Association was responsible for several promotional events including the first annual Food Show and Home Progress Exhibitions. It also helped to fund a 1934 renovation of the market's facade that installed new electric lights and window decorations.|$|E

[...] Following the destruction of educational systems and infrastructure during the civil war, many new educational institutions were opened by community members, private enterprises and Islamic NGOs.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were negative. Esther Howard {{wrote in}} The Spectator, [...] "Surprisingly Ian Fleming's {{new book is}} a romantic one and, except for some early sex in England (<b>rather</b> <b>well</b> done, this) only just as nasty as is needed to show how {{absolutely}} thrilling it is for... the narrator to be rescued from both death and worse – than by a he-man like James Bond. Myself, I like the Daphne du Maurier touch and prefer it this way but I doubt his real fans will." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{controversial}} 2007 video game, Manhunt 2, the main protagonist, Daniel Lamb, has been brainwashed {{and had his}} mind toyed with by 'The Project'. The failsafe phrase to wipe his mind clean is taken from 'The Tempest' being [...] "What seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time?" [...] Fitting <b>rather</b> <b>well</b> into the story as Daniel Lamb spends the storyline struggling to remember his past which had been cleared by Dr. Pickman. If Pickman speaks this phrase in its entire length, Daniel Lamb's brain will be wiped, killing him, therefore failing the episode.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, David Balls of Digital Spy {{was only}} {{moderately}} impressed {{and argued that}} [...] "Cole's vocals aren't terribly strong" [...] but that she had [...] "understated charm and lots of 'X Factor' exposure". Of the song itself he said [...] "Cole has taken the subtle approach on her first solo single. 'Fight For This Love' is a midtempo pop-R track with subdued, synthy production and an infectious hook that gnaws into the consciousness - albeit after a few listens." [...] Whilst Fraser McAlpine partially agreed [...] "In Cheryl's favour, she's obviously {{made an effort to}} record something that sounds different from the stuff she'd be making with Girls Aloud, and as a result this solo effort is an interesting pop/dance/R hybrid, which actually suits her <b>rather</b> <b>well,</b> style-wise." [...] However he too had issues with the voice [...] "It's just a shame it's not stronger," [...] pointing out some weaknesses, [...] "the best thing about the song is the bridge, which is sassy but vulnerable at the same time, and underpinned by a sweet melody, {{but the rest of the}} song can't match up: the verses are sluggish...".|$|E

2500|$|The long {{relatively}} peaceful {{period at}} the court under Philip the Good's reign ended with Philip's death in 1467, and under his successor Charles the Bold, the musical activities of the court were seriously disrupted; many of the singers and composers, including Hayne van Ghizeghem, took part in his many futile military campaigns.

2500|$|The [...] "Belle Époque" [...] Quarter in Bagnoles-de-l'Orne {{constitutes}} a <b>rather</b> <b>well</b> preserved {{example of what}} could be classed as a typical early 20th century French bourgeoise residential area. Built between 1886 and 1914 and located {{in the southern part of}} the town, it is filled with superb villas with polychrome façades, bow windows and unique roofing. Similar projects were developed throughout France at the same time, among which are Le Vésinet close to Paris, the Saurupt Park in Nancy and the [...] "Winter Town" [...] of Arcachon.|$|E
2500|$|His {{attitude}} toward the National Socialist regime in the late 1930s and early 1940s is difficult to understand. By his own account, {{he had been so}} influenced by the early Nazi promise of release from the post–World War I economic effects, that his patriotic feelings had increased. In a 1952 memoir article he admitted that, at that time, he [...] "fared relatively <b>rather</b> <b>well</b> under totalitarianism". Yet, he also wrote that [...] "to us, Hitler was still only a pompous fool with a Charlie Chaplin moustache" [...] and that he perceived him as [...] "another Napoleon" [...] who was [...] "wholly without scruples, a godless man who thought himself the only god".|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, {{he played}} President John F. Kennedy in {{an episode of}} the 1980s revival of The Twilight Zone, [...] "Profile in Silver". In 1988 he portrayed Liberace in a {{television}} biopic. With one of Robinson's acting trademarks being his effeminate voice, he was well suited for the part. Robinson had described {{it as one of}} his favorite roles and that [...] "The most fun was wearing his furs and jewelry and singing 'I'll be Seeing You.'" [...] The New York Times reviewer noted that [...] "Robinson does <b>rather</b> <b>well</b> in the leading role."
