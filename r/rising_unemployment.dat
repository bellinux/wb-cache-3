5|$|Although {{an urban}} revolt in Aleppo {{did not take}} place in the {{aftermath}} of the city's occupation by French forces, many of Aleppo's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu's rebels fighting in the rural areas west of the city. In addition to the rebels' propaganda campaign, anti-French sentiment in Aleppo was growing due to socio-economic factors. These included the disruption of trade routes between Aleppo and its countryside, the hoarding and profiteering of flour and <b>rising</b> <b>unemployment</b> that was partially a result of an influx of Armenian refugees who had fled their villages in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide. The latter led to soaring prices for bread and subsequent food riots and famine in some of the city's neighborhoods. The French authorities also declared martial law, restricting travel and speech, further frustrating the inhabitants.|$|E

Increased foreign competition began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses. <b>Rising</b> <b>unemployment</b> during the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s, and a significant economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford's population. By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and cotton spinning had by 1971 ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some issues}} {{in the theory of}} unemployment; proposes a framework for the analysis of unemployment; and applies the framework to the analysis of the <b>rise</b> in <b>unemployment</b> in Britain after 1979. The framework is based on bilateral monopoly in the labor market and the explanation for the <b>rise</b> in <b>unemployment</b> in Britain rests primarily with a demand-side shock, which caused the rise in 1980 - 81, and supply-side persistence, which has kept unemployment up since then.

5|$|The NWOBHM {{began as}} an {{underground}} phenomenon growing in parallel to punk and largely ignored by the media. It was only through the promotion of rock DJ Neal Kay and Sounds campaigning that it reached the public consciousness and gained radio airplay, recognition and success in the UK. The movement involved mostly young, white, male and working-class musicians and fans, who suffered the hardships brought on by <b>rising</b> <b>unemployment</b> for years after the 1973–75 recession. As a reaction to their bleak reality, they created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other's company and their favourite loud music. The NWOBHM was heavily criticised for the excessive hype generated by local media in favour of mostly talentless musicians. Nonetheless, it generated a renewal in the genre of heavy metal music and furthered {{the progress of the}} heavy metal subculture, whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after the spread of the music to continental Europe, North America and Japan.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April, MTV3 {{organised}} another debate, {{which featured}} the same four party chairpersons {{as the debate}} by the Finnish Broadcasting Company two weeks earlier; Katainen, Kiviniemi, Urpilainen and Soini. The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU-sponsored Portuguese bailout; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it, insisting that the bailout is {{necessary in order to}} assure the stability of the European economy and thus in the interest of Finland. Urpilainen and Soini were against the bailout, with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his stance that the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members. Soini also criticised the governing parties for using scare tactics in the form of threatening Finns with <b>rising</b> <b>unemployment</b> if the bailout fails to pass. On other issues, Katainen, as he had stated earlier, willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age, while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so. Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland's admission to NATO. However, even he said that the admission does not seem possible during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership.|$|E

Their workers, {{almost half of}} the industrial workforce, suffered from <b>rising</b> <b>unemployment.</b> In 1948–1949, a substantial share of Marshall Plan funds was used to subsidize imports of food. American money effectively raised real wages: the grain price was about one-third of the world price, while agriculture remained in ruins.

25|$|Prior to the Reagan administration, the United States economy {{experienced}} {{a decade of}} <b>rising</b> <b>unemployment</b> and inflation (known as stagflation).

The federal oil reserves were created to ease any future short term shocks. President Jimmy Carter began phasing out price controls on petroleum while he created the Department of Energy. Much {{of the credit for}} the resolution of stagflation is given to two causes: a three-year contraction of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board under Paul Volcker, initiated {{in the last year of}} Jimmy Carter's presidency, and long-term easing of supply and pricing in oil during the 1980s oil glut.|$|E

40|$|The {{sustained}} <b>rise</b> in German <b>unemployment</b> since 1973 poses {{a problem}} of critical importance for the world economy.

This paper investigates {{some of the reasons}} for the secular <b>rise</b> in <b>unemployment.</b> We find that while deficient aggregate demand can probably explain some of the current joblessness, the secular <b>rise</b> in <b>unemployment</b> has consisted primarily of an increase in the equilibrium rate of unemployment. We also find little evidence that this increase is due to changes in frictional unemployment. Rather, after reviewing institutional details of the labor market in Germany, we identify various impediments to the kinds of structural adjustments that have operated to maintain a fairly constant equilibrium rate of unemployment in the United States. ...|$|R
