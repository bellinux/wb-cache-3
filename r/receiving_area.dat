500|$|Treblinka II (officially the SS-Sonderkommando Treblinka) {{was divided}} into three parts: Camp 1 was the {{administrative}} compound where the guards lived, Camp 2 was the <b>receiving</b> <b>area</b> where incoming transports of prisoners were offloaded, and Camp 3 was {{the location of the}} gas chambers. All three parts were built by two groups of German Jews recently expelled from Berlin and Hanover and imprisoned at the Warsaw Ghetto (a total of 238 men from 17 to 35 years of age). Hauptsturmführer Richard Thomalla, the head of construction, brought in German Jews because they could speak German. Construction began on 10 April 1942, when Bełżec and Sobibór were already in operation. The entire death camp, which was either [...] or [...] in size (sources vary), was surrounded by two rows of barbed-wire fencing [...] tall. This fence was later woven with pine tree branches to obstruct the view of the camp. [...] More Jews were brought in from the surrounding settlements to work on the new railway ramp within the Camp 2 <b>receiving</b> <b>area,</b> which was ready by June 1942.|$|E
500|$|The work at Treblinka {{was carried}} out under threat of death by Jewish prisoners {{organised}} into specialised Sonderkommando squads or work details. At the Camp 2 Auffanglager <b>receiving</b> <b>area</b> each squad had a different coloured triangle. The triangles {{made it impossible for}} new arrivals to try to blend in with members of the work details. The blue unit (Kommando Blau) managed the rail ramp and unlocked the freight wagons. They met the new arrivals, carried out people who had died en route, removed bundles, and cleaned the wagon floors. The red unit (Kommando Rot), which was the largest squad, unpacked and sorted the belongings of victims after they had been [...] "processed". The red unit delivered these belongings to the storage barracks, which were managed by the yellow unit (Kommando Gelb), who separated the items by quality, removed the Star of David from all outer garments, and extracted any money sewn into the linings. The yellow unit was followed by the Desinfektionskommando, who disinfected the belongings, including sacks of hair from [...] "processed" [...] women. The Goldjuden unit ("gold Jews") collected and counted banknotes and evaluated the gold and jewellery.|$|E

500|$|The {{next section}} of Treblinka II (Camp 2, {{also called the}} lower camp or Auffanglager), was the <b>receiving</b> <b>area</b> where the railway {{unloading}} ramp extended from the Treblinka line into the camp. There was a long and narrow platform surrounded by barbed-wire fencing. A new building, erected on the platform, was disguised as a railway station complete with a wooden clock and fake rail terminal signs. SS-Scharführer Josef Hirtreiter {{who worked on the}} unloading ramp was known for being especially cruel; he grabbed crying toddlers by their feet and smashed their heads against wagons. Behind a second fence, about [...] from the track, there were two large barracks used for undressing, with a cashier's booth which collected money and jewellery, ostensibly for safekeeping. Jews who resisted were taken away or beaten to death by the guards. The area where the women and children were shorn of their hair {{was on the other side}} of the path from the men. All buildings in the lower camp, including the barber barracks, contained the piled up clothing and belongings of the prisoners. Next to the station building, further to the right, there was a Sorting Square where all baggage was first collected by the Lumpenkommando. It was flanked by fake infirmary called [...] "Lazaret", with the Red Cross sign on it. It was a small barracks surrounded by barbed wire where the sick, old, wounded and [...] "difficult" [...] prisoners were taken. Directly behind the [...] "Lazaret" [...] shack there was an open excavation pit seven metres (23ft) deep. These prisoners were led to the edge of the pit and shot one at a time by Blockführer Willi Mentz, nicknamed [...] "Frankenstein" [...] by the inmates. Mentz single-handedly executed thousands of Jews, aided by his supervisor, August Miete, who was called the [...] "Angel of Death" [...] by the prisoners. The pit was also used to burn old worn-out clothes and identity papers deposited by new arrivals at the undressing area.|$|E

5000|$|The {{auditory}} {{system of}} humans and animals allows individuals to assimilate information from the surroundings, represented as sound waves. Sound waves first pass through the pinnae and the auditory canal, {{the parts of the}} ear that comprise the outer ear. Sound then reaches the tympanic membrane in the middle ear (also known as the eardrum). The tympanic membrane sets the malleus, incus, and stapes into vibration. The stapes transmits these vibrations to the inner ear by pushing on the membrane covering the oval window, which separates the middle and inner ear. The inner ear contains the cochlea, the liquid-filled structure containing the hair cells. These cells serve to transform the incoming vibration to electrical signals, which can then be transmitted to the brain.The auditory nerve carries the signal generated by the hair cells away from the inner ear and towards the auditory <b>receiving</b> <b>area</b> in the cortex. The signal then travels through fibers to several subcortical structures and then to the primary auditory <b>receiving</b> <b>area</b> in the temporal lobe ...|$|E
