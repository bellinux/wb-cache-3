However, in future transmission systems the channels will be densely packed and tight filtering will be required for any in-line channel selection, e. g. to perform all-optical add-drop multiplexing or signal regeneration.

A dark-optical-comb generated by reshaping the optical clock RZ data in a Mach–Zehnder intensity modulator is employed as an injecting source to temporally deplete most of the gain in the SOA. Such a dark-optical-comb injected SOA decision-gate exhibits improved 3 R regeneration performances such as a timing tolerance of 33. 5 ps, a Q-factor of 8. 1, an input dynamical tolerance of 14 dB, and an extinction ratio (ER) of 14 dB. The deviation between the wavelengths of backward injected dark-optical-comb and input RZ data for optimizing the ER of the decision-gate is determined as ∆λ = 19 nm. Under a threshold operating dark-optical-comb power of 7 dBm, such a decision-gate can recover the − 18. 5 -dBm degraded RZ data with a bit-error-rate of less than 10 − 9 at 10 Gb/s.

40|$|Abstract: We {{demonstrate}} a modulation format transparent optical-arbitrary-waveform transmitter at 360 Gb/s including precompensation for dispersion. Proof-of-principle transmission of 9 -bit OOK and DPSK signals across a 10 -km SMF link are demonstrated with spectral efficiency of 0. 53 -b/s/Hz. Spectrally efficient, high-speed data transmission over conventional {{single mode fiber}} is desired for seamless up-grades to future networks. High-capacity transmissions typically require very high-speed electronics with dispersion compensation, or parallel modulations of multiple individual lasers on an integrated [1] or discrete platforms. Optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG) can provide waveforms of any shape in amplitude and phase. An example of an arbitrary waveform could be a simple chirped pulse used for LIDAR, or a very complex waveform like a Tb/s psuedo-random bit-sequence (PRBS) in an advanced modulation format. The transmitter is also cost-effective through parallel methodologies of the THz waveform generation process into GHz frequency electronics. Unknown amount of linear and high-order fiber dispersion can be pre-compensated for dispersion-penalty-free transmission over any fiber lengths. Recently, waveform shapers (WS) using bulk-optics or arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) have successfully created truly arbitrary waveforms using line-by-line Fourier synthesis[2, 3], which involved inde-pendent amplitude and phase modulations of individual spectral lines of an optical frequency comb (OFC).

At lower frequencies, a D-type flip-flop is used for this purpose, but due to feedback delays this is limited to operation at about 600 MHz. The circuit is in fact a reset-set flip-flop which has the attwibutes of a D-type flip-flop. The NRZ signal is sampled at its bit rate in a three transistor circuit (T 1,T 2,T 3). The signal is applied to one base (1), the bit rate pulse to another (2) and a reference voltage to the third (T 2). The result is a series of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> (<b>RZ)</b> pulses of one polarity which are then also inverted in a pnp-transistor cascade (T 4,T 5). Both polarities arrive at a summing junction (S) via time delays (t 1,t 2) and damping elements (D 1,D 2). The summed bipolar signal is applied to a Schmitt trigger circuit (T 6,T 7) acting as a differential amplifier with feedback, at whose output (3) the NRZ signal is replicated in cleaned up form. The feedback delay can be adjusted by a capacitor (C 1). The choice of transistor type assists in preventing internal oscillations, and the almost complete absence of internal feedback loops allows operation at the required frequency...|$|E
