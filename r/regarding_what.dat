5|$|<b>Regarding</b> <b>what</b> was our film Chandler, let's {{give credit}} where credit is due. We sadly {{acknowledge}} that all editing, post-production {{as well as}} additional scenes were executed by James T. Aubrey Jr. We are sorry.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} potential dangers {{of faith in the}} Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> could be a sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as glaucoma. Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, I do <b>regard</b> <b>what</b> you say; but {{you would}} not have me be false. Had you doubled the {{property}} instead of lessening it, I could not <b>regard</b> <b>what</b> you say any more." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{not angry}} with him, at first. I {{was willing to}} <b>regard</b> <b>what</b> he had done as merely a {{clerical}} error.|$|R
60|$|Subienkow {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} and remained silent. He blew cigarette smoke out on the icy air, and curiously <b>regarded</b> <b>what</b> remained of the big Cossack.|$|R
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent had {{informed}} Diefenbaker that Parliament would be dissolved in April, for an election on June 10. A final parliamentary conflict was {{sparked by the}} suicide of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt E.H. Norman {{in the midst of}} allegations made by a United States Senate subcommittee that Norman had communist links. Pearson had defended Norman when the allegations became public, and defended him again after his death, suggesting to the Commons that the allegations were false. It quickly became apparent that the information released by the Americans might have come from Canadian intelligence sources, and after severe questioning of Pearson by Diefenbaker and the other parties' foreign policy critics, Pearson made a statement announcing that Norman had had communist associations in his youth, but had passed a security review. The minister evaded further questions <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> information had been provided, and the discussion was cut short when Parliament was dissolved on April 12.|$|E
5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was {{before he became a}} writer for the show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff {{had a lot of fun}} during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E

6000|$|... “I don’t see why I should <b>regard</b> <b>what’s</b> done here,” Bessie pursued. “Why should I {{suffer the}} {{restrictions}} {{of a society}} of which I enjoy none of the privileges?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then you'll {{not even}} give Mulcahy a--a strike for his money,' {{said the voice}} of Horse Egan, who <b>regarded</b> <b>what</b> he called 'trouble' of any kind as the {{pinnacle}} of felicity.|$|R
25|$|It {{is claimed}} {{that this case}} radically changed the {{standard}} <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> constitutes a “materially adverse action” regarding employees.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} mark {{can also be}} used as a meta-sign to signal uncertainty <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> precedes. It is usually put between brackets (?). The uncertainty may concern either a superficial (such as unsure spelling) or a deeper truth (real meaning) level.|$|E
25|$|Tefillin: As {{indicated}} in Deuteronomy 6:8 among other places, tefillin {{are to be}} placed on the arm and on the head between the eyes. However, there are no details provided <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> tefillin are or how they are to be constructed.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well, my dear, from you; but we poor wretches who are the slaves of the people have to <b>regard</b> <b>what</b> is said {{of us in the}} 'People's Banner.'" ...|$|R

25|$|In May 2007, Nokia redefined {{its values}} after {{initiating}} {{a series of}} discussion across its worldwide branches <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation and Very Human.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals issued court summonses <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> they {{described}} as turtle abuse at turtle races {{at a restaurant}} in Plainfield, New Jersey. Although a judge ordered the races to be stopped, an investigation found that no abuse had occurred and the judge's order was rescinded.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{complicated}} problems that exist within these anti-transgender themes. Roffee and Waling established how, even throughout the LGBTIQ+ community, there {{continues to be}} confusion <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> individual people may identify with, and how this correlates to other people. This confusion often leads to offensive assumptions and judgement {{so that there are}} tensions and anti-social behaviours occurring, sometimes even within the community itself.|$|E
50|$|On 12 July 2010, at the 15th {{anniversary of}} the massacre, Milorad Dodik said that he {{acknowledged}} the killings that happened on the site, but did not <b>regard</b> <b>what</b> happened at Srebrenica as genocide.|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel flushed angrily. [...] "I quite {{recognize}} that I am under obligations to you, Mr. Holmes," [...] said he, [...] "but I must <b>regard</b> <b>what</b> {{you have just}} said as either a very bad joke or an insult." ...|$|R
6000|$|Madame de Cintre {{hesitated a}} moment. As Newman asked these {{questions}} {{she had grown}} a little pale, as if she <b>regarded</b> <b>what</b> was coming as necessary, but not as agreeable. [...] "Did you give him a message to me?" [...] she asked.|$|R
25|$|On 10 June 2006, the Department of Defense {{reported}} that three Guantanamo Bay detainees committed suicide. The military reported the men hanged themselves with nooses made of sheets and clothes. A study published by Seton Hall Law's Center for Policy and Research, while making no conclusions <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> actually transpired, {{asserts that the}} military investigation failed to address significant issues detailed in that report.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} {{work as an}} active member of several organizations, Robert {{discovered}} that members from different areas of the country had very different views <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> the proper parliamentary rules were, and these conflicting views hampered the organizations in their work. He eventually became convinced of the need for a new manual on the subject, one which would enable many organizations to adopt the same set of rules.|$|E
25|$|Although {{controversy}} continues <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> {{might have}} happened if Lucas had been more aggressive from the start, most commentators agree that the initial plan for Anzio was flawed. They question whether the initial landing of just over two infantry divisions, with no supporting armour, {{had the strength to}} achieve the objectives: of cutting Route 6 and then holding off the inevitable counterattacks that would come, as Kesselring redeployed his forces.|$|E
50|$|Premarital sex is {{forbidden}} in Judaism. In fact, the {{precedent for the}} mitzvot which are related in Deuteronomy 22:25-29, which <b>regard</b> <b>what</b> happens when a man rapes a virgin, {{may well have been}} set at Shechem after the rape of Dinah (cf. Genesis 34).|$|R
50|$|The Royal Commission of Inquiry into Children's Employment was {{established}} by the UK Parliament. They conducting hundreds of interviews primarily with children, not merely about their working conditions but also as <b>regards</b> <b>what</b> education they received and their day-to-day diet. They published their report in 1842.|$|R
5000|$|I {{am happy}} {{to join in the}} recent {{statement}} issued by William Hague MP, Foreign Secretary, on this matter and <b>regard</b> <b>what</b> has happened as being a most appalling transgression of justice and at heart a gross violation of the human right of freedom of belief." ...|$|R
25|$|From April 2006 {{through to}} October 2008, Russell Brand {{presented}} the weekly BBC radio show The Russell Brand Show. In most episodes Brand {{was joined by}} his co-host Matt Morgan who would often steer him in certain directions <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> to talk about. Brand sometimes called {{in a variety of}} his celebrity friends as well, including Noel Gallagher, Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross, to talk on the show each week.|$|E
25|$|Tefillin: As {{indicated}} in Deuteronomy 6:8 among other places, tefillin {{are to be}} placed on the arm and on the head between the eyes. However, there are no details provided <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> tefillin are or how they are to be constructed. Karaites, however, argue that since other passages in the Tanakh with similar language are read metaphorically, the verses from which the Rabbis derive the law of tefillin should also be read metaphorically.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of a prisoner's scheduled execution, {{he or she is}} transported directly from his or her death row unit to the Huntsville Unit. Men leave the Polunsky Unit in a three-vehicle convoy bound for the Huntsville Unit; women leave from the Mountain View Unit. The only individuals who are informed of the transportation arrangements are the wardens of the affected units. The TDCJ does not make an announcement <b>regarding</b> <b>what</b> routes are used.|$|E

40|$|Modeling {{of complex}} multidimensional systems is {{generally}} difficult especially {{in cases when}} a technological process is <b>regarded.</b> <b>What</b> is more, data obtained from technological systems are usually influenced by noise, disturbances and measurement errors. This paper presents case study of modeling of technological process, namely polymer materials grinding, with artificial neural networks. ...|$|R
