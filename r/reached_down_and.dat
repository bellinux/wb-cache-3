Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today said [...] "it's vertical in focus and a typical-sounding power ballad, but it's {{not hard to imagine}} people latching on to its powerful Job-like expression of faith and hope.". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout praised it as [...] "sonic" [...] and called it a [...] "passionate and emotional worship experience". Brian Mansfield of USA Today felt that the song's lyric [...] "I was sure by now that You would have <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wiped our tears away/Stepped in and saved the day/But once again, I say 'Amen,' and it's still raining" [...] would resonate with listeners.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 July 2003, {{at the age}} of 18, Goodrem was {{diagnosed}} with Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was forced to put all working commitments on hold while undertaking treatment for the disease. In an exclusive interview with The Australian Women's Weekly, Goodrem revealed that, since 2002, she had suffered from a head-to-toe rash, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and a lump on her neck. [...] "I was doing sit-ups when I felt something pop in my neck. I <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> I felt a small lump at the base of my throat. It wasn't sore, it wasn't visible, but I could feel it." [...] As part of her treatment, Goodrem undertook chemotherapy, which resulted in the loss of her hair, and radiation therapy. The news of her diagnosis made newspaper and television headlines and an outpouring of support was shown by fans and the general public alike. Goodrem thanked them during The Visualise Tour for all the letters and well wishes she received.|$|E

2500|$|The hand {{may be seen}} in the Ascension of Christ, sometimes, as in the Drogo Sacramentary, <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{clasping}} that of Christ, {{as though}} to pull him up into the clouds.

5000|$|Known as [...] "la mecedora" [...] in Mexico. The {{opponent}} is {{face down on}} the mat, with the attacker bending both of their legs up and tucking their ankles against his armpits.

50|$|The attacking wrestler {{stands over}} a face down opponent, {{facing the same}} direction. The wrestler first hooks each of the opponent's legs {{underneath}} his own armpits as if performing a reverse Boston crab, the wrestler then <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> underneath the opponent's chin with both hands applying a chinlock, finally leaning back to pull up the opponent's head and neck.|$|R
60|$|As he was {{tying the}} last thong a {{messenger}} {{came from the}} Herald, saying that the challenger was ready, and then Myles knew the time had come, <b>and</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> giving Sir James a grip of the hand, he drew on his gauntlet, took the jousting lance that Wilkes handed him, and turned his horse's head towards {{his end of the}} lists.|$|R
50|$|This comical move {{involves}} the attacking wrestler approaching an opponent from behind, <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> grasping his crotch with both forearms, with {{hands together and}} facing upwards into his groin, and lifting him overhead into a belly-to-back release suplex. The opponent reacts to both the suplex and being grabbed and lifted by his crotch, to humorous effect. Female wrestler Candice LeRae is known for this move, which she uses on male opponents, and calls it a Balls-plex.|$|R

50|$|There is a {{practice}} in New Jersey and New York of tossing a few coins {{onto the floor}} of a newly purchased car as a sign of good luck. This practice originated as a practical one. Because of the area's many toll roads, many drivers would carry change in their cars. The friends and family of the new car owner would throw coins onto the floor of the new car so if the driver ever ran out of his own money, he could always <b>reach</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> find some extra money on the floor.|$|R

50|$|After {{returning}} to Moonbase, Koenig and company solemnly await the collision. When the two Moons touch, {{they create a}} space-time schism—returning both to {{the chaos of the}} anomaly. There, the Moons merge to form a single Moon. Once complete, everything vanishes in a burst of white light—which fades as the Alphans awaken to find they are again in a different part of space. Carter wonders if the other Alphans also survived. As Koenig questions if they ever really existed, Helena <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> retrieves something that had fallen to the floor...a bouquet of roses given to her by Earth Bergman from his garden.|$|R

60|$|The {{accident}} {{was such a}} comical one that Dave and his chums laughed outright, and Tom Dillon and Abe Blower grinned broadly. Link Merwell <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> assisted the former teacher to his feet. Job Haskers's face was sourness itself.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I froze at {{the sight}} of a black figure against the light of my window. I {{recognized}} the strange bat, the grotesque outlines. I was about to shout for help when the fellow <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> softly began to raise the sash.|$|E

50|$|Naglopers {{are closely}} tied with the asanbonsam of Ashanti legend, a horrific {{creature}} resembling {{a man with}} hooked feet. The asanbonsam would use their appendages to <b>reach</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> snatch passerby to feast on their bodies. The Naglopers {{have been known to}} reshape their lower bodies with Vicissitude to do this as well, but a favorite torture is to take a victim, reshape them into the asanbonsam form, and promise to restore them if they act out the legend on innocents. More often than not, a torture victim will end up ghouled, dead, or the target of further, more horrific tortures.|$|R
60|$|I {{placed a}} foot upon the lowest ledge <b>and</b> clambered upward, <b>reaching</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pulling Lys to my side. Already I felt safer. Soon {{we would be}} out of danger of the beasts again closing in upon us. The man above us raised his stone hatchet above his head <b>and</b> leaped lightly <b>down</b> to meet us. His {{position}} above me gave him a great advantage, or at least so he probably thought, for he came with every show of confidence. I hated to do it, but there seemed no other way, and so I shot him down as I had shot down Tsa.|$|R
60|$|And {{when the}} bulls paused, Manu <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> seized a tawny ear. With all his little might he tugged upon the heavy head until slowly it turned back, {{revealing}} the tousled, black head and clean-cut profile of Tarzan of the Apes.|$|E
60|$|He backed slowly {{until he}} was again beside the horse, when he <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> grasped the cinch, which was still intact. Then with one hand he raised the carcass from the ground. The girl freed herself and rose to her feet.|$|E

Also he kept continually looking up the slope to the left as if seeking a way {{to climb out of}} the valley in that direction.

With a little intelligence, I can <b>reach</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pick up big nuggets of gold.
