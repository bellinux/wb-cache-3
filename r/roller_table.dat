Survival, growth, intermoult period, growth factor and intermoult growth rate of subadult mysids (4 - 10 mm standard length) were monitored over 4. 5 weeks in a <b>roller</b> <b>table.</b> In a first experiment, the effect of tidal dynamics on the floc formation process, {{as well as on the}} floc size and shape was followed. Also, we evaluated the effect of continuous rotation in the roller tanks on the growth of N. integer to be negligible. Subsequently, we performed a growth experiment with N. integer reared on the laboratory-made aggregates and estimated the feeding rate. The estuarine aggregates are a valuable food source for the mysids as they showed good survival (80 %) and grew substantially on this dietary item (0. 08 ± 0. 01 mm d - 1), although growth is slower than on Artemia nauplii (0. 11 ± 0. 01 mm d - 1). The high feeding rate of subadult Neomysis integer on the laboratory-made flocs (38 flocs ind - 1), may compensate for their low energetic value. The <b>roller</b> <b>table</b> is an adequate tool for feeding experiments with N. integer on the fragile estuarine aggregates. For Neomysis integer living in the maximum turbidity zone of estuaries, the estuarine flocs may be an important additional food source, especially in periods when mesozooplankton prey (mainly calanoid copepods) is scarce. The rich bacterial and protozoan communities associated to the flocs as well as the incorporated amorphous organic matter, normally too small to be efficiently consumed by mysids, become part of their diet. This pathway thus constitutes a short-cut in the estuarine food chain...|$|E

To examine the influence of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) on aggregate settling speed, 3 experiments with different ratios of TEP to cell volume concentration were conducted.

The higher was the specific TEP content of an aggregate, the lower was the sinking velocity and the less pronounced was the size versus velocity relationship. Excess densities (Δρ) of aggregates were derived from velocity measurements and 3 -dimensional fractal dimensions (D 3) of aggregates were calculated from scaling properties of Δρ.

40|$|Marine snow {{aggregates}} {{are heavily}} colonized by heterotrophic microorganisms that express {{high levels of}} hydrolytic activities, making aggregates hotspots for carbon remineralization in the ocean. To assess how aggregate formation influences the ability of seawater microbial communities to access organic carbon, we compared hydrolysis rates of six polysaccharides in coastal seawater after aggregates had been formed (via incubation on a <b>roller</b> <b>table)</b> with hydrolysis rates in seawater from the same site that had not incubated on a <b>roller</b> <b>table</b> (referred to as whole seawater). Hydrolysis rates in the aggregates themselves were up to three orders of magnitude higher on a volume basis than in whole seawater. The enhancement of enzyme activity in aggregates relative to whole seawater differed by substrate, suggesting that the enhancement was under cellular control, rather than due to factors such as lysis or grazing. A comparison of hydrolysis rates in whole seawater with those in aggregate-free seawater, i. e. the fraction {{of water from the}} roller bottles that did not contain aggregates, demonstrated a nuanced microbial response to aggregate formation. Activities of laminarinase and xylanase enzymes in aggregate-free seawater were higher than in whole seawater, while activities of chondroitin, fucoidan, and arabinogalactan hydrolyzing enzymes were lower than in whole seawater. These data suggest that aggregate formation enhanced production of laminarinase and xylanase enzymes, and the enhancement also affected the surrounding seawater. Decreased activities of chondroitin, fucoidan, and arabinoglactan-hydrolyzing enzymes in aggregate-free seawater relative to whole seawater are likely due to shifts in enzyme production by the aggregate-associated community, coupled with the effects of enzyme degradation. Enhanced activities of laminarin- and xylan-hydrolyzing enzymes in aggregate-free seawater were due at least in part to cell-free enzymes. Measurements of enzyme lifetime using commercial enzymes suggest that hydrolytic lifetimes of cell-free enzymes may be sufficiently long to affect carbon remineralization in areas far from their site of production. Aggregate formation may be an important mechanism shaping the spectrum of enzymes active in the ocean, stimulating production of cell-free enzymes and leading to spatial and temporal decoupling of enzyme activity from the microorganisms that produced them...|$|E

Thraustochytrids and bacteria were abundant, suggesting high biological productivity of the region. Thraustochytrids were positively related to bacteria during October 2004 but not at other times, suggesting overlapping or varying substrate preferences at different times.

Mostly, researchers that focused on human factor issues looked very closely at the x-ray screening process or at covert testing. However, it has {{to be taken into account}} that security control is typically integrated in a competitive, market-oriented environment. Thus, facilitation aspects, such as the maximal capacity (also known as throughput) of a security control line, clearly reflect one important key performance index. In a series of studies, the impact of external factors, for instance seasonal variability of temperature or number of manual baggage inspections, as well as the impact of internal factors, such as the allocation of tasks within security control crew members, were measured. The scenarios with varied internal factors consisted of different manipulations in the work process without changing given security rules, protocols or changes in infrastructure. For example, the Security Officer helping passengers preparing their bags at the <b>roller</b> <b>table</b> has been taken away from this position and assigned as second person for baggage inspection. Implications of these scenarios on measures of efficiency, such as throughput, as well as on subjective measures, such as ratings of workload and stress, have been assessed. Results show that external factors correlate with throughput remarkably and that even slight changes in the process can have a significant impact on the mentioned domains. Experiences made are discussed in order to provide suggestions of useful and feasible optimizations of the security control process...|$|E
40|$|In the {{brackish}} part {{of western}} European estuaries the mysid Neomysis integer is dominating the hyperbenthic fauna and {{plays an important}} role in the local food web. Estuarine aggregates showed to be abundantly present in the stomachs of N. integer living in the estuarine turbidity maximum (Fockedey et al., 1999). However, it was not clear if the mysids actively fed on the flocs, nor if they could survive or grow on this dietary item. The aim of this study was to identify the survival and possible growth of Neomysis integer feeding on estuarine aggregates. First, a technique to make laboratory-made aggregates out of natural water of the Scheldt Estuary - by means of a <b>roller</b> <b>table</b> - had to be optimised. Subsequently, a 7 weeks lasting growth experiment was performed with laboratory-made aggregates as the main food item. The growth performance (measured by the mean growth rate, intermoult period and growth factor) on a diet of aggregates was compared with that on a diet of Artemia nauplii. The mysids survived well (70 %) and even grew significantly (0. 059 mm day - 1) on a diet of flocs, though less than the individuals on a diet of Artemia (0. 094 mm day - 1). Also, rough estimates of the feeding rate (38 ± 18 aggregates h - 1) and the gut passage time (30 minutes) of N. integer feeding on laboratory-made aggregates were determined. Estuarine aggregates probably are an important additional food source for Neomysis integer living in the turbid zone of estuaries. The very high abundance and small effort needed to consume the flocs, might compensate their relative low energetic value...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor (UASB) {{provides}} a state-of–the-art solution to effluent treatment by anaerobic digestion: sludge production is dramatically {{lower than in}} other digestion processes, and energy is gained from the system if the produced biogas is converted to electricity and/or heat. The UASB is a modified fluidised bed reactor, with the solid state ‘catalyst’ being granulated anaerobic sludge, and the liquid phase the effluent {{that needs to be}} treated. A gas cap is installed to serve as a carbon dioxide and methane collector. This biogas (carbon dioxide and methane) is produced by the stepwise decomposition of complex carbohydrates and proteins via a consortium of micro-organisms living in a symbiotic environment known as a granule. A typical UASB reactor has an organic removal rate of 89 - 93 % Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and operates optimally at loadings of 9. 8 - 11 kg COD/ m 3 reactor volume/day. Unfortunately, one major problem hampers the efficiency of this reactor {{to such an extent that}} the unit is only economically viable in exceptional cases; if the reactor is inoculated with un-granulated anaerobic sludge, start-up times of up to 12 months can be expected. The lengthy start-up times motivated the search for an artificial way to cultivate USAB granules. Early research (done on lab-scale, 400 ml vessel volumes) proved that, under a specified set of environmental conditions, granule growth can occur in an artificial environment. Yet these laboratory-scale vessels did not facilitate scale-up or the study thereof. This led to the main problem statement of this research project: namely to design, commission, and optimise benchscale bioreactors that will generate granulated anaerobic sludge in an incubation period of 20 days. These units should also facilitate in the determining of parameters that will assist in the design of a scale-up to a UASB granule producing reactor of economically viable size. Two bench-scale reactors were initially designed specifically to “mimic” the motion found in the laboratory-scale vessels. The results from these initial reactors proved that granulation cannot only be enhanced, but granules can actually be cultivated from dispersed anaerobic sludge in a larger artificial environment over an incubation period of only 20 days. The results were still far from satisfactory, as the granules produced were irregular in shape and the yield of usable granules (2. 2 kg/m 3 reactor volume) insufficient. A third test reactor was designed to “mimic” <b>roller</b> <b>table</b> movement and baffles were included. These results were much better and the yield was 4. 4 kg/m 3 reactor volume at a baffle tipspeed of 0. 0055 m/s. The optimisation was extended further to include the inoculation sludge and the feed medium. A C:N:P ratio of 10 : 1 : 4 proved to yield the best results. Monovalent anions, hydrogen concentration and a pH-level outside the 6. 5 to 7. 2 range evidently had an inhibitory effect on the granulation rate. After the optimisation study the third test unit produced a usable granule yield of 15. 2 kg/m 3 reactor volume over the 20 -day incubation period. The incubation period can be separated into 3 distinct phases, namely the acidification, stabilisation and growth phases. From the mass balance it was found that most of the COD and nutrients were used for ECP production in the acidification phase. During the stabilisation phase, the COD and nutrients were mostly used for nucleus formation, and finally in the growth phase the COD was used for granule growth. To study the effect the internal surface area of the reactor has on the granulation process, 3 scale-down versions of the third test unit were constructed. Within the studied range, a yield of usable granules of 40 kg/m 2 reactor internal surface area was obtained...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} is a semi-industrial {{physical}} simulation of thermomechanical rolling and controlled cooling of advanced high-strength steels with increased Mn and Al content. Design/methodology/approach: Four steels of various Mn and Nb concentration were thermomechanically rolled in 3 and 5 passes using a modern LPS line for physical simulation of hot rolling at a semi-industrial scale. The hot deformation course is fully automated as well as controlled cooling applied directly after finishing rolling. Temperature-time and force-energetic parameters of hot rolling were continuously registered and assessed. Findings: The applied line consisting of two-high reversing mill, <b>roller</b> <b>tables</b> with heating panels, cooling devices and controlling-recording systems reflects industrial hot strip rolling parameters sufficiently. Reduction values and temperature-time regimes are similar to those used in industrial practice whereas strain rate is limited to about 10 s- 1 what requires taking into account during comparison. All the steels investigated have high total pressure forces due to the high total content of alloying elements. The critical factor making it possible to obtain high-quality sheet samples with a thickness up to 3. 3 mm is applying isothermal heating panels which decrease a cooling rate of thin sheets. Research limitations/implications: The real complete simulation of hot strip rolling requires extension of a used line with a further module for simulation of continuous finishing rolling stages. The work is in progress. Practical implications: The results can be successfully utilized in industrial hot rolling and controlled cooling practices after necessary modifications.

Lowest PIC/POC ratios and lowest sinking velocity (~ 366 m d − 1) at comparable sizes were observed for aggregates of the high CO 2 treatment.

We also observed that more aggregates formed in the high CO 2 treatment, and that those aggregates contained more bacteria than aggregates in the medium and low CO 2 treatment.
