50|$|The French Culoz-Modane railway was {{electrified}} with 1500 V DC third rail, later {{converted to}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> {{at the same}} voltage. Stations had <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> from the beginning.|$|R
50|$|Until May 1911, part of {{the system}} was {{equipped}} with conduit supply to avoid unsightly <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> on the central section of the tramway. From May 1911, <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> was introduced.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{electrification}} generally predated double-stacking, the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> was too low {{to accommodate}} it. However, India is building some freight-only corridors with the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> at [...] above rail, which is high enough.|$|R
50|$|Shenyang Modern Tram is {{the first}} partly battery powered tram both in China and Asia. This tram system mostly uses {{traditional}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> system, but partly uses charged battery system, without <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{electrification}} generally predated double-stacking, the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> was too low {{to accommodate}} it. However, India is building some freight-only corridors with the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> at 7.45 m above rail, which is high enough.|$|R
50|$|The Route Utilisation Strategy {{document}} makes note of {{the benefits}} of dual-voltage electric multiple-unit trains that could be used both on the third-rail Merseyrail network and on future electrified lines using <b>overhead</b> <b>wires.</b> All new third-rail rolling stock must be capable of simple conversion to the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> 25kV electrical supply system, so any future rolling stock on the Merseyrail DC third-rail lines will have provision for an <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> pantograph.|$|R
50|$|For the {{purposes}} of inspection of <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring,</b> carriage 3CM was constructed to a modified design with an overhead compartment for inspectors to watch {{the way that the}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> reacted to contact with pantographs.|$|R
25|$|S-trains run on standard-gauge {{tracks and}} are powered via <b>overhead</b> <b>wires.</b> The voltage is 1,500 or 1,650 volts DC (negative <b>overhead</b> <b>wire),</b> {{indicating}} that it varies considerably with the loading and distance from a feeder station. Power {{is drawn from}} the national grid through 38 feeder stations. They have to be relatively {{close to each other}} because the large currents in the <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> (caused by the relatively low voltage) would lead to unacceptably large transmission losses otherwise.|$|R
50|$|New York City had {{the largest}} {{installation}} of conduit cars, due to the prohibition of <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> on Manhattan Island, although a few Bronx-based trolley lines entered the northern reaches of Manhattan using <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b> Trolley lines from Brooklyn and Queens also entered Manhattan under wire, but did not use city streets. The primary reason for the initial adoption of conduit systems was for aesthetic reasons {{as an alternative to}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> that was often objected to as being unsightly.|$|R
50|$|The Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn has {{two lines}} with {{different}} electrification. To {{be able to}} use different electric systems on shared tracks, the Sihltal line has its <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> right above the train, whilst the Uetliberg line has its <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> off to one side.|$|R
50|$|The rail {{was removed}} in 2003-2004, {{and ended up}} at the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway, with all <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> on the siding gone by this time. A dwarf signal and <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> {{stanchions}} remain in the paper mill grounds themselves. The paper mill was closed in 2012.|$|R

50|$|The use of <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> allows {{higher power}} supply {{voltages}} to be used. Although <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> {{are more likely}} to be used on metro systems without many tunnels, an example of which is the Shanghai Metro, <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> are employed on some systems that are predominantly underground, as in Madrid. Lines that utilize street running while on the surface (such as Boston's Green Line) tend to derive power completely from <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> both while traveling in a tunnel in the central city and at street level in the suburban areas, as a third rail would make the track unsafe for road vehicles, especially at level crossings. There are transit lines that make use of both rail and overhead power, with vehicles able to switch between the two (an example of this being in Rotterdam and formerly in Chicago).|$|R

5000|$|The Galveston Island Trolley cars {{look like}} vintage {{electric}} trolleys, but actually they are modern build and diesel-electric powered. Therefore, {{there are no}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> in Galveston. This means that the vehicles are not rightfully referred to as [...] "trolleys", since they do not [...] "troll" [...] for power from <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> but are [...] "streetcars".|$|R
5000|$|Safety or routing issues {{sometimes}} require Metro to [...] "motorize" [...] the trolleybus routes, operating {{them with}} diesel or hybrid diesel-electric buses. These substitutions usually occur {{on weekends and}} are usually caused by maintenance on the <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> construction projects near the <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> or special events (such as parades or marathons) that require the routes to be detoured.|$|R
2500|$|The grooved {{trolley wheel}} was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was {{generally}} used on systems with [...] "old" [...] style round cross sectional <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b> The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the grooved wheel bearing {{on the underside of}} the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> wear [...] The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved <b>overhead</b> trolley <b>wire</b> of a roughly [...] "figure 8" [...] cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s. Curiously, Philadelphia did not convert its trolley wheels on its remaining streetcars until 1978. Although a streetcar with a trolley wheel may evoke an antique look, the trolley shoe is modern and more practical as well as economical.|$|R
