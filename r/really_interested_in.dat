I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor Elverson Patenôtre ordered cuts {{throughout}} the paper, {{but was not}} <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> managing it and ownership was soon put up for sale. Cyrus Curtis and Curtis-Martin Newspapers Inc. bought the newspaper on March 5, 1930. Curtis died a year later and his stepson-in-law, John Charles Martin, took charge. Martin merged The Inquirer with another paper, the Public Ledger, but the Great Depression hurt Curtis-Martin Newspapers and the company defaulted in payments of maturity notes. Subsequently, ownership of The Inquirer returned to the Patenôtre family and Elverson Corp. Charles A. Taylor {{was elected president of}} The Inquirer Co. and ran the paper until it was sold to Moses L. Annenberg in 1936. During the period between Elverson Jr. and Annenberg The Inquirer stagnated, its editors ignoring most of the poor economic news of the Depression. The lack of growth allowed J. David Stern's newspaper, The Philadelphia Record, to surpass The Inquirer in circulation and become the largest newspaper in Pennsylvania.|$|E

Inside, they discover that the Ottomans were <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> a hidden stone library {{telling the story of}} the Lake of the Moon, which contains the Fountain of Youth, a secret Native American relic which is told that it has the ability to give eternal life, and the secret society, called the Circle of Ossus, who seek it for their own gain. Alain orders Morgan to sail to the New World to search for the Lake, but Morgan is attacked by the Pirate Elizabet Ramsey (Lizzie the Pirate) and is forced to land in the Caribbean islands. After re-engaging and defeating Lizzie, Morgan's men find some navigation charts which guide them safely to New Spain.|$|E

Having said that we should {{bear in mind that}} minimizing the distance is not what we have <b>really</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in.</b> In more practical objectives include, e.g., the traveling time which is subject to the ever changing road conditions and therefore is inherently dynamic. The Dynamic TSP was introduced for the first time by Psarafits [2] and various aspects of the DTSP are now the subject of intensive study [3, 4, 5].|$|R

5|$|Israeli Arab {{historian}} Mustafa Kabha {{wrote that}} Egyptian and other Arab historians did not attribute as much {{importance to the}} battle as Israeli ones. They ask what the Egyptian objective was, {{and whether or not}} it was wise to advance without securing their lines of communication. Abdullah el Tell, commander of the Jordanian Legion in Jerusalem, thought that the Egyptians did not consider the Legion's needs. Aware of their weaknesses, they did not let anything distract them from reaching Tel Aviv. The Egyptian war log, from 19:00 on May 28, 1948, showed concern over the lines of communication. Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari wrote that while the Egyptians publicly declared that the target was Tel Aviv, they never actually meant to advance farther than their Isdud fortifications. As evidence, he cited the Egyptian refusal to take the undefended Yibna despite the villagers' repeated cries for help. Bahjat Abu-Gharbiyeh, one of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's deputies and commander of the Beit Jibrin area, wrote that the Egyptians never had a clear plan, because their leadership were not <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> a war. Therefore, their efforts were improvised. Kabha concludes that Arab historiography considers the battle the successful realization of a tactical move, designed to serve the actions of the badly coordinated Arab armies.|$|E

All of Kentucky's living former Democratic governors were invited to participate, and each accepted the invitation with the exception of Brown. Of his refusal, Brown stated [...] "I don't respect him. I don't {{want to be part of}} it. I'm not <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> being politically correct." [...] Referring to the 1987 Democratic gubernatorial primary campaign, Brown continued, [...] "He said things that were not true, like we had raised taxes. I just never respected him after that."

500|$|Coghill cites drummers Keith Moon and Mitch Mitchell {{as major}} {{influences}} on his playing, while boxer Mohammad Ali as a non-musical inspiration. He notes that multi-instrumentalist Stevie Wonder is his favourite. During his university years, Coghill began listening to technical drummers such as Dennis Chambers. Others {{have noted that}} Coghill is influenced by The Dead Kennedys and The Fugees. In 1997, Coghill stated [...] "I’m <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> groove", and explained that he enjoyed the lyrical elements of Hip Hop and bands such as Spearhead. Coghill has also stated that as {{a child growing up}} in Nambour, he had aspired to be [...] "a star like Michael Jackson". He says this ambition was sparked by a breakdancing teacher in his home town, and by his sister's love of Jackson's Thriller.|$|E
500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Vig {{recalled}} that the title [...] "Not Your Kind of People" [...] {{came to him}} when he was stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles; he texted Manson the idea for a title and she loved it. Manson wrote all the lyrics that night, and the next day the four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote the music to the song in about half an hour. Manson explained that the album title Not Your Kind of People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like we do about the world", saying that [...] "it can be great to be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider." [...] Manson also described the title as [...] "a two-fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us", stating the band was [...] "only <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> people who share our outlook" [...] as she considered that their fans were [...] "the people who connect with what you're saying and how you say it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

She cites Foxy Brown and Jay-Z as major influences: [...] "I really loved [...] as a female rapper. I was <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> her mind and her aura [...] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics.

Nicki and Lil Kim, often cited as Foxy's main rap rival, have reportedly exchanged words with each other, on social media and in their music.|$|E
500|$|A general {{election}} {{was called in}} Southern Rhodesia in July 1948 after the United Party government, headed by the Prime Minister Sir Godfrey Huggins, unexpectedly lost {{a vote in the}} Legislative Assembly. In August, about a month before election day, Smith was approached by members of the opposition Liberal Party and asked to stand for them in Selukwe. Jacob Smit's Liberals, despite their name, were decidedly illiberal, chiefly representing commercial farming, mining and industrial interests. Smith was initially reluctant, saying he was too busy organising his life to stand, but agreed after one of the Liberal officials suggested that a political career might allow him to defend the values he had fought for in the Second World War. With their wedding barely a fortnight away, Janet was astonished to learn of Smith's decision to run for parliament, having never before heard him discuss politics. [...] "I can't say that I am <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> party politics," [...] Smith explained to her, [...] "but I've always been most interested in sound government." [...] Smith duly became a Liberal Party politician, finalised his purchase of Gwenoro, and married Janet, adopting her two children as his own, all in a few weeks in August 1948. They enjoyed a few days' honeymoon at Victoria Falls, then went straight into the election campaign.|$|E

500|$|Mark Shiel {{explains}} the rising popularity of cult films {{as an attempt}} by cinephiles and scholars to escape the oppressive conformity and mainstream appeal of even independent film, {{as well as a}} lack of condescension in both critics and the films; Academic Donna de Ville says it is a chance to subvert the dominance of academics and cinephiles. [...] According to Xavier Mendik, [...] "academics have been <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> cult movies for quite a while now." [...] Mendik has sought to bring together academic interest and fandom through Cine-Excess, a film festival. I. Q. Hunter states that [...] "it's much easier to be a cultist now, but it is also rather more inconsequential." [...] Citing the mainstream availability of Cannibal Holocaust, Jeffrey Sconce rejects definitions of cult films based on controversy and excess, as they've now become meaningless. [...] Cult films have influenced such diverse industries as cosmetics, music videos, and fashion. [...] Cult films have shown up in less expected places; as a sign of his popularity, a bronze statue of Ed Wood has been proposed in his hometown, and L'Osservatore Romano, the official newspaper of the Holy See, has courted controversy for its endorsement of cult films and pop culture. [...] When cities attempt to renovate neighborhoods, fans have called attempts to demolish iconic settings from cult films [...] "cultural vandalism". [...] Cult films can also drive tourism, even when it is unwanted.|$|E
500|$|Rasmussen's {{first task}} was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound with which the band was dissatisfied. A guide track for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich's {{drumming}} were used. The band played in a live room, recording the instruments separately. Each song used three reels: one for drums, a second for bass and guitars and a third for anything else. Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began, and Rasmussen said that Hetfield [...] "wasn't <b>really</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> singing" [...] but instead [...] "wanted that hard vibe". Metallica's recording process was new to Jason Newsted, who questioned his impact on the overall sound {{and the lack of}} discussion {{with the rest of the}} team. Newsted had a different experience with his previous band, Flotsam and Jetsam, describing their style as [...] "basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall". He recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band, with only the assistant engineer present. Newsted noted that his parts were at the same audio frequency as Hetfield's guitar parts, and this created a [...] " [...] for the same frequency". Steve Thompson, who mixed the album, claims that Ulrich was squarely to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums. Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production, but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the misrepresentation of bass of the record.|$|E

In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right.
