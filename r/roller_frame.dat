[...] The roller cover absorbs the paint and transfers it to the painted surface, the <b>roller</b> <b>frame</b> attaches to the roller cover. A painter holds the roller by the handle section. The <b>roller</b> <b>frame</b> is reusable. It is possible to clean and reuse a roller cover, {{but it is also}} typically disposed of after use.|$|E
50|$|Some rollers {{place the}} <b>roller</b> <b>frame</b> inside an {{external}} track {{so they can}} move (slide) fore and aft - which allow for simulating extreme pedalling off the saddle, as if climbing a hill. Strong elastic bands or springs are attached to each corner of the frame and pull and hold the <b>roller</b> <b>frame</b> in the tracks. A bicycle on the road can move fore and aft relative to the rider, and these rollers attempt to duplicate this effect.|$|E

40|$|Inspired by bicycle {{training}} rollers, {{a wheelchair}} exercise roller (an exercise machine {{for the application}} of wheelchair users) was designed from conception of idea to alpha prototype. Background and market data was gathered through research with disabled people, members of disability and rehabilitation centers, and by examining other existing related products. Initial designs were created, and using these designs, functional requirements were set. These functional requirements were used to determine the main product modules (<b>rollers,</b> <b>frame,</b> and ramp) and desired features (simulated natural inertia/forces, varying resistance, tilt feature, etc.) Keeping these in consideration, initial calculations and hands-on research were performed in particular to determine the effect of radial load and RPMs on the bearings. Then, by using test modules built with inline skate bearings, aluminum tube, and wood 2 "x 4 "s, the initial calculations and research were tested. The results of these tests helped to determine the eventual final design. Solid modeling software (Solidworks 2005) was then used to create various design iterations and make changes as needed. (cont.) Finally, using the final solid model, a functional prototype was built using 2 "x 2 " aluminum angle, conveyor belt rollers, and plywood. This prototype was then tested under the conditions the product was originally intended to function under. The result of these tests showed that in the current state, the prototype was not at a level ready to be marketed. The rollers in their current state did not fully simulate the natural inertia and forces felt when rolling on real ground. Also, several desired features had not yet been implemented. However, the prototype did succeed in ultimately showing potential functionality and feasibility of the product. by Benjamin W. Su. Thesis (S. B.)

2500|$|Lewis Paul {{patented}} the <b>roller</b> spinning <b>frame</b> and the flyer-and-bobbin {{system for}} drawing wool {{to a more}} even thickness. The technology was developed {{with the help of}} John Wyatt of Birmingham. [...] Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in Northampton with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster, but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented carding machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright in his water frame and Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule.|$|R

It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles. [...] The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting. It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792, and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft, not warp.|$|R

50|$|In 1800s, she {{invented a}} special type of clothes-wringer {{which was a}} machine that had two <b>rollers</b> in a <b>frame</b> that was {{connected}} to a crank. Clothes would be fed in between the two rollers and as the crank was turned the clothes would have the water pressed out of them. A clothes wringer was made from two wooden pins that are {{on top of each}} other with a crank attached to allow the pins to roll. This invention came at a time when there were not a lot of ways to wash clothes other than with your hands. Therefore, this was an amazing invention and concept. However, Eglin decided to sell her patent to a “white person interested in manufacturing the product” for $18. In the April 1890 issue of Woman Inventor, Eglin was quoted as saying “You know I am black and if it was known that a Negro woman patented the invention, white ladies would not buy the wringer. I was afraid to be known because of my color in having it introduced into the market that is the only reason.” The buyer went on to reap considerable financial awards.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1927 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, 3751 was Baldwin's and the Santa Fe railway's first 4-8-4. It had a Santa Fe 5-chime freight whistle {{mounted on}} it. Tests showed that 3751 was 20% more {{efficient}} and powerful than Santa Fe's 4-8-2 3700 class steamer, which at the point was Santa Fe's most advanced steam locomotive. In 1936, the engine was converted to burn oil. Two years later, the locomotive was given a larger tender able to hold 20,000 gallons of water and 7,107 gallons of fuel oil. 3751 was also present at the grand opening of Union Station in Los Angeles on May 7, 1939 pulling the Scout, one of Santa Fe's crack passenger trains as it arrived from Chicago. It was the first steam locomotive to bring a passenger train into LAUPT. In 1941, along with other 4-8-4s, 3751 received major upgrades including: 80-inch drive wheels, a new <b>frame,</b> <b>roller</b> bearings all around, and more. That same year, it achieved its highest recorded speed at 103 mph. It {{continued to be a}} very reliable working locomotive until 1953, when it pulled the last regularly scheduled steam powered passenger train on the Santa Fe to run between Los Angeles and San Diego on August 25, this was its last run in revenue service. After that, it was stored at the Redondo Junction, California roundhouse in Los Angeles for four years before it was officially retired from the roster by the railroad in 1957, and in 1958 it was placed on display in San Bernardino.|$|R
5000|$|ST-26 (ST {{stands for}} saperniy tank or [...] "{{engineer}} tank") — engineer tank; a bridge-laying tank {{based on the}} twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 chassis. According to the [...] "System of armoured engineering armament of the Red Army", the ST-26 was developed by designers from the Academy of Military Engineering (chief engineer of the project - Gutman) {{in the beginning of}} 1932. The ST-26 had only one shortened turret {{in the middle of the}} hull armed with a DT tank machine gun with 1,008 rounds; arc of fire was 211°. Special equipment consisted of a metal tracked bridge 7.35 m long and weighing 1100 kg, supports for the bridge (a front frame with two forks and two guiding rollers, lower forks with a hoisting mechanism and a <b>roller,</b> a rear <b>frame</b> with mounts and two rollers) and a cable winch (driven by the tank engine with the use of the reversing gear) inside the vehicle. The ST-26 was intended to provide for crossing of trenches and streams 6 - 6.5 m wide and barriers up to 2 m high by T-27, T-26 and BT light tanks: the bridge had a maximum load rating of 14 t. The bridge could be laid with the help of the cable winch in 25-40 seconds without crew exit; the raising operation took 2-3 min and a commander needed to come out from the vehicle in order to control the process. The ST-26 with its cable system for bridge laying was tested in the summer of 1932.|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are well-renown for their {{strength to weight}} ratios and are widely used in many industries where high strength and low weight is required. Although steel is the traditional material of choice in the mining industry, and particularly for conveyor support structures, the strength and weight advantages offered by composite materials has prompted this investigation into the feasibility of using composite materials in underground mining conveyor support structures. The {{first phase of the}} project centred on establishing and applying selection criteria for the materials and processes which could be used in such a structure. Key concerns include fire performance, electrical conductivity, cost, availability and manufacturability. Based on these considerations, the project identified a phenolic-glass laminate manufactured using the RTM method (for moulded components) or the pultrusion process (for tube sections) as a possible basis for a composite conveyor support structure. The second phase of the project developed a set of design criteria for the use of composite materials in conveyor support structures and a series of preliminary designs based on current conveyor configurations. After analysing each preliminary design against key design criteria, in particular cost, weight, assembly time, susceptibility to damage and torsional loading, the Linestand Suspended - Beam configuration was selected as the preferred option. The third phase of the project used the findings of the preliminary design analysis and the key design criteria to develop a prototype final design. The prototype design is based on a hybrid style of frame. The majority of the structure is constructed from a custom pultruded beam connected with a composite connection piece, while the interface between the <b>rollers</b> and the <b>frame</b> utilises a steel bracket {{to reduce the risk of}} damage to the composite frame. The final design is 12 kg lighter than the current smaller steel design of similar function. The project has demonstrated the feasibility of using composite materials in conveyor support structures and the weight savings that may be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent {{fluctuations}} {{in the vicinity of}} the water free surface along a flat, vertically oriented surface-piercing plate are studied experimentally using a laboratory-scale experiment. In this experiment, a meter-wide stainless steel belt travels horizontally in a loop around two rollers with vertically oriented axes, which are separated by 7. 5 meters. This belt device is mounted inside a large water tank with the water level set just below the top edge of the belt. The belt, <b>rollers,</b> and supporting <b>frame</b> are contained within a sheet metal box to keep the device dry except for one 6 -meter-long straight test section between rollers. The belt is launched from rest with an acceleration of up to 3 -g in order to quickly reach steady state velocity. This creates a temporally evolving boundary layer analogous to the spatially evolving boundary layer created along a flat-sided ship moving at the same velocity, with a length equivalent to the length of belt that has passed the measurement region since the belt motion began. Surface profile measurements in planes normal to the belt surface are conducted using cinematic Laser Induced Fluorescence and quantitative surface profiles are extracted at each instant in time. Using these measurements, free surface fluctuations are examined and the propagation behavior of these free surface ripples is studied. It is found that free surface fluctuations are generated in a region close to the belt surface, where sub-surface velocity {{fluctuations in}}fluence the behavior of these free surface features. These rapidly-changing surface features close to the belt appear to lead to the generation of freely-propagating waves far from the belt, outside the influence of the boundary layer. Sub-surface PIV measurements are performed in order to study the modification of the boundary layer flow field due to the effects of the water free surface. Cinematic planar PIV measurements are performed in horizontal planes parallel to the free surface by imaging the flow from underneath the tank, providing streamwise and wall-normal velocity fields. Additional planar PIV experiments are performed in vertical planes parallel to the belt surface in order to study the bahvior of streamwise and vertical velocity fields. It is found that the boundary layer grows rapidly near the free surface, leading to an overall thicker boundary layer close to the surface. This rapid boundary layer growth appears to be linked to a process of free surface bursting, the sudden onset of free surface fluctuations. Cinematic white light movies are recorded from beneath the water surface in order to determine the onset location of air entrainment. In addition, qualitative observations of these processes are made in order to determine the mechanisms leading to air entrainment present in this flow...|$|R
