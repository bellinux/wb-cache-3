5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E

25|$|Their nests may {{be located}} in the trees or on the ground. Ground nests, {{frequently}} located near leaf litter, may be fabricated within sunken areas of the soil or beneath logs. Ground nests have both advantages and disadvantages. Floods or wet soil may force golden mice to leave their ground nests and relocate into the trees. However, if the ground nest is undisturbed, it can lower the risk for predation for the following reasons: the nest is well hidden, a mouse on the ground is more likely to escape a predator, and less energy is required to build a nest on the ground since the mouse doesn't have to keep <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> a tree with nesting materials.|$|E

25|$|In his autobiography, Cushing {{implies that}} he {{attempted}} suicide {{on the night}} of his wife's death by <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> stairs in the vain hope that it would induce a heart attack. He later stated that this had simply been a hysterical response borne out of grief, and that he had not purposely attempted to end his life; a poem left by Helen had implored him not to die until he had lived his life to the full, and he had resolved that to commit suicide would have meant letting her down. Although not conventionally religious, Cushing maintained a belief both in God and an afterlife. Cushing's colleagues of that period commented on his deeply Christian faith and his conviction that his separation from his wife was only temporary.|$|E
500|$|In mid-January, Danielle Savre {{was cast}} as the film's lead Laura Porter. On Savre, Betancourt stated that [...] " [...] has been {{incredible}} so far {{and has been a}} real trooper. We've [...] had her <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> these halls screaming, throwing blood on her, throwing vomit on her, throwing guts on her and she's held up so far." [...] Tobin Bell was cast as Dr. Mitchell Allen in February and Matt Cohen as Laura's brother Henry in March. Bell modeled his portrayal after Dick Cheney.|$|E
500|$|At 23:14, Muirhead-Gould {{ordered all}} ships to observe {{blackout}} conditions. Just after 23:30, {{he set off}} on a barge towards the boom net, to make a personal inspection. The Admiral reached Lolita at about midnight and indicated to her crew {{that he did not}} take the reports of enemy submarines seriously, reportedly saying: [...] "What are you all playing at, <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the harbour dropping depth charges and talking about enemy subs in the harbour? There's not one to be seen." [...] The crew reiterated that a submarine had been seen, but Muirhead-Gould remained unconvinced and before he left, added sarcastically: [...] "If you see another sub, see if the captain has a black beard. I'd like to meet him." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1847, Brannan {{opened a}} store at Sutter's Fort, in present-day Sacramento, California. During {{that time he}} also built many large {{buildings}} in both Sacramento and San Francisco. Early in 1848, employees of John Sutter paid for goods in Brannan's store with gold they had found at Sutter's Mill, near Coloma, California. His California Star paper could not publish {{the news of the}} gold strike as the staff had left in a rush for the gold fields. Yet he [...] "owned the only store between San Francisco and the gold fields -- a fact he capitalized on by buying up all the picks, shovels and pans he could find, and then <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the streets of San Francisco, shouting [...] "Gold! Gold on the American River!" [...] He paid 20 cents each for the pans, then sold them for $15 apiece. In nine weeks, he made $36,000." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim {{was born}} at 8 Fishguard Street, Everton, Liverpool and was the third eldest of seven {{children}}. The McCartney children were John (Jack), Edith, James (Jim), Ann, Millie, Jane (Jin) and Joe (who was named after a brother who died in infancy). Joe and Florrie McCartney moved shortly after Jim's birth to 3 Solva Street in Everton, which was a run-down terraced house about three-quarters of {{a mile from the}} Liverpool city centre, where Jim attended the Steers Street Primary School off Everton Road. After leaving school at 14, Jim found work for six shillings a week as a cotton [...] "sample boy", at A. Hanney & Co.; a cotton broker in Chapel Street, Liverpool. Jim's job entailed <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> Old Hall Street with large bundles of cotton that had to be delivered to cotton brokers or merchants in various salesrooms. He worked ten-hour days, five days a week, although he received a bonus at Christmas that was almost double his annual salary.|$|E
500|$|The Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) {{was built}} in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman. The house was sold in 1767 to a wealthy widow, Cassandra Chew, who {{constructed}} a kitchen in the rear in 1767, and a second floor between 1767 and 1775, and a third floor in the 1790s. It remained in private hands for almost two centuries, used as a home and place of business, until the federal government purchased it in 1953 [...] An exceptionally large number of spirits, residents and visitors claim, inhabit the small house. These include: A woman in a brown dress standing near the fireplace, a heavy-set woman standing on the staircase {{and also in the}} kitchen, a man with long blond hair and wearing a blue jacket, a man wearing short pants and long stockings, a woman in a rocking chair on the third floor, a small boy who runs down the third floor hallway, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing standing in the master bedroom, a man dressed in Colonial-era clothing seen on the second floor, a young girl with curly hair <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the staircase, an African American boy, and a German-looking craftsman. The laughter of invisible children and the translucent images of women cooking in the kitchen have also been observed. The Old Stone House may also contain one of Washington's only malevolent spirits, nicknamed [...] "George," [...] who has choked and pushed visitors and whose presence (often indicated by an extremely cold spot) leaves witnesses with an intense feeling of dread. The hauntings at the Old Stone House are so well known that they were mentioned in Sandi Wilson's short crime story, [...] "The Blonde in Black." ...|$|E

50|$|Europeans brought polkas, waltzes, schottisches and quadrilles, while Africans brought {{numerous}} {{instruments and}} percussion-based musics, including marimba.

50|$|Some of {{the main}} {{differences}} that 'new' frame has compared to 'old' frame are xiongyao zhedie (chest and waist layered folding), which is the coordinated opening and closing of back and chest along with a type of rippling wave (folding) <b>running</b> vertically <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the dantian/waist area, connected to twisting of the waist/torso. The stances {{tend to be more}} compact in the goal of better mobility for fighting applications, while they still remain quite low. This form tends to emphasize manipulation, seizing and grappling (qin na) and a tight method of spiral winding for both long and shorter range striking.|$|R
2500|$|At this, Karolina {{ran from}} the funeral parlor {{screaming}} [...] "My Elsie is dead. She was murdered, murdered." [...] Her husband and Det. Zelasky tried to calm her, but in her extreme distress she began <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the street, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers. She insisted she had known for three weeks that the [...] "gypsies" [...] had killed Elsie. Frank consoled her and assisted her boarding a trolley car for home.|$|E
2500|$|In the European Mountain Running Trophy, {{her best}} {{results have been}} as runner up in Bad Kleinkirchheim, Carinthia, Austria in 1999, which she {{repeated}} in 2001 in Slovenia, finishing behind Russian Svetlana Demidenko, and again in 2003 in Trento, Italy, when Belgium's Catherine Lallemand won. She won the women's World Mountain Running Trophy in Bergen, Germany against expectations in 2000; as with all even-numbered years, the Trophy race followed the international style, which typically only involves an ascent. Mudge is more experienced in British fell-running, which includes <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> hills, but found success despite being unable to exploit her greater descending experience. Mudge herself described the WMRT win as [...] "the pinnacle of my career" [...] in a June 2008 interview.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Doctor's Daughter" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. David Chater of The Times {{described it}} as [...] "A wonderful episode - funny, exciting and strangely moving." [...] Martin Anderson of Den of Geek! stated that it was [...] "rather good - though badly plot-holed". He noted that it was yet another episode of Doctor Who [...] "undermined by Murray Gold's incessant music". He also described the episode as [...] "quite redolent of Tom Baker-era Who, with plenty of dark and cheap corridors to run down and two under-manned warring factions for the Doctor to bring peace to". For SFX's Ian Berriman, the <b>running</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> corridors was reminiscent of Lenny Henry's 1985 Doctor Who spoof featured on The Lenny Henry Show. Berriman described the episode as [...] "underwhelming", citing that because one [...] "always suspect she's a redshirt" [...] {{it is difficult to}} care for Jenny. Although [...] "reasonably diverting", Berriman argues that budgetary constraints make [...] "the story feel so enclosed" [...] and that the episode's plot, likened to [...] "", seems too {{similar to that of the}} Sontaran two-parter immediately prior to this adventure because both involve [...] "militarism" [...] and [...] "cloning". Newsrounds Lizo Mzimba also notes the similarities with [...] "The Sontaran Stratagem" [...] and [...] "The Poison Sky". Mzimba asserts that the episode's [...] "biggest problem" [...] is that it tries [...] "to cram an enormous amount into 45 minutes" [...] with most of the [...] "interesting" [...] and new ideas not getting [...] "the attention they deserve" [...] resulting in the audience not caring about either the human fighters or the Hath and thereby limiting a [...] "sense of danger or menace".|$|E

500|$|Thunder II {{would look}} attentively with his ears forward, {{seemingly}} on cue, for his picture {{to be taken}} whenever a photographer pointed a camera at him. He is known for being people-friendly and particularly gentle with children who became acquainted with him prior to each game. Instead of watching players on the field the way Thunder Sr. did, Thunder II liked to observe {{the people in the}} stands. When bored, he has entertained himself by grabbing the zipper pulls of his handlers' jackets <b>and</b> <b>running</b> them <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> [...] He also learned how to unscrew water bottles and squeeze them to get water.

40|$|Exercise {{is often}} {{suggested}} {{as a means}} of reducing the effects of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. In response to an increase in physical activity, bone mass can be increased and several studies have investigated the effectiveness of diflerent exercises in increasing bone mass. In this study we have attempted to quantify the eflect of diflerent exercises by measuring the accelerations produced during various exercises. Accelerations have been measured at the ankle of normal subjects during a series of impulsive (walking, <b>running</b> <b>and</b> walking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> stairs) <b>and</b> non-impulsive (cycling) exercises. Accelerations were measured using an accelerometer attached to a stzficuff which straps around the ankle. Signals from the accelerometer are amplified and recorded using a specially developed portable data-logging system. The principal parameters measured were the maximum change of acceleration (peak to peak) and the rate of change of acceleration. From the results it was observed that <b>running</b> <b>and</b> walking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> stairs produced the highest peak-to-peak change (running = 8. 08 g; walking downstairs = 8. 11 9) and rate of change of acceleration (running = 2. 14 g / s; walking downstairs = 2. 07 g/s). By contrast, a non-impulsive exercise such as cycling produced relatively low values of peak-to-peak change (2. 24 g) and rate of change (0. 23 g / s) of acceleration. ...|$|R
60|$|Presently we {{saw that}} the cavern before us opened upon a hazy void. In another moment we had emerged upon a sort of {{slanting}} gallery, that projected into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit <b>running</b> vertically <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without any parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high above into the rock again. Somehow it reminded me then one of those spiral turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard. It was all tremendously huge. I can scarcely hope to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all that place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes followed up the vast declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and far above we beheld a round opening set with faint stars, {{and half of the}} lip about it well nigh blinding with the white light of the sun.

50|$|Brukdown is a Kriol {{mixture of}} European harmonies (Accordion), African syncopated rhythms and call-and-response format and lyrical {{elements}} from the native {{peoples of the}} area. In its modern form, brukdown is rural folk music, associated especially with the logging towns of the Belizean interior. Traditional instruments include the banjo, guitar, drums, dingaling bell, accordion and a donkey's jawbone played by <b>running</b> a stick <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the teeth, <b>and</b> also a grater. Brukdown remains a rural, rarely recorded genre. This genre of music has primarily African elements, while the only significant European element, is the Accordion.|$|R
