This parameterization has the advantage that perfect reconstruction condition is automatically fullfilled (see (3) below).

40|$|Bandpass filters for {{microwave}} frequencies realized with thin film bulk acoustic wave resonators (FBAR) are a promising alternative to current dielectric or {{surface acoustic wave}} filters for use in mobile telecommunication applications. With equivalent performance, FBAR filters are significantly smaller than dielectric filters and allow for a larger power operation than SAW filters. In addition, FBARs offer the possibility of on-chip integration, which will result in substantial volume and cost reduction. The first passive FBAR devices are now appearing on the market. They mainly cover needs in miniaturized RF-filters for the new bands around 2 GHz. A FBAR is essentially a thin piezoelectric plate sandwiched between two electrodes and acoustically isolated from the environment for energy trapping purposes. If the isolation is effectuated by an acoustic Bragg reflector, one speaks of solidly mounted resonators (SMR). Piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN) thin films are predominantly used in the emerging FBAR technology because AlN exhibits a sufficient electromechanical coupling coefficient kt 2, low acoustic losses at {{microwave frequencies}}, a low temperature coefficient of frequency, and its chemical composition is compatible with CMOS requirements. This thesis has two research directions. In the first part, FBAR structures based on AlN thin films were investigated for applications at X-band frequencies (7. 2 - 8. 5 GHz), i. e. operating at much higher frequencies than the ones used for present products. The goal was to identify property limitations related to such high frequencies, and to demonstrate to industry high performing SMR filters at 8 GHz. In the second part, a new material for FBAR devices was studied. The motivation is that AlN allows for a <b>restricted</b> <b>filter</b> bandwidth only, limited by its coupling factor of maximal 7 %. Monocrystalline KNbO 3 appears as an ideal alternative with its high coupling factor kt 2 of 47 %, and relatively large sound velocity of 8125 m/s for longitudinal waves along the [101] direction. Piezoelectricity of KNbO 3 films grown on electrodes has never been characterized. Single crystal {{results indicate that the}} optimal film texture would be (101). In this thesis, the growth of KNbO 3 films on Pt electrodes was studied with the goal to achieve this texture uniformly, and to characterize piezoelectric properties. X-band FBAR's were first studied with numerical simulations based on a one-dimensional theory of the thickness-extensional bulk acoustic wave (BAW). Thickness, acoustic properties and electrical conductivity of the electrodes have a large impact on the resonator characteristics. There are conflicting requirements with respect to optimum acoustic and electrical properties of the electrode materials. An optimum thickness was calculated for 8 GHz FBARs that use Pt bottom and Al top electrodes. The characteristics of ladder filters have been calculated based on the impedances of single resonators. The adjustable filter parameters, i. e. the areas of series and shunt resonators, frequency de-tuning between series and parallel resonators, and number of π-sections were screened for a process window offering maximum filter bandwidth with lowest ripple and low insertion loss for a given out-of-band rejection. An important result of the numerical simulations was that the bandwidth of ladder filters can be doubled by de-tuning the series and parallel resonators by more (1. 3 times) than the difference of resonance and anti-resonance frequency. This also leads to a flatter passband while keeping the ripples below ± 0. 2 dB. Solidly mounted resonators and filters were fabricated using an acoustic multilayer reflector consisting of AlN and SiO 2 λ/ 4 layers. All films were sputter deposited in a high vacuum sputter cluster system with 4 process chambers. The films were patterned using standard photolithography and dry etching processes. The SMR exhibited a strong and spurious-free resonance at 8 GHz with a high quality factor of 360 and electromechanical coupling coefficient of 6. 0 %. The temperature coefficient of frequency was - 18 ppm/K, and the voltage coefficient of frequency was - 72 ppm/V. Passband ladder filters with T- and π-topology consisting of 3 to 14 SMR were successfully demonstrated with a center frequency of 8 GHz. These filters were optimized for maximum bandwidth and exhibited an insertion loss of 5. 5 dB, a rejection of 32 dB, a 0. 2 dB bandwidth of 99 MHz (1. 3 %), and a 3 dB bandwidth of 224 MHz (2. 9 %). There was good correspondence between measured and simulated filter and resonator characteristics. For perfect agreement, parasitic elements needed to be taken into account. These were a series resistance of 5 Ω and a parallel conductance of 2 mS in case of single resonators. The series resistance can be explained with resistive losses in the electrodes, whereas the parallel conduction was due to conduction along the surface. For π-filters, an additional series inductance of 100 pH was needed to obtain a satisfactory fit. This inductance increased the out-of band rejection and insertion loss. Besides the group delay variation, all industrial specifications were met. KNbO 3 was in-situ sputter deposited at 500 to 600 °C using a rf magnetron source. A dedicated sputter chamber with load-lock and oxygen resistant substrate heater was built for this purpose. The high volatility of potassium oxide requires a potassium enrichment of the target. Targets with several excess concentrations (in the form of K 2 CO 3) were studied. Stoichiometric KNbO 3 films were obtained with targets containing 25 and 40 % excess K. Zero and 10 % excess yielded K deficient films, whereas 100 % and 200 % excess K led to highly unstable targets with K accumulation on the target surface, resulting in K rich second phases. The potassium-to-niobium ratio in the films depends strongly on sputter pressure and substrate temperature. Dense films, nucleated with cubic { 100 } texture, were obtained on platinized silicon substrates with a 10 nm thick IrO 2 seed layer at substrate temperatures of 520 °C. At lower temperatures the films were amorphous, and at higher temperatures the films were composed of individual and facetted KNbO 3 grains. The cubic high-temperature { 100 } texture results in a mixed (101) /(010) texture in the orthorhombic room temperature phase. The measured relative permitivity of 420 indicates that both orientations are equally present. Micro-Raman confirms the orthorhombic line splitting. Piezoelectrical and ferroelectrical activity were verified by means of a piezoelectric sensitive atomic force microscope. A very large piezoelectric activity was observed on some of the grains, and the polarization could be switched on most of the grains. However, the average d 33,f = e 33 /c 33, as measured by means of laser interferometry, showed a modest value of 24 pm/V. The effective coupling factor is derived as kt 2 = 2. 8 %, which is small relative to the theoretical value of 47 %. The high dielectric constant and the absence of piezoelectric activity along the [010] direction are responsible for the reduction of the kt 2 factor.

Bandpassfilter für Mikrowellenfrequenzen bestehend aus akustischen Raumwellen-Dünnschichtresonatoren (FBAR) sind eine vielversprechende Alternative zu den aktuellen Dielektrik-, und Oberflächenwellenfiltern (SAW) für den Einsatz in mobilen Telekommunikationsanwendungen. Bei gleichwertiger Funktionen sind FBAR Filter erheblich kleiner als dielektrische Filter und ermöglichen einen grösseren Leistungsdurchsatz als SAW-Filter. Zusätzlich bieten FBARs die Möglichkeit der on-chip Integration, die erhebliche Volumen- und Kosteneinsparungen ergibt. Die ersten passiven FBAR Bausteine, welche gegenwärtig auf dem Markt erscheinen, decken hauptsächlich den Bedarf von RF-Filter für die neuen Bänder um 2 Gigahertz ab. Ein FBAR ist im Wesentlichen eine dünne piezoelektrische Platte zwischen zwei Elektroden, die zum Energieeinschluss von der Umgebung akustisch isoliert ist. Wenn die Isolierung durch einen akustischen Bragg Reflektor erfolgt, spricht man von substrat-fixierten Resonatoren (SMR). Piezoelektrische dünne Schichte aus Aluminiumnitrid (AlN) werden bevorzugt in der aufkommenden FBAR Technologie eingesetzt. AlN zeichnet sich aus durch eine ausreichenden elektromechanische Kopplung, niedrige akustische Verluste bei Mikrowellenfrequenzen, einen tiefen Frequenz-Temperaturkoeffizienten, und gute chemische Kompatibilit ät mit CMOS Anforderungen. Diese Doktorarbeit hat zwei Forschungsrichtungen: Im ersten Teil wurden FBAR Strukturen, die auf AlN Dünnschichten basieren, für Anwendungen bei X-Band Frequenzen (7. 2 - 8. 5 Gigahertz) untersucht, d. h. bei viel höheren Frequenzen als gegenwärtig in der mobilen Telefonie verwendet werden. Das Ziel war, die Funktionalität begrenzenden Eigenschaften zu identifizieren, und der Industrie einen funktionstüchtigen 8 GHz SMR Filter zu demonstrieren. Im zweiten Teil wurde ein neues Material für den Einsatz in FBAR Vorrichtungen studiert, welches die durch seinen Kopplungsfaktor von maximal 7 % eingeschränkte Filterbandbreite von AlN, erweitern könnte. Mit seinem hohen Kopplungsfaktor kt 2 von 47 % und verhältnismässig grosser Schallgeschwindigkeit von 8125 m/s für Longitudinalwellen in [101] Richtung erscheint einkristallines KNbO 3 als ideale Alternative. Piezoelektrizität von KNbO 3 Dünnschichten, die auf Elektroden gewachsen werden, ist bisher nicht untersucht worden. In dieser Doktorarbeit wurde das Wachstum von KNbO 3 Dünnschichten auf Pt Elektroden mit dem Ziel studiert, diese optimale (101) -Textur gleichmässig aufzuwachsen, und die piezoelektrischen Eigenschaften zu charakterisieren. X-Band FBARs wurden zuerst mit numerischen Simulationen studiert, die auf einer eindimensionalen Theorie der longitudinalen akustischen Raumwelle (BAW) basieren. Schichtdicke, akustische Eigenschaften und elektrische Leitfähigkeit der Elektroden haben eine grosse Auswirkung auf die Resonatoreigenschaften. Optimale akustische und elektrische Eigenschaften stellen entgegengesetzte Anforderung an die Dicke der Elektroden. Die optimalen Schichtdicken für 8 GHz FBARs wurden bestimmt, wobei Al fü die obere und Pt für die untere Elektrode verwendet wurden. Die Eigenschaften der Bandpassfilter wurden Aufgrund der Impedanzen von einzelnen Resonatoren berechnet. Die wählbaren Filterparameter sind die Flächen der seriellen und parallelen Resonatoren, deren Frequenzdifferenz und die Anzahl π-Kreise. Optimale Kombinationen wurden ermittelt, die eine maximale Filterbandbreite mit niedrigster Welligkeit (Ripple) und limitierter Dämpfung bei einer gegebenen Signalunterdrückung ermöglichen. Als wichtiges Resultat ergab sich, dass die Bandbreite der Filter verdoppelt werden kann, falls die seriellen und parallelen Resonatoren um mehr (1. 3 mal) als der Differenz der Resonanz- und Antiresonanzfrequenz verstimmt werden. Dieses führt auch zu einem flacheren Durchlassbereich und limitiert die Rippel unter ± 0. 2 dB. Substrat-fixierte Resonatoren und Filter wurden auf einem akustischen mehrschichtigen Reflektor fabriziert, der aus AlN und SiO 2 λ/ 4 Schichten besteht. Alle Schichten wurden mittels Kathodenzerstäubung in einem UHV Clustersystem mit 4 Prozesskammern hergestellt. Die Strukturierung erfolgte mit Standardphotolithographie und Trocken- ätzprozessen. Die SMR zeigten eine starke und rippelfreie Resonanz bei 8 GHz mit einem hohen Qualitätsfaktor von 360 und elektromechanischem Kopplungskoeffizienten von 6. 0 %. Der Frequenz-Temperaturkoeffizient betrug - 18 ppm/K, und der Frequenz-Spannungskoeffizient - 72 ppm/V. Bandpassfilter mit T und π-Schaltungen, die aus 3 bis 14 SMR mit einer Mittenfrequenz von 8 GHz bestehen, wurden erfolgreich demonstriert. Diese Filter waren für eine maximale Bandbreite optimiert und zeigten eine Dämpfung von 5. 5 dB, eine Signalunterdrückung von 32 dB, eine 0. 2 dB Bandbreite von 99 MHz (1. 3 %) und eine 3 dB Bandbreite von 224 MHz (2. 9 %). Für die vollkommene Übereinstimmung zwischen den gemessenen und simulierten Filter- und Resonatoreigenschaften mussten parasitäre Elemente hinzugefügt werden. Diese bestanden aus einem Serienwiderstand von 5 Ω und einer parallelen Leitfähigkeit von 2 mS für die einzelnen Resonatoren. Der Serienwiderstand kann mit Widerstandsverlusten in den Elektroden erklärt werden, während die parallele Leitfähigkeit entlang der Oberfläche erfolgt. Für π-Filter war eine zusätzliche Serieninduktanz von 100 pH erforderlich um eine zufriedenstellende Übereinstimmung zu erreichen. Diese Induktanz erhöht die Signalunterdrückung und die Signaldämpfung. Ausser der Gruppenverzåögerungsänderung wurden alle industriellen Spezifikationen erfüllt. KNbO 3 Schichten wurde in-situ mit Kathodenzerstäubung (RF Magnetron) zwischen 500 und 600 °C abgeschieden. Zu diesem Zweck wurde eine spezielle Anlage mit Schleuse und oxydierungsresistenter Substratheizung gebaut. Die hohe Flüchtigkeit des Kaliumoxids erfordert eine Kaliumanreicherung des Targets. Targets mit mehreren Überschusskonzentrationen (in Form von K 2 CO 3) wurden studiert. Stöchiometrische KNbO 3 Schichten wurden mit Targets von 25, respektive 40 % Kaliumüberschuss erreicht. Null und 10 % Kaliumüberschuss führte zu kaliumarmen Schichten, während 100 % und 200 % Kaliumüberschuss zu einer K Anreicherung auf der Targetoberfläche und zu kaliumreichen Zweitphasen in der Schicht führte. Das Kalium zu Niobium Verhältnis in den Schichten hängt weiter stark von Prozessdruck und Substrattemperatur ab. Dichte, mit einer { 100 } Textur gekeimte Schichten wurden auf platinbedeckten Siliziumsubstrates mit einer 10 nm dicken IrO 2 Nukleationsschicht bei 520 °C abgeschieden. Bei niedrigeren Substrattemperaturen wurden amorphe Schichten, und bei höheren Substrattemperaturen wurden stark fazetierte quasi freistehende KNbO 3 Körner erzeugt. Die kubische Hochtemperaturtextur { 100 } führt zu einer gemischten (101) /(010) Texture in der orthorhombic Raumtemperaturphase. Die gemessene relative Dielektrizitätszahl εr= 420 weist darauf hin, dass beide Texturen gleichmässig vorhanden sind. Mikro-Raman Lichtstreuung bestätigt die orthorhombische Aufspaltung. Die piezoelektrische und ferroelektrische Aktivität wurden mittels eines piezoelektrisch empfindlichen Kraftmikroskops überprüft. Eine sehr grosse piezoelektrische Aktivität wurde auf einigen der Körner beobachtet, und die Polarisation konnte bei den meisten Körnern umgeschaltet werden. Die piezoelektrischen Konstante d 33,f = e 33 /c 33, die mittels der Laserinterferometrie gemessen wurde, zeigt jedoch einen tiefen Wert von 24 pm/V. Der effektive Kopplungsfaktor wird somit als kt 2 = 2. 8 % berechnet, was im Verhältnis zum theoretischen Wert von 47 % sehr klein ist. Die hohe Dielektrizitätskonstante und das Fehlen piezoelektrischer Aktivität entlang der [010] Richtung sind für die Reduzierung des kt 2 Faktors verantwortlich. Schichtrauhigkeit, Kompliziertheit des Zerstäubungsprozesses und die ungelöste Schichtpolung machen die KNbO 3 Integration in BAW Filter zu einer schwierigen Aufgabe...|$|E

This approach permits, as demonstrated with experimental PolSAR data, to model non-Gaussian scenarios. These models present also the advantage to correctly account for Gaussian scenarios in case of stationary areas. After modeling the speckle components of multidimensional SAR data, it is necessary to filter it, without affecting neither the useful information of the multidimensional data nor the signal morphology.

This investigation seeks to demonstrate that security and surveillance at sport mega-events are shaped, fundamentally, by efforts towards the increased flexibility, variability and mobility (in both space and time) of carefully orchestrated access, passage and border controls.

Complexity reduction {{of the order of}} (M/ 2) is achieved in <b>filtering</b> by <b>restricting</b> non-adjacent <b>filters</b> of PRFB non-overlapping. The channel filters of the proposed structure are shown {{to be related to the}} modelling system through the PRFB filters. The subband adaptive filtering algorithm is developed by making channel filters adaptive. An adaptive algorithm of NLMS type is derived for main channel filters by minimizing the mean-squared-error (MSE) criterion. The cross filters are derived from the main channel filters. Simulations reveal the modelling capability and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Plaque {{analysis}} in IVUS planes needs accurate intima and adventitia models. Large variety in adventitia descriptors difficulties its detection and motivates using a classification strategy for selecting {{points on the}} structure. Whatever the set of descriptors used, the selection stage suffers from fake responses due to noise and uncompleted true curves. In order to smooth background noise while strengthening responses, we apply a <b>restricted</b> anisotropic <b>filter</b> that homogenizes grey levels along the image significant structures. Candidate points are extracted {{by means of a}} simple semi supervised adaptive classification of the filtered image response to edge and calcium detectors. The final model is obtained by interpolating the former line segments with an anisotropic contour closing technique based on functional extension principles. ...|$|R

The AEC algorithm employs constrained Kalman filtering (CKF-AEC) that {{takes advantage of}} the uncorrelated reference signal from each remote channel [1], yet <b>restricts</b> the <b>filter</b> adaptation within the subspace determined by the spatialization functions used to virtualize each remote participant and the number of unique acoustic paths between the loudspeakers and microphone. In addition, the proposed algorithm allows the adaptation for channels without input signals. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm has much higher performance than the scheme proposed in [1] which uses NLMS as the adaptive filter and does not explore the available constraint...|$|R

We accomplish this using a Nelder-Mead search to minimize A_z(X_ν; 3 π [...]) over the X_ν-domain.|$|R
40|$|Parents are {{increasingly}} {{concerned about the}} risks their children run online. They fear their child is at risk from: talking with strangers, accessing inappropriate content, becoming 'addicted' and addling their brains. They are urged to become their own expert in their child's media use, and in the emerging media choices with which their child might be faced. They are encouraged to be hypervigilant and to delegate many monitoring and control functions {{to a range of}} automated tools which <b>restrict,</b> <b>filter</b> and report. But does this automation of parental concern protect children? Recent research endorses the ways in which parents used to approach this challenge, before the advent of automated 'helicopter' parenting and the latest scare stories about 13 year olds on hook-up apps. In simpler days, when ACMA conducted their 2007 study of Australian families online, parents were supported in their roles as guides and influencers of their children's behaviours. But that investigation was conducted at the tipping point where public debate became increasingly impacted by firstly Howard's family-friendly filter and then Conroy's mandatory filter {{at the level of the}} ISP. These were soon followed by the burgeoning availability of parental controls offering care-givers the illusory impression that they could automate cotrol of what and when (and to some extent where) their child could consume media. Now, in addition to legacy media guilting parents who prefer to negotiate on these issues, pro-automate parents put pressure on their non-compliant peers for providing the weak link in the control chain. It only takes one unfiltered access point to corrupt an entire peer group [...] . This paper examines the costs and benefits of an everyday automated approach to 'keeping children safe online', using original ethnographic research and integrating these data with other studies. status: publishe...|$|R

Methods and results We developed weighted allele scores based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with established associations with HDL-C, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). For each trait, we constructed two scores. The first was unrestricted, including all independent SNPs associated with the lipid trait identified from a priormeta-analysis (threshold P < 2 x 10 (- 6)); and the second a <b>restricted</b> score, <b>filtered</b> to remove any SNPs also associated with either {{of the other two}} lipid traits at P Conclusion The genetic findings support a causal effect of triglycerides on CHD risk, but a causal role for HDL-C, though possible, remains less certain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper aims {{to design}} a new {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) non-separable implementation of dyadic-valued cosine-sine modulated filter banks (2 D D-CSMFBs) for low computational complexity. CSMFBs satisfy rich directional selectivity (DS) and shift-invariance (SI), {{and they can be}} easily designed by the modulation of a prototype filter. In addition, our previous work introduced a one-dimensional (1 D) D-CSMFBs (1 D D-CSMFBs). By <b>restricting</b> real-valued <b>filter</b> coefficients to rational-valued ones, they can save computational cost while keeping DS and SI. The proposed 2 D implementation in this paper can further reduce the computational cost by unifying the conventional 2 D separable structure into a 2 D non-separable one directly. Furthermore, experimental results of image non-linear approximation show that the proposed 2 D D-CSMFBs are comparable or even better than the 1 D D-CSMFBs. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} domain {{plays a key}} role in the description of signals and systems. In the classical approaches, the individual frequency components are treated as independent: In linear systems, the superposition principle <b>restricts</b> the <b>filtering</b> to an OR-like processing of independent complex exponentials. Likewise, the classical second-order statistic (the powerspectrum) measures only the occurrence of each individual frequency component, independent of whether it occurs in a systematic combination with other components or not. This basic limitation can be overcome by the extension of the classical approaches to nonlinear systems and higher-order statistics, which makes it possible to selectively address AND-like combinations of frequency components. We measure which AND combinations are statistically most relevant in natural images, and investigate how this statistical structure can be exploited by nonlinear Volterra filters...|$|R

This phenomenon <b>restricts</b> the <b>filter’s</b> {{field of view}} and limits the practical application of narrow reflection notch filters. The amount of shift is inversely proportional to the effective average index of the composite film. A method of designing narrow notch optical filters with very broad field of view and controllable bandwidth is demonstrated. Because this method produces a filter that is predominantly composed of the high refractive index material, it will shift on angle less than a typical quarter-wave notch filter. Increasing the effective index of the filter also reduces the separation of S and P-polarized light with angle. This paper presents modeled and measured performance for both mid and far-infrared filters developed using this technique. Narrow notch discrete and rugate filter designs are compared...|$|R
