50|$|Currently, FEBT Rockhill Restoration Crew {{performs}} restoration work on {{the historic}} railroad at least one weekend per month, except October and December, {{as well as a}} special work week in May. FEBT volunteers restore buildings, machinery, <b>repair</b> <b>track</b> and rolling stock, provide tours, and help maintain the premises. Since 2002 substantial restoration has occurred on more than half the core maintenance shop complex. Several other buildings have received moderate to extensive restoration. Five pieces of rolling stock have been returned to operation with three more in progress. Six pieces of machinery in the maintenance shops have been restored to operation and some are being used to make parts for other restoration projects. Seven pieces of track have received work. The crew also works on restoration projects on parts of the railroad outside Rockhill Furnace.|$|E

5000|$|A works {{train engine}} dived nose-first into Camel Creek near Rodinga with a fireman {{sustained}} {{a broken leg}} after the 30 foot Camel Creek bridge was undermined. The train was an engine and three carriages and was <b>repairing</b> <b>tracks</b> from recent floods. The driver also sustained unspecified injuries.|$|R
2500|$|The {{freight train}} {{involved}} in the accident was [...] "tied down" [...] (parked) on an auxiliary track known as [...] "The Slide," [...] running parallel along {{the west side of}} the main tracks, waiting its turn to deliver <b>track</b> ballast to <b>repair</b> <b>tracks</b> on the former Southern Pacific Railroad's Coast Line which had been washed out by major January 2005 rainstorms.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-2000s, {{ridership}} {{had dropped}} greatly {{due to the}} lack of continued publicity. Services were reduced, which led to further decrease in patronage. By 2003 the train ran only four days a week. It was found that NYSW had used large amounts of state grants and tax breaks to fund freight service and <b>repair</b> <b>track</b> on its other lines, rather than for OnTrack as the money had been intended. Another reason for the lack of growth in ridership was the lack of stations in residential areas, limiting the line's use by commuters. In 2007 service had been cut to weekends only and ridership had declined to 50 passengers per day, far short of the 500 per day required to be profitable. NYSWR chairman Walter Rich, one of OnTrack's major proponents, died in 2007, and the railroad's interest in continuing OnTrack service diminished. Regular service was terminated indefinitely in July 2007. The Orange Express ran its last train in March 2008. The line continues to be used, infrequently, by freight trains.|$|E
40|$|Hydrolytic deamination of {{cytosine}} to uracil in DNA {{is increased}} in organisms adapted to high temperatures. Hitherto, the uracil base excision repair (BER) pathway {{has only been}} described in two archaeons, the crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilumand the euryarchaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, which are hyperthermophiles and use single-nucleotide replacement. In the former the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site intermediate is removed by the sequential action of a 5 ′-acting AP endonuclease and a 5 ′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase, whereas in the latter the AP site is primarily removed by a 3 ′-acting AP lyase, followed by a 3 ′-phosphodiesterase. We describe here uracil BER by a cell extract of the thermoacidophilic euryarchaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum, which prefers a similar short-patch repair mode as A. fulgidus. Importantly, T. acidophilumcell extract also efficiently executes ATP/ADP-stimulated long-patch BER {{in the presence of}} deoxynucleoside triphosphates, with a <b>repair</b> <b>track</b> of ∼ 15 nucleotides. Supplementation of recombinant uracil-DNA glycosylase (rTaUDG; ORF Ta 0477) increased the formation of short-patch at the expense of long-patch repair intermediates, and additional supplementation of recombinant DNA ligase (rTalig; Ta 1148) greatly enhanced repair product formation. TaUDG seems to recruit AP-incising and -excising functions to prepare for rapid single-nucleotide insertion and ligation, thus excluding slower and energy-costly long-patch BER...|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) Congenital {{heart disease}} (CHD) and heterotaxy {{patients}} have increased postoperative and respiratory complications. We recently showed CHD-heterotaxy patients can have respiratory ciliary dysfunction (CD) {{similar to that}} associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, including low nasal nitric oxide and abnormal ciliary motion. In this study, we investigated whether CHD-heterotaxy patients with CD may have worse postsurgical outcomes. MethodsWe examined postsurgical outcome in 13 heterotaxy-CHD patients with CD (25 surgeries), compared with 14 heterotaxy-CHD patients without CD (27 surgeries). Outcome data were collected for each surgery, including respiratory complications, tracheostomy, use of inhaled β-agonists or nitric oxide, length of hospital stay, days on ventilator, and death. ResultsThe CD versus the no-CD CHD cohorts had similar Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery- 1 risk categories, <b>repair</b> <b>track,</b> age at surgery, and follow-up evaluation times. Respiratory complications (76 % vs 37 %; P = . 006), need for tracheostomy (16 % vs 0 %; P = . 047), and use of inhaled β-agonists (64 % vs 11 %; P = . 0001) all were increased significantly in heterotaxy-CHD patients with CD. No significant differences were detected in postoperative hospital stay, days on mechanical ventilation, or surgical mortality. A trend toward increased mortality for the CD group beyond the postoperative period was observed (33 % vs 0 %; P = . 055) in patients younger than age 10 years. ConclusionsOur findings showed that heterotaxy-CHD patients with CD may have increased risks for respiratory deficiencies. Overall, there was a trend toward increased mortality in CD patients with intermediate follow-up evaluation. Because β-agonists are known to increase ciliary beat frequency, presurgical screening for CD and perioperative treatment of CD patients with inhaled β-agonists may improve postoperative outcomes and survival...|$|E

The first train arrived at Cold Brook Station on July 4, 2008: the first regularly scheduled passenger train {{to arrive at}} the station since 1954. Because Cold Brook station remains privately owned, the railroad maintained no agency there and there are no facilities to board or discharge passengers. In 2009, the CMRR <b>repaired</b> <b>track</b> another [...]8 miles to the Boiceville Bridge at MP 21.3, for work trains only.|$|R
50|$|Aliens are {{beginning}} their attack on Planet X, shooting lasers at the track. The {{goal is to}} bring the Queen of X to her secret fortress down the line, <b>repairing</b> <b>track</b> destroyed by UFOs to get there. In the original version, an extra section of track allows the player to begin the mission without taking the crane, which is required to fix any broken track. Thanks to the near-impossibility of completing the job without the crane, the passing track was removed in the Deluxe version.|$|R
50|$|Bromberg-Ost (Konzentrationslager Bromberg-Ost) was {{the female}} subcamp of the German Nazi {{concentration}} camp KL Stutthof between 1944-1945, {{set up in}} the city of Bydgoszcz during the later stages of World War II. The mostly Jewish women prisoners dispatched from the main camp in Sztutowo worked as slave-labour for the German railways; loading cargo, clearing and <b>repairing</b> <b>tracks,</b> and digging ditches. The commandant of the camp was SS-Scharführer Anton Kniffke. No warm clothing was provided before mid-December. Women who managed to survive were taken on a death march to Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg.|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of his}} civic-improvement {{efforts in}} New Haven, Berkowitz began asking local {{officials}} for infrastructure repairs, tree trimming and other public services. He was frustrated by the difficulty of communicating with government employees {{and a lack of}} a mechanism for followup. He conceived a civic engagement website where citizens could pinpoint issues like broken streetlights and potholes on a map and forward the repair requests to local officials. The problems could be publicly documented and their progress toward <b>repairs</b> <b>tracked</b> through a geographic information system. In the spring of 2008, Berkowitz launched SeeClickFix with partners Miles Lasater, Kam Lasater and Jeff Blasius.|$|R
5000|$|Seymour commandeered five {{trains in}} Tianjin and {{departed}} for Beijing with his entire {{force on the}} morning of 10 June. The first day the soldiers travelled 25 miles without incident, crossing a bridge at Yancun over the Hai River unopposed, although Chinese Gen. Nie Shicheng and thousands of his soldiers were camped there, Nie's soldiers were [...] "friendly" [...] and did not attack. [...] The next few days went slowly, as Seymour had to <b>repair</b> railroad <b>tracks</b> and fight off Boxer attacks as his trains advanced. On June 14 several hundred Boxers armed with swords, spears and clumsy gingals attacked Seymour twice and killed five Italian soldiers. The Americans counted 102 Boxer bodies left on the battlefield {{at the end of one}} battle. [...] Seymour continued to <b>repair</b> <b>tracks</b> and advanced very slowly. Chinese Gen. Nie let Seymour's army slip past in trains, because Ronglu had deliberately issued contradictory orders that left Nie confused. However, the Muslim forces were not [...] "confused", and immediately set out attacking the foreigners.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{build up}} to the battle at Tell El Kebir the {{specially}} raised 8th Railway Company RE operated trains carrying stores and troops, as well as <b>repairing</b> <b>track.</b> On {{the day of the}} battle they ran a train into Tell El Kebir station at between 8-9am (13 September) and [...] "found it completely blocked with trains, full of the enemy's ammunition: the line strewn with dead and wounded, and our own soldiers swarming over the place almost mad for want of water" [...] (extract from Captain Sidney Smith's diary), Once the station was cleared they began to ferry the wounded, prisoners and troops with stores to other destinations.|$|R
