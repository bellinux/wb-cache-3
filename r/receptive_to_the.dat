At that time he went to Paris, and later, Milan, where his idea received support from Napoleon Bonaparte, who saw the Poles as a promising source of new recruits, and who superficially appeared <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of liberating Poland. Dąbrowski was soon authorized by the French-allied Cisalpine Republic to create the Polish Legions, which would be part of {{the army of the}} newly created Republic of Lombardy. This agreement, drafted by Napoleon, was signed on 9 January 1797, and marked the formal creation of the Legions.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 53 - 55 This study sought <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> receptivity {{of learners}} to role playing. This study mainly aimed at learning if Turkish {{high school students}} agree with the researchers who have made many positive assumptions about role playing. The {{study was conducted with}} 12 students of the upper intermediate EFL level at the Bilkent University Preparatory School (BUPS) in Ankara, Turkey. In this study, <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> extent of students' receptivity <b>to</b> role playing, <b>the</b> researcher investigated five aspects of receptivity: How <b>receptive</b> are learners <b>to</b> their fellow learners? How <b>receptive</b> are learners <b>to</b> <b>the</b> teacher's way of teaching? How <b>receptive</b> are learners <b>to</b> <b>the</b> teaching materials? How <b>receptive</b> are learners <b>to</b> being successful? How <b>receptive</b> are learners <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of communicating with others? To identify students' receptivity, data gathered from three different sources [...] observations, a students' questionnaire, and an interview with the teacher [...] were triangulated.

5|$|Some breeders {{have shown}} concern {{regarding}} {{the lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool. Researchers who completed the 2007 DNA {{study found that the}} Singapura (along with the Burmese) have the least genetic diversity among the 22 breeds studied. The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the genetic diversity had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea, preferring to use Singapuras from around the world that are not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen have to meet certain health and appearance requirements.|$|E

Coghlan married Gertrude in Wynberg, a southern suburb of Cape Town, on 10 January 1899. Around this time Coghlan's friend Percy Ross Frames invited him to join him in Bulawayo, one of the main settlements in Rhodesia, as Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the adjoining areas were now collectively called. Coghlan was <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea, but was compelled to stay in Kimberley by the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899. Kimberley was besieged by Boer forces, cut off by rail and telephone, from 14 October until its relief by General John French on 15 February 1900.|$|E

They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} oestrus itself, when the female is <b>receptive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> male, lasts about 24 hours, and {{observations}} have placed its recurrence between 21 and 25 days. Rhinos in the Cincinnati Zoo {{have been observed}} copulating for 30–50 minutes, similar in length to other rhinos; observations at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre in Malaysia have shown a briefer copulation cycle. As the Cincinnati Zoo has had successful pregnancies, and other rhinos also have lengthy copulatory periods, a lengthy rut may be the natural behavior. Though researchers observed successful conceptions, all these pregnancies ended in failure {{for a variety of}} reasons until the first successful captive birth in 2001; studies of these failures at the Cincinnati Zoo discovered the Sumatran rhino's ovulation is induced by mating and it had unpredictable progesterone levels. Breeding success was finally achieved in 2001, 2004, and 2007 by providing a pregnant rhino with supplementary progestin.|$|E
