Since MNs appear to form a <b>replicative</b> <b>mechanism</b> in which a portion of the observer's brain replicates the agent's brain, MNs have been considered evidence in favor of ST.

40|$|The genomic {{duplication}} {{associated with}} Potocki-Lupski syndrome (PTLS) maps {{in close proximity}} to the duplication associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A (CMT 1 A). PTLS is characterized by hypotonia, failure to thrive, reduced body weight, intellectual disability, and autistic features. CMT 1 A is a common autosomal dominant distal symmetric peripheral polyneuropathy. The key dosage-sensitive genes RAI 1 and PMP 22 are respectively associated with PTLS and CMT 1 A. Recurrent duplications accounting for the majority of subjects with these conditions are mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination between distinct low-copy repeat (LCR) substrates. The LCRs flanking a contiguous genomic interval encompassing both RAI 1 and PMP 22 do not share extensive homology; thus, duplications encompassing both loci are rare and potentially generated by a different mutational mechanism. We characterized genomic rearrangements that simultaneously duplicate PMP 22 and RAI 1, including nine potential complex genomic rearrangements, in 23 subjects by high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization and breakpoint junction sequencing. Insertions and microhomologies were found at the breakpoint junctions, suggesting potential <b>replicative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for rearrangement formation. At the breakpoint junctions of these nonrecurrent rearrangements, enrichment of repetitive DNA sequences was observed, indicating that they might predispose to genomic instability and rearrangement. Clinical evaluation revealed blended PTLS and CMT 1 A phenotypes with a potential earlier onset of neuropathy. Moreover, additional clinical findings might be observed due to the extra duplicated material included in the rearrangements.

Nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) or crossing-over in meiosis between sequences that are not in allelic positions (i. e., paralogous sequences) can result in recurrent deletions or duplications causing genomic disorders. Previous studies of NAHR have focused on description of the phenomenon, but it remains unclear how NAHR occurs during meiosis and what factors determine its frequency. Here we assembled two patient cohorts with reciprocal genomic disorders; deletion associated Smith-Magenis syndrome and duplication associated Potocki-Lupski syndrome. By assessing the full spectrum of rearrangement types from the two cohorts, we find that complex rearrangements (those with more than one breakpoint) are more prevalent in copy-number gains (17. 7 %) than in copy-number losses (2. 3 %); an observation that supports a role for <b>replicative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in complex rearrangement formation. Interestingly, for NAHR-mediated recurrent rearrangements, we show that crossover frequency is positively associated with the flanking low-copy repeat (LCR) length and inversely influenced by the inter-LCR distance.

The existence of transposons was postulated in the late 1940s by Barbara McClintock, who was studying the inheritance of maize, but the actual molecular basis for transposition was described by later groups. McClintock discovered that pieces of the chromosomes changed their position, jumping from one chromosome to another. The repositioning of these transposons (which coded for color) allowed other genes for pigment to be expressed. Transposition in maize causes changes in color; however, in other organisms, such as bacteria, it can cause antibiotic resistance. Transposition is also important in creating genetic diversity within species and adaptability to changing living conditions. During the course of human evolution, as much as 40% of the human genome has moved around via methods such as transposition of transposons.|$|R

Approximately 100 distinct recombinant genomes have been identified. The majority of crossovers occurred between nonhomologous segments of the partners and might have resulted from transesterification reactions, not necessarily involving an enzymatic activity. Some of the crossover loci are clustered. The origin of some of these “hot spots ” could be explained by invoking structures similar to known ribozymes. A significant proportion of recombinant RNAs contained the entire 5 * partner, if its 3 * end was oxidized or phosphorylated prior to being mixed with the 3 * partner. All of these observations are consistent with a mechanism that involves intermediary formation of the 2 *, 3 *-cyclic phosphate and 5 *-hydroxyl termini.

Insertion sequence IS 10 is thought to transpose by a nonreplicative mechanism. In the simplest models, nonreplicative transposition cannot give rise to an adjacent deletion because an intrinsic feature of such transposition is excision of the IS element from the donor location. We report here that IS 10 can generate adjacent deletions, but at a frequency which is approximately 1 / 30 th the frequency of transposition for the same element.

Monomeric genomic components may be generated either by homologous recombination or, when {{two copies of}} the origin of replication (ori) are present, by a modified rolling circle replication mechanism in which nascent single-stranded DNA is resolved by the introduction of nicks at both oris. DNA B partial repeats with duplicated common region sequences containing combinations of wild-type sequences and nonlethal mutations at nucleotides 151 and 155 within the putative stem—loop region have been constructed and introduced into plants in the presence of DNA A. Analysis of progeny indicates that monomers are generated by DNA strand nicking preferentially between nucleotides 151 and 155, suggesting a nonrandom <b>replicative</b> release <b>mechanism</b> involving the ubiquitous TAATATTAC motif (nucleotides 146 – 154). Viable ACMV DNA A deletion mutants are known to revert to wild-type size during systemic infection by generating tandem repeats.

We find that E 1 unwinds DNA with a strand-exclusion mechanism, with the N-terminal side of the helicase ring facing the replication fork.

40|$|New human {{mutations}} {{are thought}} to originate in germ cells, thus making a recurrence of the same mutation in a sibling exceedingly rare. However, increasing sensitivity of genomic technologies has anecdotally revealed mosaicism for mutations in somatic tissues of apparently healthy parents. Such somatically mosaic parents might also have germline mosaicism that can potentially cause unexpected intergenerational recurrences. Here, we show that somatic mosaicism for transmitted mutations among {{parents of children with}} simplex genetic disease is more common than currently appreciated. Using the sensitivity of individual-specific breakpoint PCR, we prospectively screened 100 families with children affected by genomic disorders due to rare deletion copy-number variants (CNVs) determined to be de novo by clinical analysis of parental DNA. Surprisingly, we identified four cases of low-level somatic mosaicism for the transmitted CNV in DNA isolated from parental blood. Integrated probabilistic modeling of gametogenesis developed in response to our observations predicts that mutations in parental blood increase recurrence risk substantially more than parental mutations confined to the germline. Moreover, despite the fact that maternally transmitted mutations are the minority of alleles, our model suggests that sexual dimorphisms in gametogenesis result in a greater proportion of somatically mosaic transmitting mothers who are thus at increased risk of recurrence. Therefore, somatic mosaicism together with sexual differences in gametogenesis might explain a considerable fraction of unexpected recurrences of X-linked recessive disease.

Replication is associated with both major classes of transposition mechanisms: cut-and-paste and cointegrate formation (paste-and-copy). Cut-and-paste transposition is often activated by replication of the transposon, while in cointegrate formation replication completes integration. We describe a novel transposition mechanism used by insertion sequence IS 911, which we call copy-and-paste. IS 911 transposes using a circular intermediate (circle), which then integrates into a target. We demonstrate that this is derived from a branched intermediate (figure-eight) in which both ends are joined by a single-strand bridge after a first-strand transfer. In vivo labelling experiments show {{that the process of}} circle formation is replicative. The results indicate that the replication pathway not only produces circles from figure-eight but also regenerates the transposon donor plasmid.

The present work {{is focused on}} the characterization of the activities mediated by the transposase protein (TnpA) of the bacterial transposon Tn 4430 belonging to the Tn 3 family. TnpA catalyzes replicative transposition of Tn 4430 and target immunity that prevents multiple insertions of the transposon into the same DNA molecule. Very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that control the transposition and target immunity reactions catalyzed by TnpA of the Tn 3 family. In this study, we have achieved decisive steps toward the understanding of the <b>replicative</b> transposition <b>mechanism</b> by developing in vitro reactions with TnpA reproducing specific steps of the transposition process. Additional observations have also revealed an unexpected link between the mechanism of DNA targeting by Tn 4430 and DNA replication, suggesting a mechanism for recruiting replication machinery during the replicative transposition. This work also provides important findings toward the understanding of target immunity. We first showed that formation of a specific complex between TnpA and the immunizing transposon is necessary to generate immunity. In addition, the biochemical assays revealed that TnpA mutants affected in their immunity function had promiscuous activities when compared to wild type TnpA, suggesting that the activity of the protein is normally tightly regulated. Finally, we were interested in the biological significance of target immunity. We tested the involvement of this process in avoiding intra-molecular replicative transposition leading to deleterious events within the DNA molecule.

After a culture becomes confluent the rate of division varies either with cell motility or with the average area of the culture surface occupied by a cell, suggesting that cell-to-cell contact affects the rate of division by restraining the area and movements of the cell surface. Thus effective inhibition of division would require adequate contact inhibition of movement (which describes the tendency of cells to avoid moving across one another) and also adequate adhesions between cell borders.

Unit-length circular HCMV genomes lacking terminal restriction fragments were detected starting 4 h after infection even when cells were treated with aphidicolin, phosphonoacetic acid, or cycloheximide. Viral DNA synthesis began 24 h after infection and produced large amounts of high-molecular-weight replicative DNA that was a precursor of progeny genomes. Replicative DNA contained rare terminal restriction fragments, and long-arm termini were much less frequent than short-arm termini. Replicative DNA was not composed of unit-length circles because low-dose gamma irradiation of replicative DNA generated numerous random high-molecular-weight fragments rather than unit-length molecules. PacI digestion of replicative DNA from a recombinant HCMV with two closely spaced PacI sites revealed that replicative DNA is concatemeric and genome segment inversion occurs after concatemer synthesis. These results show that after circularization of the parental genome, DNA synthesis produces concatemers and genomic inversion occurs within concatemeric DNA. The results further suggest that concatemers acquire genomic termini during the cleavage/packaging process which preferentially inserts short-arm termini into empty capsids, causing a predominance of short-arm termini on the concatemer...|$|E
40|$|The tau and gamma {{subunits}} of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme {{are both}} {{products of the}} dnaX gene. Since tau and gamma are required as stoichiometric components of the <b>replicative</b> complex, a <b>mechanism</b> must exist for the cell to coordinate their synthesis and ensure that both subunits are present in an adequate quantity and ratio for assembly. We have proposed that gamma is produced by a translational frameshift event. In this report, we describe the use of dnaX-lacZ fusions in all three reading frames to demonstrate that gamma, the shorter product of dnaX, is generated by ribosomal frameshifting to the - 1 reading frame of the mRNA within an oligo(A) sequence that {{is followed by a}} sequence predicted to form a stable secondary structure. Immediately after frameshifting a stop codon is encountered, leading to translational termination. Mutagenesis of the oligo(A) sequence abolishes frameshifting, and partial disruption of the predicted distal secondary structure severely impairs the efficiency. Comparison of the expression of lacZ fused to dnaX distal to the site of frameshifting in the - 1 and 0 reading frames indicates that the efficiency of frameshifting is approximately 40 %...|$|R
40|$|Pituitary tumor {{transforming}} gene (PTTG 1, securin) {{is involved}} in cell-cycle control through inhibition of sister-chromatid separation. Elevated levels of PTTG 1 {{were found to be}} associated with many different tumor types that might be involved in late stage tumor progression. However, the role of PTTG 1 in early stage of tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we utilized the adenovirus expression system to deliver PTTG 1 into normal human fibroblasts to evaluate the role of PTTG 1 in tumorigenesis. Expressing PTTG 1 in normal human fibroblasts inhibited cell proliferation. Several senescence-associated (SA) phenotypes including increased SA-β-galactosidase activities, decreased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and increased SA-heterochromatin foci formation were also observed in PTTG 1 -expressing cells, indicating that PTTG 1 overexpression induced a senescent phenotype in normal cells. Significantly, the PTTG 1 -induced senescence is p 53 -dependent and telomerase-independent, which is distinctively different from that of <b>replicative</b> senescence. The <b>mechanism</b> of PTTG 1 -induced senescence was also analyzed. Consistent with its role in regulating sister-chromatid separation, overexpression of PTTG 1 inhibited the activation of separase. Consequently, the numbers of cells with abnormal nuclei morphologies and chromosome separations were increased, which resulted in activation of the DNA damage response. Thus, we concluded that PTTG 1 overexpression in normal human fibroblasts caused chromosome instability, which subsequently induced p 53 -dependent senescence through activation of DNA-damage response pathway...|$|R
40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Xanthomonas {{are among the most}} {{important}} phytopathogens. A key feature of Xanthomonas pathogenesis is the translocation of type III secretion system (T 3 SS) effector proteins (T 3 SEs) into the plant target cells via a T 3 SS. Several T 3 SEs and a murein lytic transglycosylase gene (mlt, required for citrus canker symptoms) are found associated with three transposition-related genes in Xanthomonas citri plasmid pXAC 64. These are flanked by short inverted repeats (IRs). The region was identified as a transposon, TnXax 1, with typical Tn 3 family features, including a transposase and two recombination genes. Two 14 -bp palindromic sequences within a 193 -bp potential resolution site occur between the recombination genes. Additional derivatives carrying different T 3 SEs and other passenger genes occur in different Xanthomonas species. The T 3 SEs include transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs). Certain TALEs are flanked by the same IRs as found in TnXax 1 to form mobile insertion cassettes (MICs), suggesting that they may be transmitted horizontally. A significant number of MICs carrying other passenger genes (including a number of TALE genes) were also identified, flanked by the same TnXax 1 IRs and delimited by 5 -bp target site duplications. We conclude that a large fraction of T 3 SEs, including individual TALEs and potential pathogenicity determinants, have spread by transposition and that TnXax 1, which exhibits all of the essential characteristics of a functional transposon, may be involved in driving MIC transposition. We also propose that TALE genes may diversify by fork slippage during the replicative Tn 3 family transposition. These mechanisms may {{play a crucial role in}} the emergence of Xanthomonas pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE Xanthomonas genomes carry many insertion sequences (IS) and transposons, which play an important role in their evolution and architecture. This study reveals a key relationship between transposons and pathogenicity determinants in Xanthomonas. We propose that several transposition events mediated by a Tn 3 -like element carrying different sets of passenger genes, such as different type III secretion system effectors (including transcription activation-like effectors [TALEs]), were determinant in the evolution and emergence of Xanthomonas pathogenicity. TALE genes are DNA-binding effectors that modulate plant transcription. We also present a model for generating TALE gene diversity based on fork slippage associated with the <b>replicative</b> transposition <b>mechanism</b> of Tn 3 -like transposons. This may provide a mechanism for niche adaptation, specialization, host-switching, and other lifestyle changes. These results will also certainly lead to novel insights into the evolution and emergence of the various diseases caused by different Xanthomonas species and pathovars...|$|R
