5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to killer whales being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly <b>recently,</b> <b>about</b> 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{traces of}} human habitation in the Beijing municipality {{were found in}} the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. Homo erectus fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic Homo sapiens also lived there more <b>recently,</b> <b>about</b> 27,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in downtown Beijing.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} 41 medical schools in South Korea. Medical {{programs}} in South Korea {{used to be}} direct-entry programs {{such as in the}} UK, taking six years to complete. However, most universities were going through a transition from direct-entry to a 4+4 year system, such as those found in the United States and Canada. <b>Recently,</b> <b>about</b> half of the universities are converting back to six years direct-entry program by 2015, and almost all of the universities are converting it back by 2017.|$|E

25|$|Argentina's {{population}} {{has long had}} one of Latin America's lowest birth rates and population growth rates (<b>recently,</b> <b>about</b> 1% a year), but it enjoys a comparatively low infant mortality rate. The median age is approximately 30 years and life expectancy at birth is of 76 years. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines speak English (though only 15.4% of those claimed {{to have a high}} level of English comprehension), 8.3% speak Portuguese and 6.9% speak Italian.|$|E
25|$|Bottom fishing has {{operated}} {{for over a}} century on heavily fished grounds such as the North Sea and Grand Banks. While overfishing has long been recognised as causing major ecological changes to the fish community on the Grand Banks, concern has been raised more <b>recently</b> <b>about</b> the damage which benthic trawling inflicts upon seabed communities. A species of particular concern is the slow growing, deep water coral Lophelia pertusa. This species is home to a diverse community of deep sea organisms, but is easily damaged by fishing gear. On 17 November 2004, the United Nations General Assembly urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling.|$|E
25|$|The {{proportion}} of people under 15 is 25.6%, a little below the world average of 28%, and the {{proportion of}} people 65 and older is relatively high at 10.8%. In Latin America this is second only to Uruguay and well above the world average, which is currently 7%. Argentina has one of Latin America's lowest population growth rates, <b>recently</b> <b>about</b> 1% a year, as well as a comparatively low infant mortality rate. Its birth rate of 2.3 children per woman is still nearly twice as high as that in Spain or Italy, compared here as they have similar religious practices and proportions. The median age is approximately 30 years and life expectancy at birth is 77.14 years.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{estimated}} average cost per unit of electric power must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities, borrowed funds, return to investors (including cost of risk), estimated annual production, and other components, averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment, which may be in excess of twenty years. Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially. In 2004, wind energy cost a fifth of what {{it did in the}} 1980s, and some expected that downward trend to continue as larger multi-megawatt turbines were mass-produced. In 2012 capital costs for wind turbines were substantially lower than 2008–2010 but still above 2002 levels. A 2011 report from the American Wind Energy Association stated, [...] "Wind's costs have dropped over the past two years, in the range of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour <b>recently....</b> <b>about</b> 2 cents cheaper than coal-fired electric power, and more projects were financed through debt arrangements than tax equity structures last year.... winning more mainstream acceptance from Wall Street's banks.... Equipment makers can also deliver products in the same year that they are ordered instead of waiting up to three years {{as was the case in}} previous cycles.... 5,600 MW of new installed capacity is under construction in the United States, more than double the number at this point in 2010. Thirty-five percent of all new power generation built in the United States since 2005 has come from wind, more than new gas and coal plants combined, as power providers are increasingly enticed to wind as a convenient hedge against unpredictable commodity price moves." ...|$|E

[...] A number of recently devised methods can assess the DNA methylation status in cancers versus normal tissues. [...] Some methods assess methylation of CpGs located in different classes of loci, including CpG islands, shores, and shelves as well as promoters, gene bodies, and intergenic regions.

2500|$|Since even {{ships of}} ice class 1A Super {{are assumed to}} rely on {{icebreaker}} assistance from time to time, a research was conducted <b>recently</b> <b>about</b> introducing a new ice class exceeding all existing ice classes, 1A Super+, for ships capable of independent operation in all ice conditions and therefore reducing the need of icebreaker assistance in some ports. These ships could also be granted [...] "icebreaker status" [...] and their higher operating costs could be partially covered by government subsidies from the same funds {{that are used to}} cover the cost of icebreaker assistance.

2500|$|In Dubuque, the Catholic {{schools are}} all part of the Holy Family system. [...] There has been much {{controversy}} <b>recently</b> <b>about</b> how to best run the schools. [...] The administrators of the system had recently made plans to reorganize the schools. [...] This was due to factors such as a declining number of students attending Catholic schools. [...] An especially controversial move that was proposed was to turn St. Anthony's school into a central school for certain grades. [...] Parents of the parish felt that their concerns were being ignored. [...] Eventually, the Archdiocesan Board of Education vetoed the plan, and told the school system to continue work on planning the system's future.|$|E
2500|$|A {{report from}} the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that the {{livestock}} sector is [...] "responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions". The IPCC estimates that Cattle and other livestock emit about 80 to 93 Megatonnes of methane per year, accounting for an estimated 37% of anthropogenic methane emissions, and additional methane is produced by anaerobic fermentation of manure in manure lagoons and other manure storage structures. The net change in atmospheric methane content was <b>recently</b> <b>about</b> 1 Megatonne per year, [...] and in some recent {{years there has been}} no increase in atmospheric methane content. [...] While cattle fed forage actually produce more methane than grain-fed cattle, the increase may be offset by the increased carbon recapture of pastures, which recapture three times the CO2 of cropland used for grain.|$|E
