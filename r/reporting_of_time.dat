40|$|This study aims {{to address}} the impact of ethical culture to the reduced audit quality (RAQ) and under <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (URT) act under {{conditions}} of time budget pressure. In addition, {{this study examined the}} relationship between time budget pressure and ethical culture. This study is a replication of the study Svanberg and Ohman (2013) in Sweden. The independent variables are time budget pressures. The dependent variable consisted of reduced audit quality acts, under <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and ethical culture. Moderating variable in this study is a culture of ethics. Researchers assume that the ethical culture has aspects that can be the deciding factor of how auditors react when faced with a pressure which in turn affects the quality of the audit. The reason researchers to replicate because this is the first study to report the effect of ethical culture on dysfunctional auditor behavior using actual self-reported frequencies of reduced audit quality acts and under <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> as data. In this study in the form of primary data collected by using a questionnaire. The samples used in the 42 auditors to evaluate the effect of independent variables on the RAQ acts or URT. The method used for the determination of the sample of this study was non-probability. The findings of each factor on the dependent variable is done by using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that the time budget pressure influence the behavior of a decline in audit quality. When ethical culture strong, reduced audit quality acts and URT will decline. While the types of tests performed on the auditor did not provide statistically significant results. Time budget pressure is not related to the behavior of URT and Ethical Culture. Reduced audit quality effect on URT. So that the impact of time budget pressure when there is a decline in the quality audit stated that the lower the complexity of the work is not in accordance with auditing standards and independence of audi...|$|E

40|$|In the {{investigation}} of computer crimes time plays an important role. Files on a computer system are time-stamped, meaning as each file is modified, created, or accessed, the time at which these events happen is recorded. Investigators of computer crimes correlate these time-stamps to events on a computer system. Computer systems that have inaccurate clocks {{make it difficult for}} an investigator to perform time-event correlation. A successful correlation depends upon time-stamps and corroborating evidence that can link events to times. Typical computers are built with inexpensive materials and as such have inaccurate clocks. The use of an inaccurate clock can be observed as a clock skew: the time reported by the clock degrades over time making the clock lag behind or move past real time. A clock model represents how a computer clock behaves in it’s <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The clock model includes all of the discrete time events in the clock’s history.

Dysfunctional audit behaviors include auditors’ act during performance audit program which directly or indirectly reduced audit quality namely audit quality reduction (AQR) and Under <b>Reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> (URT) behaviors.

The result of confirmatory factor analyses and test of reliability and validity provide support for three separate dimensions of professional commitment. Affective professional commitment has negative associated with AQR behavior, but it relationship with URT behavior is not significant. The influence of continuance professional commitment to AQR and URT behaviors is not significant. Normative professional commitment is inversely related to AQR and URT behaviors.

40|$|Aims and background. Trastuzumab, a humanized {{monoclonal}} antibody {{directed against the}} extracellular domain of ErbB, has determined clinical benefit for women affected bymetastatic or early stage HER 2 -positive breast cancer and never previously treated with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab is generally used as first-line treatment of HER 2 + metastatic breast cancer and is currently administered beyond progression even without clear evidence supporting such clinical practice. In fact, HER 2 -positive metastatic breast cancer has {{a high risk of}} progressing after first-line therapy, and second- line treatments vary. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate by a systematic review the efficacy of trastuzumab-based treatments beyond progression in HER 2 -positive metastatic breast cancer. Materials and methods. We performed a systematic review using Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library data bases and publications in principalmeetings or congresses of oncology in Europe and America until September 2008. The main selection criterium was the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to progression, calculated from the start of each trastuzumab-based therapy to the date of progressive disease or death. Results. Twelve studieswere selected that included a total of 516 patients. Theweighted mean time to progression was 23. 66 weeks (standard deviation, 4. 37) and the median was 26 weeks (range, 13 - 39). Interestingly, combined trastuzumab plus vinorelbine treatment showed a lower mean and median time to progression (20. 59 and 19. 57 weeks, respectively), whereas trastuzumab plus capecitabine yielded a mean time to progression of 30. 33 weeks. Conclusions. The added value of the present study has been to provide a quantitative summary measure of time to progression which can be used for comparisons between current and future available regimens.
