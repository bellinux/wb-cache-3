40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{progression}} of damage in carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) countersunk composite bolted joints (CBJs) with neat-fit clearance, subjected to quasi-static loading. Damage mechanisms, comprising of fibre buckling and breakage, matrix damage, shear damage and inter-laminar delamination within the CFRP composite parts of the joints have been studied. Load-displacement curves, X-ray and optical microscopic images in single- and three-bolt CBJs were used to investigate damage and deformation characteristics. The observations were then employed to further investigate the type of failure {{and the extent of}} damage. The evolution of damage within the composite parts was correlated to the failure characteristics of the joints: It was found that the type and extension of damage is strongly correlated with the ultimate failure load point of the joint in single-bolt CBJs. A combined inter/intra-laminar damage consisting of fibre cluster breakage, extensive fibre buckling, debonding and delamination was observed at the ultimate failure load. This study was then extended to three-bolt CBJ where damage surrounding each bolt and its corresponding failure load was strongly correlated: The final study showed that the ultimate failure point in single-bolt CBJ and the first-bolt-failure point in three-bolt CBJ correspond to the composite plies undergoing intra-laminar damage with the size reaching {{to the edge of the}} <b>countersunk</b> <b>head.</b> This damage developed extensively through the thickness of the composite parts underneath the countersink, and in the direction opposite to the loading direction. Outside the <b>countersunk</b> <b>head,</b> debonding and delamination were found to be the dominant damage driving mechanisms. Finally, a new design rule has been proposed to predict the response of multi-bolt joints (damage area and failure load) by using the response in single-bolt CBJ as an initial baseline...|$|R

However, kitchen cabinet supplier is facing with major problem regarding to the increasing number of failure that occurred at the screw jointing during kitchen cabinet installation. Thus, the objective of the study is to observed the failure or damages during screw fixing on kitchen cabinet. It was observed that the screw head and driving features effect the number of damages and the failure mode type. Screw with pan-head type has the lowest number of damages compared with <b>countersunk</b> <b>head</b> screw. Selecting screw insertion technique is also important in order to reduce number of damages.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of machine-countersunk flush rivets for aircraft described in reference 1 revealed {{the necessity of}} having {{the height of the}} rivet heads greater than the depth of the countersunk holes if tightly riveted joints were to be obtained. If ordinary roundhead rivets were inserted from {{the opposite side of the}} joint and the <b>countersunk</b> <b>heads</b> formed in the driving of the rivets filled the countersunk holes completely, still tighter joints were obtained. In either case the rivets protruded above the skin surface after driving, and the protruding portion of the rivet heads had to be removed in order to obtain flush rivets. A number of requests have been received for a description of the tool used to mill off the protruding portion of the rivet heads. This report contains assembly and detail drawings of the latest flush-rivet milling tool used at the NACA Structures Research Laboratory. Figure 6 shows the tool in operation.

40|$|The {{increase}} in the frictional resistance of a surface caused {{by the presence of}} rivet heads was determined by towing four planing surfaces of the same dimensions. One surface was smooth and represented a surface without rivet heads or one with perfectly flush countersunk rivets. The other three surfaces were each fitted with the same number of full-size rivet heads but of a different type arranged in the same pattern on each surface. The surfaces were towed at speeds representative of the high water speeds encountered by seaplanes during take-off and the range of Reynolds Number covered by the test was from 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 18 x 10 (exp 6). The rivet heads investigated were oval countersunk, brazier, and round for rivets having shanks 5 / 32 inch in diameter. The oval <b>countersunk</b> <b>heads</b> were sunk below the surface by dimpling the plating around them. The results of the tests showed that, for the rivet heads investigated, the {{increase in}} the friction coefficient of the surface is directly proportional to the height of the rivet head.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{mechanical}} behaviour of 2 -bolt single-lap CFRP joints with countersunk bolts is investigated, both numerically and experimentally. A detailed 3 D non-linear FE model of composite bolted joints has been developed. The model replicates with good agreement the experimental tensile tests {{up to the}} point where bearing damage occurs and reproduces the joint behaviour correctly. Five stages are identified in the joint behaviour. The evolution of contact during the test is studied showing a correlation with the joint stiffness. Parametric studies investigate the influence of bolt clamping force, coefficient of friction and bolt-hole clearance on the joint behaviour. Using the developed FE model, the distribution of the six stress components around the holes of the composite joints is studied together with the effects of head height, shank-hole clearance and position of bolts. The stress along the fibres is identified as the critical stress component and the compressive fibre failure of the 0 ° oriented plies as the start of the bearing damage. The 0 ° oriented plies in the cylindrical part of the hole are found to be the plies carrying the bearing load. Increasing clearance reduces the extent of the bolt shank-hole contact and leads to higher stresses and lower joint stiffness. The 45 ° and - 45 ° oriented plies are found to have {{a key role in the}} joint bearing strength and shear-out failure. Fatigue tests are run with the introduction of a novel method to monitor the loss of clamping force and detect crack initiation in the fasteners during the test itself, using strain gauges and a real-time algorithm. The clamping force is found to remain constant until crack initiation and progressively drop until final failure. Load transfer and interaction between the bolts is observed during the fast but stable fatigue crack propagation. The fatigue tests are conducted on joints with differing plate thicknesses and <b>countersunk</b> <b>head</b> geometries to assess the influence of these on the number of cycles to crack initiation and to final failure. A link between fatigue and static test results is highlighted and, in addition, a fatigue failure mechanism of the joint is proposed. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Multiple site damage (MSD) is the {{occurrence}} of many small cracks at multiple locations such as rivet holes. Once the MSD is initiated, the strength of structure may be quickly reduced to an unacceptable level and caused catastrophic failure. ^ This dissertation describes research into the fatigue life of lap joint structure with MSD. The load transfer mechanism in joint structure is studied, including several types of rivets, material properties and structure geometry. The load transfer for each rivet is determined {{as a function of}} crack propagation. Two other mechanisms can affect the load transfer mechanism-interference between the rivet and rivet hole due to riveting process, and clamping pressure between the panels, were also investigated. Since these two mechanisms are complicated to analyze, and rely {{on the quality of the}} manufacture and assembly, the riveting process was well controlled by applying the rivet squeeze force through an MTS machine. ^ Single lap joint specimens, containing fatigue MSD in one row of rivet holes, were cycled to failure under constant amplitude loading. A modified MSD life prediction model is used to estimate fatigue life. Predictions for the growth and coalescence of individual cracks are in accordance with the experimental results. During the fatigue tests, the propagation of some small cracks at low remote stress levels were delayed due to clamping-up stress under the <b>countersink</b> rivet <b>head.</b> Marker band analysis, therefore, is utilized to detect the crack growth information under <b>countersink</b> rivet <b>head</b> and includes the delay effect into the fatigue prediction program. ^ The individual/relative effect of two random variables—the interference fit levels and crack length distribution at rivet holes—on MSD fatigue life is investigated. A thousand Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the statistical degradation in residual strength as the Wide Fatigue Damage (WFD) extends by fatigue. The fastener interference, reflected as riveting quality, determines the overall evaluation of fatigue behavior of a lap joint. The influence of both rivet installation (i. e. fastener interference) and initial WFD size on fatigue life and residual strength are presented, and indicate the relative influence of these parameters on structural integrity. ...|$|R
40|$|December 2006. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable riveting parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, rivet diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed rivet. The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed rivet head geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed rivet head. The results demonstrate that the correct formation of rivet head geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of rivet head is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the <b>countersunk</b> rivet <b>head</b> does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} our study {{demonstrate}} that PETS is a minimally invasive and safe technique for treating LLD by creating a growth inhibition of the longer limb. The screws can {{be placed in a}} parallel or crossed pattern and it may be beneficial to <b>countersink</b> the screw <b>heads,</b> particularly if they are placed in a parallel fashion to decrease the risk of pain from a prominent screw head irritating the soft tissues. Clinicians may use the growth predictor method of choice with the understanding {{that there may be a}} large variability in the result, but usually the variability is not clinically significant. We found that the Green−Anderson and Moseley methods tended to underpredict and the Paley method tended to overpredict the final LLD. Several studies have reported that PETS creates delayed growth inhibition and recommend performing PETS between 6 and 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis [5, 8, 18]. We believe that PETS is reversible by removing the screws and are now performing the PETS 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis. We believe that PETS creates growth inhibition by locking the epiphysis to the metaphysis with screw threads on both sides of the growth plate. Although we have not used fully threaded 7.3 -mm cannulated screws, we believe that fully threaded screws would be equally successful and would decrease the problems associated with screw removal.|$|R
30|$|The six {{patients}} who complained of pain over their screws at maturity had screws {{placed in a}} parallel fashion. We are now <b>countersinking</b> the screw <b>heads</b> partially into the cortical bone at the meta-diaphyseal junction to address this concern. Although crossed screws are more technically demanding to achieve precise placement, crossed screws may have less screw head prominence and decrease the risk of irritating the adjacent soft tissues. Song et al. [17] treated 59 patients with PETS using crossed screws and reported no screw-related pain, infection, neurologic injury or hematoma. Three screws broke during attempted removal and the removal was abandoned in 2 others. Five patients (8  %) developed an axial deviation that was attributed to inadequate purchase of the epiphysis on one side {{in three of the}} five cases. In our study, no patient developed asymmetric growth that created an axial, coronal or sagittal deformity and we had no problems removing screws. Parallel screws are shorter than crossed screws and can be placed within 10 degrees of perpendicular to the physis in both the anteroposterior and lateral views making them theoretically more mechanically effective to inhibit growth than crossed screws. Since crossed screws are longer than parallel screws, 7.3 -mm cannulated screws with a 32 -mm thread are placed in a crossed fashion in case they are difficult to remove even though they have reverse-cutting threads. We believe that the ideal screw to address all these shortcomings would be a fully threaded 7.3 -mm cannulated stainless steel screw.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the bolt clampup force relaxation behavior in countersunk, single-lap bolted joints between glass/vinylester resin laminates and steel panels. Additionally, the effect of bolt clampup force relaxation on the bearing strength of such joints was studied. Specially-instrumented bolts were used to measure clampup force relaxation in ten countersunk joint specimens. A 100, 000 pound capacity MTS testing machine {{was used to evaluate}} the bearing strength in tension of sixteen countersunk bolted joint specimens torqued to four different levels of initial torque, as well as four similar protruding-head bolted joint specimens (at the same levels of torque). The results of the relaxation experiments indicate that clampup force varies widely in nominally identical joints at identical torque levels, by as much as a factor of two. In countersunk bolt joints with sufficiently high initial clampup force, the clampup force relaxed in accordance with the inverse power equation proposed by Shivakumar and Crews for protruding-head bolt joints in graphite/epoxy laminates. Relaxation in the present experiments proceeded faster than in the protruding-head joints studied by Shivakumar and Crews; this {{is believed to have been}} due to the relative lack of constraint provided at the GRP surface by the countersunk bolt. The results from the bearing strength experiments suggest that clampup force has only a small beneficial effect on bearing strength in both <b>countersunk</b> and protruding <b>head</b> single-lap joints, when compared to double-lap joints. The reduced effectiveness of clampup force in increasing the bearing strength is believed to be a result of the increased joint rotation and bolt bending inherent in single-lap joints. These phenomena lead to delamination and brooming failure in the GRP, which can be avoided in double lap joints with sufficient bolt clampup force. The countersunk joints failed at a load approximately 20 % lower than the protruding head joints. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with stress analysis and strengthprediction in composite laminates containing bolt holes andopen holes. It covers both two- and three-dimensional analyses,and experiments {{have been carried out}} to determine criteriaparameters and to validate the analysis methods. The objective of the work on two-dimensional analysismethods has been to develop accurate and cost-efficient stressanalysis and failure prediction methods valid for complexloading conditions. Both the finite element method and a methodbased on Lekhnitskii 9 ̆ 2 s complex stress functions have beenused to determine the stress distribution around the hole. Inthe case of bolted laminates, the frictionless contact betweenthe bolt and the hole has been taken into account. Differentfailure criteria, including the Point Stress Criterion (PSC) and the Damage Zone Criterion (DZC) have been used to predictthe strength of test specimens subjected to complex loadingconditions. In the case of bolted laminates, simple failurecriteria for preliminary design are proposed. The validity ofthese criteria is demonstrated on multi-fastener tension- andshear-loaded test specimens. A comprehensive test programme wascarried out to establish criteria parameters and to generatedata to validate the stress analysis and strength predictionunder complex loading conditions. A special test fixture wasdesigned for this purpose. Good agreement was found betweenpredicted and measured results. The objective of the work on three-dimensional methodshas been to develop tools for three- dimensional stress andfailure analyses and to study the effect of various factors onthe strength of single-lap joints. An experimental programmewas conducted to characterize the failure mechanisms and tomeasure deformation, strain, and bending effects. Athree-dimensional finite element model of a bolted single-lapjoint has been developed to determine the non-uniform stressdistribution through the thickness of the laminate in thevicinity of the hole. The model was validated against measuredstrains and displacements from the experimental programme. Theagreement between predicted and experimental results wasgenerally good. In the failure characterisation part of theexperimental programme, {{it was found that the}} failure of thejoints was dominated by kinking. A failure analysis procedurefor the prediction of bearing failure dominated by kinking hasbeen developed. In this procedure, failure is predicted using aquadratic failure criterion evaluating fibre stress andtransverse shear stress at a characteristic distance from theedge of the bolt hole. Experimental results were used tovalidate the analysis procedure and good agreement was foundbetween predicted and experimental failure loads. The analysisprocedure were then used study the effect of eight differentparameters which affect the strength of bolted compositelaminates. The parameters studied were: laminate thickness,lay-up, bolt diameter, bolt configuration (<b>countersunk</b> orprotruding <b>head),</b> friction, clamping force, clearance andlateral support. The parametric study was organised as areduced two-level factorial test. The results from theparametric study show that laminate thickness, friction,clamping force and bolt configuration are the parameters whichhave the strongest influence on the strength of the joints.

40|$|Terminating {{action is}} a {{remedial}} repair which entails the replacement of shear <b>head</b> <b>countersunk</b> rivets with universal head rivets which have a larger shank diameter. The procedure was developed to eliminate the risk of widespread fatigue damage (WFD) in the upper rivet row of a fuselage lap joint. A test and evaluation program has been conducted by Foster-Miller, Inc. (FMI) to evaluate the terminating action repair of the upper rivet row of a commercial aircraft fuselage lap splice. Two full scale fatigue tests were conducted on fuselage panels using the growth of fatigue cracks in the lap joint. The second test was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the terminating action repair. In both tests, cyclic pressurization loading was applied to the panels while crack propagation was recorded at all rivet locations at regular intervals to generate detailed data on conditions of fatigue crack initiation, ligament link-up, and fuselage fracture. This program demonstrated that the terminating action repair substantially increases the fatigue life of a fuselage panel structure and effectively eliminates the occurrence of cracking in the upper rivet row of the lap joint. While high cycle crack growth was recorded in the middle rivet row during the second test, failure was not imminent when the test was terminated after cycling to well beyond the service life. The program also demonstrated that the initiation, propagation, and linkup of WFD in full-scale fuselage structures can be simulated and quantitatively studied in the laboratory. This paper presents an overview of the testing program and provides a detailed discussion of the data analysis and results. Crack distribution and propagation rates and directions as well as frequency of cracking are presented for both tests. The progression of damage to linkup of adjacent cracks and to eventual overall panel failure is discussed. In addition, an assessment of the effectiveness of the terminating action repair and the occurrence of cracking in the middle rivet row is provided, and conclusions of practical interest are drawn...|$|R
