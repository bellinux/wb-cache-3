5000|$|As a twin {{cam system}} relies on each cam {{rotating}} independently, {{based solely on}} the force of the string and the resistance of the bow limbs being absolutely symmetrical, there is room for a twin cam system to [...] "lose tune" [...] through wear and tear, string stretch, or just general age. The effect of a detuned twin cam bow is that the two cams <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sync with each other, causing the bowstring to accelerate in two alternating directions upon release. This causes a number of adverse consequences, the most obvious being unsteady arrow flight.|$|E

50|$|Marsh {{invented the}} {{earliest}} form of vibrating electrical interrupter in 1824. It {{consisted of a}} straight wire electrically connected and flexibly suspended at the top while the lower end extending into a shallow mercury filled trough which served as a second electrical contact. The {{lower end of the}} wire was also positioned between the poles of a powerful permanent horseshoe shaped magnet. When electric current flowed through the wire, the magnetic field of the wire created a force with the field of the permanent magnet such that the wire would <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mercury trough and interrupt the electrical circuit. Without the magnetic force, the wire would then fall back due to the force of gravity into the mercury thereby restoring the connection and restarting the cycle of vibration.|$|E
50|$|To request an interrupt, a bus device would assert {{one of four}} {{common bus}} lines, BR4 through BR7, until the {{processor}} responded. Higher numbers indicated greater urgency, perhaps that data might be lost or a desired sector might <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> contact with the read/write heads unless the processor responded quickly. The printer's readiness for another character was the lowest priority (BR4), as it would remain ready indefinitely. If the processor were operating at level 5, then BR6 and BR7 would be in order. If the processor were operating at 3 or lower, it would grant any interrupt; if at 7, it would grant none. Bus requests that were not granted were not lost but merely deferred. The device needing service would continue to assert its bus request.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{vectorial}} spin analysis in spin and angle resolved photoemission {{is illustrated in}} this report. Two prototypical systems, Bi/Ag(111) (sqrt 3 x sqrt 3) R 30 and Pb/Ag(111) (sqrt 3 x sqrt 3) R 30, which show a large Rashba type spin-orbit splitting, were investigated by means of spin and angle resolved photoemission. The spin polarization vectors of individual bands are determined by a two-step fitting routine. First, the measured intensities are fitted with an appropriate number of suitable peaks to quantify {{the contributions of the}} individual bands, then the measured spin polarization curves are fitted by varying for each band the polarization direction and its magnitude. We confirm that the surface states experience a large spin splitting. Moreover, we find that all surface state bands are 100 percent spin polarized, and that for some states spin polarization vectors <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the surface plane.

40|$|Two {{critical}} steps controlling serine recombinase ac-tivity are the remodeling of dimers {{into the}} chemi-cally active synaptic tetramer and {{the regulation of}} subunit rotation during DNA exchange. We identify a set of hydrophobic residues within the oligomer-ization helix that controls these steps by the Hin DNA invertase. Phe 105 and Met 109 insert into hy-drophobic pockets within the catalytic domain of the same subunit to stabilize the inactive dimer confor-mation. These <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the catalytic domain in the dimer and into the subunit rotation interface of the tetramer. About half of residue 105 and 109 sub-stitutions gain the ability to generate stable synap-tic tetramers and/or promote DNA chemistry without activation by the Fis/enhancer element. Phe 106 re-places Phe 105 in the catalytic domain pocket to sta-bilize the tetramer conformation. Significantly, many of the residue 105 and 109 substitutions support subunit rotation but impair ligation, implying a de-fect in rotational pausing at the tetrameric conformer poised for ligation. We propose that a ratchet-like surface involving Phe 105, Met 109 and Leu 112 within the rotation interface functions to gate the subunit rotation reaction. Hydrophobic residues are present in analogous positions in other serine recombinases and likely perform similar functions...|$|E

40|$|Single-molecule, protein-induced {{fluorescence}} enhancement (PIFE) {{serves as}} a molecular ruler at molecular distances inaccessible to other spectroscopic rulers such as Förster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) or photoinduced electron transfer. In order to provide two simultaneous measurements of two distances on different molecular length scales {{for the analysis of}} macromolecular complexes, we and others recently combined measurements of PIFE and FRET (PIFE-FRET) on the single molecule level. PIFE relies on steric hindrance of the fluorophore Cy 3, which is covalently attached to a biomolecule of interest, to <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an excited-state trans isomer to the cis isomer through a 90 ° intermediate. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that accounts for relevant photophysical and kinetic parameters of PIFE-FRET, show how this framework allows the extraction of the fold-decrease in isomerization mobility from experimental data, and show how these results provide information on changes in the accessible volume of Cy 3. The utility of this model is then demonstrated for experimental results on PIFE-FRET measurement of different protein-DNA interactions. The proposed model and extracted parameters could serve as a benchmark to allow quantitative comparison of PIFE effects in different biological systems. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} first {{fabrication}} of vertical three-dimensional micro-Fresnel lenses with polysili-con materials by surface micromachining technique. Micro-Fresnel lenses {{play a very}} important role in micro-optics because of their thin film structures and their ability to achieve very short fo-cal lengths. Although micro-Fresnel lenses have been studied and well understood [11, the lens planes usually are restrained {{on the surface of the}} substrate. Therefore, their abilities of integra-tion with other optoelectronic components in micro-optics are limited. In this paper, we present a vertical three-dimensional binary-phase micro-Fresnel lens which overcomes the disadvantage of conventional micro-fresnel lenses and is able to <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the plane and stands perpendicular to the substrate. This lens and other similarly constructed micro-optical elements can shrink the whole free-space optical system to a single micro-chip.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of my research}} involves {{an investigation of the}} relationship between design and production through a case study fabrication project which utilize digital design software and manufacturing technologies, to achieve a better understanding of where formal, spatial, and material possibilities lie. This project focuses specifically on using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) fabrication techniques to produce three-dimensional forms with poly-urethane foam aimed at achieving certain surface effects and material sensations. Critical to understanding the potentials of digital fabrication is an understanding of its evolution to its current role in contemporary architecture. My methods consist of a qualitative approach to the evolution of digital design tools and manufacturing technologies. I have conducted a thorough literature review and will provide an overview of concepts surrounding the digital paradigm such as materiality, sensation and affect. Secondly, a fabrication project was completed from design to production using a three-axis CNC mill, our current machine at the Texas A & M Architecture Ranch. Three-axis CNC mills are typically used to create surface effects and not completely three-dimensional objects because of their inability to <b>rotate</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the z-axis to make undercuts. We investigated different fabrication techniques {{that can be used to}} create completely three-dimensional forms with this machine and poly-urethane foam. Included in the fabrication process was extensive material research as to which additive materials were best able to increase the foam?s surface strength and smoothness and provide appropriate finishing to produce a liquid-like effect. A sectioning technique using cuts in both the horizontal and vertical direction was developed and can serve as an example of a possible means of fabricating large scale three-dimensional forms with a three-axis mill. We hope that this project will help encourage experimentation and research in the area of digital fabrication as contemporary architecture moves forward to a complex digital profession...|$|E
