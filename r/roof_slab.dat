25|$|The Anderson shelters {{performed}} well under blast and ground shock, {{because they had}} good connectivity and ductility, which meant that they could absorb {{a great deal of}} energy through plastic deformation without falling apart. (This was in marked contrast to other trench shelters which used concrete for the sides and roof, which were inherently unstable when disturbed by the effects of an explosion - if the <b>roof</b> <b>slab</b> lifted, the walls fell in under the static earth pressure; if the walls were pushed in, the roof would be unsupported at one edge and would fall.) However, when the pattern of all night alerts became established, it was realised that in winter Anderson shelters were cold damp holes in the ground and often flooded in wet weather, and so their occupancy factor would be poor. This {{led to the development of}} the indoor Morrison shelter.|$|E
25|$|From {{the ground}} level {{entrance}} {{door on the}} western side of the tower, a spiral concrete staircase with steel tubular handrail winds around a central service duct before arriving in the near-centre of the observation room. Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated cabinetry sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found in the toilet. Floors are lined with linoleum and a system of suspended ceiling panels conceals the underside of the concrete <b>roof</b> <b>slab.</b> A recent sink and cupboard sits up against the southern wall of the toilet. All original communications equipment has been removed. Access to the external balcony, which wraps around all sides except the straight, western edge, is through a single door in the south-west corner. This timber door retains the original separate screen door. The narrow balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade made from two tubular steel rails and widely separated balusters covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebble-dash on the exterior face. The steel balusters pierce the concrete floor slab and are fixed on the underside.|$|E

40|$|The {{countries}} located {{close to}} the equator generally have tropical climatic conditions, where temperatures remain relatively high with humid conditions. Thus, the climatic conditions are usually identified as warm humid. With the rapid urbanization, two different solutions are adopted to meet the housing needs. One is the construction of medium to high rise apartment buildings which has become popular in many large cities located closed to the equator. Another option have been to pursue residential developments {{with a large number}} of detached houses located on small blocks of lands. The energy consumption for buildings is becoming higher and high energy demand and the associated green house gas emission is another critical issue that needs attention in the long run. Global warming can also become a key factor in near future due to environment and climatic changes that are associated with it. This emphasise the need to develop and promote new passive techniques to achieve thermal comfort in built environment. The use of insulated <b>roof</b> <b>slabs</b> provide an alternative that may enable the creation of green cover at roof level. This can also become an alternative solution to the traditional roofs since insulation can be effective in creating desirable indoor conditions needed by free running spaces and the flat slab on top of the building can solve many environmental and social problems arising out of high density residential developments to a certain extent. In addition, this can be an ideal alternative to traditional roofs considering the better cyclone resistance that can be offered due to the self weight. Considering all these facts, reinforce concrete solid slabs were considered as an alternative. With detailed experimental programmes on small scale models and prototypes, it is shown that a minimum insulation thickness of 25 mm with a material having a conductivity of about 0. 03 W/mK can retard the heat flow significantly. In order to ensure that <b>roof</b> <b>slabs</b> have unrestricted access, an innovative solution was proposed and used as the insulation system for the experimental programme. Since it is practically difficult to predict the effect of insulated <b>roof</b> <b>slabs</b> on built environments such as houses using actual model based experiments, simulations have been used with computer software validated for tropical climatic conditions to predict the trends. Since there are strong indications of changing climatic patterns due to global warming, the performance of insulated <b>roof</b> <b>slabs</b> under such future scenarios have also been predicted using appropriately modified climatic files. In order to emphasise the need to rely on carefully planned micro climate in future, thermal comfort models have been developed considering the climatic acclimatization that is expected from people gradually facing the global warming scenarios {{over a long period of}} time. With all these studies, it is highlighted the importance of adopting insulated <b>roof</b> <b>slabs</b> as a solution to combat the heat island effect in built up areas by creating roof top gardens. Since these slabs can be successfully adopted in air-conditioned commercial buildings, life cycle costing approach was used to predict the desirable insulation thickness for air conditioned spaces. With this multi-disciplinary approach, the usefulness of insulated <b>roof</b> <b>slabs</b> as an alternative to traditional roofs have been highlighted.
