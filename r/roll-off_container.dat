5000|$|Atlantic Conveyor was a 14,950 ton roll-on, <b>roll-off</b> <b>{{container}}</b> ship {{owned by}} Cunard. She was built along with six other container ships, each named Atlantic .... and sailing under different national flags for different companies.|$|E
50|$|Roll-off {{containers}} have {{a rectangular}} footprint typically {{determined by the}} size of typical trucks. <b>Roll-off</b> <b>container</b> sizes are determined by the amount of volume of debris they contain. Typical container sizes in the United States are 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 cubic yards While the roll-offs may be rented by volume, there may be weight limitations. Weight limits may be necessary to ensure compliance with road-use and safety laws and regulations. (or 2-40 cubic meters in other nations).|$|E
50|$|Roll-offs {{are placed}} by {{roll-off}} trucks. As the roll-off truck raises its hydraulically operated bed, the <b>roll-off</b> <b>container</b> rolls off the bed. A cable {{is used to}} slowly lower the container. After the waste container is loaded, the roll-off truck pulls the filled container onto the roll-off truck by using a cable and winch system. If the roll-off truck is not a winch system, then it is most likely a hook-lift system. A hook-lift system works by the truck extending a 90 degree arm with a hook on the end which hooks under a bar and gently lifts the dumpster onto the truck. Most hook-lift systems are on smaller roll-off trucks as they are usually used for 20 yard containers and under. These smaller systems are usually the preferred option on smaller scale construction jobs such as roof replacement, kitchen remodels, and garage clean-outs. Smaller single-axle trucks are generally viewed as safer operations as they are much lighter and more easily transported in residential areas. When being carried, the roll-off must be covered.|$|E
50|$|A {{roll-off}} is a usually {{open top}} dumpster {{characterized by a}} rectangular footprint, utilizing wheels to facilitate rolling the dumpster in place. The container {{is designed to be}} transported by special roll-off trucks. Roll-offs are commonly used to contain loads of construction and demolition waste or other waste types. While most <b>roll-off</b> <b>containers</b> have a swinging door on the end for easier disposal of waste, some <b>roll-off</b> <b>containers</b> are not open top and are used with commercial or industrial trash compactors.|$|R
50|$|There is the {{potential}} to recycle many elements of construction waste. Often <b>roll-off</b> <b>containers</b> are used to transport the waste. Rubble can be crushed and reused in construction projects. Waste wood can also be recovered and recycled.|$|R
50|$|One problem often {{encountered}} with <b>roll-off</b> <b>containers</b> is {{the liability}} of scratching or damaging the surface they are placed on. Most <b>roll-off</b> <b>containers</b> have metal rollers for wheels, which can at times scratch or be abrasive to a concrete or asphalt surface. It is recommended {{to place a}} protective board such as plywood under the container to avoid {{a situation where the}} placement surface can be damaged. Most roll-off companies do not offer plywood, but will place the container on the wood if supplied. The roll-off must be placed on a hard surface other than dirt. Gravel, asphalt, and concrete are all acceptable. If the container is placed on dirt, the wheels may sink after a rainfall event and the truck could get stuck.|$|R

50|$|Shah Alam Transfer Station or SATS is a {{solid waste}} {{transfer}} station located in Section 21, Shah Alam. The site can be accessed by Jalan Puchong via KESAS Highway and Persiaran Jubli Perak via Federal Highway. SATS and its transportation system {{is owned by the}} Ministry of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government (KPKT) through SWCorp while Worldwide Holdings Bhd through WHB Environment appointed as the maintenance operator (concessionaire). SATS costs Worldwide in average RM800,000 a month to operate and currently sending all waste compacted there to a sanitary landfill in Jeram, Kuala Selangor using special <b>roll-off</b> <b>containers</b> (silos) mounted on a haulage trailers. Apart of SATS that built at Shah Alam, there are four more such similar transfer stations in Malaysia which located at Taman Beringin in Kuala Lumpur, Taruka at Johor, and another two at Batu Maung and Ampang Jajar, both located in Penang.|$|R
40|$|High level waste at the SRS F- and H-Area Tank Farms {{consists}} of both sludge and supernate fractions. Supernate contains soluble species. Sludge contains both insoluble species and entrained supernate. The {{nature and extent}} of contamination present on waste generated during operation of the F- and H-Area Tank Farms {{is a function of the}} tank, the nature of the job generating the waste, variability in waste handling techniques, and other factors. Historically, supernate-contaminated waste had been segregated and manifested as supernate waste. A single, comprehensive characterization for supernate has been developed previously (Reference 4). Sludge-contaminated waste has been manifested by combining sludge and supernate waste streams to account for entrained supernate present in sludge. Separate sludge waste stream characterizations have been developed for each of the F- and H-Area Tank Farms (Ref. 1 and 2). Low-activity waste (LAW) {{consists of}} both sludge and supernate fractions. Routine LAW is waste that has a maximum dose rate of 50 mrem/hr at 5 cm for Sealands and 35 mrem/hr at 5 cm for Roll-Offs. However, it is intended that routine, low-activity waste not be segregated; therefore, individual low-activity waste cuts may consist of items contaminated with either supernate or sludge in the same container. Historical waste generation rates of the two waste streams will be used to develop a single waste stream distribution representative of low-activity waste. The single distribution is based on the assumption that the actual contamination present on waste in a series of containers from these tanks will be representative of the average supernate/sludge radionuclide distribution. This document develops a characterization for low-activity waste consisting of both radioactive and hazardous constituents. The characterization includes quantification of the average Sealand and <b>Roll-Off</b> <b>containers</b> of routine, low-activity waste. This characterization will apply only to low-level waste that has a whole body (30 cm) dose rate less than or equal to 5 mrem/hr from an individual waste bag or item and has a radionuclide distribution that is represented by the existing high level supernate and sludge waste streams (FHW- 00001 and HTK- 00002). This document specifically refers to the issues of waste management related to the F- and H-Area Tank Farms. However, the characterization presented in this document of low-activity waste managed in Sealand and <b>Roll-Off</b> <b>containers</b> applies to any SRS facilities that process the supernate or sludge waste streams that are presently stored in the F- and H-Area Tank Farms...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, China's {{merchant}} marine had fewer than thirty ships. By the 1970s and 1980s, maritime shipping capabilities had greatly increased. In 1985 China established eleven shipping offices and jointly operated shipping companies in foreign countries. In 1986 China ranked ninth in world shipping {{with more than}} 600 ships and a total tonnage of 16 million, including modern roll-on and <b>roll-off</b> ships, <b>container</b> ships, large bulk carriers, refrigerator ships, oil tankers, and multipurpose ships. The fleet called at more than 400 ports in more than 100 countries.|$|R
40|$|The current {{landfill}} {{located in}} Adams County, Idaho is nearing capacity due to uncontrolled and unregulated dumping. Adams Family, Inc. has been tasked with designing a new regional municipal wastes transfer station to help alleviate {{the problem and}} prolong the landfillâ€™s useful life by preventing unregulated dumping and whereby reducing the wastes volume placed within the existing Adams County landfill. The new municipal wastes transfer station will be built on five acres of undeveloped land due north of the existing landfill entrance. The transfer station {{will be used to}} store recyclable municipal waste which will include scrap metal, used tires, electronic waste, batteries, green waste, and oil, before being transferred to a processing facility. The transfer station design includes: two storage sheds, two forty cubic yard <b>roll-off</b> <b>containers,</b> and designated areas to temporarily store municipal wastes from the general public and prevent every person from having unregulated access to the working landfill space. The municipal wastes transfer station design plans also include an office building complete with restrooms and a breakroom for a small number of landfill workers, a maintenance bay used for upkeep of onsite vehicles, and a wash station area for maintenance vehicles. A management plan is included to mitigate offsite stormwater from entering the landfill site and becoming contaminated. Pavement improvements will be made to the site and at the entrance to and from the landfill at Goodrich Road...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Wood-waste {{generators}} use single <b>roll-off</b> box <b>containers</b> {{or large}} dump trucks when hauling to solid-waste collection facilities. The facility {{does not necessarily}} identify the wood-waste generator because the wood-waste delivery might be mixed with other material. Nor do disposal fees at collection facilities account for source generators. Private landfills and transfer stations collect most wood waste. For billing, personnel at their scalehouses usually record the quantity of waste delivered and who delivered it. Typically, this method to account for waste conceals {{the identities of the}} actual generators. Most facilities do not separate woodwaste nor charge unique fees. They commingle wood waste with garbage in drop boxes that can be (un) loaded automatically. These are either front-end loader boxes from small- to mid-sized generators or big roll-off boxes from larger generators. However, private recyclers introduced and now provide source-separation and separate hauling systems. Those in competitive markets rapidly developed separating systems, which have become common. Many wood-waste materials that solid-waste facilities never-before handled (such as landclearing stumps and brush or orchard prunings) are now increasingly processed and marketed by private facilities. When using separating systems, identifying and sorting the wood portion of the waste stream becomes critical. Best Practice: To implement a separating system, identify the generating sources from which to collect wood waste. This Best Practice recommends using state and local databases, which list statistics about the typical composition of industrial waste, to classify prospective regional generators by their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Every private company has a four-digit SIC code that federal, state, or local governmental databases can provide. Then, cross-reference their SIC codes against others that have the highest rates of waste-wood generation (e. g., pallet repair, home builders, cabinet manufacturers, lumber yards, etc.).
