In addition, the measuring technique is lab intensive and impractical in the clinical settings [24]. Another concern is the inability to measure extraneous blood loss which can affect {{the total amount of}} MBL especially in cases of severe bleeding [25]. Finally, the <b>recovered</b> <b>amounts</b> of alkaline hematin are influenced by the variability of absorption of different sanitary products, a problem that could not be overcome unless a sanitary product is standardized or a reference is set for different sanitary products. All these factors precluded the use of extraction-based quantitative methods in clinical settings [26].|$|E

The recovery of lactulose and mannitol in urine was employed to evaluate intestinal permeability in children with and without diarrhea. Lactulose and mannitol probes were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPLC-PAD). Two groups of solutions containing 60 µM sugars were prepared. Group I consisted of glucosamine, mannitol, melibiose and lactulose, and group II of inositol, sorbitol, glucose and lactose. In the study of intra-experiment variation, a sample of 50 µl from each group was submitted to 4 successive determinations. The <b>recovered</b> <b>amounts</b> and retention times of each sugar showed a variation 97 %. In the study of inter-experiment variation, we prepared 4 independent samples from groups I and II at the following concentrations: 1. 0, 0. 3, 0. 1, 0. 03 and 0. 01 mM. The amounts of the sugars recovered varied by 99 %. Retention (k'), selectivity (a) and efficiency (N) were used to assess the chromatographic conditions. All three parameters were in the normal range. Children with diarrhea presented a greater lactulose/mannitol ratio compared to children without diarrhea...|$|E
40|$|Rammelkamp and Keefer (1) {{found that}} only about 60 per cent of {{intravenously}} administered penicillin could be recovered from the urine of man. This finding has been confirmed by later reports, although the <b>recovered</b> <b>amounts</b> vary from 40 to 99 per cent (2). This paper deals with the mechanism of the elimination of penicillin in bilaterally nephrecto-mized dogs. Diffusion of Penicillin from Blood to Tissues A dog, in which the elimination of penicillin 5 had been blocked by bilateral nephrectomy and ligation of the cystic and common bile ducts, was given an intravenous injection of 25, 000 units/kg. of crystalline penicillin G. Blood samples were taken from another vein at intervals from two minutes to 10 hours after the injection. The serum concentrations of penicillin were determined using a serial dilution technique. In Figure 1, the serum penicillin concentrations have been plotted on a logarithmic scale as a func-tion of time after the injection. The penicillin concentration decreases rapidly during the first hour but thereafter very slowly. For the time being we shall consider only the first portion of the curve. We may assume that this initial de-crease was due to diffusion of penicillin from the blood stream into the tissues...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} understand the effects of different quantities of additional iron and oxidizing flux (Na 2 O 2) on the direct fire assay of low grade pyritic refractory gold ores instead of performing any pre-treatment like roasting before fire assay. A portion of the pyritic ore was primarily roasted using a rotary kiln to remove sulphur content for the comparison of the results obtained from direct fire assay of the pyritic ore. Then, fire assay process was performed to the roasted ore and gold and silver content in the ore was determined. Unroasted ore specimens were fused by using fluxes and PbO, which accumulates the precious metals, with various quantities of iron. Correlation between the quantity of additional iron and the recovery of gold-silver were investigated. Various quantities of Na 2 O 2, as an oxidizing flux, {{were added to the}} smelting charge with iron additions, from which the highest gold and silver recoveries were obtained from previous experiments. From the results, {{it was clear that the}} increase in additional iron and Na 2 O 2 quantities was the reason for the increase in the <b>recovered</b> <b>amounts</b> of lead, gold and silver during the process...|$|E

Dense POM and coarse POM differed in their fraction mass, organic C content, C/N ratio, and {{contributions to the}} total soil OM and the magnitudes of these differences changed with soil types. Across four soil types, 13 % to 22 % macro organic C was present in the heavy macro OM fraction under a complete dispersion of 2 to 0. 05 mm aggregates. Noncellulosic carbohydrates were identical and mainly plant-derived compounds in dense and coarse POM fractions but were dominated by microbially derived monomers in heavy macro OM fraction. Amino sugars in both POM fractions were dominated by fungal-derived compounds, whereas heavy macro OM fraction contained fungal-amino sugars only. Macro OM had contents of total noncellulosic sugars and total amino sugars {{similar to those of}} dense POM (i. e., light OM), but macro OM contained more microbially synthesized neutral sugars and fungal-amino sugar N than dense POM. In addition, macro OM and dense POM were not parallel soil OM fractions, in terms of <b>recovered</b> <b>amounts</b> of organic C and N, neutral carbohydrates, and amino sugars from contrasting soils.

40|$|The two {{additive}} brominated flame retardants, tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) {{are used}} to prevent fire to start and spread. They are simply mixed with material and {{are most likely to}} leach out in the environment, because of non-covalently binding to the material. TBECH can exist as four pairs of enantiomers, α-, β-, γ- and δ-TBECH. The technical HBCD can exist as three pairs of enantiomers, α-, β- and γ-HBCD and two meso forms δ- and ε-HBCD. None of these compounds are produced in Sweden, but they are imported to industries. TBECH has been found in Beluga blubber and can accumulate in zebrafish. HBCD has been found in water environments and can be toxic to and bioaccumulate in water-living animals. In this study, a method was developed for separation and detection of α-, β-, γ- and δ-TBECH on HRGC/HRMS. All TBECH-isomers could be separated with the developed method. How much of the TBECH isomers that were recovered after applying existing extraction and clean-up procedures, normally applied for clean-up and extraction of PCBs and PCDD/Fs, was evaluated. Low <b>recovered</b> <b>amounts</b> (6. 8 - 35. 5 %) of TBECH-isomers added in known amounts to three different whale samples indicate severe evaporation losses and possibly photolytic degradation. None of the four enantiomers were detected in the three whale samples. For HBCD analysis, both the chromatography and MS/MS parameters were optimised for δ- and ε- HBCD yielding good chromatography and sensitivity. However, due to technical difficulties during the time-period of this project, no whale samples could be analysed for HBCD on UPLC/MS/MS. ...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis of 12 - and/or 15 -HETE {{by human}} {{epidermal}} cells was investigated after separating basal cells from suprabasal epidermal cell layers. We {{found that the}} main metabolite of 3 H-arachidonic acid (3 H-AA), formed by freshly prepared. upper epidermal layers (stratum granulosum and spinosum), upon RP-HPLC co-eluted with authentic 3 H- 12 -HETE. A 3 H- 15 -HETE co-eluting peak selectively occurred in chromatograms obtained from supernatants of fractions containing basal cells. Supernatants of freshly prepared suspensions rich in basal keratinocytes appeared to contain 3 H- 15 -HETE as their main 3 H-AA metabolite, by far exceeding the <b>recovered</b> <b>amounts</b> of 3 H- 12 -HETE. Moreover, keratinocytes cultured for 1 week or longer were found to produce predominantly a 3 H-AA metabolite co-eluting with 3 H- 15 -HETE. In supernatants of cultured cells, little if any 3 H- 12 -HETE was detectable. Cultured human skin fibroblasts were not found to produce relevant amounts of HETE. Genuine tissue rich in basal cells, i. e., cells of hair follicles, were found to form twice as much 3 H- 15 -HETE as 3 H- 12 -HETE (3 H- 15 -HETE/ 3 H- 12 -HETE-ratio = 1. 9 ± 0. 8; n = 7). Apparently, different epidermal layers are able to produce a characteristic pattern of 3 H-AA metabolites. 3 H- 15 -HETE generation {{seems to be a}} marker for proliferating keratinocytes, whereas 3 H- 12 -HETE formation appears to be typical for differentiating suprabasal epidermal cells. Our results may explain the heretofore varying patterns of AA-metabolites by keratinocytes reported in the literature...|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} of human odor volatiles {{is of interest}} to forensic applications as a path to investigate canine scent discriminations in legal investigations. A study using a selected array of previously identified human odor compounds has been conducted to determine the retention and release capabilities of five (5) natural and synthetic fabric types, cotton (mercerized fabric and gauze matrix), polyester, rayon and wool. A direct spike approach as well {{the use of a}} dynamic airflow device were the two approaches used for the {{collection of}} the selected volatile organic mix. The direct spike experiment showed how natural, cellulosic fibers such as viscose rayon showed an enhanced ability to release a reproducible volatile odor profile. Rayon demonstrated to be the fabric type with the highest recovered scent mass amounts, followed by wool and polyester. As was expected cotton showed the lowest <b>recovered</b> <b>amounts,</b> possibly due to its complex fiber morphology which enhances the possibility of chemicals to be retained in higher rates within the structure of the cotton fiber. Samples collected on the same fabric substrate showed a reproducible odor profile as measured via hierarchical clustering which corroborates previous live human odor studies and which can be pivotal in forensic biometric measurements. The introduction of an airflow variable to volatile collection decreased the amounts recovered for all fiber types. The reproducibility for each fabric type between replicate sampling was also reduced and a statistical significant difference (P< 0. 001) was observed in the interaction between airflow speed and fabric type. The cotton fabric was the material which showed enhance collection at the low airflow speed as observed by the recovered mass amount. In conclusion, these findings d...|$|E
