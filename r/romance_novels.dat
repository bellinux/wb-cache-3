5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} <b>romance</b> <b>novels,</b> most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other <b>romance</b> <b>novels</b> of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. The books were set almost entirely {{in the world of}} the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E

25|$|This subgenre {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of other subgenres, including Regency romance. Mass-market historical <b>romance</b> <b>novels</b> are rarely published in hardcover, with fewer than 15 receiving that status each year, less than one-fifth of the number of contemporary <b>romance</b> <b>novels</b> published in that format. Because historical romances are primarily published in mass-market format, their fortunes are tied to a certain extent to the mass-market trends. Booksellers and large merchandisers now sell fewer mass market paperbacks, preferring trade paperbacks or hardcovers, which prevents historical romances from being sold in some price clubs and other mass merchandise outlets.|$|E

25|$|Erotic {{romance is}} {{a blend of}} romance and erotica. Erotic <b>romance</b> <b>novels</b> are {{characterized}} by strong sexual content, but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres. Erotic <b>romance</b> <b>novels</b> tend to use more frank language, avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content. These novels also usually include more sex scenes, often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene, and may include more unusual positions or acts. Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes, however, erotic romance is not identical to traditional pornography. Pornography concentrates on the sex acts, but erotic novels include well-developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts.|$|E
