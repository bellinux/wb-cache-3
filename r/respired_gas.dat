This phenomenon, which occurs at stable ambient pressures, at 1 or many ATA, has been designated the isobaric gas counterdiffusion syndrome. In a series of analyses and experiments in vivo and in vitro the cause of the syndrome has been established as due to gas accumulation and development of gas bubbles in tissues as a result of differences in selective diffusivities, for various <b>respired</b> and ambient <b>gases,</b> in the tissue substances between capillary blood and the surrounding atmosphere.

40|$|Background: Inhaled {{nitric oxide}} (NO) at levels between 5 and 80 ppm {{has been used}} {{experimentally}} to treat a variety of conditions. NO also is a common environmental air pollutant in industrial regions. As compressed hospital air is drawn from the local environment, we speculated that it may contain NO contamination, which, if present, would provide unwitting inhaled NO therapy to all subjects <b>respiring</b> this compressed <b>gas.</b> Methods: NO levels were measured twice daily from ambient hospital air and compressed gas sources driving positive pressure ventilation from two adjacent hospitals and compared with NO levels reported daily by local Environmental Protection Agency sources. An NO chemiluminescence analyzer (Sievers 270 B; Boulder, Colo) sensitive to ≤ 2 parts per billion {{was used to measure}} NO levels in ambient air and compressed gas. Results: NO levels in ambient air and hospital compressed air covaried from day to day, and absolute levels of NO differed between hospitals with the difference never exceeding 1. 4 ppm (range, 0 to 1. 4 ppm; median, 0. 07 ppm). The hospital with the highest usage level of compressed air had the highest levels of NO, which approximated ambient levels of NO. NO levels were lowest on weekends in both hospitals. We also documented inadvertent NO contamination in one hospital occurring over 5 days, which corresponded to welding activity near the intake port for fresh gas. This contamination resulted in systemwide NO levels of 5 to 8 ppm. Conclusion: Hospital compressed air contains highly variable levels of NO that tend to covary with ambient NO levels and to be highest when the rate of usage is high enough to preclude natural degradation of NO in 21 % oxygen. Assuming that inhaled NO may alter gas exchange, pulmonary hemodynamics, and outcome from acute lung injury, the role of unwitting variable NO of hospital compressed air needs to be evaluated...|$|R

However, this procedure is limited to measuring the electrical activity of the heart using electrocardiography and intermittent blood pressure (BP) measurements and does not involve the continuous assessment of heart functioning. In this study, we compared continuous beat-to-beat pulse contour analysis to monitor noninvasive cardiac output (CO) during exercise with inert gas rebreathing and <b>respired</b> <b>gas</b> analysis. Nineteen healthy male volunteers were subjected to bicycle ergometry testing with increasing workloads. Cardiac output was deter- mined noninvasively by continuous beat-to-beat pulse contour analysis (Nexfin) and by inert gas rebreathing, and estimated using the <b>respired</b> <b>gas</b> analysis method. The effects of the rebreathing maneuver on heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and CO were evaluated. The CO values derived from the Nexfin- and inert gas rebreathing methods were well correlated (r = 0. 88, P < 0. 01) and the limits of agreement were 30. 3 % with a measurement bias of 0. 4 ± 1. 8 L/min. Nexfin- and <b>respired</b> <b>gas</b> analysis-derived CO values correlated even better (r = 0. 94, P < 0. 01) and the limits of agreement were 21. 5 % with a measurement bias of - 0. 70 ± 1. 6 L/min. At rest, the rebreathing maneuver increased HR by 13 beats/min (P < 0. 01), SV remained unaffected (P = 0. 7), while CO increased by 1. 0 L/min (P < 0. 01).

Encapsulation of the nitroxides into the microsphere greatly increased the sensitivity of the electron paramagnetic resonance signal line width to oxygen because of the higher solubility of oxygen in organic solvents. The encapsulation also protected the nitroxide from bioreduction.

40|$|The use of {{sidestream}} analyzers for <b>respired</b> <b>gas</b> {{analysis is}} almost universal.

Using direct absorption spectroscopy with a diode laser operating at a wavelength near 2 μm, measurements of expired carbon dioxide concentrations were obtained with an absolute limit of detection of 0. 04 % at a time resolution of 10 ms. Simultaneously, cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy at a wavelength near 760 nm was employed to obtain measurements of expired oxygen concentrations with an absolute limit of detection of 0. 26 % at a time resolution of 10 ms.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to understand better the mechanisms leading to the decrease in exercise capacity observed in horses suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Five COPD horses were submitted to a standardized submaximal treadmill exercise test while they were in clinical remission or in acute crisis. Respiratory airflow, O 2 and CO 2 fractions in the <b>respired</b> <b>gas,</b> pleural pressure changes and heart rate were recorded, and arterial and mixed venous blood were analyzed for gas tensions, hemoglobin, and plasma lactate concentrations. O 2 consumption, CO 2 production, expired minute ventilation, tidal volume, alveolar ventilation, cardiac output, total pulmonary resistance, and mechanical work of breathing were calculated. The results showed that, when submaximally exercised, COPD horses in crisis were significantly more hypoxemic and hypercapnic and that their total pulmonary resistance and mechanical work of breathing were significantly higher and their expired minute ventilation significantly lower than when they were in remission. However, their O 2 consumption remained unchanged, which was probably due to the occurrence of compensatory mechanisms, i. e., higher heart rate, cardiac output, and hemoglobin concentration. Last, their net anaerobic metabolism seemed to be more important. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} pulmonary fuinc-tion must include measurements of pulmonary ventilation, diffusion, and circulation. An ac-curate measurement of alveolar ventilation, in-dependent of diffusion and circulation, is desir-able. To date, no method has been wholly satisfactory (3). One {{approach has been}} by study of {{the time course of}} equilibration of alveolar gas with a "foreign " inspired gas, such as H 2 (4), He (5 - 7) or pure 02 (8 - 15). A prin-cipal difficulty has been to differentiate between the effects of an enlarged respiratory dead space and of uneven alveolar ventilation, both of which can retard the completion of equilibration. The development by Lilly and Hervey of the N 2 meter, for continuous analysis of N 2 con-centration of <b>respired</b> <b>gas,</b> permits an automatic breath-by-breath analysis of gas expired during and after the change from breathing air to unin-terrupted breathing of 02. The ensuring pro-gressive elimination of pulmonary N 2 represents the process of equilibration with a N 2 -free gas, and may be analyzed in terms of alveolar ventila-tion. This paper presents the pulmonary N 2 clearance curves obtained from healthy persons and patients with cardiorespiratory disease, and a method for analysis of these curves which yields a comprehensive picture of the volume and time characteristics of alveolar ventilation. The lungs of healthy subjects, to a small degree, and of persons with cardiorespiratory disease to a greater degree, are ventilated unevenly; i. e., certain regions appear to be ventilated more rapidly than other regions.

40|$|Four {{different}} measures (PETCO 2, PACO 2, PADCO 2, and PJCO 2) for indirectly estimating arterial PCO 2 (PaCO 2) from <b>respired</b> <b>gas</b> at {{the mouth}} have been investigated. PETCO 2 was the end-tidal PCO 2. PACO 2 was calculated using a reconstruction of the alveolar oscillation of PCO 2 obtained from the end-tidal "plateau" in PCO 2. PADCO 2 was calculated as for PACO 2 except {{that the effects of}} dead space were incorporated. PJCO 2 was calculated from an empirical relationship involving PETCO 2 and tidal volume. Six subjects were studied at rest and during cycle ergometry at 50 and 100 W while breathing a variety of gas mixtures. Arterial samples were drawn for determination of true PaCO 2. The differences for each method between estimated and true PaCO 2 at rest and at 50 and 100 W were as follows: PETCO 2, - 1. 35 +/- 2. 64, 1. 67 +/- 2. 31, and 2. 67 +/- 2. 02 (SD) Torr; PaCO 2, - 2. 15 +/- 2. 73, - 0. 80 +/- 2. 18, and - 0. 35 +/- 2. 31 (SD) Torr; PADCO 2, - 1. 55 +/- 2. 54, 0. 25 +/- 2. 16, and 0. 63 +/- 2. 26 (SD) Torr; and PJCO 2, - 1. 41 +/- 2. 30, 0. 12 +/- 1. 79, and 0. 08 +/- 1. 96 (SD) Torr.

MethodsEight men (age = 24. 6 ±mm 5. 5 years; height = 179 ±mm 4. 1 cm; mass = 78. 1 ±mm 3. 4 kg; body mass index = 24 ±mm 2. 5 kg/m− 2; body fat = 18. 9 #mm 4. 3 %) completed a maximal treadmill exercise test under two randomly ordered conditions: pre-exercise stretching (PES) and no stretching (CONTROL). Electrocardiogram (ECG) and <b>respired</b> <b>gas</b> analysis were continuously recorded at rest, during, and for 5 min following exercise testing. The stretching exercises for the PES condition consisted of six passive stretches comprising upper and lower body muscle groups performed three times each for 30 sec with 10 sec passive rest between repetitions. ResultsThe {{results indicated that the}} rMSSD was significantly (p< 0. 01) faster for the CONTROL versus the PES condition during the 5 min following exercise testing. Additionally, significantly lower low-frequency power (PES = 3. 20 ±mm 1. 14 ms 2; CONTROL= 24. 65 ±mm 7. 57 ms 2; p< 0. 001) and total power (PES = 23. 57 ±mm 7. 41 ms 2; CONTROL = 195. 90 ±mm 46. 37 ms 2; p< 0. 001) responses were visually detected for the PES versus CONTROL condition following exercise testing.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} ventilatory, cardiovascular and metabolic parameters during recovery from strenuous exercise in horses {{suffering from a}} crisis of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and to determine whether ipratropium dry powder inhalation (DPI) before exercise has an effect on these parameters. When 6 saddle horses, affected with COPD, developed airway obstruction, they inhaled placebo and ipratropium (2400 pghorse), the order being randomly chosen. Pulmonary function tests were then recorded 15 min after inhalation. Following these tests, the horses underwent a strenuous treadmill exercise, followed by a ecovery period that consisted of a 10 min walk. Measurements were made at the first and tenth min of recovery. Respiratory flow, 0 2 and C 02 fractions in the <b>respired</b> <b>gas,</b> pleural pressure changes and heart rate were recorded. Arterial and mixed venous blood samples were analysed or gas tensions, haemoglobin and plasma lactate concentrations. Oxygen consumption (Wz), C 02 production, tidal volume, alveolar oxygen tension (PAOz), alveolar ventilation, the alveolar-pulmonary capillary oxygen difference ((A-a) dOz) and total pulmonary resistance (RL) were measured. The PA 02 was the only parameter significantly improved during recovery following ipratropium DPI. This improvement was not accompanied by evidence of improvement of other ventilatory or cardiorespiratory parameters. The results showed that in horses suffering from a crisis of COPD, recovery is characterised by an exercise-induced bronchodilation. Secondly, ipratropium DPI at a dose of 2400 pghorse is an effective bronchoddator in these horses at rest but it has little effect on the airway calibre during the recovery period. It is suggested that the short term recovery period is still Muenced by exercise-induced adjustments that may exceed the bronchodilatory effect of inhaled ipratropium that are observed before exercisePeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a Fleisch No. 5 pneumotachometer (F), and two commercial ultrasonic pneumotachometers, the BRDL (B) and the Spiroson (S) systems were compared in respect to their use for determination of ventilatory parameters at rest and during lobeline-induced hyperpnoea. Five clinically healthy Thoroughbred horses were tested with the three pneumotachometers in random order. Respiratory airflow, <b>respired</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations, oesophageal pressures, pressures within the mask systems and arterial blood gases were determined before and during lobeline-induced hyperpnoea. Because measured peak expiratory airflow rates exceeded the stated linear range of the Fleisch pneumotachometer (approximately +/- 25 l s(- 1)) differential pressure-flow curves were determined in vitro over the range of flows recorded in vivo. Expired flows greater than the linear range were corrected according to the derived regression equation. No differences {{in any of the}} measured variables among the three systems were present at rest. At peak ventilation of lobeline-induced hyperpnoea mask pressures [Delta P(mask) (mean (SEM)) : F: 9. 6 (2. 8) cm H(2) O, B: 0. 8 (0. 4) cm H(2) O, S: 1. 4 (0. 8) cm H(2) O] and end tidal carbon dioxide [ET CO(2) (mean (SEM)) : F: 2. 6 (0. 1) %, B: 2. 1 (0. 2) %, S: 2. 1 (0. 1) %] were significantly higher in system F. Despite a tendency for respiratory frequency and peak inspired and expired flows, to be lower with system F, no significant differences in the measurements of ventilatory mechanics were detected. In conclusion, the ultrasonic flowmeters pose significantly lower resistive loads onto the respiratory system during ventilation above resting levels than Fleisch No 5 pneumotachometers. However, at the flowrates achieved during lobeline-induced hyperpnoea an in vitro calibration of the differential pressure-flow relationship allows correction for expiratory alinearity in system F. In addition, the {{performance of}} the Spiroson flowmeter is accurate in determining ventilatory mechanics at rest and during lobeline-induced hyperpnoea. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Consistently, {{reports in}} the {{literature}} have identified that a sedentary lifestyle contributes to the progression {{of a range of}} chronic degenerative diseases. The measurement of energy expenditure and physical activity pattern in children is a challenge for all professionals interested in paediatric health and from a broader perspective, the public health fraternity charged with considering longer term health consequences of physical inactivity. The primary objective of this thesis was to identify a suitable indirect and objective measurement technique for the assessment of energy expenditure and physical activity pattern in children. The ideal characteristics of such a technique are that it should be reproducible and have been validated against a criterion reference method. To achieve this goal, a series of methodological studies were undertaken (Chapters II and III). This work was essential to increase accuracy during the individualised laboratory calibration process and further minimise prediction errors when analysing data from 7 days of monitoring under free-living conditions {{in the second part of}} the study (Chapters IV and V). In the first study to verify the combined effect of body position, apparatus and distraction on children's resting metabolic rate (RMR), experiments were carried out on 14 children aged 8 - 12 (mean age = 10. 1 years ± 1. 4). Each participant underwent 2 test sessions, one week apart under three different situations: a) using mouthpiece and nose-clip (MN) or facemask (FM); b) sitting (SEAT) or lying (LY) and c) TV viewing (TV) or no TV viewing. In the first session, following 20 min rest and watching TV, the following protocol was used: LY: 20 min - stabilisation; 10 min using MN and 10 min using FM. Body position was then changed to seated: 20 min stabilisation; 10 min using FM; 10 min using MN. In the second session, FM and MN order was changed and participants did not watch TV. Data were analysed according to the eight combinations among the three studied parameters. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated statistically significant differences for &VO 2 (p= 0. 01) and RMR (p= 0. 02), with TVMNSEAT showing higher values than TVFMLY. Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias for &VO 2, &VCO 2, RQ and RMR between TVFMLY and TVMNSEAT of - 17. 8 ± 14. 5 ml. min- 1, - 8. 8 ± 14. 5 ml. min- 1, 0. 03 ± 0. 05 and - 115. 2 ± 101. 9 kcal. d- 1, respectively. There were no differences in RMR measurements due to body position and apparatus when each variable was isolated. Analyses of distraction in three of four combinations indicated no difference between TV and no TV. In summary, different parameter combinations can result in increased bias and variability and thereby reported differences among children's RMR measurement. The second study dealt with treadmill adaptation and determination of self-selected (SS) walking speed. Assessment of individual and group differences in metabolic energy expenditure using oxygen uptake requires that individuals are comfortable with, and can accommodate to, the equipment being utilised. In this study, a detailed proposal for an adaptation protocol based on the SS was developed. Experiments were carried out on 27 children aged 8 - 12 (mean age = 10. 3 ± 1. 2 yr). Results from three treadmill tests following the adaptation protocol showed similar results for step length with no significant differences among tests and lower and no statistically significant variability within- and between-days. Additionally, no statistically significant differences between SS determined over-ground and on a treadmill were verified. These results suggest that SS speed determined over-ground is reproducible on a treadmill and the 10 min familiarisation protocol based on this speed provided sufficient exposure to achieve accommodation to the treadmill. The purpose of the third study was to verify within- and between-day repeatability and variability in children's oxygen uptake (&VO 2), gross economy (GE) [&VO 2 divided by speed] and heart rate (HR) during treadmill walking based on SS. 14 children (mean age = 10. 2 ± 1. 4 yr) undertook 3 testing sessions over 2 days in which four walking speeds, including SS, were tested. Within- and between-day repeatability was assessed using the Bland and Altman method and coefficients of variability (CV) were determined for each child across exercise bouts and averaged to obtain a mean group CV value for &VO 2, GE and HR per speed. Repeated measures ANOVA showed no statistically significant differences in within- or between-day CV for &VO 2, GE or HR at any speed. Repeatability within and between-day for &VO 2, GE and HR for all speeds was verified. These results suggest that submaximal &V O 2 during treadmill walking is stable and reproducible at a range of speeds based on children's SS. In the fourth study, the objective was to establish the effect of walking speed on substrate oxidation during a treadmill protocol based on SS. Experiments were carried out on 12 girls aged 8 - 12 (mean age = 9. 9 ± 1. 4 yr). Each participant underwent 2 test sessions, one week apart. Workloads on the treadmill included 2 speeds slower than SS (1. 6 [V 1] and 0. 8 km. h- 1 [V 2] slower than SS), SS (V 3), and a speed 0. 8 km. h- 1 faster than SS (V 4). Indirect calorimetry from <b>respired</b> <b>gas</b> measurements enabled total fat (FO) and carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation rates to be calculated according to the non-protein respiratory quotient (Peronnet and Massicote, 1991) and percentage of CHO and FO calculations using equations from McGilvery and Goldstein (1983). Repeated measures ANOVA followed by a Tukey Post Hoc test (p 50 %P &VO 2 (P &VO 2 = the highest &VO 2 observed during an exercise test to exhaustion). Results of the current study compared to observations in the literature showed that HR I 140 bpm consistently estimates lower MVPA time than HR > 50 %P &VO 2. When these two PA indices were compared with individual and standard MET measured minute-byminute, statistically significant differences were verified among all of them at MPA, but no differences were verified at VPA, except between individual and standard METs. However, whether each one of the PA indices used are under- or overestimating time at MVPA is still debatable due to the lack of a gold standard. Finally, each index used in this study classified different numbers of participants as achieving the PA target of 60 min. d- 1. The wide variability between indices when attempting to classify children who are achieving the recommended target is cause for great concern because habitually these indices are utilised as screening tools in paediatric and public health settings and used to guide behavioural interventions...|$|E
