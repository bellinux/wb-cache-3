40|$|Abstract. As cutter {{radial runout}} and {{deformation}} play a main role in processing precision, surface roughness and cutter wear during hard milling, {{the effects of}} the former two factors on actual cutting radius and cutting chip thickness are analyzed during milling process briefly in this paper. The vector direction of <b>radius</b> <b>runout</b> and deformation are assumed to be the same. Then, the milling force of cutting cutter whirling a circle is simulated under the three-dimensional feed motion, and the simulation result agrees well with the experimental result...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{numerical}} model {{was used to}} predict the surface roughness of parts machined by contour milling processes, taking into account only the tool eccentricity or both the tool eccentricity and the runout of the tool as differences in the tool edge radii, {{as a function of}} feed per tooth and per turn fz. The computational model allows determining the value of both average roughness Ra and peakto-valley roughness Rt, and is based on the geometric tool-part intersection. In a first step, the effect of only eccentricity as a function of feed fz was studied, assuming that there is no error in the tool <b>radii</b> (no <b>runout).</b> In a second step, the influence of both eccentricity and runout as a function of feed fz was studied. When runout was also considered, 100000 runs were performed for each fz value using a random runout in each run in order to get simulated roughness values. Several graphics were obtained with the maximum and minimum value of average roughness Ra and of peak-to-valley roughness Rt for each value of feed fz. In a previous work, the effect of runout as a function of feed fz was studied, assuming that the tool has no eccentricity. In this work, the previous results with no eccentricity were compared with the new results obtained when taking into account only eccentricity or both runout and eccentricity, {{in order to determine the}} influence of eccentricity on surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{observations}} {{of the collapse of}} initially vertical columns of small grains are presented. The experiments were performed mainly with dry grains of salt or sand, with some additional experiments using couscous, sugar or rice. Some of the experimental flows were analysed using high-speed video. There are three different flow regimes, dependent on the value of the aspect ratio a =hi/ri, where hi and ri are the initial height and radius of the granular column respectively. The differing forms of flow behaviour are described for each regime. In all cases a central, conically sided region of angle approximately 59 ◦, corresponding to an aspect ratio of 1. 7, remains undisturbed throughout the motion. The main experimental results for the final extent of the deposit and the time for emplacement are systematically collapsed in a quantitative way independent of any friction coefficients. Along with the kinematic data for the rate of spread of the front of the collapsing column, this is interpreted as indicating that frictional effects between individual grains in the bulk of the moving flow only {{play a role in the}} last instant of the flow, as it comes to an abrupt halt. For a < 1. 7, the measured final <b>runout</b> <b>radius,</b> r∞, is related to th...|$|R
