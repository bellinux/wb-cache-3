40|$|This work {{examined}} the extraction properties of metallic elements from municipal incinerator fly ash under hydrothermal conditions. The ash was firstly pre-washed by distilled water, then subjected to hydrothermal treatments. The pre-washing process was effective for Na, K, Ca extraction with extraction percentages of 67 %, 76 % and 48 %, respectively. The optimum contact time was 30 min for the pre-washing process. Five types of acids were {{tested for the}} extraction experiments and hydrochloric acid {{was found to be}} most effective for metal extraction from the ash. Compared to <b>room</b> <b>condition,</b> hydrothermal. treatment accelerated the dissolution of the ash, thus promoted the reaction of acid with hazardous metals such as Cr, Cd, Pb, and furthermore, the consumption speed of acid was slowed down under hydrothermal condition. The acid simultaneously reacted with all the metal in the ash under hydrothermal condition but preferentially reacted with Ca at <b>room</b> <b>condition.</b> The optimum hydrothermal treatment temperature, time and liquid/solid ratio were 150 degrees C, 5 h and 10 : 1 (ml:g), respectively.

40|$|Oilly seeds, such {{as those}} of {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.), have short storability (3 - 4 months in <b>room</b> <b>condition)</b> due to oxidative stress during storage. The objective of this research was to determine whether prestorage seed invigoration by antioxidants, could improve storability of sunflower seeds. The research was performed using fresh harvested seeds. Prestorage seed invigorations were conducted by matriconditioning with water or antioxidants solution i. e. 4. 17 % curcumin or 100 and 150 ppm ascorbic acid. The seeds were stored for four months at <b>room</b> <b>condition</b> (28 - 29 °C and 62 - 79 % relative humidity). Observations were conducted monthly. Experiment was arranged in split plot design. The result showed that all prestorage seed invigoration treatments were not effective to enhance storability of sunflower seeds compared to control. Inefficiency exogenous antioxidants was probably due to highly endogenous antioxidants activity during storage. This was indicated by the slow deterioration rate of control seeds, or due to high concentration of curcumin which was actually potential to enhance storability of sunflower seeds. It is suggested that presowing treatment and midstorage treatment will enhance storability of sunflower seeds...|$|R

40|$|While {{research}} indicates that technology can be useful for supporting learning and collaboration, there is still relatively little uptake or widespread implementation of these technologies in classrooms. In this paper, we explore {{one aspect of the}} development of a multi-touch classroom, looking at two different designs of the classroom environment to explore how classroom layout may influence group interaction and learning. Three classes of students working in groups of four were taught in the traditional forward-facing <b>room</b> <b>condition,</b> while three classes worked in a centered <b>room</b> <b>condition.</b> Our results indicate that while the outcomes on tasks were similar across conditions, groups engaged in more talk (but not more off-task talk) in a centered room layout, than in a traditional forward-facing room. These results suggest that the use of technology in the classroom may be influenced by the location of the technology, both in terms of the learning outcomes and the interaction behaviors of students. The findings highlight the importance of considering the learning environment when designing technology to support learning, and ensuring that integration of technology into formal learning environments is done with attention to how the technology may disrupt, or contribute to, the classroom interaction practices...|$|R

50|$|SU-8 is a 3 {{component}} UV-sensitive negative photo-resist {{based on}} epoxy resin, gamma butyrolactone and triaryl sulfonium salt. The SU-8 polymerizes at approximately 100 °C and is temperature-stable up to 150 °C. This polymer adhesive is CMOS and bio-compatible and has excellent electrical, mechanical and fluidic properties. It {{also has a}} high cross-linking density, high chemical resistance and high thermal stability. The viscosity depends on the mixture with the solvent for different layer thicknesses (1.5 to 500 µm). Using multilayer coating a layer thickness up to 1 mm is reachable. The lithographic structuring {{is based on a}} photoinitiator triaylium-sulfonium that releases lewis acid during UV radiation. This acid works as catalyst for the polymerization. The connection of the molecules is activated over different annealing steps, so called post exposure bake (peb). Using SU-8 can achieve a high bonding yield. In addition, the substrate flatness, clean <b>room</b> <b>conditions</b> and the wettability of the surface are important factors to achieve good bond results.|$|E
5000|$|Coating: Coating is {{the process}} step in which a layer is applied on the cavity surface of the optical insert which protects the mould against wear, corrosion, friction, {{sticking}} of glass and chemical reactions with glass. For coating the surface of moulds by physical vapour deposition (PVD), metals are evaporated in combination with process-gas-based chemicals. On the tool surface, highly adherent thin coatings are synthesized. Materials for coatings on optical inserts are Platinum-based PVD (mostly iridium-alloyed, standard), diamond-like carbon (not yet commercially available), SiC (CVD) on SiC-ceramics (not yet commercially available, have to be post-machined) or TiAlN (not yet commercially available). To achieve a homogeneous layer thickness, the mould's position has to be changed during coating. To prepare the mould for the coating the surfaces have to be degreased, cleaned (under clean room or near-clean <b>room</b> <b>conditions)</b> and batched. Especially the cathode of the machine has to be cleaned. After this process the workpiece has to be debatched.|$|E

Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed the data extracted from a standard questionnaire filled out by the patients presented to the emergency department of Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital over 6 -month periods {{before and after the}} beginning of HSE.

5000|$|RLGs require {{accurate}} machining, use {{of precision}} mirrors, and assembly under clean <b>room</b> <b>conditions.</b> Their mechanical dithering assemblies add somewhat to their weight but not appreciably. RLGs {{are capable of}} logging in excess of 100,000 hours of operation in near-room temperature conditions. Their lasers have relatively high power requirements. [...] Interferometric FOGs are purely solid-state, require no mechanical dithering components, do not require precision machining, {{are not subject to}} lock-in, have a flexible geometry, and can be made very small. They use many standard components from the telecom industry. In addition, the major optical components of FOGs have proven performance in the telecom industry, with lifespans measured in decades. However, the assembly of multiple optical components into a precision gyro instrument is costly. Analog FOGs offer the lowest possible cost but are limited in performance; digital FOGs offer the wide dynamic ranges and accurate scale factor corrections required for stringent applications. Use of longer and larger coils increases sensitivity at the cost of greater sensitivity to temperature variations and vibrations.|$|E

40|$|Background: Manufacturers supply {{alginate}} impression {{materials as}} a powder that is packaged in bulk and in individual container. Some Indonesian dental suppliers often repackage the bulk alginate into individual plastic packages {{which are not}} tied tightly and stored in the display room without air conditioner. It is known that critical factors to the shelf life of alginate includer avoidance of moisture contamination which may lead to premature setting of the alginate and avoidance of high temperature which may cause depolymerization of the alginate. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine storage duration effect of repacked alginates on deformation recovery. Methods: Two brands of alginates (Tulip®TU, and Aroma Fine DF III®AF) were repacked into 120 plastic containers. The samples were stored in <b>room</b> <b>condition</b> (temperature 29 ° C ± 1 ° C, relative humidity 60 % ± 10 %) for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks. The alginates setting time and recovery from deformation were measured according to the ANSI/ADA specification number 18 (ISO 1563). result: The results revealed that there was decreased setting time during 5 weeks but there was slight decreased in deformation recovery after 3 weeks storage. The ANOVA showed there was no significant difference of alginates deformation recovery among the storage times (p > 0. 05).
