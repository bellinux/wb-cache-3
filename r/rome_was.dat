5|$|As a free agent, <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> {{unable to}} secure an NHL contract, and instead {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} attend the Detroit Red Wings training camp on a try-out for the 2014–15 season.

5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and while it is true that <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E

5|$|The Corinthian {{order of}} {{architectural}} style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural {{style in the}} age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome.

5|$|The Roman/Latin cavalry was {{sufficient}} while <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> {{in conflict with}} other states in the mountainous Italian peninsula, which also disposed of limited cavalry resources. But as <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> confronted by external enemies that deployed far more powerful cavalry elements, such as the Gauls and the Carthaginians, the Roman deficiency in cavalry numbers could be a serious liability, which in the Second Punic War (218–202BC) resulted in crushing defeats. Hannibal's major victories at the Trebia and at Cannae, were owed to his Spanish and Gallic heavy cavalry, which far outnumbered the Roman and Latin levies, and to his Numidians, light, fast cavalry which the Romans wholly lacked. The decisive Roman victory at Zama in 202BC, which ended the war, owed much to the Numidian cavalry provided by king Massinissa, which outnumbered the Roman/Latin cavalry fielded by 2 to 1. From then, Roman armies were always accompanied by large numbers of non-Italian cavalry: Numidian light cavalry and, later, Gallic heavy cavalry. For example, Caesar relied heavily on Gallic and German cavalry for his Conquest of Gaul (58–51BC).|$|E

5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of <b>Rome,</b> <b>was</b> mounting and pursuing great purposes, while <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E
5|$|At his death, {{the role}} of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by Ivan III, Grand duke of Muscovy. He had married Andreas' sister, Sophia Paleologue, whose grandson, Ivan IV, would become the first Tsar of Russia (tsar, or czar, meaning caesar, is a term {{traditionally}} applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople.

5|$|In 87 BC, Hybrida {{accompanied}} Lucius Cornelius Sulla into Greece {{either as}} a military tribune or as a legatus. Two years prior, in 89 BC, the Mithridatic Wars had begun due to a dispute between Mithridates VI of Pontus and Nicomedes III of Bithynia over the Roman province of Cappadocia. Mithridates invaded and conquered both Bithynia and Cappadocia {{before moving on to}} invade Roman Greece, which in turn spurred some of the city-states to rebel against Rome. At the time <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> embroiled in internal conflict through the Social Wars from 91 to 88 BC and then almost immediately after, an uprising occurred in Rome which further delayed Sulla's response to Mithridates. After the rebellion in <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> dealt with, Sulla, accompanied by Hybrida, marched on Greece to face the Mithridatic-Greek armies under the command of General Archelaus and Aristion. The First Mithridatic War continued from 86 to 83 BC. During this campaign, Sulla drove the Mithridatic and Greek armies back towards Athens before capturing it in 86 BC, invading Asia Minor the following year and then successfully forcing a peace with Mithridates in 83 BC. Sulla returned to Italia in 83 BC, leaving Lucullus to command forces in Asian and Hybrida to command a small cavalry force in Achaia. In Achaia, Hybrida levied contributions on the province, an offence for which he was prosecuted by the young Julius Caesar in 76 BC However, he refused to appear and succeeded in escaping punishment after appealing to the people's tribunes.|$|E
