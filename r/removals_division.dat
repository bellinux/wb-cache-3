50|$|Hanningtons, Brighton's {{oldest and}} most famous {{department}} store, was opened in a single shop unit in the town's North Street in 1808. By {{the end of the}} 19th century it had expanded substantially and had floated on the stock market. More buildings were acquired throughout the town as the business grew, and by the 1860s Charles Smith Hannington (who had inherited the business from his father) had established a furniture storage and <b>removals</b> <b>division</b> for the benefit of people moving to the many villas and large houses built in Brighton and neighbouring Hove in that era.|$|E

50|$|In Thomas Ricks’ 2012 book The Generals {{he cites}} Baldwin’s <b>removal</b> from <b>division</b> command and letter of admonishment {{as the last}} {{instance}} of a US Army general being held accountable for combat ineffectiveness, {{as opposed to being}} punished for personal failings such as adultery. Ricks contrasts Baldwin’s removal and the World War II relief of corps and division commanders who proved ineffective (many of whom performed well when given second chances) with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the post-Vietnam Army, Ricks argues that a culture of mediocrity exists because generals may be punished for personal misconduct, but are not held accountable for poor job performance.|$|R

The Bexley branch of the CPGB openly defied the CPGB leadership. All its members were expelled in 1971, most establishing the Appeal Group.|$|R
40|$|Perichondrium/periosteum is {{involved}} in regulating long bone growth. Long bones grow faster after <b>removal</b> or circumferential <b>division</b> of periosteum. This can be countered by culturing them in conditioned medium from perichondrium/periosteum cells. Because both complete <b>removal</b> and circumferential <b>division</b> are effective, we hypothesized that perichondrium/periosteum cells require an intact environment to release the appropriate soluble factors. More specifically, we propose that this release depends {{on their ability to}} generate intracellular tension. This hypothesis was explored by modulating the ability of perichondrium/periosteum cells to generate intracellular tension and monitoring the effect thereof on long bone growth. Perichondrium/periosteum cells were cultured on substrates with different stiffness. The medium produced by these cultures was added to embryonic chick tibiotarsi from which perichondrium/periosteum was either stripped or left intact. After 3 culture days, long bone growth was proportionally related to the stiffness of the substrate on which perichondrium/periosteum cells were grown while they produced conditioned medium. A second set of experiments demonstrated that the effect occurred through expression of a growth-inhibiting factor, rather than through the reduction of a stimulatory factor. Finally, evidence for the importance of intracellular tension was obtained by showing that the inhibitory effect was abolished when perichondrium/periosteum cells were treated with cytochalasin D, which disrupts the actin microfilaments. Thus, we concluded that modulation of long bone growth occurs through release of soluble inhibitors by perichondrium/periosteum cells, and that the ability of cells to develop intracellular tension through their actin microfilaments is at the base of this mechano-regulated control pathway...|$|R
25|$|Within {{minutes of}} {{speaking}} with Custer, Pennington {{heard the sound}} of firing, followed by the appearance of a staff officer who told him that Merritt had sent Pennington's brigade into the attack. Custer said he must be mistaken and rode off. Pennington headed for the front only to find that his brigade in fact had attacked, faltered and was pulling back in confusion. In his after action report, Pennington said the failure to maintain contact with Fitzhugh's brigade, the <b>removal</b> of Capehart's <b>division</b> from his left and the fact his men were running out of ammunition caused the retreat. With Pennington's brigade no longer on his left, Devin had to pull his division back. While the Union forces regrouped, Devin supplied Pennington's men with more ammunition and the Union attack was resumed. After renewing their attack, Pennington's brigade fell back again but Devin's division continued their attack against Steuart's and Wallace's brigades.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between Christianity and other religions. Part one looks briefly at the matter of religion itself. Part two provides a condensed historical survey of the attitude of Christianity toward the world outside itself: {{the approach of the}} church to other religions changed from initial appreciation through a long phase of rejection to an increasingly affirmative posture in recent times. This shift is explained by a number of causal factors that gave rise to new understandings regarding God’s work in the world and Christian mission, which in turn led to the emergence of various theologies of religion. The question confronting religious people today is how to foster the <b>removal</b> of interhuman <b>divisions</b> and the promotion of justice and peace. One potential means of achieving this goal is interreligious dialogue. In part three, the author delineates his concept of the four facets of dialogue: that of histories, of theologies, of spiritualities, and of life. Dialogue at all four of these levels is key to the establishment of interreligious convivance, which in our present world is prerequisite to the security and well-being of humanity. <br /...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTracking {{of cells}} in live-imaging {{microscopy}} videos of epithelial sheets {{is a powerful}} tool for investigating fundamental processes in embryonic development. Characterizing cell growth, proliferation, intercalation and apoptosis in epithelia helps us to understand how morphogenetic processes such as tissue invagination and extension are locally regulated and controlled. Accurate cell tracking requires correctly resolving cells entering or leaving the field of view between frames, cell neighbour exchanges, cell <b>removals</b> and cell <b>divisions.</b> However, current tracking methods for epi-thelial sheets are not robust to large morphogenetic deformations and require significant manual interventions. Here, we present a novel algorithm for epithelial cell tracking, exploiting the graph-theoretic concept of a 'maxi-mum common subgraph' to track cells between frames of a video. Our algorithm does not require the adjustment of tissue-specific parameters, and scales in sub-quadratic time with tissue size. It does not rely on precise positional information, permitting large cell movements between frames and enabling tracking in datasets acquired at low temporal resolution due to experimental constraints such as phototoxicity. To demonstrate the method, we perform tracking on the Drosophila embryonic epidermis and compare cell–cell rearrangements to previous studies in other tissues. Our implementation is open source and generally applicable to epithelial tissues...|$|R
40|$|Context: An {{effective}} {{approach to}} emergency {{removal of the}} face mask (FM) from a football helmet should include successful removal of the FM and limitation of both the time required and the movement created during the process. Current recommendations and practice are to use a cutting tool to remove the FM. Researchers recently have suggested an alternate approach that combines {{the use of a}} cordless screwdriver and a cutting tool. This combined tool approach has not been studied, and FM removal has not been studied in a practical setting. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and speed of using a combined tool approach to remove the FMs from football helmets during on-field conditions throughout the course of a football season. Design: Randomized multigroup design. Setting: Practice field of 1 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II football college. Patients or Other Participants: Eighty-four members of 1 football team. Intervention(s) : We used a battery-ope rated screwdriver for FM removal and resorted to using a cutting tool as needed. Main Outcome Measure(s) : We tracked FM removal success and failure and trial time and compared results based on helmet characteristics, weather variables, and the seasonal timing of the removal trial. Results: Of the 84 players, 76 were available for data-collection trials. Overall, 98. 6 % (75 / 76) of FM removal trials were successful and resulted in a mean removal time of 40. 09 +/- 15. 1 seconds. We found no differences in FM removal time throughout the course of the season. No differences in effectiveness or trial time were found among helmet characteristics, weather variables, or the timing of the trial. Conclusions: Combining the cordless screwdriver and cutting tool provided a fast and reliable means of on-field FM <b>removal</b> in this <b>Division</b> II setting. Despite the excellent overall result, 1 FM was not removed in a timely manner. Therefore, we recommend that athletic trainers practice helmet removal to be prepared should FM removal fail...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} France and its empires {{is one that}} has been well trodden, {{particularly}} the French occupation, and subsequent war, in Algeria. In this companion to his earlier work, 2011 ’s The Colonial Heritage of French Comics,McKinney attempts to examine the reconstruction of French national identity in the wake of decolonisation through the medium of Francophonecomics. He endeavours to study the colonial affrontier (3), the space in which France and its colonies are connected and divided, where they seek to confront each other, or to seek peace and the <b>removal</b> of the <b>division.</b> McKinney argues this affrontier can be found most strongly in the Francophone comics produced dealing with the French colonial experience in Algeria, {{as well as that of}} Indochina,and does so from both sides of each conflict. McKinney examines in detail the French colonisation of Algeria (1830 sonwards), the French war in Indochina (1946 – 54) and the Algerian war (1954 – 62), and his work is the first to approach these well-covered areas of research through the medium of comics. The resulting work takes the form of an investigation into the five forms of genealogical inquiry utilised in comics regarding these conflicts. His approach investigates the familial, ethnic, national, artistic and critical forms of genealogy relating to colonialism and imperialism from a variety of viewpoints, including the previously overlooked perspective of the pieds noirs. He aims to highlight both those cartoonists that critique the colonial ideology, as well as those cartoonists who to some extent attempt to gloss over or even romanticise the French empire, strengthening the affrontier. He positions himself alongside Foucault in seeing genealogy as a useful means of establishing ‘historical knowledge of struggles’ (Foucault 1980, 85), but McKinney looks at the colonial representation in a popular medium,including the recent increase in comics produced which consider the French colonial experience. He argues that this consideration of the present, as well as European imperialism, is absent in the work of Foucault. The text is accompanied by a number of black and white facsimiles of pages from the comics he analyses to illustrate the different and often conflicting positions of cartoonists on these issues. Overall, McKinney’s work is a welcome addition to the study of the French colonial experience, which separates its elf from the rest by using Francophonecomics as lenses through which to look at these already well-trodden areas of study. He succeeds in determining if and how cartoonists critique colonial ideology and representations on both sides of the conflicts, a task in which he is unarguably successful. McKinney’s work, however, is unfortunately let down by typo graphicerrors, which occur throughout the text. Nevertheless, McKinney’s work is another important work in the field of Bande Dessine ́e scholarship, and useful for anyone interested in the representations of colonialism and imperialism in French comics, accompanied by anencyclopaedic bibliography of comics produced on this topic...|$|R
