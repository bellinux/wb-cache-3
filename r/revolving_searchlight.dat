He was hidden from sight now by the gathering twilight and the rolling mists. From behind the house came the softly muffled roar of the tide sweeping in, and, with sharper insistence, the whirr of machinery from the boathouse. Granet lit a cigarette and walked thoughtfully away. Just as he climbed into the car, a peculiar light through the trees startled him. He stood up and watched. From the top of the house a slowly <b>revolving</b> <b>searchlight</b> played upon the waters.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, with Charles G. Armstrong, Ryan was {{responsible}} for the first illumination of an entire skyscraper: the new tower of the Singer Building on lower Broadway in New York City was lighted from the base to the 35th floor with arc searchlights, while the top of the tower was outlined with 1,600 incandescent bulbs, the technique that had been used to illuminate buildings up to that time. The illumination, which was planned when the building was designed, was bright enough for colors to be visible, but was patchy; Singer used retouched photographs for advertising. He later illuminated other skyscrapers, in particular in 1912 the General Electric Company Building in Buffalo, New York, which he lighted with arc searchlights and a <b>revolving</b> <b>searchlight</b> in changing colors {{on the top of the}} tower; this scheme prefigured the colored floodlighting of skyscrapers and Ryan's own work for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition three years later. Ryan was also responsible for lighting the interior of that building.|$|E
50|$|General Electric Company Building, Buffalo, New York (1912; new {{lighting}} scheme 1927): multi-level floodlights, purple {{lights on}} tower, <b>revolving</b> <b>searchlights.</b> One {{of the first}} color lighting schemes, {{and one of the}} first to use large lamps instead of outlining with many small ones. Often lit in particular colors for seasonal and other special displays. Building design: Esenwein & Johnson. Lighting design Walter D'Arcy Ryan.|$|R
