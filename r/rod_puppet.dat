5|$|The {{series was}} shot on-location in Romania, {{utilizing}} stop-motion and <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> techniques {{to achieve the}} look the director wanted for the series' subspecies creatures. The series has had mixed reviews with critics citing vampire clichés as a downfall of the films, but generally commending the director's choice in filming in Romania, {{as well as the}} special effects used in the film.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Wijnhamer, known as PahWongso, was {{recognised}} in West Java for his promotion of social causes. These included promoting monogamy {{and faith in}} western medicine, as well as combating gambling {{and the use of}} opium and alcohol. In conveying his messages he often used the Sundanese wayang golek (a form of <b>rod</b> <b>puppet),</b> as the local people were generally unable to read. He was able to speak Dutch, Malay, and Javanese fluently, and had some command of Chinese and Japanese. This social work was funded predominantly from PahWongso's day job, selling fried peanuts (kacang goreng).|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{design to}} the limits, Simonovich-Efimova created puppets {{to be worn}} on the head, {{allowing}} the puppeteer to manipulate several characters simultaneously. She patented {{a new type of}} <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> with rods attached to the elbows to free up the hands. The rods were hidden behind hanging costumes. To make puppets look more lifelike, the Efimovs devised a system where the arms were elongated. Rods rather than the puppeteer's fingers were inserted into the glove to manipulate the arms, which were allowed to move by manipulating strings inside the body of the doll. Simonovich-Efimova utilized other apparatus, like springs in the body of a cat puppet to give it the flexibility of a live animal. These innovations allowed their finely formed, elegantly clad puppets to move about naturally, rather than with the stiff, jerky movements of their predecessors. In an era when almost all puppet performances were designed to entertain children or present government ideology, Simonovich-Efimova went {{out of her way to}} perform shows for adults, including The Enchanted Pear Tree, Macbeth, and works by Molière and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Though she also made adaptations in her work with fables to replace what were seen as outmoded ideas, like replacing serfs with young communist characters, Simonovich-Efimova's focus was on artistry, entertainment and professionalism. She also developed a new system of life-sized manikins, blurring the lines between puppetry and acting, when she danced on stage with her Petrushka. Between 1920 and 1940, the Efimovs performed between 1,500 and 2,000 puppet shows.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the oldest}} forms of folk art is puppetry. Puppeteers use various kinds of puppets, {{including}} marionettes, glove <b>puppets,</b> <b>rod</b> <b>puppets,</b> cloth puppets and wire puppets in performances incorporating folk songs and dances over some dialogues. The subject matter is derived mainly from children's stories and fables.|$|R
5000|$|The puppets of X-Bomber were {{controlled}} from below the set using rods, {{and as a}} consequence were generally seen only from the waist up. Whereas Gerry Anderson's series were episodic in nature, X-Bomber had an overall story arc, with sub-plots and new characters being introduced as the series progressed, leading to a definite end. Similarly, <b>rod</b> <b>puppets</b> were used in Gerry Anderson's 1967 series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons canned as [...] "under-control" [...] puppets due to their inability to walk-whereas everywhere else they were marionettes. Anderson would later use <b>Rod</b> <b>puppets</b> in Terrahawks.|$|R
5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E
25|$|Stan Winston, {{responsible}} for creature effects in Aliens, was approached {{but was not}} available. Winston instead recommended Tom Woodruff, Jr. and Alec Gillis, two former workers of his studio who had just started their own company, Amalgamated Dynamics. Even before principal photography had begun, the practical effects crew was developing models of the Alien and the corpses of the Sulaco victims. Richard Edlund's Boss Film Studios was hired for compositing and other post-production effects. A small number of shots contain computer-generated imagery, most notably the cracking alien head once the sprinklers cause thermal shock. Other CGI elements include shadows cast by the <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> alien, and airborne debris in outdoor scenes.|$|E
25|$|The Alien {{is portrayed}} by both Woodruff, Jr. {{in a suit}} and a <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> filmed against bluescreen and {{optically}} composited into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by rotoscoping. A mechanical alien head was also used for close-ups. The suit adapted the design used in Aliens so Woodruff could walk on all fours. Woodruff's head was contained in the neck of the suit, because the head was filled with animatronics to move the mouth of the Alien. Fincher suggested that a Whippet be dressed in an alien costume for on-set coverage of the quadrupedal alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.|$|E

500|$|The {{subspecies}} creatures, {{which were}} created from Radu's blood, originally began as local Romanian men in rubber suits. The men were filmed on over-scaled sets {{to simulate the}} miniature size of the creatures. The performances of the Romanian men, along with {{the design of the}} rubber suits, caused director Ted Nicolaou to rethink his approach. Nicolaou brought in animator David W. Allen to assist him in creating [...] "more magical" [...] looking subspecies creatures. Allen went through all of the film footage that contained the Romanian extras in their rubber suits with the film's editor in order to find usable footage before and after the men enter the scene. Allen would use the isolated footage to develop a new background for the animated creatures he would later create. Allen created two puppet types, displayed in front of a bluescreen: a stop-motion puppet and a <b>rod</b> <b>puppet.</b> Each of the puppet types were composed of foam rubber, and held similar skeletal systems. Some differences between the two types include tension filled joints for the stop-motion puppet, while the <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> was looser. The flexibility of the rod-puppet allowed for faster movements, which were needed occasionally for real-time filming.|$|E
500|$|The {{extended}} shooting schedule owed much to {{the fact}} that scenes where ghosts and human characters interacted had to be filmed twice; once with human characters acting on set, and then with the ghost characters acting against a blue screen. The two elements would later be digitally composited into one shot with the use of split screen photography. Such sequences required precise timing from the cast as they traded dialogue with characters who were merely blank air. The hardest challenge for the digital animators at Weta was creating the Grim Reaper, which went through many transformations before finding physical form. [...] "We set out with the intention of doing the Reaper as a <b>rod</b> <b>puppet,</b> maybe shooting it in a water tank," [...] Jackson commented. [...] "We even thought of filming someone, dressed in costume, at different camera speeds." [...] Test footage was shot with puppets and a man in a Reaper suit, but in the end, it was decided that using computer animation would be the easiest task. Another entirely computerized character called [...] "the Gatekeeper", a winged cherub who helps guard the cemetery, was deleted from the final cut.|$|E
2500|$|Laine Liska {{was hired}} to lead a team of puppeteers in a new process dubbed [...] "Mo-Motion" [...] where the <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> would be {{simultaneously}} manipulated and filmed with a moving motion control camera. Depending on {{the complexity of the}} shot, the puppet was operated by 4–6 people. Sparse sets were created as they provided freedom of motion for the puppeteers as well as large, solid surfaces for the puppet to act within a three dimensional space.|$|E

50|$|A <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> is {{made out}} of wood wire and string and is {{manipulated}} with wooden or wire rods. Rod puppets can sometimes have a complete working hinged mouth but many do not. A <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> can have a fixed facial expression. Arms are usually a requirement as rods are attached to them. A fish <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> could have a rod attached to the tail to manipulate this section of the puppet. Sometimes special variants exist with additional manipulable parts: (e.g., eyelids that open and close). Many rod puppets depict only the upper half of the character, from the waist up, with the stage covering the missing remainder, but variations sometimes have legs. The legs usually just dangle, but in special cases the legs may be controlled either from behind the stage using rods from below.These are mostly used at carnivals or fairs. A very common example of rod puppets are those of The Muppets and Sesame Street.|$|E
