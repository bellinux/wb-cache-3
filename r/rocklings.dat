50|$|The Lotidae are {{a family}} of cod-like fishes {{commonly}} known as lings or <b>rocklings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{blue ling}} (Molva dypterygia) {{is a member}} of the cod family from the North Atlantic. It is usually 70 to 110 cm long, but the maximum length is 155 cm. Blue ling feed on fish (flatfishes, gobies, <b>rocklings)</b> and {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. The fish reaches sexual maturity at the age of six to 12 years.|$|E
50|$|The shore {{rockling}} is often {{confused with the}} five-bearded rockling (Ciliata mustela) and the larger three-bearded rockling (Gaidropsarus vulgaris), due to their similar colourings, shape, and habitat. As the name suggests, the main visual differences are the five-bearded rockling having five barbels around its mouth, whereas the three-bearded rockling has a significant redness to its brown colouring {{when compared to the}} {{shore rockling}}. Shore <b>rocklings</b> live in and around rocky areas throughout the English Channel, feeding on both worms and crustaceans. Other than in the English Channel, they are also found in the Atlantic (Europe) and Mediterranean.|$|E
5000|$|In Póvoa de Varzim {{there are}} {{subtropical}} and temperate fish species. Tide pools often only exist as separate entities only {{at low tide}} and are habitats of diverse adaptable animals and algae. The most common fish in tide pools are blennies (generally called marachomba), including: Parablennius gattorugine, Parablennius pilicornis, Coryphoblennius galerita, Lipophrys pholis, and Lipophrys trigloides. Other small fish recorded locally include worm pipefish, rock gobies and snail-fish. In larger tide pools, schools of juvenile sargo seabreams, Zebra seabreams, small-headed clingfish, brilliantly-coloured and camouflaged wrasses such as the green wrasse, the Common Wrasse and the Ballan Wrasse, <b>rocklings</b> and juveniles of other species of fish are frequently found.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA better {{knowledge}} on spawning grounds of principal commercial fishes from North Sea {{is necessary for}} their monitoring. Fish egg taxonomic identification based on morphological characters cannot always be carried out effectively. This is particularly {{the case for a}} number of Gadidae fish species eggs (i. e. cod, haddock and whiting, and three rockling species) which have the same range of size and for which molecular-based techniques can help improving the accuracy of egg taxonomic identification, and hence the reliability of studies on spawning areas. In this study, formalin fixation, egg conservation and DNA extraction were optimized in order to develop a specific PCR-RFLP method. Based on the sequence of the cytochrome b gene of reference specimens, a PCR-RFLP method was developed to distinguish eggs of cod, haddock and whiting of one part, and between eggs from three species of <b>rocklings</b> on the other part. Among the 404 eggs tested, 80 % of positive amplification was obtained for <b>rocklings</b> eggs and 86. 36 % for Gadidae eggs. Eggs from Enchelyopus cimbrius, Ciliata mustela and Ciliata septentrionalis, and Gadus morhua, Merlangius merlangus and Melanogrammus aeglefinus were distinguished. with this method. Based on morphological characters, the percentage of misidentification was less for cod than whiting...|$|E
40|$|Fishes of the {{subfamily}} Gaidropsarinae, {{commonly known}} as <b>rocklings,</b> are anatomically unique within the family Gadidae (Teleostei, Gadiformes), mostly because of their possession of a highly specialized chemosensory and vibratile first dorsal fin. The genus Gaidropsarus contains 13 extant species occurring from subtropical to temperate waters in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, South Africa, New Zealand, Tasmania, Japan and southeastern Pacific, plus a single fossil species from the Miocene of Algeria. A new species of rockling, Gaidropsarus pilleri sp. nov., is described from the Middle Miocene (Late Badenian) corallinacean limestone of St. Margarethen in Burgenland, Eisenstadt-Sopron Basin, Austria based on seven articulated skeletons. The new species {{is based on a}} unique combination of features, including: possession of a wide neurocranium (neurocranial width contained less than two times in its length); well-developed sphenotic spine; epibranchials 2 and 3 characterized by massive uncinate processes; presence of 44 (13 + 31) vertebrae; five posterior parapophyses enlarged, the posterior three wing-like; 2 nd dorsal fin contains about 50 rays; anal fin with 43 rays; caudal peduncle very short (2. 4 % SL). Gaidropsarus pilleri sp. nov. is the earliest known occurrence of the <b>rocklings</b> based on skeletal remains. The vibratile and chemosensory first dorsal fin of gaidropsarines may have arisen by co-option of the first dorsal-fin module...|$|E
40|$|We studied otter diet in a {{heterogeneous}} coastal environment in S Spain including sandy and rocky coastal habitats {{as well as}} four small Mediterranean-regime streams. The main sources of environmental variation (rocky coast vs. sandy coast, coastal habitat vs. inland habitats) were clearly reflected in the otter diet composition. In rocky coastal transects otters intensely predated on wrasses, blennies and <b>rocklings,</b> while in sandy coastal ones eels, flatfish and crayfish were characteristic prey types. Grey mullet {{was the most important}} prey type in terms of biomass in both coastal environments. Fish consumption clearly decreased from coastal habitat to inland ones. Otter prey were heavier in coastal than in inland habitats, while consumed fish were heavier in the sandy coast than in the rocky one. Within the wide habitat variation in the study area, otter foraging efficiency was considered maximum in estuarine environments. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Gaidropsarus Rafinesque, 1810 is a genus {{of marine}} fishes, {{commonly}} known as <b>rocklings,</b> comprising 14 living species and showing a high ecological diversity from the intertidal zone to the deep sea. The systematics of this group has been controversial due to {{a general lack of}} representative specimens and the conservative morphology exhibited. A multidisciplinary approach combining the analysis of meristic data and the DNA barcode standard was applied in a species delimitation approach. Individuals representing eight valid and three unnamed species were collected, morphologically identified and archived in several museum collections. Comparison of DNA sequences shows complex results, furthering the idea of the difficult identification of specimens based on traditional taxonomy. DNA barcoding supports synonymies, like G. biscayensis–G. macrophthalmus and G. guttatus–G. mediterraneus, agreeing with the extensive overlaps observed in the meristic variables analysed and suggesting a {{reduction in the number of}} species. Genetic distances showed pairs of closely related species like G. granti–G. vulgaris and G. argentatus–G. ensis, the latter being only distinguished by one main distinctive character. Four deep-water specimens, morphologically classified only to the genus level, constituted three independent taxa apart from the ones present in this study and with no barcode matches in the repository databases. They could represent new records for the North Atlantic or unknown species of this genus. The results obtained show that more studies will be necessary to solve the systematics of this branch of the Gadiformes. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
