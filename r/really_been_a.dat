5|$|By 1139, an {{invasion}} of England by Robert and Matilda appeared imminent. Geoffrey and Matilda had secured much of Normandy and, together with Robert, spent {{the beginning of the}} year mobilising forces for a cross-Channel expedition. Matilda also appealed to the papacy at the start of the year; her representative, Bishop Ulger, put forward her legal claim to the English throne on the grounds of her hereditary right and the oaths sworn by the barons. Arnulf of Lisieux led Stephen's case, arguing that because Matilda's mother had <b>really</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> nun, her claim to the throne was illegitimate. The Pope declined to reverse his earlier support for Stephen, but from Matilda's perspective the case usefully established that Stephen's claim was disputed.|$|E

Chirithy {{claims that the}} events of the Keyblade War have <b>really</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> dream the player has had ever since turning down Ava's offer to join the Dandelions (although in Unchained χ, it is revealed that the player is actually sent to the Unchained Realm by Ephemer and Skuld) and the two decide to rest after confronting a wall of thorns. On {{the other side of the}} thorns, Maleficent (who is heavily implied to have found the Book of Prophecies) congratulates herself with what she has accomplished whilst wondering where Pete is. Confident that Sora and company cannot meddle in this world, she contemplates on conquering this iteration of her home world that she has entered in.|$|E
5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever <b>really</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E

500|$|The ukulele expert Steven Sproat {{considers}} that Formby [...] "was incredible... There hasn't <b>really</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> uke player since Formby—or even before Formby—who played quite like him". Much of Formby's virtuosity {{came from his}} right-hand technique, the split stroke, and he developed his own fast and complicated syncopated musical style with a very fast right-hand strum. Joe Cooper, writing in New Society, considered that [...] "Nobody has ever reproduced the casual devastating right hand syncopation, which so delicately synchronised with deft left hand chord fingering".|$|E
500|$|Best {{decided to}} leave show business, {{and by the time}} of Hunter Davies' {{authorised}} Beatles' biography in 1968, he was not willing to talk about his Beatles association. Years later he stated in his autobiography, [...] "the Beatles themselves certainly never held out a helping hand and only contributed to the destruction with their readily printed gossip that I had never <b>really</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Beatle, that I didn't smile, that I was unsociable and definitely not a good mixer. There was not a single friendly word from any one of them". This culminated in a Beatles' interview published in Playboy magazine in February 1965 in which Lennon stated that [...] "Ringo used to fill in sometimes if our drummer was ill. With his periodic illness." [...] Starr added: [...] "He took little pills to make him ill." [...] Best sued the Beatles for defamation of character, eventually winning an out-of-court settlement for much less than the $18 million he had sought.|$|E
500|$|In September 2005, {{the band}} {{announced}} the album's title and {{revealed that the}} title track, [...] "Lights and Sounds", was confirmed {{to be the first}} single from the album, with a video shot in Van Nuys, California and a release date of November 15. On October 24, the band began a tour in support of the album, during which they began playing at small venues at college arenas. The tour lasted for six weeks. In November 2005, it was announced that guitarist Ben Harper had parted ways with the band. Key explained that the band went through [...] "a lot of the highest and lowest points" [...] and that making an album [...] "would be on the highest list, and losing a member would be on the lowest." [...] He also added, [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> long journey together, you know, so obviously, parting ways with Ben was a really unpleasant experience. It was either go on without him, or don't go on at all. And, at the core, we decided that we had something too great to let go of, and that we had to kind of make a last resort and move on without him." [...] Harper was replaced by Ryan Mendez.|$|E

2500|$|The fallout was significant: {{while the}} hosts were almost universally roasted, their opponents were lauded to the skies. [...] Talk predominated around the forging {{of a new}} world order.

[...] And the 13-year green and golden age in {{international}} cricket has <b>really</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> sequence of overlapping phases, subtly different, distinguished by key retirements: Taylor and Healy in 1999; the Waughs in 2003; Warne and McGrath in 2007." [...] Calls for Shane Warne's return to Test cricket, omnipresent since his retirement in 2007, were now accompanied by calls for him to be given the captaincy in the impending Ashes as well.|$|E
2500|$|Abbess’s initial {{idea for}} the film was his fondness for the name ‘Gabriel.’ He and co-writer Matt Hylton Todd {{researched}} angels and demons in various religions, drawing figures from Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam as well as John Milton’s Paradise Lost. The writers chose their favourite seven angels and favourite seven demons to create an [...] "all-star" [...] supernatural battle. Abbess says, [...] "There hadn’t <b>really</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> movie about angels. Not like this. I hadn’t even seen Constantine at the time, nor the one with Christopher Walken (The Prophecy) in it, {{so as far as}} I knew – and, anyway, this is very different from those – it hadn’t been done before." [...] The writers were interested in the backstory and mythology of purgatory, and aimed to focus more on the characters than the special effects. Gabriel was deliberately designed to be commercial and [...] "franchiseable." [...] It was written as the first part of a trilogy, and, if financially successful, will be followed by two sequels that will explore the world outside purgatory.|$|E
