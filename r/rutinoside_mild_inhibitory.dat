Since two BRAFi/MEKi combinations with similar efficacy are approved, potential differences in their effects on immune cells would enable a rational choice for triple therapies. Therefore, we characterized {{the influence of the}} clinically approved BRAFi/MEKi combinations dabrafenib (Dabra) and trametinib (Tram) vs. vemurafenib (Vem) and cobimetinib (Cobi) on the activation and functionality of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) -transfected T cells.

All BRAFi/MEKi reduced this release as single agents, with Dabra having the <b>mildest</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect, and Dabra + Tram having a clearly <b>milder</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect than Vem + Cobi. A similar picture was observed for the upregulation of the activation markers CD 25 and CD 69 on CAR-transfected T cells after antigen-specific stimulation. Most importantly, the cytolytic capacity of the CAR-T cells was significantly inhibited by Cobi and Vem + Cobi, whereas the other kinase inhibitors showed no effect.

40|$|Background: Euphorbia hirta L. (Euphorbiaceae), {{commonly}} known as Dudhani, is distributed in the warm region of India and China. Traditionally, it is used in respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders. In addition, the antidiabetic property of the plant was also reported in the literature. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effect of aqueous, hydroalcoholic, and methanolic extracts (MEHs) of E. hirta on α-glucosidase and α-amylase in vitro. Materials and Methods: Aqueous, hydroalcoholic, and MEHs of E. hirta were prepared as per application program interface. In α-glucosidase activity, α-glucosidase (0. 1 μ/mL) and substrate, 2. 5 mM p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside was used; absorbance was recorded at 405 nm. In α-amylase activity, α-amylase solution (1. 0 μ/mL) and substrate, 0. 25 % starch were used, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The IC 50 values were calculated by linear regression. Results: All the extracts showed α-glucosidase inhibitory activity comparable to acarbose with MEH having highest inhibitory activity among tested extracts. The observed IC 50 values were 213. 63, 146. 9, 78. 88, and 8. 07 μg/mL for aqueous, hydroalcoholic, MEH, and acarbose, respectively. All the extracts have shown <b>mild</b> α-amylase <b>inhibitory</b> activity compared to acarbose.

40|$|International audienceMetformin, a drug {{widely used}} in the {{treatment}} of Type II diabetes, has recently received attention owing to new findings regarding its mitochondrial and cellular effects. In the present study, the effects of metformin on respiration, complex 1 activity, mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release and cell death were investigated in cultured cells from a human carcinoma-derived cell line (KB cells). Metformin significantly decreased respiration both in intact cells and after permeabilization. This was due to a mild and specific inhibition of the respiratory chain complex 1. In addition, metformin prevented to a significant extent mitochondrial permeability transition both in permeabilized cells, as induced by calcium, and in intact cells, as induced by the glutathione-oxidizing agent t-butyl hydroperoxide. This effect was equivalent to that of cyclosporin A, the reference inhibitor. Finally, metformin impaired the t-butyl hydroperoxide-induced cell death, as judged by Trypan Blue exclusion, propidium iodide staining and cytochrome c release. We propose that metformin prevents the permeability transition-related commitment to cell death in relation to its <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on complex 1, which is responsible for a decreased probability of mitochondrial permeability transition...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyaluronan (HA) plays crucial {{roles in}} the tumourigenicity of many types of {{malignant}} tumours. 4 -Methylumbelliferone (MU) is an inhibitor of HA synthesis. Several studies have shown its inhibitory effects on malignant tumours; however, none have focused on its effects on osteosarcoma. METHODS: We investigated the effects of MU on HA accumulation and tumourigenicity of highly metastatic murine osteosarcoma cells (LM 8) that have HA-rich cell-associated matrix, and human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG- 63 and HOS). RESULTS: In vitro, MU inhibited HA retention, thereby reducing the formation of functional cell-associated matrices, and also inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Akt phosphorylation was suppressed by MU (1. 0 mM). In vivo, although MU showed only a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on {{the growth of the}} primary tumour, it markedly inhibited (75 % reduction) the development of lung metastasis. Hyaluronan retention in the periphery of the primary tumour was markedly suppressed by MU. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that MU suppressed HA retention and cell-associated matrix formation in osteosarcoma cells, resulting in a reduction of tumourigenicity, including lung metastasis. 4 -Methylumbelliferone is a promising therapeutic agent targeting both primary tumours and distant metastasis of osteosarcoma, possibly via suppression of HA retention...|$|R
40|$|Contrasting {{hypotheses}} of mammalian thermoregulation {{were tested}} in unanesthetized rabbits {{in relation to the}} role of the central nervous (CNS) monoamines 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and noradrenaline (NA) in regulating lung function and ear skin blood flow (Doppler flowmeter). Normal rabbits and rabbits with CNS depletion of 5 -HT and NA (caused by the neurotoxins 5, 7 -dihydroxytryptamine and 6 -hydroxydopamine) were studied in an airconditioned chamber at ambient temperatures of 12 °, 22 ° and 35 °C. The results suggest that CNS 5 -HT plays an excitatory role in the heat conservation mechanism of cold-induced ear skin vasoconstriction, and that this effect is inhibited by CNS NA to cause heat dissipation during heat stress. Both CNS 5 -HT and NA appear to exert a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> restraint on ventilation even during heat stress. The data support the theory that CNS 5 -HT is concerned with heat conservation and CNS NA with heat loss mechanisms in the cutaneous circulation, and that both monoamines moderate heat loss through panting.

40|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor (ER) modulates transcription {{by forming}} complexes with other proteins and then binding to the estrogen response element (ERE). We {{have identified a}} novel interaction of this receptor with the POU transcription factors Brn- 3 a and Brn- 3 b which was independent of ligand binding. By pull-down assays and the yeast two-hybrid system, the POU domain of Brn- 3 a and Brn- 3 b was shown {{to interact with the}} DNA-binding domain of the ER. Brn- 3 –ER interactions also affect transcriptional activity of an ERE-containing promoter, such that in estradiol-stimulated cells, Brn- 3 b strongly activated the promoter via the ERE, while Brn- 3 a had a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect. The POU domain of Brn- 3 b which interacts with the ER was sufficient to confer this activation potential, and the change of a single amino acid in the first helix of the POU homeodomain of Brn- 3 a to its equivalent in Brn- 3 b can change the mild repressive effect of Brn- 3 a to a stimulatory Brn- 3 b-like effect. These observations and their implications for transcriptional regulation by the ER are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOxidative {{damage has}} been {{reported}} {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence suggests that the antidiabetic drug metformin prevents oxidative stress-related cellular death in non-neuronal cell lines. In this report, we point to the direct neuroprotective effect of metformin, using the etoposide-induced cell death model. The exposure of intact primary neurons to this cytotoxic insult induced permeability transition pore (PTP) opening, the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), cytochrome c release, and subsequent death. More importantly, metformin, together with the PTP classical inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA), strongly mitigated the activation of this apoptotic cascade. Furthermore, the general antioxidant N-acetyl-L: -cysteine also prevented etoposide-promoted neuronal death. In addition, metformin was shown to delay CsA-sensitive PTP opening in permeabilized neurons, as triggered by a calcium overload, probably through its <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on the respiratory chain complex I. We conclude that (1) etoposide-induced neuronal death is partly attributable to PTP opening and the disruption of DeltaPsim, in association with the emergence of oxidative stress, and (2) metformin inhibits this PTP opening-driven commitment to death. We thus propose that metformin, beyond its antihyperglycemic role, can also function as a new therapeutic tool for diabetes-associated neurodegenerative disorders...|$|R

One of the potential alternative therapies for renal cell carcinoma may be inhibition of angiogenesis. In this study, we analysed the inhibitory effects of several potential agents on expression of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are the main mediators in angiogenesis of renal cell carcinoma. We used medroxyprogesterone acetate, interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma, minocycline hydrochrolide and genistein, which {{are known to be}} antiangiogeneic. Northern blot analyses revealed that, among the five agents examined, genistein had a strong inhibitory effect on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA.

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Azlin Mustapha. In this study, the effects of zinc oxide (ZnO) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) on the intestinal bacteria, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis were investigated. All three bacterial strains were inoculated into tryptic soy broth (TSB) or Lactobacilli MRS broth media containing different concentrations of ZnO (0, 12, 16, 20 mM) and Ag (0, 1. 8, 2. 7, 4. 6 mM) NPs and 1 % of NP-free solution and incubated at 37 oC for 24 h. The presence and characterization of ZnO and Ag NPs on bacterial cells were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). UV-visible absorbance and the Live/Dead Bacterial Viability assay were performed to assess membrane leakage and viability of bacterial cells before and after treatment with the NPs. For all bacteria, for up to 12 h of incubation, the numbers of treated cells were within 1 log CFU/mL {{less than that of}} the control. Morphological changes of bacterial cells were observed, but many cells remained in normal shapes. Results of UV-visible spectroscopy showed that only a small amount of internal cellular contents were leaked due to the NPs. Also, more live than dead cells were observed after exposure to the NPs. Results indicate that ZnO and Ag NPs have very <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effects on intestinal bacteria. Includes bibliographical references (pages 66 - 74) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} a medium-throughput {{system based on}} deposition of calcium phosphate films in multi-well tissue culture plates {{that can be used}} to study the effect of inorganic additives on the behavior of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in a standardized manner. All tested elements, copper, zinc, strontium, fluoride and carbonate were homogenously deposited into calcium phosphate films in varying concentrations by using a biomimetic approach. The additives affected morphology and composition of calcium phosphate films to different extent, depending on the concentration used. The effect on proliferation and differentiation of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblasts depended on the compound and concentration tested. In general, copper and zinc ions showed an inhibitory effect on osteoblast proliferation, the effect of strontium was concentration dependent, whereas films containing fluoride and carbonate, respectively, augmented osteoblast proliferation. Copper and zinc had no effect or were <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> on osteoblast differentiation, while strontium, fluoride and carbonate ions demonstrated a clear decrease in differentiation in comparison to the control films without additives. Primary osteoclasts cultured on calcium phosphate films containing additives showed a significantly decreased resorptive activity as compared to the control, independent on the element incorporated. No cytotoxic effect of the elements in the concentrations tested was observed. The system presented in this study mimics bone mineral containing trace elements, making it useful for studying fundamental processes of bone formation and turnover. The present results can be used for modifying bone graft substitutes by addition of inorganic additives in order to affect their performance in bone repair and regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Indomethacin given {{continuously}} in {{the drinking}} water (20 micrograms/ml) to BALB/cAn pi mice during the latent period of pristane- induced plasmacytoma development dramatically reduced the plasmacytoma incidence from 34. 9 to 2. 2 %. Additionally, indomethacin given from day 0 to 120 or begun as late as 60 d after a single injection of 1. 0 ml pristane was also highly effective in reducing the development of plasmacytomas. Indomethacin treatment did not prevent {{the formation of a}} peritoneal inflammatory exudate or peritoneal oil granulomatous tissue, although it had a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on the intensity of the cellular inflammation, particularly after extensive treatment of greater than 100 d. Indomethacin treatment reduced the incidence of arthritis by 50 %. A major effect of indomethacin treatment was a reduction in the appearance of microscopic plasmacytomas that appear in the oil granuloma before plasmacytomas can be detected by routine sampling of the peritoneal exudate. Between days 116 and 181, 16 of 20 mice given 0. 5 ml pristane were found to have foci of plasmacytoma cells, while only 2 of 20 indomethacin-treated mice had foci-containing plasmacytoma cells. The number of mice with microscopic foci in the pristane-treated group greatly exceeded the expected incidence of plasmacytomas (22 %) at this dose of pristane. The growth of primary plasmacytomas in transplant that is dependent on the pristane- conditioned peritoneal environment was not inhibited by indomethacin treatment. The role of indomethacin in inhibiting plasmacytoma development was not established; two possibilities are that it inhibits production of mutagenic and tissue destructive oxidants by inflammatory cells, and it inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and intracellular production of oxidant biproducts...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} is {{a significant}} human pathogen capable of replicating in mononuclear phagocytic cells. Exposure to reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates is likely to represent {{an important aspect of}} the life cycle of this organism. The response of M. tuberculosis to these agents may be of significance for its survival in the host. Materials and Methods: Patterns of de novo proteins synthesized in M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv exposed to compounds that generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates were studied by metabolic labeling and twodimensional electrophoresis. Results: Menadione, a redox cycling compound which increases intracellular superoxide levels, caused enhanced synthesis of seven polypeptides, six of which appeared to be heat shock proteins. Chemical release of nitric oxide induced eight polypeptides of which only one could be identified as a heat shock protein. Nitric oxide also exhibited a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> action on general protein synthesis in the concentration range tested. Hydrogen peroxide did not cause differential gene expression and exerted a generalized inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Cumene hydroperoxide caused mostly inhibition but induction of two heat shock proteins was detectable. Conclusions: The presented findings indicate major differences between M. tuberculosis and the paradigms of oxidative stress response in enteric bacteria, and are consistent with the multiple lesions found in oxyR of this organism. The effect of hydrogen peroxide, which in Escherichia coli induces eight polypeptides known to be controlled by the central regulator oxyR, appears to be absent in M. tuberculosis. Superoxide and nitric oxide responses, which in E. coli overlap and are controlled by the same regulatory system soxRS, represent discrete and independent phenomena in M. tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|Butanol is an {{important}} industrial chemical and has gained attention as {{an important}} fuel because of its advantages of being less corrosive and water tolerant {{as compared to the}} ethanol. This study revealed the effects of butyric acid as an additive on growth and Acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) production using batch culture of Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N 1 - 4. Different combinations of glucose and butyric acid were studied to finalize the best productive ratio for ABE and butanol production. The highest ABE and butanol production was obtained when 4 g L - 1 of butyric acid was used in the presence of 30 g L - 1 of glucose. The inhibitory effects of butyric acid on bacterial growth were also investigated using C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N 1 - 4 and <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effects were found at high butyric acid concentration. On the other hand, no linear correlation between butyric acid and butanol production was observed. Production of 17. 76 g L - 1 butanol with a productivity of 0. 15 g L - 1 h - 1 from 4 g L - 1 of butyric acid proved the ability of C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N 1 - 4 to be tolerant to the certain concentration of butyric acid for the enhanced butanol production. Butyric acid was not only contributing as an additive or stimulating agent to the butanol pathway but also was being utilized as a co-substrate. Enhanced butanol production using growing cells of C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N 1 - 4 in the presence of specific concentration of butyric acid (4 g L - 1 butyric acid) as a co-substrate with glucose can be carried out without any remarkable inhibition to bacterial growth...|$|R
40|$|Current {{combined}} surgical and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy {{of primary}} metastatic osteosarcoma (OS) is ineffective, reflected by a 5 -year survival rate of affected patients {{of less than}} 20 %. Studies in experimental OS metastasis models pointed to the CXCR 4 /CXCL 12 homing axis as a novel target for OS metastasis-suppressive treatment. The present study investigated {{for the first time}} the CXCR 4 -blocking principle in a spontaneously metastasizing human 143 B OS cell line-derived orthotopic xenograft mouse model. The highly metastatic 143 B cells, unlike the parental non-metastatic HOS cells, express functional CXCR 4 receptors at the cell surface, as revealed in this study by RT/PCR of gene transcripts, by FACS analysis with the monoclonal anti CXCR 4 antibody 12 G 5 (mAb 12 G 5) and by CXCL 12 time- and dose-dependent stimulation of AKT and ERK phosphorylation. A significantly (p < 0. 05) higher CXCL 12 dose-dependent chemotactic response of 143 B compared to HOS cells in a Boyden chamber trans-well migration assay suggested a crucial role of the CXCL 12 /CXCR 4 homing axis in 143 B cell lung metastasis. Repetitive treatment of mice with 143 B cell-derived intratibial tumors given intravenous bolus injections of mAb 12 G 5 indeed inhibited significantly (p < 0. 01) the number of X-gal-stainable lung micrometastases of lacZ-transduced 143 B cells. Antibody treatment had also a <b>mild</b> <b>inhibitory</b> effect on primary tumor growth associated with remarkably less osteolysis, but it did not affect the number of developing lung macrometastases. In conclusion, these results demonstrate considerable potential of high-affinity CXCR 4 -blocking agents for OS tumor cell homing suppressive treatment in metastasizing OS complementary to current (neo) -adjuvant chemotherapy...|$|R
