40|$|The requirements, design, and {{performance}} of a centrifugal regulator aimed at limiting deployment rates of deployable elements are discussed. The overall mechanism is comprised of four distinct functional parts in a machined housing: (1) the centrifugal brake device, which checks the payout of a deployment cable; (2) the <b>reducing</b> <b>gear,</b> which produces the spin rate necesary for the braking device; (3) the payout device, which allows the unwinding of the cable; and (4) the locking device, which prevents untimely unwinding. The centrifugal regulator is set into operation by a threshold tension of the cable which unlocks the mechanism and allows unwinding. The pulley of the windout device drives the centrifugal brake {{with the help of}} the <b>reducing</b> <b>gear.</b> The centrifugal force pushes aside weights that produce friction of the studs in a cylindrical housing.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{experimental study}} has been conducted to acquire detailed noise spectra and directivity data for a high-fidelity, 6. 3 %-scale, Boeing 777 main landing gear. The measurements were conducted in the NASA Langley Quiet Flow Facility using a 41 -microphone directional array system positioned at a range of polar and azimuthal observer angles {{with respect to the}} model. DAMAS (Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources) array processing as well as straightforward individual microphone processing were employed to compile unique flyover and sideline directivity databases for a range of freestream Mach numbers (0. 11 - 0. 17) covering typical approach conditions. Comprehensive corrections were applied to the test data to account for shear layer ray path and amplitude variations. This allowed proper beamforming at different measurement orientations, as well as directivity presentation in free-field emission coordinates. Four different configurations of the landing gear were tested: a baseline configuration with and without an attached side door, and a noise reduction concept "toboggan" truck fairing with and without side door. DAMAS noise source distributions were determined. Spectral analyses demonstrated that individual microphones could establish model spectra. This finding permitted the determination of unique, spatially-detailed directivity contours of spectral band levels over a hemispherical surface. Spectral scaling for the baseline model confirmed that the acoustic intensity scaled with the expected sixth-power of the Mach number. Finally, comparison of spectra and directivity between the baseline gear and the gear with an attached toboggan indicated that the toboggan fairing may be of some value in <b>reducing</b> <b>gear</b> noise over particular frequency ranges...|$|E

40|$|Industrial gears {{are often}} very expensive; they {{are large and}} {{manufactured}} in batches of small quantities, or even individually. Nevertheless, several industrial gears are prematurely discarded because of superficial damages, even if modern technologies and machine tools can completely repair these kinds of failures. For a long time, in fact, the repair of a gear {{was limited to the}} modification of the addendum modification coefficient (a. k. a. profile shift coefficient), while the modification of the pressure angle was usually impracticable, due to the axis limitations of the conventional gear machinery, where the pressure angle and the normal module are set by the tooling. Thus for each repair requiring that pressure angle variation, a gear tooling with the modified pressure angle should be used. In the past decade, the scenario has changed, thanks to the introduction of the - multi-axis CNC Machine Centers, - gear modules for CAD/CAM software, - evolution of CNC Gear Grinding machines, - development of new cutting tools able to machine parts with surface hardness higher than 60 HRC. The above has enabled the application of new types of modification for the refurbishment of superficially damaged gears. This paper presents a new approach to repair industrial gears by showing a case study where pressure angle modification is also considered, differently from the past repairing procedures that dealt only with the modification of the profile shift coefficient. A computer program has been developed to automatically determine the repair alternatives under two goals: minimize the stock removal or maximize gear tooth strength. It will also be shown that the refurbishment of industrial gears using these approaches can result in a 30 - 40 % savings, compared to the cost of a new part, without <b>reducing</b> <b>gear</b> strength. This paper will also show that the whole repair procedure can be carried out in no more than two weeks, depending on the gear size...|$|E
40|$|Helicopters {{are highly}} {{dependent}} on their transmission systems, which provide the vital links from the engines to the rotor and ancillary systems. Components are highly loaded and must be manufactured to {{a high degree of}} accuracy; the lack of redundancy implies that this is a `series-chain' system. Existing techniques for calculating expected life are based upon historical data from different gearbox and helicopter types, thus limiting the confidence of the results. Design techniques may be conservative in some areas, whilst neglecting to consider different load patterns, usage, maintenance and environmental factors. This work describes the development of probabilistic models that represent damage accumulated by fatigue, wear and corrosion of the key components with an Intermediate gearbox (IGB). The parameters of these models represent geometrical, load and material data at the design stage, and produce an output in terms of failure probability against operating hours. This allows the influential parameters to be identified before building a prototype helicopter gearbox. The results from these models are then used to predict the upper and lower bounds of system reliability. This enables the combination of diverse failure mechanisms to be viewed to determine the relevant significance of each failure mechanisms. The effectiveness of the gearbox monitoring systems has been incorporated in the computer model by considering the probability of detection (POD) of each failure mechanism. The work to develop models found that there is a large body of work available to describe damage accumulation due to fatigue, but far less in regard to wear and corrosion. Fatigue models are very sensitive to load and material variability, particularly tooth root bending fatigue, for which many loads are considered `non-damaging'. Wear models are mostly affected by changes in material hardness, wear coefficient and slip amplitude; changes in load are less influential on the predicted time to failure. The results for galvanic corrosion are dominated by the corrosion rate and time to initiate. In the system reliability model, <b>reducing</b> <b>gear</b> load appears to be the simplest means to increase life; increases in material strength and reduction in material variability are less achievable without significant improvements in manufacture and/or material technology...|$|E
