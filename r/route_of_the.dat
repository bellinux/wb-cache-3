5|$|I-80 {{follows the}} routes {{of two major}} auto trails through the state. In western Utah, I-80 follows the {{historical}} <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Victory Highway from Wendover at the Nevada state line to the junction of US-40 near Park City. Throughout Utah, I-80 is signed as the modern <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lincoln Highwayexcept through Salt Lake City, where the Lincoln Highway is routed along State Route 201 and Parley's Way. The <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lincoln Highway across Utah was generally derived from the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pony Express and the Central Overland Route. However, much of the original <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City is inaccessible. The original <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lincoln Highway proceeded southwest from Tooele towards Ely, Nevada. This area is now used for military bases, such as the Dugway Proving Ground and Tooele Army Depot. The area was {{closed to the public}} when these bases were established. I-80 and US-93 are the modern signing of the Lincoln Highway between those two cities. East of Salt Lake City, I-80 closely parallels the original <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lincoln Highway.|$|E

5|$|State Route 201 {{is one of}} the {{original}} highways through the Salt Lake Valley. Signs along the route claim the path of the highway to be the historical <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> California Trail, Pony Express and Lincoln Highway. While signed as the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> California Trail, modern 2100 South is a less common branch called Hastings Cutoff that became infamous because of the Donner Party. The Lincoln Highway, generally derived from the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pony Express across Utah, was routed on 2100 South. However, no modern highway exactly follows the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pony Express west of Salt Lake City. SR-201 is one of a few auto-tour routes that approximates the Pony Express trail, which actually ran south of the road.|$|E

5|$|The survey crew {{did not use}} the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{railroad}} {{past the}} San Rafael Reef. However, they did use the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railroad across the Wasatch Plateau. The construction crews destroyed two of four tunnels when the bed was widened for the freeway. The two remaining tunnels are visible just south of the freeway and are used by a frontage road.|$|E
