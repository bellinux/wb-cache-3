5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) {{agrees to}} take his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) back to the day her father Pete (Shaun Dingwall) died in 1987. When Rose intervenes and pulls her father {{out of the path}} of a car, time is wounded and dangerous <b>Reapers</b> attack, threatening to erase history. Pete eventually learns that {{to get rid of the}} <b>Reapers,</b> he must throw himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the <b>Reapers,</b> who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the <b>Reapers.</b> The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the <b>Reapers</b> are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the <b>Reapers</b> into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
5|$|Sovereign {{reveals that}} the <b>Reapers</b> remain outside the Milky Way waiting for organic life to develop and {{discover}} the Mass Relays, before harvesting them when they reach their peak. Afterwards, with the bomb about to explode, Shepard hears that Ashley and Kaidan have both been pinned down, and must choose which one to rescue. Shepard also finds Saren, who claims that his allegiance to Sovereign will save organic life forms by demonstrating their usefulness to the <b>Reapers.</b> Liara is then able to pinpoint the Conduit's location back on the Normandy: a Prothean world known as Ilos. There, Shepard learns that the Citadel Station is actually a huge Mass Relay that the <b>Reapers</b> use to invade the galaxy. During the last extinction cycle, a few Protheans survived on Ilos via cryopreservation and then re-entered the Citadel Station via the Conduit, a reverse-engineered miniature Mass Relay disguised aboard the station as a statue. The Protheans sabotaged the Citadel to prevent the <b>Reapers</b> from remotely activating the Citadel Mass Relay. Saren plans to reach the Citadel by using the Conduit to allow Sovereign to activate the Citadel Mass Relay and trigger the Reaper invasion.|$|E

5|$|Shepard {{destroys the}} machine {{powering}} it and prepares {{to destroy the}} Collector base. However, the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and gives the order to sterilize the base instead with a timed radiation pulse {{so that it can}} be used against the <b>Reapers.</b> After deciding the fate of the base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the Normandy, Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man, who is either pleased or furious with Shepard's decision. As Shepard meets in the Normandys cargo bay with the survivors, Joker gives the Commander schematics of a Reaper. Humanity now has the full attention of the <b>Reapers,</b> who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|As Baz, {{the player}} {{searches}} for Reg and Tel. Timmy, a Smartie rescued {{in the first}} mission, functions {{as a guide for}} the player: introducing other Smartie characters, and providing exposition of the scenario. The plot portrays the Smarties as suffering under the reign of the Sea <b>Reapers</b> and their Queen Sappho. Alluding to the film, The Magnificent Seven, Baz gathers the separated Meccaryns, and takes on a quest to solve the Smarties' predicaments. In a climactic cut scene, Sappho sacrifices Timmy to Kabuto, and the young Smartie's grandfather, Borjoyzee, becomes the player's guide. Baz leads an escape from the area, and sets up a base to lead a counterattack. Thereafter Delphi becomes the player's character. Yan, the Samurai Smartie serves as the guide for this story segment, giving instructions on Delphi's abilities. After completing the training missions under Yan, Delphi attacks Sappho's base and the <b>Reapers,</b> eventually confronting the queen in a boss fight. When defeated, Sappho summons Kabuto to destroy the Smarties, but Kabuto eats her instead.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, the Autobot penal {{facility}} on Garrus-9 is {{attacked by the}} Combaticons, who escape with the Monstructor component Transformers, forcing a reluctant Fortress Maximus to dispatch Arcee to track them down. Learning of this, Prime pulls Prowl's detachment away from Earth to help contain the problem, though Hot Rod elects to stay to learn Sunstreaker's fate. Nightbeat also suspects someone has tampered with his memory. Elsewhere, Sixshot, having encountered and felt a kinship with the <b>Reapers</b> before, defects to their side, but is taken out by a returned Starscream (revived by the other Decepticons {{to stand up to}} Megatron), leading to a full-scale battle between the Decepticons and <b>Reapers.</b> The Decepticons win, with aid from Galvatron, who escapes with Sixshot's body as the US military locates the Decepticons' base. Scorponok merges with the human Dante into a new body, but is unable to prevent Hunter, now merged with Sunstreaker's mind in a copy of his body, from escaping. In the Dead Universe Nemesis Prime, Jhiaxus, and Galvatron agree the endgame is about to begin.|$|E
5|$|In Giants: Citizen Kabuto, players take on {{the roles}} of three {{humanoid}} races: gun-toting Meccaryns, magic-wielding Sea <b>Reapers,</b> and the gigantic Kabuto. Each player is assigned direct control of a single character. The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this design to encourage players {{to focus on the}} action and not to be burdened with micromanagement. Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fictional version of the Shibuya {{shopping}} district in Tokyo, Japan. While everyday life goes on in the Realground (RG), the chosen dead are brought to an alternate plane of existence called the Underground (UG). The UG is also the venue for the Reapers' Game. By offering their most treasured possession to enter the Game, the dead gain the chance to contest for the prize: to be brought back to life or to transcend to a higher form of spiritual existence. Most of those who choose to transcend become <b>Reapers,</b> the opponents of players in future Games. Lasting a week, each Game is a contest to judge the worth of humanity. Players set out to accomplish objectives under the rules created by the Composer, who is a god-like entity who maintains Shibuya. Another Reaper, the Conductor, tasks other <b>Reapers</b> to obstruct the players' efforts. Failure to complete a mission will disperse the mind and spirit of the player or Reaper, thus erasing his or her existence.|$|E

5|$|Rukia was {{the first}} {{character}} of the series created by Kubo, her design being the one he decided to use {{for all the other}} Soul <b>Reapers.</b> Reaction to her character is generally positive. Her differences from typical shōnen heroines is praised, as is her interaction with other characters. Additionally, she usually ranks second in Weekly Shōnen Jumps Bleach popularity polls, and is consistently the most popular female character in those polls. Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Rukia's likeness, including a plush doll and several figurines.|$|E
5|$|The tenth {{season of}} the Bleach anime series, {{released}} on DVD as the , is directed by Noriyuki Abe, and produced by TV Tokyo, Dentsu and Studio Pierrot. The 16-episode season is based on Tite Kubo's manga series. The episodes' plot continues to follow Ichigo Kurosaki's and his friends' battle against the Espada, the strongest of former Soul Reaper Captain Sōsuke Aizen's army, to rescue Orihime Inoue. Episodes 204 and 205 are centered on a soccer match developed by the Kasumiōji Soul <b>Reapers</b> who appeared in season 9.|$|E
5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul <b>Reapers.</b> Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E
40|$|Drosophila <b>Reaper</b> can bind {{inhibitor}} of apoptosis proteins (IAP) {{and thereby}} rescue caspases from proteasomal degradation. In insect cells, this {{is sufficient to}} induce apoptosis. <b>Reaper</b> can also induce apoptosis in mammalian cells, in which caspases need to be activated, usually via the mitochondrial pathway. Nevertheless, we find that <b>Reaper</b> efficiently induces apoptosis in mammalian cells {{in the absence of}} mitochondrial permeabilisation and cytochrome c release. Moreover, this capacity was only marginally affected by deletion of <b>Reaper's</b> amino-terminal IAP-binding motif. Independent of this motif, <b>Reaper</b> could globally suppress protein synthesis. Deletion of 20 amino acids from the carboxy-terminus of <b>Reaper</b> fully abrogated its potential to inhibit protein synthesis and to induce apoptosis in the absence of IAP-binding. Our findings indicate that the newly identified capacity of <b>Reaper</b> to suppress protein translation can operate in mammalian cells and may be key to its pro-apoptotic activity...|$|R
50|$|Man-Ape later joins a new Lethal Legion (consisting of the Grim <b>Reaper,</b> Black Talon, Goliath (Erik Josten's latest alias), Nekra, and Ultron-12) and battles Tigra, but {{abandons}} the Grim <b>Reaper</b> alongside Black Talon {{when the}} <b>Reaper's</b> racism became {{too much for}} him to tolerate.|$|R
50|$|Nekra {{falls in}} with the voodoo-master the Black Talon as voodoo tutor, and with the Grim <b>Reaper</b> as her lover. When the Grim <b>Reaper</b> dies in combat, Nekra is able to briefly reanimate him as a zombie, so lifelike that even the Grim <b>Reaper</b> does not realize he is dead. When Nekra's love becomes greater than her hate though, the <b>Reaper</b> dies again. Nekra takes his corpse with her, in hopes of reanimating him again.|$|R
5|$|In a later arc, Hitsugaya leads a {{group of}} Soul <b>Reapers</b> {{assigned}} to defend Karakura Town against the Arrancar that Aizen has enlisted to his cause. He defeats Shawlong Qufang, and Luppi Antenor, and upon learning that Orihime Inoue has followed the Arrancars back to their home world, Hitsugaya returns to Soul Society {{to help in the}} preparation for the war against Aizen. At Karakura Town, he engages the Espada Tier Halibel before she is mortally wounded by Aizen. From there, Hitsugaya engages Aizen, and is tricked into stabs Momo in the chest with Aizen taking advantage of the youth's rage of being tricked to cut his left limbs off. After Aizen's defeat and healed, Hitsugaya resolves to train so that he can more freely use his strongest move as a Soul Reaper, bankai, to protect Hinamori.|$|E

5|$|Shepard then {{recruits}} former squad member Tali'Zorah, Thane Krios, and Samara (later optionally {{replaced by}} Morinth), before {{being sent to}} explore a supposedly disabled Collector ship. There, Shepard learns that the Collectors were originally Protheans that were turned into slaves of the <b>Reapers.</b> With EDI's help, Shepard also finds out how to bypass the Omega-4 Relay before being ambushed by the Collectors. Although Shepard's squad escape, his/her relationship with the Illusive Man is strained due to his prior knowledge of the trap. After optionally earning the loyalty of the squad, Shepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an IFF necessary to safely travel through the Omega-4 Relay. Shepard may also acquire a disabled geth that, if activated, voluntarily joins the squad and is named Legion.|$|E
5|$|The Machination {{performs}} a successful surgery on Hunter, and Ironhide is seemingly {{killed in an}} explosion set up by them. They now begin to manufacture their own army of Sunstreaker bodies. Shockwave and the Dynobots are excavated up by archaeologists in Eureka, Nevada and Skywatch takes over the area. In Oregon, two young humans wonder whether to buy Soundwave, still trapped in cassette player mode. Megatron calls Sixshot to come and speed up Earth's destruction, and the <b>Reapers</b> follow, eager to have Sixshot join their attempt to rid the universe of war-like species. Elsewhere on Earth, Ramjet's grandiose plans for a coup against Megatron fail when the Decepticon leader kills him in one-on-one combat.|$|E

The subsequent battle between Prime and Sixshot exposes the Transformers to the world at large and forces the military to call in a carpet bombing strike. The Autobots escape, but Verity and Jimmy are seemingly killed. Elsewhere, Hot Rod and Wheeljack set out to recover Ironhide's body, but are confronted by the Machination's Headmaster army, only escaping due to Wheeljack's gadgets. Hunter escapes his captors and discovers the decapitated but still living head of Sunstreaker. Sunstreaker reveals his mind is being used as the hub for the Machination's army, and Hunter opts to fight back, becoming a Headmaster himself. The <b>Reapers</b> arrive at Earth, attacking the Decepticon base and forcing Megatron to recall Sixshot, while Nova Prime (now known as Nemesis Prime), concerned at the pace of events, dispatches Galvatron to Earth.|$|E
40|$|Drosophila genes <b>reaper,</b> grim, and head-involution-defective (hid) induce {{apoptosis}} {{in several}} cellular contexts. N-terminal sequences of these proteins are highly conserved and {{are similar to}} N-terminal inactivation domains of voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels. Synthetic <b>Reaper</b> and Grim N terminus peptides induced fast inactivation of Shaker-type K+ channels when applied to the cytoplasmic side of the channel that was qualitatively similar to the inactivation produced by other K+ channel inactivation particles. Mutations that reduce the apoptotic activity of <b>Reaper</b> also reduced the synthetic peptide’s ability to induce channel inactivation, indicating that K+ channel inactivation correlated with apoptotic activity. Coexpression of <b>Reaper</b> RNA or direct injection of full length <b>Reaper</b> protein caused near irreversible block of the K+ channels. These results suggest that <b>Reaper</b> and Grim may participate in initiating apoptosis by stably blocking K+ channels...|$|R
50|$|An {{attempt to}} recruit Siena Blaze for the MLF {{resulted}} in Siena's powers somehow transporting <b>Reaper</b> and Siena to the Ultraverse.There {{he joined the}} Exiles along with other Marvel Universe refugees Juggernaut and Siena Blaze. <b>Reaper</b> bargains with the alien race known as the Tradesmen for a new upgraded version of his scythe, but the Tradesman was murdered during the deal. The Tradesmen returned to demand a life {{in exchange for the}} Tradesman they lost and <b>Reaper</b> turned his scythe on Juggernaut, sending him back to the Marvel Universe. The Tradesmen accepted and left, but <b>Reaper's</b> teammates were less than happy with <b>Reaper's</b> actions. <b>Reaper</b> started to like life in the Ultraverse and slowly became a reluctant hero. He becomes intimate with the athletic 'Velvet Fist'. This new grouping disbands later.|$|R
50|$|Regardless, Captain America {{appeared}} at the <b>Reaper's</b> next rally, to publicly challenge the ideas he was putting forth. The <b>Reaper</b> exhorted the frenzied crowd to attack Captain America, and {{a large portion of}} it moved to do so. In the scuffle, Captain America was knocked unconscious by the <b>Reaper,</b> who then personally led the crowd to attack New York City Hall. While this was happening, Bucky had acquired documentation that definitively proved the <b>Reaper</b> was an agent provocateur working for the Nazis, and not an American citizen. Bucky and a revived Captain America pursued the <b>Reaper</b> into the New York City Subway, where he was disarmed by Captain America.
