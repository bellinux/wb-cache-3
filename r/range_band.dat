The center ring covers the 6 to 18-MHz <b>range</b> (<b>band</b> B) and the inner ring covers the 18 to 30-MHz <b>range</b> (<b>band</b> C). Band A contains 48 sleeve monopole elements spaced 78.4 feet apart (7.5 degrees). Band B contains 96 sleeve monopole elements spaced 37.5 feet (11.43 m) apart (3.75 degrees). Band C contains 48 antenna elements mounted on wooden structures placed {{in a circle around}} the central building. Bands A and B elements are vertically polarized. Band C elements consist of two horizontally polarized dipole antenna subelements electrically tied together, and positioned one above the other." ...|$|E

As a result, we can tune the bandgap which varies from 1. 73 eV to 1. 84 eV.

40|$|Anatase and rutile Ti-L- 2,L- 3 edge spectra were {{measured}} in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) using a {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM) coupled to a CEOS Cs-probe corrector, an omega-type monochromator and an in-column omega-type energy filter fully corrected for 2 nd order aberrations. Thanks to the high energy resolution, high electron probe current and high stability achieved under this instrumental configuration, new fine structures, never reported before, were resolved at the L 3 band of both rutile and anatase. The data suggest that new peaks also exist in the L- 2 e(g) band. The experimental spectra are compared with multichannel multiple scattering (MMS) calculations. Good agreement is found for number, energy position and intensity of the newly resolved spectral features. Up to now, the L 3 eg band splitting could not be well described by theory not even through the crystal field multiplet approach. We show that the L 3 eg band splitting is due to long <b>range</b> <b>band</b> structure effects, contrary to the usual interpretations in terms of local ligand field or near-neighbour hybridization effects.
