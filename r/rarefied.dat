5|$|Plasma may be {{the most}} {{abundant}} form of ordinary matter in the universe, although this hypothesis is currently tentative based on the existence and unknown properties of dark matter. Plasma is mostly associated with stars, extending to the <b>rarefied</b> intracluster medium and possibly the intergalactic regions.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is {{contained}} within the Local Bubble, a space of <b>rarefied</b> hot gas, possibly produced by the supernova remnant Geminga. The distance between the local arm and the next arm out, the Perseus Arm, is about 6,500 light-years. The Sun, and thus the Solar System, is found in what scientists call the galactic habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} elements {{change into}} one another by a process of condensation and rarefaction. Fire first becomes solidified into air; then air into water; and lastly, water into earth. The process of dissolution {{takes place in the}} reverse order: earth being <b>rarefied</b> into water, water into air and air into fire.|$|E
5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of <b>rarefied</b> matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 million miles). The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances, and the size of the universe is now known to be inconceivably large and possibly infinite.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, Americans like William Billings were {{establishing}} a bold, new style of vocal performance, markedly distinct from European traditions. John Cole, an important publisher and tune collector in Baltimore, known for pushing a <b>rarefied</b> European outlook on American music, responded with the tunebook Beauties of Psalmody, which denigrated the new techniques, especially fuguing. Cole continued publishing tunebooks up to 1842, and soon began operating his own singing school. Besides Cole, Baltimore {{was home to}} other major music publishers as well. These included Wheeler Gillet, who focused on dignified, European-style music like Cole did, and Samuel Dyer, who collected more distinctly American-styled songs. The tunebooks published in Baltimore included instructional notes, using {{a broad array of}} music education techniques then common. Ruel Shaw, for example, used a system derived from the work of Heinrich Pestalozzi, interpreted by the American Lowell Mason. Though the Pestalozzian system was widely used in Baltimore, other techniques were tried, such as that developed by local singing master James M. Deems, based on the Italian solfeggi system.|$|E
25|$|For <b>rarefied</b> non-ideal gases, {{approaches}} such as {{the cluster}} expansion use perturbation theory to include the effect of weak interactions, leading to a virial expansion.|$|E
25|$|In Playing Dress Up (Goss Michael Foundation, Dallas 2007), McCartney {{chronicled the}} <b>rarefied</b> and at times, both {{monotonous}} and madcap, world of high fashion, {{both on the}} catwalk and backstage with an unreserved collection of images.|$|E
25|$|In {{the other}} limit, for {{extremely}} <b>rarefied</b> gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not {{small compared to}} the mean free paths. This {{is known as the}} Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the Knudsen number.|$|E
25|$|In 1922 Lorentz first {{examined}} Martin Knudsen's {{investigation on}} <b>rarefied</b> gases and {{in connection with}} that he discussed Le Sage's particle model, followed by a summary of his own electromagnetic Le Sage model - but he repeated his conclusion from 1900: Without absorption no gravitational effect.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{pornography}} {{produced in}} the United States {{is in the form}} of movies and the branch acutely competes with the internet. The market is very diverse and ranges from the mainstream heterosexual content to the <b>rarefied</b> S/M, BDSM, interracial sex, ethnic, etc. through enduringly popular gay porn.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1920s to early 1930s {{pathology}} was deemed a medical specialty. Combined with {{developments in the}} understanding of general physiology, {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century, the study of pathology had begun to split into a number of <b>rarefied</b> fields and resulting in the development of large number of modern specialties within pathology and related disciplines of diagnostic medicine.|$|E
25|$|Current Martian surface {{temperatures}} vary from lows of about −87°C (−125°F) during polar winter to highs {{of up to}} −5°C (23°F) in summer. The wide range {{is due to the}} <b>rarefied</b> atmosphere, which cannot store much solar heat, and the low thermal inertia of the soil. Early in its history, a denser atmosphere may have permitted the formation of an ocean on Mars.|$|E
25|$|Neon {{lighting}} {{is closely related}} to fluorescent lighting, which developed about 25 years after neon tube lighting. In fluorescent lights, the light emitted by <b>rarefied</b> gases within a tube is used exclusively to excite fluorescent materials that coat the tube, which then shine with their own colors that become the tube's visible, usually white, glow. Fluorescent coatings and glasses are also an option for neon tube lighting, but are usually selected to obtain bright colors.|$|E
25|$|Stylistically, the {{lighting}} in the San Zaccaria piece {{has become so}} soft and diffuse that it makes that in the San Giobbe appear almost raking in contrast. Giovanni's use of the oil medium had matured, and the holy figures seem to be swathed in a still, <b>rarefied</b> air. The San Zaccaria is considered perhaps the most beautiful and imposing of all Giovanni's altarpieces, and is dated 1505, the year following that of Giorgione's Madonna of Castelfranco.|$|E
25|$|For many {{systems of}} {{physical}} and chemical kinetics, detailed balance provides sufficient conditions for the strict increase of entropy in isolated systems. For example, the famous Boltzmann H-theorem states that, according to the Boltzmann equation, the principle of detailed balance implies positivity of entropy production. The Boltzmann formula (1872) for entropy production in <b>rarefied</b> gas kinetics with detailed balance served as a prototype of many similar formulas for dissipation in mass action kinetics and generalized mass action kinetics with detailed balance.|$|E
25|$|Lunel was keen {{to focus}} on all aspects of Stendhal's novel: historical, political, sentimental, but the final text {{concentrates}} on the latter, for which Sauguet's music effected a progressive ascension towards a more pure and <b>rarefied</b> love. The libretto starts when Fabrice, refusing military heroics, has made a clandestine return {{to his mother and}} aunt Gina near the Swiss-Italian frontier, thus first seeing Clélia. All chapters of Book I: the arrival of Napoleon and his followers in Lombardy, Fabrice's military exploits and Waterloo; are left out.|$|E
25|$|The {{makers of}} EastEnders decided that Colin's partner {{needed to be}} in stark {{contrast}} {{in order to prevent}} Colin from becoming too <b>rarefied</b> (up until this point middle-classed characters had been relatively unsuccessful and had failed to fully integrate into EastEnders predominantly working-class community). Barry was scripted to be much more down-to-earth in comparison: working-class instead of middle-classed; openly gay instead of 'in the closet'; loud and brash instead of shy and retiring, and in addition the age difference between the two was substantial — Colin being roughly fifteen years Barry's senior.|$|E
25|$|Colin was a middle-classed, well-meaning, {{slightly}} uptight yuppie, so {{the makers}} of EastEnders decided that his partner needed to be in stark contrast {{in order to prevent}} him from becoming too <b>rarefied</b> (up until this point middle-classed characters had been relatively unsuccessful and had failed to fully integrate into EastEnders predominantly working-class community). Barry was scripted to be much more down-to-earth in comparison: working-class instead of middle-class; openly gay instead of 'in the closet'; loud and brash instead of shy and retiring and in addition the age difference between the two was substantial — Colin being roughly fifteen years Barry's senior. The actor Gary Hailes was chosen to play the role. Hailes was known to EastEnders co-creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, as he had previously attended auditions in 1984 for the role of Mark Fowler, but had been unsuccessful - the role went to David Scarboro instead.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's final {{large-scale}} orchestral {{works were}} his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: [...] "If {{ever there was}} music from another planet, this is surely it. Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air <b>rarefied</b> and bracing." [...] Nielsen's last musical composition, the organ work Commotio, was premiered posthumously in 1931.|$|E
500|$|Surrounding and {{stretching}} between galaxies, {{there is a}} <b>rarefied</b> plasma that is organized in a galactic filamentary structure. This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5–200 times the average density of the Universe. It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 105K to 107K, which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons {{to escape from the}} hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 105 K is often called [...] "warm" [...] in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm–hot, <b>rarefied</b> state. When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 108K and above in the so-called intracluster medium.|$|E
500|$|Sappho {{was said}} to have three brothers: Erigyius, Larichus, and Charaxus. According to Athenaeus, Sappho often praised Larichus for pouring wine in the town hall of Mytilene, an office held by boys of the best families. This {{indication}} that Sappho was born into an aristocratic family is consistent with the sometimes <b>rarefied</b> environments that her verses record. [...] One ancient tradition tells of a relation between Charaxus and the Egyptian courtesan Rhodopis. Herodotus, the oldest source of the story, reports that Charaxus ransomed Rhodopis for a large sum and that Sappho wrote a poem rebuking him for this.|$|E
500|$|On [...] "Blame Game", West {{attempts}} {{to call his}} past lover, but he receives a call back instead and he hears a conversation between her and Chris Rock, who begins an extended monologue approximately five minutes into the song. [...] Chris Rock performs a vulgar, profanity-ridden sketch in which he compliments his lover's dress sense and sexual technique, and asks her who taught her these skills. Each time he asks, the answer is the same: [...] "Yeezy taught me.". Andy Gill of The Independent commented that a similar [...] "alliance of aristocratic piano and cello with less <b>rarefied</b> elements underpins 'Blame Game', a brutal rumination on West's sexual appetite".|$|E
500|$|The song, if not {{the title}} alone, {{was a source of}} {{irritation}} for those critics who deemed Living in the Material World overly preachy and didactic. In a full-page album review in Melody Maker, Michael Watts summarised his impression of Harrison's spiritual message: [...] "One gets this feeling of George, somewhat remote and <b>rarefied,</b> indicting the world for being what it is, although if anybody could change the world it would be an old Beatle." [...] While noting the song as an autobiographical statement on the singer's [...] "struggle to retain personal dignity and peace of mind", Watts wrote: [...] "He's dealing in lofty sentiments and abstractions; not everyone will want to drink of the cup." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his years}} as a senator, Biden amassed a {{reputation}} for loquaciousness, with his questions and remarks during Senate hearings being especially known for being long-winded. [...] He has been a strong speaker and debater and a frequent and effective guest on the Sunday morning talk shows. [...] In public appearances, he is known to deviate from prepared remarks at will. [...] According to political analyst Mark Halperin, he has shown [...] "a persistent tendency to say silly, offensive, and off-putting things"; The New York Times writes that Biden's [...] "weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything". [...] Nor is Biden known for modesty; journalist James Traub has written that [...] "Biden's vanity and his regard for his own gifts seem considerable even by the <b>rarefied</b> standards of the U.S. Senate." ...|$|E
500|$|Hana (花, flower): In the Kadensho (Instructions on the Posture of the Flower), Zeami {{describes}} hana saying [...] "after you {{master the}} secrets of all things and exhaust the possibilities of every device, the hana that never vanishes still remains." [...] The true Noh performer seeks to cultivate a <b>rarefied</b> relationship with his audience {{similar to the way}} that one cultivates flowers. [...] What is notable about hana is that, like a flower, it is meant to be appreciated by any audience, no matter how lofty or how coarse his upbringing. [...] Hana comes in two forms. [...] Individual hana is the beauty of the flower of youth, which passes with time, while [...] "true hana" [...] is the flower of creating and sharing perfect beauty through performance.|$|E
500|$|... 1000 Forms of Fear debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 52,000 copies. By doing so, it became the lowest sales figure for a number-one album on the chart in nearly two years. The Guardians Clem Bastow commented on the album's success in the United States: [...] "Australian artists {{typically}} fare better in the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, but even then, Sia finds herself in <b>rarefied</b> company." [...] On behalf of The Sydney Morning Herald, George Palathingal opined that the album's debuting atop the Billboard 200 is the result of [...] "a stroke of (anti-)marketing genius" [...] and [...] "a case of quality pop music standing proud." [...] 1000 Forms of Fear had sold 374,000 copies in the United States as of December 2015.|$|E
500|$|Fauré {{scholars}} are {{generally agreed that}} the last nocturne – which was the last work he wrote for the piano – is among the greatest of the set. Nectoux writes that along with the sixth, it is [...] "incontestably the most moving and inspired of the series." [...] Bricard calls it [...] "the most inspired and beautiful in the series." [...] For Pinkas, the work [...] "achieves a perfect equilibrium between late-style simplicity and full-textured passionate expression." [...] The work opens in a [...] "pure, almost <b>rarefied</b> atmosphere" [...] (Nectoux), with a [...] "tone of noble, gentle supplication... imposing gravity and... rich expressive four part writing." [...] This is followed by an allegro, [...] "a true middle section in a virtuoso manner, ending in a bang" [...] (Pinkas). The repeat of the opening section completes the work.|$|E
500|$|Pérez {{arrived in}} Kansas City amid {{widespread}} {{anger over the}} departure of fan-favorite Dye. Facing off against Dye {{in one of his}} first games as a Royal, Pérez took the low-key approach: [...] "I'm just going to play my game." [...] Pérez finished out the 2001 season in Kansas City, batting [...]241 over 49 games. Pérez started at shortstop for the 2002 season but his batting average sank to [...]236, leading sportswriters to question whether the <b>rarefied</b> air at Coors Field had inflated Pérez's numbers. Pérez also may have sealed his fate by refusing to enter a late-season game at the request of manager Tony Peña. [...] At {{the end of the year}} the Royals were looking to move Pérez and his $4.1 million salary; he was eventually claimed off waivers by the San Francisco Giants and signed a two-year, $4.25 million contract.|$|E
500|$|Writings on more {{permanent}} media {{have also been}} lost in several ways. Stones with inscriptions were frequently re-used as building materials, and ceramic ostraca require a dry environment to ensure {{the preservation of the}} ink on their surfaces. Whereas papyrus rolls and packets were usually stored in boxes for safekeeping, ostraca were routinely discarded in waste pits; one such pit was discovered by chance at the Ramesside-era village of Deir el-Medina, and has yielded the majority of known private letters on ostraca. Documents found at this site include letters, hymns, fictional narratives, recipes, business receipts, and wills and testaments. Penelope Wilson describes this archaeological find as the equivalent of sifting through a modern landfill or waste container. She notes that the inhabitants of Deir el-Medina were incredibly literate by ancient Egyptian standards, and cautions that such finds only come [...] "...in <b>rarefied</b> circumstances and in particular conditions." ...|$|E
500|$|Burnet's <b>rarefied</b> {{education}} {{brought him}} a lifelong interest in scientific and mathematical pursuits. [...] He was proposed {{for membership in the}} Royal Society by Isaac Newton in 1705, and was enrolled as a fellow in February 1705/6. [...] He was acquainted with the mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, and was a regular correspondent on a wide array of scientific subjects with Philadelphia merchant and politician James Logan. [...] He reported to the Royal Society observations of the Grindelwald Glacier in Switzerland, and on an unusual instance of Hungarian conjoined twins he saw while resident in The Hague in 1708. [...] Observations he made of eclipses of the moons of Jupiter while he was governor of New York were used to more precisely determine New York City's longitude. [...] During his tenure in New York he was relatively starved for intellectual discourse; he briefly met a young Benjamin Franklin and encouraged him in his intellectual pursuits.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{lost its}} {{magnetosphere}} 4 billion years ago, possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes, so {{the solar wind}} interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere, lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer. Both Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Express have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing off into space behind Mars, and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the MAVEN orbiter. Compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is quite <b>rarefied.</b> Atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges {{from a low of}} [...] on Olympus Mons to over [...] in Hellas Planitia, with a mean pressure at the surface level of [...] The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to that found [...] above Earth's surface. The resulting mean surface pressure is only 0.6% of that of Earth (101.3 kPa). The scale height of the atmosphere is about , which is higher than Earth's, , because the surface gravity of Mars is only about 38% of Earth's, an effect offset by both the lower temperature and 50% higher average molecular weight of the atmosphere of Mars.|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{developed}} the concept {{for the show}} after reading The Killer Angels, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Michael Shaara chronicling the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. He wanted to follow people who had fought on the losing side of a war and their experiences afterwards as pioneers and immigrants {{on the outskirts of}} civilization, much like the post-American Civil War era of Reconstruction and the American Old West culture. He intended the show to be [...] "a Stagecoach kind of drama {{with a lot of people}} trying to figure out their lives in a bleak pioneer environment". Whedon wanted to develop a show about the tactile nature of life, a show where existence was more physical and more difficult. After reading The Killer Angels, Whedon read a book about Jewish partisan fighters in World War II that also influenced him. Whedon wanted to create something for television that was more character-driven and gritty than most modern science fiction. Television science fiction, he felt, had become too pristine and <b>rarefied.</b>|$|E
500|$|Complex {{named it}} the second best {{song of the}} first half of 2014. Writer Justin Charity commented saying, [...] "While hardly their strongest verses of even the past couple years, Ross, Kanye, and Sean all come correct with the quotables here, from Sean's opening mantra to Kanye's {{aggressive}} confessional to post-sex grilled cheese. The song's weary gospel build-up makes way for the minimal, <b>rarefied</b> ecstasy of that spaceship hangover melody. An arena confession I need to be shouting at the livest of live shows by year's end: [...] "All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch!" [...] Verdict: We need another Yeezus." [...] MySpace also named the song one of the 50 best songs of the same time period. A writer for them said, [...] "'Sanctified' is a behemoth of a track, replete with an original vocal line from Bettye LaVette that plays like a gospel sample and an impeccable verse from 'Ye that makes up for Ross rapping, [...] "Fellatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you, the best." [...] It's simply the best gospel song masquerading as a rap jam this year." ...|$|E
