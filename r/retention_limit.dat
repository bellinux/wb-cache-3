The results are given without specifying precisely how the excess of loss reinsur-ance premium is calculated.

40|$|The {{calculation}} of stop-loss premiums {{for a life}} portfolio is a problem encountered in reinsurance. This problem is examined using an individual risk model, in which a portfolio consists of a fixed number of contracts. The normal approximation of the stop-loss premium gives acceptable results except in {{cases in which the}} <b>retention</b> <b>limit</b> has a large value. In those cases, the normal approximation takes into account only the tail of the distribution of the total claim size, leading to an underestimation of the corresponding stop-loss premium. New upper bounds for these stop-loss premiums are derived using risk ordering principles in an individual risk model. The analysis shows that the net stop-loss ordering is preserved under mixing and convolution. A number of computations are required for computing the upper bounds, and direct calculation requires operations equal to the number of contracts times the <b>retention</b> <b>limit.</b> Numerical results of a hypothetical portfolio are presentedstatus: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Most {{insurance}} companies deal with reinsurance. One {{of the problems}} they have to solve is: What reinsurance treaty is optimal for their company? Optimal reinsurance for large portfolios has, during the past decades, been given much more attention in the academic world than individual claims have. In this thesis we will investigate the optimal reinsurance contract for the individual claims case. The thesis will start by introducing some basic concepts in reinsurance. There will be a brief explanation of reinsurance mathematics. We will establish mathematical formulations of {{the different types of}} reinsurance contracts and the optimality criteria. Then we will see some of the existing literature on the topic and show some own results. This is going to point us toward the optimal reinsurance contract: the non-proportional a x b contract with <b>retention</b> <b>limits</b> a and b where b is infinite. We will introduce the reader to the Panjer recursion. The recursion will be used as a numerical tool to simulate the a x b contract.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with {{an examination of the}} available domestic retention capacity and the demand for international reinsurance in the Arab World. The study has been broken down into the following basic components: 1. The development of the insurance markets of the Arab countries is traced against the background of the economic, political, demographic and other changes, including the growth of demand for insurance, that have occurred in the region over the last few decades. 2. Insurance legislation and supervision, which varies greatly throughout the Arab region, is examined in order to identify the effect it may have on the development of national markets. 3. The market capacity required for the insurance of large risks and natural hazards is analysed, revealing that normal reinsurance arrangements and local retention capacity can absorb only a very small proportion of those risks; and that Arab insurers have a growing need for catastrophe excess of loss reinsurances. 4. The performance of Arab reinsurance companies and pools as a means of improving retention capacity is examined based on data collected from two reinsurance companies and five pools, to demonstrate how retention capacity can be improved. 5. Finally, a theoretical and empirical investigation is conducted into the determination of <b>retention</b> <b>limits.</b> Factors relevant to decisions on fixing <b>retention</b> <b>limits</b> are examined, and the relationship of company objectives to <b>retention</b> <b>limits</b> and the effect of different forms of reinsurance on the size of retained premium income are discussed. The study ends with an analysis of the fire, marine cargo and motor reinsurance programmes of two Arab insurance companies to see whether their retention policies are in line with accepted reinsurance practice or whether they could retain more of their business for their own account. The Arab insurance industry is still in its infancy, with all the attendant inadequacies such a state implies which brings with it two major problems - the inability of retention capacity of local insurers to respond sufficiently rapidly to changes in the economies of Arab countries and the heavy reliance on foreign reinsurance, which in turn leads to low retained premium income. It is hoped that this thesis will have provided an insight into ways in which Arab insurers and reinsurers could themselves meet more of their countries' insurance needs...|$|R

Three types of traps are found: two intrinsic traps (detrapping energy of 0. 87 eV and 1. 00 eV) and one extrinsic trap created by ion irradiation (detrapping energy of 1. 50 eV).

40|$|Natural {{polymers}} such as polysaccharides {{have been}} used as self-assembled matrices for drug delivery. Modified high amylose starch tablets swell to a limit when submerged in water, yielding a hydrogel with quasi-reversible viscoelastic properties. Such tablets display slow-release properties with a near zero-order drug delivery kinetics. Mechanical properties, electron microscopy imaging and swelling behavior have been investigated. Results from the foregoing investigations and from 13 C CP/MAS NMR studies, which showed a clear transition from amorphous to crystalline organization upon wetting, were used to propose a model. The latter proposes that the viscoelastic hydrogel is formed due to the propensity of amylopectin and amylose, the two components of starch, to organize into double helices. The so formed pseudo-crosslinks, as water penetrates the dry tablet, explain the shape <b>retention</b> (<b>limited</b> swelling). This model was tested using Curdlan, a beta- 1, 3 -glucan that is known to crystallize as triple helices. Studies on Curdlan tablets demonstrated limited swelling and shape retention, but unsuitable mechanical properties. This supported the model and added a feature that takes into account the heterogeneous nature of starch as an important factor in the obtention of a good viscoelastic hydrogel. Because hydrophobic drugs are difficult to release by diffusion through matrices of hydrophilic polysaccharides, synthesis of compatibilizers was undertaken. Using a natural hydrophobic polyester: poly([R]- 3 -hydroxybutyric acid), PHB, possessing a high enthalpy of crystallization, a self-assembly amphiphilic system was created.
