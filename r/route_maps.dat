5|$|Two years later, four {{units of}} vacuum {{fluorescent}} displays (VFD) were {{mounted on the}} ceiling. Eight units of dynamic <b>route</b> <b>maps</b> were mounted above every door in each car in trainset 053/054 for a two-month trial. This new SMRT Active Route Map Information System (STARiS) was then progressively introduced to all C151 trainsets, and subsequently to C651 and C751B trains for a cost of S$12 million—S$20,000 per car.

25|$|As one of {{his many}} {{responsibilities}} as clerk to the postmaster general, Bradley began to compile information for a complete postal service map, including routes, stations, and distances between each. Handicapped by his lack of training in the fields of topography and cartography, Bradley utilized cartographic knowledge imparted in earlier maps by Robert Erskine and Thomas Hutchins.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{our work}} on sketch understanding, focusing {{here on the}} analysis of a sketched <b>route</b> <b>map.</b> A <b>route</b> <b>map</b> is drawn to help someone navigate along a path {{for the purpose of}} reaching a goal. A hand-sketched <b>route</b> <b>map</b> does not generally contain complete map information and is not necessarily drawn to scale, but yet it contains the correct qualitative information for route navigation. Here we propose a methodology for extracting a qualitative model of a sketched <b>route</b> <b>map,</b> based on human navigation strategies, using spatial relationships. Linguistic descriptions are generated from the sketch, both in the form of detailed descriptions at discrete path steps and also as a high-level route description. To describe the path linguistically, one must first be able to understand the path in a qualitative sense. We assert that the translation of a sketch into linguistic descriptions illustrates that the essential qualitative path knowledge has been extracted. The methodology is demonstrated using example sketches drawn on a handheld PDA. Index Terms—sketch, <b>route</b> <b>map,</b> spatial relations, force histograms, linguistic description...|$|R

2500|$|Routes {{were not}} {{distinguished}} {{from each other}} on subway maps until 1958. The first <b>route</b> <b>maps</b> were aesthetically pleasing, but had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has since become recognized in design circles as a modern classic. However, the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements, specifically {{in the sense that}} elements only ran horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. By contrast, the Hertz map, which replaced the Vignelli design in 1979, contained elements that were more curved and [...] "organic looking" [...] while clarifying the nuances and complexities of the three former systems. The Hertz design, first created by Michael Hertz, remains in use with some stylistic differences and updates reflecting subway expansions since then.|$|E
2500|$|Abraham Bradley Jr. (February 22, 1767 [...] May 7, 1838) was an American lawyer, judge, and {{cartographer}} who was {{assistant postmaster}} general for 30 years during the earliest {{history of the}} United States Post Office Department. Bradley was responsible for moving the federal government's post office from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the new capital at Washington, D.C., hosting the national post office {{in his own home}} for a period. The continuity brought by Bradley's long employment during the tenure of five different United States postmasters general helped establish the budding postal service as a reliable provider; Bradley drew detailed and innovative postal <b>route</b> <b>maps</b> which contributed significantly to the office's efficiency. Bradley's original work of 1796 {{was one of the first}} comprehensive maps of the United States as it existed, which [...] "represented the first clear cartographic break in European-dominated map making and introduced a new, more distinctly American style of cartography to the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|Designed by British {{architect}} Nicholas Grimshaw and {{his firm}} Grimshaw Architects, the shelters are constructed of stainless steel, with glass {{on three sides}} including the roof and rear. The fourth side consists of an advertising panel. On the non-advertising panel is an insert listing {{the streets of the}} intersection where the stop is located on the outer side, and <b>route</b> <b>maps</b> and information also featured on the Guide-A-Ride on its inner face. The shelters come in five sizes (Regular: Narrow: Short: Little: and Double: [...] ). All the modern shelters feature benches (many of the old ones did not), and were praised for environmentally friendly construction during their introduction. Several of these shelters, primarily in Manhattan, have since been equipped with LED displays, LCD video advertisement panels, and ad panels with NFC communication technology. Following the acquisition of Cemusa by French advertising firm JCDecaux in 2015, bus shelters are now maintained by JCDecaux.|$|E

60|$|Much {{was due to}} {{the efforts}} of Lord Fitzroy Somerset, Wellington's {{military}} secretary who, by entering into communication with the commanders of brigades and regiments, most of whom were quite young men--for the greater part of the army was but of recent creation--was enabled not only to learn something of the state of discipline in each regiment, but greatly to encourage and stimulate the efforts of its officers; who felt that the doings of their regiment were observed at headquarters, that merit would be recognized without favouritism, and that any failure in the discipline or morale of those under their orders would be noted against them. Twice, during the two months, Terence had been sent for to headquarters, in order that he might give Lord Fitzroy minute information concerning the various roads and localities, point out natural obstacles where an obstinate defence might be made by an enemy, or which could be turned to advantage by an advancing army. The <b>route</b> <b>maps</b> that he had sent were frequently turned to, and fully explained.|$|E
60|$|Other living races {{have the}} gift of drawing, but none {{more so than the}} Eskimo. I will {{therefore}} speak of these and not of the Australian and Tasmanian pictures, nor of the still ruder performances of the old inhabitants of Guiana, nor of those of some North American tribes, as the Iroquois. The Eskimos are geographers by instinct, and appear to see vast tracts of country mapped out in their heads. From the multitude of illustrations of their map-drawing powers, I may mention one of those included in the journals of Captain Hall, at p. 224, which were published in 1879 by the United States Government, under the editorship of Professor J. E. Nourse. It is the facsimile of a chart drawn by an Eskimo who was a thorough barbarian in the accepted sense of the word; that is to say, he spoke no language besides his own uncouth tongue, he was wholly uneducated according to our modern ideas, and he lived in what we should call a savage fashion. This man drew from memory a chart of the region over which he had {{at one time or another}} gone in his canoe. It extended from Pond's Bay, in lat. 73°, to Fort Churchill, in lat. 58°44', over a distance in a straight line of more than 960 nautical, or 1100 English miles, the coast being so indented by arms of the sea that its length is six times as great. On comparing this rough Eskimo outline with the Admiralty chart of 1870, their accordance is remarkable. I have seen many MS. <b>route</b> <b>maps</b> made by travellers a few years since, when the scientific exploration of the world was much less advanced than it is now, and I can confidently say that I have never known of any traveller, white or brown, civilised or uncivilised, in Africa, Asia, or Australia, who, being unprovided with surveying instruments, and trusting to his memory alone, has produced a chart comparable in extent and accuracy to that of this barbarous Eskimo. The aptitude of the Eskimos to draw, is abundantly shown by the numerous illustrations in Rink's work, all of which were made by self-taught men, and are thoroughly realistic.|$|E
