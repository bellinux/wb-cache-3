40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the influence of the resolution with which interfaces of fractal geometry are represented, on the contact area and consequently on the contact interfacial stresses. The study is based on a numerical approach. The paper focuses on the differences between the cases of elastic and inelastic materials having as primary parameter the resolution of the interface. Design/methodology/approach - A multi-resolution parametric analysis is performed for fractal interfaces dividing a plane structure into two parts. On these interfaces, unilateral contact conditions are assumed to hold. The computer-generated surfaces adopted here are self-affine curves, characterized by a precise value of the <b>resolution</b> <b>delta</b> of the fractal set. Different contact simulations are studied by applying a horizontal displacements on the upper part of the structure. For every value of s, a solution is taken in terms of normal forces and displacements at the interface. The procedure is repeated for different values of the <b>resolution</b> <b>delta.</b> At each scale, a classical Euclidean problem is solved by using finite element models. In the limit of the finest resolution, fractal behaviour is achieved. Findings - The paper leads to a number of interesting conclusions. In the case of linear elastic analysis, the contact area and, consequently, the contact interfacial stresses depend strongly on the resolution of the fractal interface. Contrary, in the case of inelastic analysis, this dependence is verified only for the lower resolution values. As the resolution becomes higher, the contact area tends to become independent from the resolution. Originality/value - The originality of the paper lies on the results and the corresponding conclusions obtained for the case of inelastic material behaviour, while the results for the case of elastic analysis verify the findings of other researchers...|$|E

40|$|We {{summarize}} {{the results of}} a number of hard X-ray measurements on cerium-doped LaCl 3 and LaBr 3 scintillators. The experiment was carried out at the HASYLAB synchrotron radiation facility using highly monochromatic pencil beams across the energy range 10. 5 - 100 keV. Additional full-area measurements were carried out using radioactive sources. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The measured FWHM energy <b>resolutions</b> (<b>Delta</b> E/E) under pencil beam illumination were 29 % (LaBr 3) and 32. 4 % (LaCl 3) at 10. 5 keV falling to 7. 8 % (LaBr 3) and 9. 2 % (LaCl 3) at 100 keV. At 662 keV, the energy resolutions were 3. 9 % and 3. 0 % FWHM. The proportionality of the energy responses shows marked deviations from linearity above and below the La edge at 39. 8 keV. At the edge the energy response changes by 3 %. Fine structure across the edge was also investigated using single photon count rate measurements taken in 1 eV steps across the edge. The data show considerable near-edge structure when compared to curves generated from standard atomic data tables. However, very little evidence was found for extended X-ray fine structure suggesting that the bulk of the structure arises from the local coordination environment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
