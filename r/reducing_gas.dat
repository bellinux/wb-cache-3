40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the consequences of}} operating a semiconducting oxide gas sensor with appreciable oxygen ion mobility within a temperature range where equilibration of the bulk oxygen content and surface reactions with <b>reducing</b> <b>gases</b> can proceed simultaneously. The investigations focus on the behaviour of {{an example of a}} perovskite material (LaFe 0. 95 W 0. 05 O 3) stemming from standard perovskites, but having all alkaline ions substituted by rare earth, on its resistance and stability against sulfur-containing gases (H 2 S) and on its sensitivity towards some important <b>reducing</b> <b>gases</b> (carbon monoxide, ethanol, methane, propane). The experimental results provide responses to these latter four gases which are distorted by the superimposition of responses involving bulk oxygen equilibration upon the surface reactions with <b>reducing</b> <b>gases.</b> It is concluded that, although perovskite-structure oxides remain useful for oxygen monitoring at high temperature, their deployment for sensing <b>reducing</b> <b>gases</b> is problematical...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Smith's {{estimate}} {{of the number of}} dogs in this country at 7,000,000 is a [...] "conservative" [...] one, it must be confessed, and can hardly have been based on observations by moonlight in a suburban village; his {{estimate of}} the effective strength of the average dog at 500 pounds is probably about right, as will be attested by any intelligent boy who in campaigns against orchards has experienced detention by the Cerberi of the places. Taking his own figures Mr. Smith calculates that {{we have in this country}} 3,500,000,000 pounds of [...] "idle dog power." [...] But this statement is more ingenious than ingenuous; it gives, as doubtless it was intended to give, the impression that we have only idle dogs, whereas of all mundane forces the domestic dog is most easily stirred to action. His expense of energy in pursuit of the harmless, necessary flea, for example, is prodigious; and he is not infrequently seen in chase of his own tail, with an activity scarcely inferior. If there is anything worth while in accepted theories of the conversion and conservation of force these gigantic energies are by no means wasted; they appear as heat, light and electricity, modifying climate, <b>reducing</b> <b>gas</b> bills and assisting in propulsion of street cars. Even in baying the moon and insulting visitors and bypassers the dog releases a certain amount of vibratory force which through various mutations of its wave-length, may do its part in cooking a steak or gratifying the olfactory nerve by throwing fresh perfume on the violet. Evidently the commercial advantages of deposing the dog from the position of Exalted Personage and subduing him to that of Motor would not be all clear gain. He would no longer have the spirit to send, Whitmanwise, his barbarous but beneficent yawp over the housetops, nor the leisure to throw off vast quantities of energy by centrifugal efforts at the conquest of his tail. As to the fleas, he would accept them with apathetic satisfaction as preventives of thought upon his fallen fortunes.|$|E

40|$|Four spinel ferrites, MFe 2 O 4 (M = Cu, Cd, Zn and Ni), having various grain sizes (100 – 700 nm) were {{prepared}} by sol-gel-selfcombustion and their sensing properties to <b>reducing</b> <b>gases</b> were investigated.

The sensitivity of four ferrites to <b>reducing</b> <b>gases</b> like acetone, ethanol and LPG was been compared. It was revealed that CuFe 2 O 4 is the most sensitive to LPG and ZnFe 2 O 4 {{can be used as a}} sensor to selectively detect ethanol vapors in air.
