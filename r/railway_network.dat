5|$|The branch was {{included}} in the Beeching report of 1963 which concluded that, since 30% of the <b>railway</b> <b>network</b> carried less than 1% of the total passenger traffic, much of it should be closed. The residents of Newport Pagnell resisted the closure, demanding an enquiry which took place on 7 June 1964. Despite many objections, it was determined that the line would close. The last passenger service was the 5:34 pm train from Newport Pagnell on 5 September 1964, just under a century after the line opened to passengers. The mourning of the line was so great that a bucket of water was poured over a double dressed as Richard Beeching, the man commonly associated with the closure of over 4,000 miles of the British <b>railway</b> <b>network.</b> The crowd cheered as this happened, a mark of the public's feelings about the closure.|$|E

The objective of this model is to minimize the total cost incurred by transferring and storing empty cars in different stages. Moreover, a genetic algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal empty cars distribution strategies in <b>railway</b> <b>networks.</b> Finally, numerical experiments are given to show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed model and algorithm...|$|R
