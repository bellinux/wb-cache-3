500|$|While {{designing}} {{sound for}} the musical Hair, Dugan began {{to appreciate the}} human operator's inability to act quickly enough to control multiple microphones. He saw the show's audio mixing person [...] "working <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> for 16 area mics, 9 hand mics, and 10 mics in the band". Dugan thought that a microphone should not be turned on unless it was getting some worthwhile signal, {{more than just the}} room ambiance. His frustration with microphone mixing led him to experiment for a few years with microphone signals controlled automatically by voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs), finally developing the [...] "Dugan Music System", shown to the AES at their 49th convention, held in New York in 1974. This system used a novel proportional gain algorithm whereby the total gain was divided between all active microphones. The microphones were [...] "continuously and automatically adjusted" [...] by a set of VCAs to bring each microphone up or down in the mix, based on how much signal it was sending relative to the signal received by a reference microphone placed somewhat distant from the other microphones. Dugan's patent application for a [...] "Control Apparatus for Sound Reinforcement Systems" [...] was accepted and published on June 4, 1974. This was the first useful automatic microphone mixing algorithm, the basis for all of Dugan's later systems.|$|E
5000|$|The Monster GO-DJ has two LCD touch screens, one {{on either}} side of a {{physical}} interface comprising <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> and a cross-fader. [...] The <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> are dual-mode, having a second function when pressed. The hardware section also has transport buttons, status LEDs around the rotaries, and beat indication LEDs.|$|E

50|$|It is {{controlled}} by a pedal for the pitch, and a single <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> that selects from 16 presets—five Whammy effects, nine Harmony effects, and two Detune effects.|$|R
5000|$|Maschine: As the {{original}} configuration, Maschine featured 16 pressure sensitive pads, 11 <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> 2 LCD screens, and 41 buttons. Alongside the USB connection, Maschine also featured a MIDI {{input and output}} to connect to compatible gear externally.|$|E
50|$|The pedal is foot-controlled to start, stop, fill, and transition, with <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> for {{adjusting}} volume, tempo {{and drum}} set. An additional accessory dual footswitch may be {{plugged into the}} BeatBuddy to provide control of accent hits, pause/unpause, as well as tap tempo and hands free content navigation.|$|E
50|$|MX-28 - The MX-28's {{literature}} says (C)1981. It is {{very similar}} to MX20 except that it uses sliders instead of <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> and has a Phaser instead of vibrato. It also has a built in speaker on the right side. The 'high/low' variations of the voices is omitted, but on this machine you can actually blend the voices together.|$|E
50|$|In response, several luxury brands had {{switched}} to <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> control devices, {{with the aim}} to simplify cabin layout and consolidate multiple controls with a single device. The BMW iDrive, Audi MMI, and Mercedes-Benz COMAND APS interfaces operated using a circular center knob which can be rotated side to side, and pressed to select items, with the <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> scrolling through on-screen menus. Of these systems, some reviewers praised their ability to simplify the dash layout, while others levied criticism for reputed complexity and user difficulty, particularly with iDrive.|$|R
50|$|Non-cable-ready {{television}} sets are older televisions (e.g., with a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob)</b> with no coaxial cable F connector; a cable converter box or a cable-ready VCR {{is necessary to}} receive cable.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} check the feasibility of predicting experimental outcomes of driver distraction studies. The predictions are based on subtasks analysis and synthesis. In the first experiment, data (e. g., Total Glance Time, Single Glance Durations and Total Shutter Open Times) are gathered when subjects interacted with touch screen applications. In a second experiment, additional data were gathered about <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> interactions. These data were used to synthesis and predict the outcomes of a third (evaluation) experiment, which involved <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> and touch screen tasks. The results are promising and can help {{to have a better}} understanding of problematic subtasks and reduce testing of clearly unsuitable applications. The transfer of the procedure to other laboratories is challenging. The modeling and mapping process includes many subjective decisions...|$|R
50|$|The HP-HIL (Hewlett-Packard Human Interface Link) is {{the name}} of a {{computer}} bus used by Hewlett-Packard to connect keyboards, mice, trackballs, digitizers, tablets, barcode readers, <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> touchscreens, and other human interface peripherals to their HP 9000 workstations. The bus was in use until the mid-1990s, when HP substituted PS/2 technology for HIL. The PS/2 peripherals were themselves replaced with USB-connected models.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997 Clavia {{released}} the Nord Modular, a virtual analog modular synthesizer. Called a [...] "landmark in synthesis" [...] it allowed you to essentially {{build your own}} virtual analog synthesizer. It too was later upgraded with the 2004 release of the Nord Modular G2, that gave it the same endless <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> as the Nord Lead 3 and a larger keyboard with aftertouch.|$|E
5000|$|Maschine Studio: The {{most recent}} {{configuration}} of Maschine, Studio is marketed as the premium {{edition of the}} hardware. Studio features 16 pressure sensitive pads, RGB backlighting, 9 <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> 2 color LCD screens, 2 sliders, a jog wheel, and 66 buttons. The controller also features dual MIDI inputs and outputs, 2 foot switch inputs, and an input for a 15v power supply, as USB power is insufficient.|$|E
5000|$|Simpler systems {{allow the}} driver to control the valve or door {{directly}} (usually {{by means of a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>knob,</b> or a lever). More complicated systems use a combination of electromechanical actuators and thermistors to control the valve or doors to deliver air at a precise temperature value selected by the user.|$|R
50|$|KVM {{switches}} {{were originally}} passive, mechanical devices based on multi-pole switches {{and some of}} the cheapest devices on the market still use this technology. Mechanical switches usually have a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> to select between computers. KVMs typically allow sharing of two or four computers, with a practical limit of about twelve machines imposed by limitations on available switch configurations. Modern hardware designs use active electronics rather than physical switch contacts with the potential to control many computers on a common system backbone.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of Remote Touch, Lexus {{interiors}} were typically equipped with touchscreen interfaces. Although this system was regarded by many reviewers as easier to use than conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> controllers, the need to place the touchscreen within easy reach limited design possibilities for the interior (by forcing placement of the screen in the center dash and {{in close proximity to}} the steering wheel). The enhanced technology trend in the automotive industry also resulted in a plethora of ever-increasing buttons and switches on many luxury vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The channel input strips {{are usually}} {{a bank of}} {{identical}} monaural or stereo input channels. Each channel has <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> buttons and/or faders for controlling the gain and equalization (e.g., bass and treble) of the signal on each channel. Depending on the mixer, a channel may have buttons which enable the audio engineer to reroute the signal to a different output for monitoring purposes, turn on an attenuator [...] "pad", or activate other features.|$|E
5000|$|Logic Control (and now MCU) allows {{control of}} almost all Logic {{parameters}} with hardware faders, buttons and [...] "V-Pots" [...] (<b>rotary</b> <b>knobs).</b> Its touch-sensitive, motorized faders react to track automation. All transport functions and wheel scrubbing are also available. The unit also controls plug-in parameters. Visual feedback including current parameters being edited, parameter values, project location (SMPTE time code or bars/beats/divisions/ticks) are conveyed by a two-line LCD and red 7-segment LED displays.|$|E
50|$|MIDI {{keyboards}} are a {{very common}} feature of a recording studio, and any DAW setup. Most include a transpose function {{and the ability to}} set different octaves. Many MIDI keyboards have pitch bend and modulation wheels. Some also have extra sets of assignable <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> and/or buttons for sending custom MIDI messages to the synthesiser, sampler or DAW software. Devices with extra features (also including rhythm input, instrument selection, transport control) are sometimes called keyboard controllers.|$|E
50|$|The player uses a flight-style {{joystick}} to move {{a spaceship}} around a dark starfield, a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> to orient it, and a trigger on the stick to fire. Planets appear {{at the start of}} a level and begin growing. They can be destroyed prior to reaching full size and sprouting moons. Once a planet has moons, it's shielded until all its moons have been launched at the player's ship. A planet that has lost all of its moons becomes angry and charges the player.|$|R
50|$|Newer Minitor pagers can scan two {{channels}} {{by selecting}} that function via a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> on the pager; in this mode when using a Minitor III or IV the user will hear all traffic, {{even without the}} correct tones being sent. If the activation tones are transmitted in this monitor mode, the pager alerts as normal. Minitor Vs {{have the option to}} remain in monitor mode or in selective call mode when scanning two channels. Minitor IIIs and IVs only have the option to remain in monitor mode when scanning two channels.|$|R
50|$|Unveiled by Lexus at the 2008 Los Angeles Auto Show in November of that year, Remote Touch became Lexus {{entry into}} the realm of non-touchscreen human-machine interfaces. Introduced on the third {{generation}} Lexus RX, the Remote Touch system differs from previous interfaces in being the first to use a computer mouse (or trackball)-based concept, instead of the <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> model. The system allows the operator to freely move the on-screen cursor across any part of the screen. The cursor replaces the role of the drivers hand on the previous touchscreen interface.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, Clavia {{released}} the Nord Lead. Called [...] "a magic piece of electronics" [...] by Sound on Sound it popularized the virtual analog type of synthesis. In 1997 the Nord Lead 2 was released, with many improvements, including increasing polyphony from 4 to 16 notes. The Nord Lead 3 {{was released in}} 2001, with a reworked sound engine, better D/A converters and monophonic aftertouch. The most striking aspect of the Nord Lead 3 was that all the sound editing knobs had been replaced with infinite <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> where {{the value of the}} parameter was indicated by a LED 'collar' around the knob. The <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs,</b> LED collars and keyboard with aftertouch made the Nord Lead 3 an [...] "absolute delight" [...] but because of its higher price, the Nord Lead 2 remained in demand. And as some of the parts of the Nord Lead 3 were getting harder to source, Clavia released an updated version of the Nord Lead 2, called the Nord Lead 2x, with faster processors, better D/A converters and an upgraded polyphony to 20 voices. The Nord Lead 3 was discontinued in 2007, but the Nord Lead 2x remains in production.|$|E
50|$|The first HR-3300 was {{released}} in 1976. These early units used two large <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> for tuning television signals for recording, one for VHF and another for UHF. Separate antenna inputs and pass-throughs were provided for both frequencies, as well composite video in and out via RCA jacks. An electronic timer with four seven-segment displays was located in the lower left of the front panel allowed the user to automatically record programs, one event up to 24 hours in the future. It also included a mechanical three-digit counter, similar to those on audio cassette recorders.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{much of the}} {{interior}} receives an update, with new seats, door panels, and the entire dashboard is redesigned with attention paid to ergonomics. Switching locations with the climate controls, a Double-DIN radio featured large buttons and knobs; on models without automatic climate controls, <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> replaced sliding controls. The power seat controls, if specified, were now located on the door panels along with enlarged buttons for the power windows and door locks. The outdated horizontal speedometer was replaced by instrument cluster used in the Crown Victoria (adding a voltmeter and oil-pressure gauge); a digital instrument panel with trip computer was still an option.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{implementation}} of ADSR {{can be found}} on the Hammond Novachord in 1938 (which predates the first Moog synthesizer by over 25 years). [...] A seven-position <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> set preset ADS parameter for all 72 notes; a pedal controlled release time. [...] The notion of ADSR was specified by Vladimir Ussachevsky (then head of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center) in 1965 while suggesting improvements for Bob Moog's pioneering work on synthesizers, although the earlier notations of parameter were (T1, T2, Esus, T3), then these were simplified to current form (Attack time, Decay time, Sustain level, Release time) by ARP.|$|R
40|$|Haptic-enabled <b>rotary</b> control <b>knobs</b> are {{increasingly}} being integrated within vehicles to manage vehicular instrumentation. By doing so, driver safety and performance is increased {{as a result of}} the distraction reductions associated with such a system. The integration of window adjustment within such a vehicular instrumentation management system is examined through human factors studies for the purpose of reducing driver distraction. Additional focus is placed on examining the ability of haptic feedback alone to eliminate reliance on visual feedback when adjusting window height. Results indicate that eliminating such reliance is possible by means of a <b>rotary</b> control <b>knob</b> providing varying intermediate haptic feedback as the window is adjusted...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the haptical and gestural {{user input}} modes are {{compared}} {{with regard to}} distraction from a controlling task similar to steering a car. The examination is carried out in a driving-simulation laboratory. While performing the controlling task permanently, the test subject has to execute a variety of user input with a given modality. Haptical input is done by using buttons or a <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> while gestural input consists of dynamic right hand movements in a designated space. During the experiment, the controlling error, the object recognition performance, and the required duration for each user input are measured. The results show a significant benefit for gestural input. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Nord Lead 3 {{was a more}} {{advanced}} version introduced in 2001, with many new features like 4 operator FM Synthesis (Sinus Modulation), and an arpeggiator. The most visible new feature was replacing all the control knobs with endless <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> surrounded by a lighted indicating collar to show the current setting. The Nord Lead 3 was however much {{more expensive than the}} Nord Lead 2, so the Nord Lead 2 and later Nord Lead 2X was sold in parallel to this flagship product. The Nord Lead 3 was discontinued in 2007, leaving the Nord Lead 2X the only remaining product in the Nord Lead series.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of drive by wire (or more properly, shift by wire) {{computer}} controlled transmissions (particularly {{in the case of}} automatics), the gear stick no longer needs to be mechanically connected to the transmission unit itself, and can therefore be made much smaller since {{there is no need to}} package either remote mechanisms or complex interlocking arrangements. This has allowed designers to replace the gear stick completely with either buttons, <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs</b> (current Jaguar and Range Rover models are good examples of this), or a miniaturized gear stick on the centre console. This can be seen in the Toyota Prius and some Audis, BMWs and the Lincoln Continental. Japanese finger shift is another example. It is a revival of an approach used in the 1950s by the Chrysler push button PowerFlite and the Packard Touchbutton Ultramatic.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{controls}} on bass amps: switches and <b>rotary</b> <b>knobs.</b> The simplest, least expensive practice amps and combo amps may {{only have a few}} switches and knobs, such as an [...] "on/off" [...] switch, a volume knob, and a bass and treble control knob. Mid-priced models may add additional tone controls (e.g., one, two or three [...] "midrange" [...] controls and a [...] "presence" [...] knob for very high frequencies) and/or add a second type of volume knob called a [...] "gain", [...] "preamplifier" [...] (or [...] "preamp"/"pre"), or [...] "drive" [...] (short for [...] "overdrive") control. A good selection of equalizer knobs and gain stages is standard on expensive amplifiers. If an amp has one or more preamp or gain knobs, the second volume knob may be called [...] "master", [...] "volume" [...] or [...] "post".|$|E
50|$|ZunZun Block (ズンズンブロック lit. ZunZun Burokku) is an arcade game {{released}} in 1979 by Taito. It runs on Taito Discrete Logic hardware {{and is a}} clone of Breakout that uses cellophane strips on the monitor to act as color. Not much {{is known about the}} game since it is unavailable in MAME even though there are users claiming to own original boards. Using the <b>rotary</b> <b>knob,</b> the player must hit the ball with the paddle to break all of the bricks on the screen. A small green propeller-like object will sometimes appear at the centre of the screen, and the formation of bricks will move down if hit.|$|R
5000|$|The Oldsmobile Profile was a 2000 {{concept car}} built by Oldsmobile. The Profile was a compact {{crossover}} SUV, with rear sliding doors and 5 seats. The Profile {{came with a}} supercharged 3.5 L V6 engine with 250 horsepower, all-wheel drive, and traction control. The gear selector was a dash-mounted <b>rotary</b> <b>knob,</b> freeing up the console for storage. The transmission could be shifted manually by using steering wheel-mounted buttons. A [...] "smart card" [...] keyless ignition system performed all personal driver adjustments including seat, radio, mirror and steering wheel when activated by the driver. Along with many other innovative features, was hands-free phone communication, Internet, on-board vehicle diagnostics and a DVD entertainment system with headrest displays for rear seat passengers.|$|R
50|$|Field Goal (フィールドゴール Fīrudo Gōru) is an arcade game {{released}} in 1979 by Taito Corporation. It is a clone {{of the game}} Breakout, where the player must use the <b>rotary</b> <b>knob</b> to control a paddle and hit {{the ball into the}} red, yellow and blue helmets on the screen. Each time a row of helmets is cleared out, a new row will appear in its place. If the player hits the orange area towards the top of the screen, it will decrease the size of the player's paddle. Sometimes a football player will appear, and if the ball hits him, the player will earn bonus points. The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2007 as part of Taito Memories II Gekan.|$|R
