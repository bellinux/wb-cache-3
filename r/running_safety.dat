40|$|Making use of {{long-term}} transverse vibration monitoring data of DaShengGuan Bridge, the early-warning method of train <b>running</b> <b>safety</b> of the high-speed railway bridge is established by adopting {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) method. Firstly, the root mean square (RMS) of the transverse acceleration of the main girder is used as the monitoring parameter for the train <b>running</b> <b>safety.</b> The correlation model between the RMS values measured from different positions is further adopted as the evaluating model for the train <b>running</b> <b>safety.</b> Finally, {{the effects of the}} environmental changes on the evaluating model are eliminated using the PCA method and the warning index for the train <b>running</b> <b>safety</b> is further constructed. The analysis results show that the correlation between the RMS values of the accelerations from different measuring positions on the main girder can be analyzed by a quadratic polynomial fitting model. The PCA method can effectively remove the environmental effects on the quadratic polynomial fitting model. The proposed warning method provides a good capability for detecting the abnormal changes of the measured transverse accelerations and hence it is suitable for early-warning of the train <b>running</b> <b>safety...</b>|$|E

Taking a long span cable-stayed bridge across the Huangpu River as an example, a full three-dimensional finite element model of the train-bridge system was established, in which the soil-bridge and rail-train interactions were considered.

An improved nonlinear mathematical model of buffers and a coupler rotation angle stop element are also included. After validating the presented locomotive dynamic model by comparing its calculated results with test data, simulations are carried out to analyse the influences of the coupler-tail arc surface and locomotive secondary suspension parameters on the coupler compressed stability and locomotive <b>running</b> <b>safety.</b> Results indicate that the friction coefficient and the arc radius of the coupler-tail arc surfaces have a remarkable influence, and that the locomotive secondary lateral stop and lateral stiffness also have a significant effect.

40|$|Low-flatcar wagons are {{designed}} to load entire articulated lorries instead of loading only the containers {{in order to make}} the loading and unloading stages easier and faster. This design implies a particular layout of the bogie and suspension system, aiming at minimizing the height of the flatcar with respect to the rail level. This solution influences the dynamic behavior of the wagons, reducing the steering capability and causing high lateral forces on the driving wheels when low-radius curves or turnouts are negotiated. Aim of the work is the homologation of low-flatcar wagons on the Italian railways. Besides the classical homologation procedure prescribed by the EN 14363 rule, a particular focus will be devoted to the <b>running</b> <b>safety</b> when negotiating turnouts. Indeed, it will be demonstrated that, under certain conditions, this is a very critical running condition for these vehicles. First, a numerical analysis is performed to identify the most critical condition.

40|$|Coupling forces, {{especially}} buffer forces, play {{a significant}} role in affecting <b>running</b> <b>safety</b> of freight trains. The increase in coupling force is due to relative motion between adjacent wagons that depends both on track geometry and on manoeuvre performed. Emergency braking in particular, can strongly excite the longitudinal dynamics of a trainset, usually causing significant solicitations on coupling elements. Additionally, braking while cornering may enhance the effect of the coupling forces on the lateral dynamics of the wagon, decreasing <b>running</b> <b>safety</b> margins. A factor that affects the maximum solicitations on coupling devices during emergency braking is payload distribution compared to brake power distribution along the trainset. This issue is particularly significant in Italian railways where empty wagons may be placed along the trainset between fully laden ones without any particular restriction. This paper presents the results of a research aiming at defining imbalance indexes which can be related to the maximum forces exchanged among wagons through the coupling devices. Indexes can be used as guidelines for identifying critical payload distributions and improve wagons arrangement...|$|E
40|$|Determination of the {{interaction}} forces between wheel and rail of railway vehicles is essential for assessment of the vehicle dynamic characteristics from {{point of view of}} <b>running</b> <b>safety</b> and rail loading as well as for approval the vehicle and alignment them to the Technical Specification for Interoperability. The direct measurement of transverse and vertical interaction forces using the existing full-disk wheel is practical impossible due to the impossibility of separating the two types of forces. To avoid this impediment it was realized a measuring wheelset fitted with 12 spokes achieved as force transducers for measurement of the vertical forces and 12 spokes achieved as force transducers for measurement of the transverse forces. The measuring wheelset was calibrated as a force transducer and was used to determine the wheel and rail interaction forces for LE-MA 6000 kW electric locomotive made by Softronic Craiova.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{framework}} to analyze the interaction between an actively controlled magnetic levitation vehicle and a guideway structure under gusty wind. The equation of motion is presented for a 30 -dof maglev vehicle model consisting of one cabin and four bogies. In addition, a lateral electromagnetic suspension (EMS) system is introduced to improve the <b>running</b> <b>safety</b> and ride quality of the maglev vehicle subjected to turbulent crosswind. By using the developed simulation tools, the effects of various parameters on the dynamic response of the vehicle and guideway are investigated in the case of the UTM maglev vehicle running on a simply supported guideway and cable-stayed guideway. The simulation results show that the independent lateral EMS and associated control scheme are definitely helpful in improving the <b>running</b> <b>safety</b> and ride quality of the vehicle under gusty wind. In the case of the cable-stayed guideway, at low wind speed, vehicle speed is the dominant factor influencing the dynamic responses of the maglev vehicle and the guideway, but at wind speed over 10 [*]m/s, wind becomes the dominant factor. For the ride quality of the maglev vehicle, wind is also the most influential factor...|$|E
40|$|A {{static and}} a dynamic {{analysis}} model are separately established using ABAQUS finite element program {{to study the}} mechanical properties of track structure and <b>running</b> stability and <b>safety</b> of the vehicle {{under the condition that}} uneven settlement of bridge piers exists. The static model is aimed at studying the effects caused by uneven settlement alone and the dynamic one is for the effects induced by uneven settlement and train loads together. Conclusions are drawn as follows: 1) The influence range of uneven settlement on fastenings is 10 groups of fastenings {{on both sides of the}} beam joint. Among them the influence on the first group of fastenings is the largest. 2) The influence area of uneven settlement on rail stress is within the range of 15 m on both sides of the beam joint. The bigger uneven settlement is, the larger rail stress will be. 3) Uneven settlement of bridge piers has certain effects on <b>running</b> stability and <b>safety,</b> but every evaluating indicator is within the specification limits, showing that the operation has good emergency capacity. 4) The influence induced by uneven settlement is much greater on the mechanical characteristics of rail and fastenings than on <b>running</b> stability and <b>safety,</b> making it clear that the factor that determines the limit of uneven settlement of bridge piers is fastening force and rail stress, not the <b>running</b> stability and <b>safety...</b>|$|R
