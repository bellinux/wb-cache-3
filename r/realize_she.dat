[...] When the divorce was finalized, she went to New York, leaving her former husband three fully prepared show scripts.

500|$|Blackout {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. On music review aggregator Metacritic the album holds {{a score of}} sixty-one out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on 24 critical reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of AllMusic, described the album as [...] "state-of-the-art dance-pop, a testament to skills of the producers and perhaps even Britney being somehow cognizant enough to <b>realize</b> <b>she</b> should hire the best, even if she's not at her best." [...] Dennis Lim of Blender deemed it as [...] "her most consistent , a seamlessly entertaining collection of bright, brash electropop." [...] Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly commented that while the album is not poetry, [...] "there is something delightfully escapist about Blackout, a perfectly serviceable dance album abundant {{in the kind of}} bouncy electro elements that buttressed her hottest hits." [...] A reviewer for NME said that the heavily treated vocals make Spears sound robotic, adding that [...] "it could really do with a few more human touches." [...] Pitchfork's Tom Ewing called [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] the centerpiece of the album, and added that [...] "like most of Blackout, is superb modern pop, which could probably only have been released by this star at this moment. Britney as walking catastrophe makes for great car-crash copy and her record can fit into that if you want it to." [...] Ewing also compared the relationship between Spears and Blackout with American television series Twin Peaks, saying that what made the show [...] "so great wasn't the central good-girl-gone-bad story, it was the strangeness that story liberated. And Britney's off-disc life is both distraction from and enabler for this extraordinary album". Mike Schiller of PopMatters said that [...] "Right down to its utterly garish cover, Blackout is utterly disposable and ultimately forgettable." [...] Melissa Maerz from Rolling Stone explained that Blackout [...] "is {{the first time in her}} career that she's voiced any real thoughts about her life" [...] and that [...] "she's gonna crank the best pop booty jams until a social worker cuts off her supply of hits." [...] Rob Sheffield of the same magazine described Blackout as [...] "one of the most influential albums in modern pop".|$|E
