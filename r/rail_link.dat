5|$|In 2010, Martin Pakula of the Labor Party, newly {{appointed}} State Minister for Public Transport {{announced that the}} <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> had been taken off the agenda with new freeway options being explored instead, however a change of government at the 2010 Victorian State Election to Liberals, saw policy for {{the introduction of the}} <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> return to the agenda, with a promise by the incoming Coalition government to undertake planning for its construction.|$|E
5|$|A further type of {{committee}} is normally {{set up to}} scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter {{who is not a}} member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport <b>Rail</b> <b>Link,</b> the Airdrie-Bathgate <b>Rail</b> <b>Link</b> and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|China's {{rail system}} had long {{linked to the}} Trans-Siberian via northeastern China and Mongolia. In 1990 China added a link between its rail system and the Trans-Siberian via Kazakhstan. China calls its {{uninterrupted}} <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> between {{the port city of}} Lianyungang and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion of the <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.|$|E

50|$|This meant however that Northampton, {{despite being}} a large town, {{did not have}} direct <b>rail</b> <b>links</b> to London. A branch from the main line was built to Northampton in the early 1840s, the Northampton and Peterborough Railway, from Blisworth, which gave the town {{indirect}} <b>rail</b> <b>links</b> to London and Birmingham.|$|R
5|$|It was {{reported}} in the press in March 2007 that China intends to build a high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> between China and Western Europe with the possibility of a high-speed rail journey from Beijing to London taking just two days.|$|E
5|$|The New Eurasian Land Bridge, {{also called}} the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, is the name given to China's <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> with Central Asia. The route {{includes}} China's east-west railways which, {{in addition to the}} Beijiang line, are the Longhai Railway and the Lanzhou–Xinjiang Railway. Together, the railways create an uninterrupted <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> between the port city of Lianyungang in Jiangsu province and Kazakhstan. In 1995 the Chinese and Kazakhstan governments signed an agreement which allows the latter to use Lianyungang as its primary seaport for exports and imports, and the former intends for Lianyungang to serve as the designated starting point for the New Eurasian Land Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Freight trains {{operated}} by EWS first ran over CTRL Section 1, on the consecutive evenings of 3–4 April 2004.

5|$|In 2001, the Bracks State Government {{investigated}} {{the construction of}} a heavy <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> to the airport under the Linking Victoria programme. Two options were considered; the first branched off the Craigieburn Suburban Line to the east, and the second branched off the Albion Goods Line, which passes close to the airport's boundary to the south. The second option was preferred. Market research concluded most passengers preferred travelling to the airport by taxi or car, and poor patronage of similar links in Sydney and Brisbane cast doubt on the viability of the project. This led to the project being deferred until at least 2012. On 21 July 2008, the Premier of Victoria reaffirmed the government's commitment to a <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> and said that it would be considered within three to five years. To maximise future development options, the airport is lobbying for the on-grounds section of the railway to be underground.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 2013, the Victorian Liberal {{government}} under the newly installed Premier, Denis Napthine, {{announced that the}} Melbourne Airport <b>Rail</b> <b>Link</b> (MARL) would be constructed around 2015/16 running from the CBD via Sunshine station and the Albion–Jacana railway line.|$|E

5|$|The {{possibility}} of installing a <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> {{from what was}} originally known as the Broadmeadows line (now the Craigieburn line) to the airport was debated in the 1960s under the Bolte State Government, but with not enough support shown in parliament, the rail project was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|From Almaty in Kazakhstan, {{the railway}} extends to Tashkent and Samarkand, Uzbekistan {{and then to}} Tejen, Turkmenistan. From Tejen, another line {{continues}} to Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan. After Ashgabat, the line ends at Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan, a port on the Caspian Sea. (After a direct <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan opened, it became possible for the freight to bypass Uzbekistan, which has poor relations with its neighbors).|$|E
5|$|More recently, the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge, {{built from}} 1959 to 1964, had been {{proposed}} {{to serve as}} the <b>rail</b> <b>link.</b> The 95th Street station was slated to be connected to the bridge, one of the world's longest suspension bridges, because it followed the route of the planned tunnel. However, no space for any tracks was ever built because of Moses's opposition to the expansion of New York City public transportation.|$|E
5|$|Proposals in January 2013 {{to improve}} the bus service to the airport {{involving}} turning emergency lanes into bus lanes on the freeway and the Bolte Bridge and putting SkyBus on a myki fare, were challenged by CityLink operator Transurban, because it would limit its toll revenue, and by Melbourne Airport, because it would reduce its car parking profits. Similar objections would apply to a <b>rail</b> <b>link.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{area has}} been {{inhabited}} since the Stone Age, and was a centre of ironworking in Roman times. Crawley developed slowly as a market town from the 13th century, serving the surrounding villages in the Weald. Its location {{on the main road}} from London to Brighton brought passing trade, which encouraged the development of coaching inns. A <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> to London opened in 1841.|$|E
5|$|The long, sandy Watergate Bay {{leads to}} St Columb Porth and Newquay. A <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> with through trains to London and the North of England on summer {{weekends}} {{has helped the}} town prosper as a seaside resort popular with surfers and clubbers. On {{the far side of}} the town, beyond Fistral Beach, lies the River Gannel. There are seasonal ferries to Crantock and a footbridge which is passable at low tide, otherwise there is a detour inland to use the road bridge.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a single}} <b>rail</b> <b>link</b> to the Rhondda, the Rhondda Line, based around the old Taff Vale Railway which {{serviced}} both the Rhondda Fach and Rhondda Fawr. The Rhondda Line runs through the Rhondda Fawr, linking Rhondda to Cardiff Central. The railway stations that once populated the Rhondda Fach were all closed after the Beeching Axe. The railway line serves ten Rhondda stations with the villages not directly linked connected through bus services.|$|E
