40|$|The {{maintenance}} of pluripotency and specification of cellular lineages during embryonic development {{are controlled by}} transcriptional regulatory networks, which coordinate specific sets of genes through both activation and repression. The transcriptional repressor RE 1 -silencing transcription factor (REST) plays important but distinct regulatory roles in embryonic (ESC) and neural (NSC) stem cells. We investigated how these distinct biological roles are effected at a genomic level. We present integrated, comparative genome- and transcriptome-wide analyses of transcriptional networks governed by REST in mouse ESC and NSC. The REST <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile</b> has dual components: a developmentally independent core that is common to ESC, NSC, and differentiated cells; and a large, ESC-specific set of target genes. In ESC, the REST regulatory network is highly integrated into that of pluripotency factors Oct 4 -Sox 2 -Nanog. We propose that an extensive, pluripotency-specific <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile</b> lends REST {{a key role in}} the {{maintenance of}} the ESC phenotype...|$|E

40|$|Endocytosis is a {{key process}} in the {{internalization}} of extracellular materials and plasma membrane proteins, such as receptors and transporters, thereby controlling many aspects of cell signaling and cellular homeostasis. Endocytosis in plants has an essential role not only for basic cellular functions but also for growth and development, nutrient delivery, toxin avoidance, and pathogen defense. The precise mechanisms of endocytosis in plants remain quite elusive. The lack of direct visualization and examination of single events of endocytosis has greatly hampered our ability to precisely monitor the cell surface lifetime and the <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile</b> of proteins driving endocytosis or endocytosed cargos in plants. Here, we discuss the necessity to systematically implement total internal reflection fluorescence microcopy (TIRF) in the Plant Cell Biology community and present reliable protocols for high spatial and temporal imaging of endocytosis in plants using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a test case, since it represents the major route for internalization of cell-surface proteins in plants. We developed a robust method to directly visualize cell surface proteins using TIRF microscopy combined to a high throughput, automated and unbiased analysis pipeline to determine the temporal <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile</b> of proteins to single sites of endocytosis, using the departure of clathrin as a physiological reference for scission. Using this ‘departure assay’, we assessed the recruitment of two different AP- 2 subunits, alpha and mu, to the sites of endocytosis and found that AP 2 A 1 was recruited in concert with clathrin, while AP 2 M was not. This validated approach therefore offers a powerful solution to better characterize the plant endocytic machinery and the dynamics of one’s favorite cargo protein...|$|E

40|$|International audience: After {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) {{resident}} and peripheral myeloid cells are recruited to the injury site and {{play a role in}} injury progression. These cells are important for clearing cellular debris and can modulate the retraction and growth of axons in vitro. However, their precise spatiotemporal recruitment dynamics is unknown and their respective roles after SCI remain heavily debated. Using chronic, quantitative intravital two-photon microscopy of adult mice with SCI, here we show that infiltrating LysM(+) and resident CD 11 c(+) myelomonocytic cells have distinct spatiotemporal <b>recruitment</b> <b>profiles</b> and exhibit changes in morphology, motility, phagocytic activity, and axon interaction patterns over time.

40|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} currently {{relies on}} extradural electrode arrays that {{are separated from}} the spinal cord surface by a highly conducting layer of cerebrospinal fluid. It has recently been suggested that intradural placement of the electrodes {{in direct contact with}} the pial surface could greatly enhance the specificity and efficiency of stimulation. The present computational study aims at quantifying and comparing the electrical current distributions as well as the spatial <b>recruitment</b> <b>profiles</b> resulting from extra- and intra-dural electrode arrangements. The electrical potential distribution is calculated using a 3 D finite element model of the human thoracic spinal canal. The likely recruitment areas are then obtained using the potential as input to an equivalent circuit model of the pre-threshold axonal response. The results show that the current threshold to recruitment of axons in the dorsal column is more than an order of magnitude smaller for intradural than extradural stimulation. Intradural placement of the electrodes also leads to much higher contrast between the stimulation thresholds for the dorsal root entry zone and the dorsal column, allowing better focusing of the stimulus...|$|R

30|$|Very few {{investigations}} have used NaHCO 3, or indeed other methods, to manipulate pH {{and to explore}} the effects of alkalosis on afferent or other neural pathways contributing to skeletal muscle fatigue [94, 95]. Based {{on the assumption that}} H+ accumulation leads to a decline in central drive to the muscle, Matsuura and colleagues measured surface electromyography (sEMG) activity in the vastus lateralis to determine whether motor unit recruitment strategies during repeated high-intensity cycling (i.e. repeated 10 -s efforts at a resistive load (N) of 0.075  BM  9.81 − 1) would be influenced by NaHCO 3 ingestion [94]. Neither root mean square or mean power frequency was influenced by pH, with both NaHCO 3 and control conditions reflecting similar <b>recruitment</b> <b>profiles</b> throughout the test [94]. A follow-up study by the same group suggested that NaHCO 3 again had no effect on gross sEMG activity or perceived sense of effort after 2  min of cycling at 105 – 110  % of a pre-determined maximal workload [95]. However, sEMG signals lack sensitivity to detect changes in the number and discharge rate of active motor units that would indicate increased central motor output [108, 109] and therefore may not be sensitive enough to accurately determine whether or not altering pH may affect descending central drive.|$|R
30|$|The master {{regulator}} {{of thermal}} stress response, Hsf 1, {{is also an}} essential determinant for viability and virulence in Candida albicans. Our recent studies highlighted that apart from ubiquitous roles of Hsf 1 at higher temperatures, it also has myriad non-heat shock responsive roles essential under iron deprivation and drug defense. Here, we further explored its implications in the normal cellular functioning, by profiling its genome-wide occupancy using chromatin immuno-precipitation coupled to high-density tiling arrays under basal and iron deprived conditions. Hsf 1 <b>recruitment</b> <b>profiles</b> revealed that it binds to promoters of 660 genes of varied functions, under both the conditions, however, elicited variability in intensity of binding. For instance, Hsf 1 binding was observed on several genes of oxidative and osmotic stress response, cell wall integrity, iron homeostasis, mitochondrial, hyphal and multidrug transporters. Additionally, the present study divulged a novel motif under basal conditions comprising, -GTGn 3 GTGn 3 GTG- where, Hsf 1 displays strong occupancy at significant number of sites on several promoters distinct from the heat induced motif. Hence, by binding to and regulating major chaperones, stress responsive genes and drug resistance regulators, Hsf 1 is imperative in regulating various cellular machineries. The current study provides a framework for understanding novel aspects of how Hsf 1 coordinates diverse cellular functions.|$|R
40|$|Monocyte {{chemoattractant}} protein- 1 (MCP- 1) is a CC chemokine that stimulates monocyte recruitment when {{injected into}} tissues of healthy animals. However, {{the function of}} this chemokine in models with preexisting inflammation is not known. Therefore, MCP- 1 was superfused over the mesentery of naive rats or rats with chronic adjuvant-induced vasculitis. MCP- 1 elicited increased leukocyte transendothelial migration in adjuvant-immunized rats compared with naive animals. Surprisingly, histology revealed that neutrophils constituted the majority of leukocytes recruited in adjuvant-immunized animals. In vitro, MCP- 1 was also able to induce chemotaxis of neutrophils isolated from adjuvant-immunized rats but not from naive rats. Flow cytometry revealed novel expression of the CC chemokine receptors CCR 1 and CCR 2 on neutrophils from adjuvant-immunized animals. In naive animals, an antibody against CD 18 blocked leukocyte adhesion and emigration in response to MCP- 1. In adjuvant-immunized animals, leukocyte adhesion was reduced by antibodies against the α 4 -integrin but not by antibodies against CD 18. However, the CD 18 antibody did block emigration. To our knowledge, {{this study is the}} first to show increased sensitivity to a CC chemokine in a model with preexisting inflammation, and altered leukocyte <b>recruitment</b> <b>profiles</b> in response to MCP- 1.

40|$|The {{glucocorticoid}} receptor (GR) is a {{transcription factor}} {{of which the}} underlying gene regulatory mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Compound A (CpdA), a selective GR modulating compound in various cell models, {{has been shown to}} favour GR-mediated gene repression but not GR-mediated gene activation. Shifting balances towards only a particular subset of GR gene regulatory events may be of benefit in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We present evidence to support that the combination of CpdA with Dexamethasone (DEX), a classic steroidal GR ligand, can shape GR function towards a unique gene regulatory profile in a cell type-dependent manner. The molecular basis hereof is a changed GR phosphorylation status concomitant with a change in the GR cofactor <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile.</b> We subsequently identified and confirmed the orphan nuclear receptor SHP as a coregulator that is specifically enriched at GR when CpdA and DEX are combined.

Here, the consequences of its depletion on cell survival, PARP activity, the recruitment of base excision repair (BER) proteins to DNA damage sites, and overall DNA single-strand break (SSB) repair were investigated using isogenic HeLa stably depleted (KD) and Control cell lines. Synthetic lethality achieved by disrupting PARP activity in Cdk 5 -deficient cells was confirmed, and the Cdk 5 KD cells were also found {{to be sensitive to the}} killing effects of ionizing radiation (IR) but not methyl methanesulfonate or neocarzinostatin. The <b>recruitment</b> <b>profiles</b> of GFP-PARP- 1 and XRCC 1 -YFP to sites of micro-irradiated Cdk 5 KD cells were slower and reached lower maximum values, while the <b>profile</b> of GFP-PCNA <b>recruitment</b> was faster and attained higher maximum values compared to Control cells. Higher basal, IR, and hydrogen peroxide-induced polymer levels were observed in Cdk 5 KD compared to Control cells. Recruitment of GFP-PARP- 1 in which serines 782, 785, and 786, potential Cdk 5 phosphorylation targets, were mutated to alanines in micro-irradiated Control cells was also reduced. We hypothesize that Cdk 5 -dependent PARP- 1 phosphorylation on one or more of these serines results in an attenuation of its ribosylating activity facilitating persistence at DNA damage sites. Despite these deficiencies, Cdk 5 KD cells are able to effectively repair SSBs probably via the long patch BER pathway, suggesting that the enhanced radiation sensitivity of Cdk 5 KD cells is due to a role of Cdk 5 in other pathways or the altered polymer levels...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1) is {{associated}} with a spectrum of inflammatory processes related to neurodegenerative disease. The effects of single-bolus injections of IL- 1 into the CNS parenchyma give rise to neutrophil (PMN) recruitment, transient blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, but no overt damage to CNS integrity. The effects of long-term IL- 1 expression in brain parenchyma on CNS integrity have not been investigated. We used a recombinant adenovirus expressing IL- 1 (AdIL- 1) to examine the chronic effects of IL- 1 expression in the CNS. Histochemical and immunohistochemical methods were used to characterize the immune response to an intrastriatal injection of 107 pfu of AdIL- 1 and ELISA to quantified the IL- 1 protein produced by the adenovector. IL- 1 expression was detectable at 4, 8, 14, and 30 days postinjection. At days 1 and 2, some monocyte adherence was observed in the lumen of the vessels but between days 8 and 14 there was marked and restricted recruitment of PMNs, vasodilatation and breakdown of the BBB. Microglia and astrocyte activation was evident at days 2, 8 and 14. At days 8 and 14, disorganization of the nervous tissue, demyelination were observed. The number of neurons in the striatum was not affected by the treatment. At 30 days, the nervous tissue appeared normal with no signs of demyelination, infiltration or BBB breakdown. Thus, we show that chronic expression of IL- 1 can damage CNS integrity, that IL- 1 generates a restricted leukocyte <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile</b> in the CNS, and that there is no tachyphylaxis to chronic IL- 1 expression<br/...|$|E
40|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether fatigue and workload would affect muscle recruitment during cycling. To infer {{on changes in}} priority for recruitment of motor units, we assessed the combined effects of fatigue and workload during an incremental cycling test to exhaustion on frequency components of lower limbs muscle activation. Competitive cyclists performed an incremental maximal cycling test while muscle activations were recorded from {{the right and left}} vastus lateralis, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius medialis. Muscle activation signals were assessed using frequency band analyses and decomposed into overall, high and low frequency bands. Combined effects from workload/fatigue were assessed using t tests and Cohen¿s effect sizes (ES). There were increases in the overall muscle activation due to increased workload/fatigue for biceps femoris (40 % vs. 90 %, p< 0. 01 and ES = 1. 85) and vastus lateralis (40 % vs. 70 %, p= 0. 01 and ES = 0. 96, and 40 % vs. 90 %, p< 0. 01 and ES = 2. 03, and 70 % vs. 90 %, p< 0. 01 and ES = 0. 96), but not for gastrocnemius medialis. There was also greater contribution from low frequency component for biceps femoris (40 % vs. 90 %, p = 0. 01 and ES = 1. 12). Similar workload/fatigue effects have been observed between lower limbs. In conclusion, incremental cycling test lead to an increase in activation of main knee joint flexors and extensors but not in plantar flexors during cycling.

40|$|Hypertrophy of beta {{cells from}} obese fa/fa rats is {{associated}} with increased sensitivity to basal glucose. Exposure to glucose in culture distorts insulin secretion more in beta cells from large than small islets from fa/fa rats. The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate whether increased beta cell volume {{is associated with}} both glucose hypersensitivity and altered activity of the glucose-sensitive anion conduct-ance. Beta cells from fa/fa rats had increased volume compared with those from lean rats after 24 h culture. Three-day exposure to 25 mM glucose in culture induced 10 – 15 % hypertrophy in beta cells from lean rats and basal secretion from intact islets was increased tenfold. Estimates of ion channel activity were made from measurement of radiolabeled ion efflux. Taurine efflux, a marker of glucose-regulated anion channel activity, was reduced after high glucose exposure but no alterations in glucose-dependent K+ efflux were detected. The reverse hemo-lytic plaque assay was used to determine the contributions of the number of secreting cells (recruitment) versus secretion per cell in beta cells from enlarged (> 250 µm diameter), intermediate (125 – 250 µm) and small ( 125 µm islets. When beta cells from small islets were exposed to supra-physiological glucose for 3 days, recruitment was increased at basal glucose and blunted at high glucose. Glucose exposure converts the <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile</b> of beta cells from small islets to resemble that of beta cells from large islets while inducing cellular hypertrophy and reduced anion conductance.

Typically, the recruitment of a fluorescent protein-tagged endocytic protein was referenced to the disappearance of spot-like clathrin-coated structure (CCS), but the precision of spot-like CCS disappearance as a marker for canonical CME remained unknown. Here we have used an imaging assay based on total {{internal reflection}} fluorescence microscopy to detect scission events with a resolution of ∼ 2 s. We found that scission events engulfed comparable amounts of transferrin receptor cargo at CCSs of different sizes and CCS did not always disappear following scission. We measured the recruitment dynamics of 34 types of endocytic protein to scission events: Abp 1, ACK 1, amphiphysin 1, APPL 1, Arp 3, BIN 1, CALM, CIP 4, clathrin light chain (Clc), cofilin, coronin 1 B, cortactin, dynamin 1 / 2, endophilin 2, Eps 15, Eps 8, epsin 2, FBP 17, FCHo 1 / 2, GAK, Hip 1 R, lifeAct, mu 2 subunit of the AP 2 complex, myosin 1 E, myosin 6, NECAP, N-WASP, OCRL 1, Rab 5, SNX 9, synaptojanin 2 β 1, and syndapin 2. For each protein we aligned ∼ 1, 000 <b>recruitment</b> <b>profiles</b> to their respective scission events and constructed characteristic "recruitment signatures" that were grouped, as for yeast, to reveal the modular organization of mammalian CME. A detailed analysis revealed the unanticipated recruitment dynamics of SNX 9, FBP 17, and CIP 4 and showed that the same set of proteins was recruited, in the same order, to scission events at CCSs of different sizes and lifetimes. Collectively these data reveal the fine-grained temporal structure of CME and suggest a simplified canonical model of mammalian CME in which the same core mechanism of CME, involving actin, operates at CCSs of diverse sizes and lifetimes...|$|R

Until now limitations in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology {{did not permit}} discrimination of deoxy[Hb+Mb] between superficial and deep muscles. In humans, the deep quadriceps is more highly vascularized and oxidative than the superficial quadriceps. Using high-power time resolved NIRS, we tested the hypothesis that deoxygenation of the deep quadriceps would be less than in superficial muscle during incremental cycling exercise in eight males. Pulmonary V･ 26 o 2 was measured and muscle deoxy[Hb+Mb] was 27 determined in the superficial vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and rectus 28 femoris (RF-s), and the deep rectus femoris (RF-d). Deoxy[Hb+Mb] in RF-d was 29 significantly less than VL at 70 % (67. 2 ± 7. 0 vs. 75. 5 ± 10. 7 μM) and 80 % (71. 4 ± 11. 0 vs. 79. 0 ± 15. 4 μM) of peak work rate (WRpeak), but greater than VL and VM at WRpeak (87. 7 ± 32. 5 vs. 76. 6 ± 17. 5 and 75. 1 ± 19. 9 μM). RF-s was intermediate at WRpeak (82. 6 ± 18. 7 μM). Total[Hb+Mb] and tissue oxygen saturation were significantly greater in RF-d than RF-s throughout exercise.

40|$|The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a versatile, {{multifunctional}} zinc-finger protein {{involved in}} {{a broad spectrum of}} cellular functions. In mammalian cells, CTCF functions together with the Cohesin complex, an essential regulator of sister chromatid cohesion. Together, CTCF and Cohesin have been shown to regulate gene expression at a genome-wide level in mammalian cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces pombe, Cohesin has been implicated in transcription termination of convergently transcribed genes, in a cell cycle dependent manner. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the possibility of direct transcriptional involvement of CTCF and Cohesin in human cells. The first model system applied for this experimental purpose was the β-globin gene with introduced canonical CTCF-binding sites replacing the endogenous Co- Transcriptional Cleavage (CoTC) element downstream of β-globin. The results obtained indicate that recruitment of CTCF to the β-globin 3 ` flanking region does not prevent read-through transcription. However, CTCF-binding does mediate RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) pausing at the site of recruited CTCF. This results in more efficient pre-mRNA 3 ` end processing and therefore rescues β-globin mRNA to wild type levels. Cohesin was not detected at the introduced CTCF-binding sites. These results are a contribution {{to our understanding of the}} spatio-temporal requirements for cotranscriptional events like 3 ` end pre-mRNA processing and Pol II kinetics. The second part of my thesis presents an investigation on the involvement of CTCF and Cohesin in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) gene expression regulation in human monocytes and differentiated M 1 - and M 2 -type macrophages. These studies provide first evidence of Cohesin recruitment to the TNFα gene body and its regulatory NFκB-binding sites.

Electromyography (EMG) activities of the vastus medialis and lateralis were measured throughout each exercise bout. During MSE(30), muscle activity (root mean square) increased significantly (p ≤ 0. 04), with a significant leftward-shifted median frequency of the power density spectrum (MDF; p ≤ 0. 01), whereas MDF was significantly rightward-shifted during MSE(180) (p = 0. 02). The mean [Formula: see text]O(2) value was significantly higher in MSE(30) than in MSE(180) (p < 0. 001).

Although economic, social and political changes during the period covered by the various studies are not the main focus of the work here, the articles depict the effects of such changes on upper secondary education in particular. While upper secondary education was radically changed by the political reforms of the 1990 s, characterized by decentralisation and marketization, the analyses advanced in the studies indicate that its basic social structure remains stable. In one dimension, this structure opposes an “elite” pole having a particularly high social and scholastic recruitment to a “popular” pole with a correspondingly low <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile.</b> In a likewise durable second dimension, a “cultural” pole built up by schools and study programmes that are particularly popular among culturally strong social groups, opposes an “economic” pole favoured by social groups close to the economic and private sectors of society. The various papers reveal that the last opposition corresponds to both differences in life styles and deeply rooted convictions related to family and formal education among cultural and economic fractions of the upper-middle and middle classes. At this level, a belief in education as a development of the personality, with connected values such as individuality and originality, stands against a conviction that education is a rational investment in a future competitive career; as such, it is subject to calculated, measured risks. The existence of deeply rooted values among social groups with different structures of assets or capital also explains why schools –in the institutional strategies imposed on them by the school market– tend to express convictions (topoi) and symbolic values that correspond to those of their target groups. The various studies included in this thesis employ a combination of statistical approaches, mainly correspondence analysis, and qualitative ones such as: interviews, ethnographic observation and text analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} recruitment {{to the nursing}} education in Denmark from 1850 but with emphasis on the years 1988 - 2001 during which a major reform was conceived and implemented. Pursuant to that reform, in 2001 the nursing education was given {{the status of a}} Bachelor’s Degree Program in Nursing. The aim of the dissertation is to determine the effects – if any – of this development on the <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile</b> and on the objective position of the nursing education in the field of advanced education in Denmark and whether there are polarizations and/or regularities in young peoples’ approach to the nursing education homologous with socio-cultural constellations. The dissertation draws theoretical inspiration from sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, with emphasis on Bourdieu’s reproduction theory and praxeology. The empirical basis for the dissertation consists of formal documents defining the nursing education since the first law on authorized nurses was passed in 1933 until The Executive Order regarding the nursing education in 2001. These documents form the basis for an objectifying analysis of the institutional, structural and education policy conditions that historically formed the framework for the shaping and content of the nursing educations. The historical background contributes to a contextualization of the analyses carried out concerning changes in recruitment patterns and students’ social positioning since nursing was established as an occupation. The analysis of recruitment patterns builds mainly on a survey carried out in 2004 / 5 covering a class of students from five nursing schools in Denmark (a third of the total population). The dissertation shows that the 2000 / 2001 reform did not lead to a fundamental change in ranking in the academic hierarchy. Although social recruitment to the nursing profession moved “upward”, seen over a longer period, the analyses showed that the nursing education as a whole, also after the 2001 reform, mainly attracted young women from “lower” positions in the social space than those from which university students were recruited. The dissertation furthermore shows how students’ social background and acquired dispositions can generate a basic habitual orientation that may have a determining influence on the way they orient themselves in relation to the education and occupation...|$|E

40|$|Rationale: Tuberculosis {{remains to}} be a global health threat. The {{observed}} increase of MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases necessitates the development of novel antibiotic-independent therapeutic strategies. The current study aimed at elucidating the role and the therapeutic potential of the two neutral serine proteases cathepsin G (CG) and neutrophil elastase (NE) in the lung host defense against mycobacterial infections. Methods: CG deficient, CG/NE double deficient, and wild-type mice were infected with M. bovis BCG, and bacterial loads in BAL fluids and lung tissue as well as lung leukocyte <b>recruitment</b> <b>profiles,</b> lung histopathology and cytokine profiles were determined over time. In selected experiments, M. bovis BCG infected wild-type mice received repetitive intratracheal applications of liposomal encapsulated human CG and NE to evaluate the antimycobacterial efficacy of these serine proteases as novel therapeutic approach in vivo. Results: CG deficient mice {{and even more so}} CG/NE deficient mice responded with significantly impaired pathogen elimination to infection with M. bovis BCG, relative to wild-type mice. Moreover, granuloma formation was more pronounced in M. bovis BCG challenged CG/NE deficient mice compared to CG deficient and wild-type mice. Examination of professional phagocyte subsets revealed that exclusively neutrophils shuttled CG and NE into the bronchoalveolar space of M. bovis BCG infected mice. Accordingly, chimeric wild-type mice with a CG/NE deficient hematopoietic system displayed significantly increased lung bacterial loads in response to M. bovis BCG infection. Liposomal encapsulated human CG/NE instilled into the lungs of wild-type mice co-localized with mycobacteria in the same phagosomal compartment of alveolar macrophages, as assessed by laser scanning and electron microscopy. Such liposomal CG/NE therapy resulted in significantly reduced mycobacterial loads in the lungs of mice. Conclusion: The data show that neutrophils are the primary cellular shuttle transporting CG and NE into the lungs during the early phase of mycobacterial infections. Moreover, CG/NE critically contribute to the early mycobacterial pathogen elimination in the lungs of infected mice. In addition, we show {{for the first time that}} liposomal encapsulated CG and NE exhibit therapeutic potential against lung mycobacterial infections. These findings may be relevant for novel adjuvant approaches in the treatment of tuberculosis in humans...|$|R
40|$|The glucagon-like peptide- 1 {{receptor}} (GLP- 1 R) is {{an important}} regulator of insulin biosynthesis and secretion, {{and is one of}} the key therapeutic targets in the management of type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. Like most GPCRs, the GLP- 1 R is pleiotropically coupled, to physiologically relevant signalling pathways including cAMP formation, intracellular calcium (iCa 2 +) mobilization and phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (pERK 1 / 2). The GLP- 1 R is a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that has the ability to be activated by multiple endogenous ligands including four variants of GLP- 1 (the predominant form being GLP- 1 (7 - 36) NH 2) and oxyntomodulin. This receptor is also activated by the exogenous peptide exendin- 4 and allosteric ligands such as the Novo Nordisk Compound 2 and Eli Lily 4 -(3 -(benzyloxy) phenyl) - 2 -(ethylsulfinyl) - 6 -(trifluoromethyl) pyrimidine (BETP). These allosteric ligands also have unique properties compared to orthosteric exogenous ligands including the ability to alter the signalling of the GLP- 1 R in response to orthosteric ligands. These effects can be different depending on which orthosteric ligand is co bound to the receptor, a effect known as probe-dependence. This thesis identifies a novel case of probe dependence, the ability of allosteric ligands to modify the signalling mediated by metabolites of endogenous ligands that were previously considered to be ‘inert’ breakdown products that may open up new avenues for allosteric drug discovery. It is widely accepted that insulin secretion downstream of GLP- 1 R activation is critically dependent on cAMP formation, but recent evidence is also emerging for an essential role of regulatory proteins such as β-arrestins and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK). The canonical role of these regulatory proteins is to terminate GPCR signalling and promote receptor internalization. However, more recently, roles as scaffolding proteins that can regulate G protein-independent signalling have emerged. Consequently, the studies comprising this thesis illustrate distinct <b>recruitment</b> <b>profiles</b> of regulatory proteins to the GLP- 1 R in response to multiple endogenous and exogenous ligands. This thesis identifies differential actions of allosteric modulators on GLP- 1 R peptide ligands (‘probe dependence’), thus demonstrating differential responses of receptor signalling with respect to both orthosteric and allosteric ligands, highlighting the ability for both ligand- and pathway-specific effects (‘biased signalling’). Collectively, this work further demonstrates the potential benefits of biased signalling and allosteric modulation, but may also influence the approaches and precautions that must be considered in the design, identification and development of small molecules for therapeutic use...|$|R
40|$|A presente tese abordou o tema de potenciais biomarcadores em uma população altamente vulnerável – díades mães/bebês com história de exposição ao crack na gestação. Foram avaliados 57 bebês expostos e 99 não expostos, e as suas mães. No primeiro artigo, a ênfase foi à ativação inflamatória, onde se detectou um aumento da IL- 6 (perfil pró-inflamatório) nos expostos, mesmo mediante ajuste para confundidores (10. 208, 54 IC 95 % 1. 328, 54 – 19. 088, 55 vs. 2. 323, 03 IC 95 % 1. 484, 64 – 3. 161, 21; p= 0. 007). A IL- 10 (perfil antiinflamatório) também se mostrou elevada nos bebês expostos (432, 22 IC 95 % 51, 44 – 812, 88 vs. 75, 52 IC 95 % 5, 64 – 145, 39, p = 0. 014). A IL- 6 esteve aumentada nas mães expostas ao crack (25. 160, 05, IC 95 % 10. 958, 15 – 39. 361, 99 vs. 8. 902, 14 IC 95 % 5. 774, 97 – 12. 029, 32; p = 0. 007), sem alterações de IL- 10 entre as puérperas. Não houve correlação entre os níveis de citocina materna e do bebê (Spearman test; p ≥ 0. 28). Neste estudo, concluiu-se que IL- 6 e IL- 10 podem ser marcadores da ativação inflamatória precoce em bebês com exposição intrauterina ao crack. Nossos resultados corroboram com os achados da {{literatura}} indicando que as citocinas possam ser mediadores potenciais para explicar os efeitos comportamentais e cognitivos do estresse prénatal sobre o feto, integrando imunologia e a hipótese da neuroinflamação a saúde mental da criança. No segundo artigo, avaliou-se uma medida de estresse oxidativo (EO), o TBARS, e de Fator Neurotrófico Derivado do Cérebro (BDNF), nas referidas díades. Os resultados encontrados na análise multivariada do TBARS no sangue de cordão umbilical (SCU) apontam para um menor EO nos bebês expostos (63, 97 IC 95 % 39, 43 – 88, 50 em expostos vs 177, 04 IC 95 % 140, 93 – 213, 14 em não expostos, p 0. 28). In this study, it {{was concluded}} that IL- 6 and IL- 10 could be markers of early inflammatory activation on babies exposed to crack/cocaine. Our results support the findings of the literature indicating that the cytosine could be potential mediators to explain the behavior and cognitive effects of prenatal stress on the fetus, integrating immunology and the hypothesis of the neuroinflammation to the child’s mental health. In the second article, we assessed a measurement of oxidative stress, the TBARS and the BDNF in the referred dyads. The results found in the multivariate analysis of the TBARS in the umbilical chord’s blood (UCB) point to a less oxidative stress in the babies exposed to (63. 97, 95 %CI 39. 43 – 88. 50 in exposed vs. 177. 04, 95 %CI 140. 93 – 213. 14 non exposed, p < 0. 001). This is an innovative finding, pointing in the direction of an endogenous antioxidant activation system on the newly born exposed, {{on the basis of the}} homeostasis rupture caused by the crack toxicity during the pregnancy. The fetus would mobilize endogenous antioxidant routes since very early in its development, as promoted by Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript (CART). Still in this study, we can see the increase of the BDNF in the exposed babies (3. 86, 95 %CI 2. 29 – 5. 43 vs 0. 85, 95 %CI 0. 47 - 1. 23; p < 0. 001), but a decrease in the exposed pregnant women in relation to the non-exposed (4. 03, 95 %CI 2. 87 – 5. 18 vs. 6. 67, 95 %CI 5. 60 – 7. 74; p = 0. 006). The data of BDNF in babies exposed to crack are highly innovative, but consistent to the literature in the sense of a reaction of neuroplasticity. In pregnant women the data is surprising, having in mind that the adult literature indicates an increase of BDNF in crack/cocaine users in relation to controllers. A possibility to explain this finding is a possible variation in the practicality and intensity of usage of crack/cocaine from the test group. Alternatively the most prevalence post-traumatic stress (PTSD) in the crack pregnant users could justify this finding. Patients with PTSD tend to present levels of BDNF less than the normal controllers. This leads us to four possible biomarkers, in a population difficult to access and in a highly relevance to public health. We can tell that there are different answers according to the development stage and that the pregnant women could have a neurotrophins <b>recruitment</b> <b>profile</b> and perhaps other biomarkers, different to non pregnant. Therefore, we can observe that structural, physiological, molecular changes promoted by cocaine result from an involvement from a vast network of neurotransmitters integrated and active in different areas of the brain and in different moments of maturation...|$|E

Multiple-patriline colonies tended to have more inspectors than single-patriline colonies, their inspectors inspected their feeder at higher rates when it was empty, and then foraged at higher rates and performed more waggle runs when it was restocked, which quadrupled feeder <b>recruitment.</b> The patriline <b>profile</b> for a colony’s inspectors consistently differed from that of its general population.

40|$|The innate {{immune system}} is {{essential}} for host defense; it senses the presence of potentially pathogenic-invading microorganisms, and the contribution of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to this response is increasingly recognized. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of TLR 4 to the course of cutaneous leishmaniasis in vivo. We used C 57 BL/ 10 ScNCr (TLR 4 0 / 0) and C 57 BL/ 10 ScCr [TLR 4 /interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) Rβ 2 0 / 0] mice and compared the course of Leishmania major infection, parasite load, cell <b>recruitment,</b> and cytokine <b>profile</b> with those of wild-type C 57 BL/ 10 ScSn mice.

40|$|Nuclear {{receptor}} Nur 77 (NR 4 A 1, TR 3, or NGFI-B) {{has been}} shown to play an anti-inflammatory role in macrophages, which have a crucial function in defense against peritonitis. The function of Nur 77 in Escherichia coli-induced peritoneal sepsis has not yet been investigated. Wild-type and Nur 77 -knockout mice were inoculated with E. coli, and bacterial outgrowth, cell <b>recruitment,</b> cytokine <b>profiles,</b> and tissue damage were investigated. We found only a minor transient decrease in bacterial loads in lung and liver of Nur 77 -knockout compared to wild-type mice at 14 h postinfection, yet no changes were found in the peritoneal lavage fluid or blood. No differences in inflammatory cytokine levels or neutrophil/macrophage numbers were observed, and bacterial loads were equal in wild-type and Nur 77 -knockout mice at 20 h postinfection in all body compartments tested. Also, isolated peritoneal macrophages did not show any differences in cytokine expression patterns in response to E. coli. In endothelial cells, Nur 77 strongly downregulated both protein and mRNA expression of claudin- 5, VE-cadherin, occludin, ZO- 1, and β-catenin, and accordingly, these genes were upregulated in lungs of Nur 77 -deficient mice. Functional permeability tests pointed toward a strong role for Nur 77 in endothelial barrier function. Indeed, tissue damage in E. coli-induced peritonitis was notably modulated by Nur 77; liver necrosis and plasma aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) /alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) levels were lower in Nur 77 -knockout mice. These data suggest that Nur 77 does not {{play a role in the}} host response to E. coli in the peritoneal and blood compartments. However, Nur 77 does modulate bacterial influx into the organs via increased vascular permeability, thereby aggravating distant organ damag...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt Emotional {{intelligence}} {{describes an}} ability, capacity, skill, or self-perceived ability to identify, assess, {{and manage the}} emotions of one 2 ̆ 7 s self, of others, and of groups. The theory is enjoying considerable support in the literature and has had successful applications in many domains. The intelligence quotient, or IQ, is a score derived from one of several different standardized tests to measure intelligence. It {{has been used to}} assess giftedness, and sometimes underpin recruitment. Many have argued that IQ, or conventional intelligence, is too narrow: some people are academically brilliant yet socially and interpersonally inept. And we know that success does not automatically follow those who possess a high IQ rating. Wider areas of intelligence enable or dictate how successful we are. Toughness, determination, and vision help. But emotional intelligence, often measured as an emotional intelligence quotient, or EQ, is more and more relevant to important work-related outcomes such as individual performance, organizational productivity, and developing people because its principles provide a new way to understand and assess the behaviors, management styles, attitudes, interpersonal skills, and potential of people.
