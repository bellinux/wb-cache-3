The {{components}} {{structure and}} principle of <b>ring</b> <b>ball</b> gratings sensor is put {{forward for the}} present state that there still has not a better method to detect torque under the extreme environment in domestic. According to the localization property in time and frequency domains and the translation invariant property, the preprocessed signal of sensor is decomposed with multi resolution, and the signal is reconstructed with wavelet under the intervention of neural network. The wavelet neural networks (WNN) model is constructed and the algorithm routine is realized in laboratory virtual instrument engineering workbench (LabVIEW). With the testing device, the demodulation experiments are carried out for the corresponding sensor signals when the shaft is continuous rotated along the same direction, rotated along the alternate direction and knocked.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{rheological}} properties of asphaltite-modified bituminous binders. The natural asphaltite, employed to modify a petroleum-derived-bitumen, is mined in Albania. At a first time, penetration,ring ball temperature and rheological properties of both asphaltite and pure petroleum bitumen are determined. Then, the petroleum bitumen is mixed with 5, 10 and 15 % of natural bitumen and the penetration and <b>ring</b> <b>ball</b> temperature of the blends are assessed. In addition to this, rheological tests are performed on the 10 % blend. The rheological experimental tests are carried out {{by means of a}} visco-analyzer METRAVIB under annular shearing and tension-compression loadings. Based on the experimental results and assuming that the material follows the time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP), master curves of complex modulus and of phase angle are constructed. The results show that the modified bitumens get stiffer and behave more elastically with the modification rate. This evolution is explained by the physicochemical composition of the asphaltite which presents high asphaltene agglomerates content. These improved characteristics are interesting for binders’ behavior at high temperature conditions in pavement applications. The experimental data are modeled by means of a simple blending law. In addition to this, some efforts are done to model the blend’s behavior by the Palierne’s model developed for emulsions of viscoelastic phases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{tractors}} {{for agricultural}} works showed {{an important role}} to mechanized agricultural sector. A repairable mechanical system (as agricultural tractor) is subject to deterioration or repeated failure. In this study, the regression model was used to predict the failure rate of MF 399 tractor. The machine failure pattern was carefully studied and key factors affecting the failure rate were identified in five regions of Khouzestan province. The tractors grouped in four sub groups according to annual use hours and maintenance policies (corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance). Results showed that the majority of recorded failures were observed in the electrical system (20. 3 %) for each machine sub-group. Maximum and minimum annual repair and maintenance costs were related to other (tire, <b>ring,</b> <b>ball</b> bearing and operator seat) and brake system respectively. According to the results of the research, different annual use hours and maintenance policies affected failure rate. The tractors included in 300 - 1, 000 PM subgroup were mostly in the useful life period while the machines were towards the wearing out period of machine life for 300 - 1, 000 CM subgroup. The tractors maintained under 1, 200 - 2, 000 PM subgroup showed an obvious indication of wear-out period entrance, while the tractors were mostly in the wear-out period for the 1, 200 - 2, 000 CM sub group. The tractors included in 300 - 1, 000 annual use hours were commonly in a randomized breakdown period during their useful life but these tractors tend to enter the wear out period in the 1, 200 - 2, 000 annual use hours...|$|E
40|$|A lagrangian {{formulation}} {{is presented}} {{for the total}} dynamic stiffness and damping matrices of a rigid rotor carrying noncentral rigid disk and supported on angular contact ball bearings (ACBBs). The bearing dynamic stiffness/damping marix is derived {{in terms of the}} bearing motions (displacements/rotations) and then the principal of virtual work is used to transfer it from the bearing location to the rotor mass center to obtain the total dynamic stiffness/damping matrix. The bearing analyses take into account the bearing nonlinearities, cage rotation and bearing axial preload. The coefficients of these time-dependent matrices are presented analytically. The equations of motion of a rigid rotor-ACBBs assembly are derived using Lagrange's equation. The proposed analyses on deriving the bearing stiffness matrix are verified against existing bearing analyses of SKF researchers that, in turn, were verified using both SKF softwares/experiments and we obtained typical agreements. The presented total stiffness matrix is applied to a typical grinding machine spindle studied experimentally by other researchers and excellent agreements are obtained between our analytical eigenvalues and the experimental ones. The effect of using the total full stiffness matrix versus using the total diagonal stiffness matrix on the natural frequencies and dynamic response of the rigid rotor-bearings system is studied. It is found that using the diagonal matrix affects natural frequencies values (except the axial frequency) and response amplitudes and pattern and causes important vibration tones to be missig from the response spectrum. Therefore it is recommended to use the full total stiffness matrix and not the diagonal matrix in the design/vibration analysis of these rotating machines. For a machine spindle-ACBBs assembly under mass unbalnce and a horizontal force at the spindle cutting nose when the bearing time-varying stiffness matrix (bearing cage rotation is considered) is used, the peak-to-valley variation in time domain of the stiffness matrix elements becomes significant compared to its counterpart when the bearing standard stiffness matrix (bearing cage rotation is neglected) is used. The vibration spectrum of the time-varying matrix case is marked by tones at bearing outer <b>ring</b> <b>ball</b> passing frequency, rotating unbalnce frequency and combination compared to spectrum of the standard stiffness matrix case which is marked by only the rotating unbalnce frequency. Therfore, it is highly recomended to model bearing stiffness matrix to be a time-dependent...|$|E
40|$|Lidar {{remote sensing}} {{instruments}} {{can make a}} significant contribution to satisfying many of the required measurements of atmospheric and surface parameters for future spaceborne platforms, including topographic altimeters, atmospheric profiles of, wind, humidity, temperature, trace molecules, aerosols, and clouds. It is highly desirable to have wide measurement swaths for rapid coverage rather than just the narrow ribbon of data that is obtained with a nadir only observation. For most applications global coverage is required, and for wind measurements scanning or pointing is required in order to retrieve the full 3 -D wind vector from multiple line-of-sight Doppler measurements. Conventional lidar receivers make up {{a substantial portion of the}} instrument's size and weight. Wide angle scanning typically requires a large scanning mirror in front of the receiver telescope, or pointing the entire telescope and aft optics assembly, Either of these methods entails the use of large bearings, motors, gearing and their associated electronics. Spaceborne instruments also need reaction wheels to counter the torque applied to the spacecraft by these motions. NASA has developed simplified conical scanning telescopes using Holographic Optical Elements (HOEs) to reduce the size, mass, angular momentum, and cost of scanning lidar systems. NASA has developed two operating lidar systems based on 40 cm diameter HOEs. The first such system, named Prototype Holographic Atmospheric Scanner for Environmental Remote Sensing (PHASERS) was a joint development between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the University of Maryland College Park. PHASERS is based on a reflection HOE for use at the doubled Nd:YAG laser wavelength of 532 nm and has recently undergone a number of design changes in a collaborative effort between GSFC and Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. The next step was to develop IR transmission HOEs for use with the Nd:YAG fundamental in the Holographic Airborne Rotating Lidar Instrument Experiment (HARLIE). The HOE spins like a compact disk in a large <b>ring</b> <b>ball</b> bearing. In an aircraft the HOE faces down, looking out through a window at an angle of 45 degrees off-nadir. The HOE diffracts 85 % of the incident 532 nm light into a 160 micron spot at a focal length of 1 meter. HARLIE is a field deployable lidar measuring aerosol, cloud, and boundary layer backscatter for atmospheric research. It has flown several times and is also used from a ground-based trailer in an upward-looking mode. The HOE generates a 45 degree conical scan pattern by rotating at speeds up to 30 rpm. Like PHASERS, the HOE in HARLIE serves both as the laser collimating lens as well as the receiver telescope primary optic. The telescope is coupled to the receiver package via fiber optic. The transmitter is a diode pumped Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, delivering 1 mJ pulses at a 5 KHz rep-rate. The receiver has a 200 microradian field-of-view and a 0. 5 nm optical bandpass. The photon counting data system utilizes a single Geiger-mode silicon avalanche photodiode detector, This new technology has also presented us with new data visualization challenges as well as new measurement techniques. The backscatter data obtained from a stationary (i. e. ground-based) scanning HOE lidar is on the surface of a cone, which when viewed over many consecutive scans can reveal atmospheric motions on this surface over time as the atmosphere advects over the site. In a moving platform such as an airplane or satellite, the data from consecutive scans cover different areas under the flight path, revealing atmospheric structure in 3 -dimensions. An example of a visualization of HARLIE ground-based data is presented, showing aerosol backscatter on a 90 degree conical surface generated from one 360 degree scan of the lidar during the HOLO- 1 field campaign on the afternoon of 10 March 1999. Higher backscatter levels are rendered as lighter signal against a dark background. Breaking Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are evident on the north side of the scan at an altitude of 10 - 11 km. Time series of successive scans made at regular intervals render unique views of atmospheric motions, from which vertical profiles of atmospheric wind vectors can be obtained using a unique data analysis approach. Wind vectors obtained from the lidar were compared with co-located radiosonde wind profiles during an intensive operating period in September-October 2000 at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's Southern Great Plains Central Facility...|$|E
