500|$|Snow was {{designed}} by Nao Ikeda and Tetsuya Nomura. He {{was designed}} around a motif of ice, with his bandanna inspired by an unused costume element from Kingdom Hearts coded designed by Kamikokuryo. For XIII-2, the bandanna was removed and {{he was given a}} new hairstyle. Originally to have been called [...] "Storm", the development team nicknamed the character [...] "Mr. 33 cm" [...] in reference to his shoe size while his name was still a secret. Nomura designed his darker look in Lightning Returns. Snow's personality in XIII, which carried over to XIII-2, was created to be passionate, optimistic and impulsive, opposing and acting as a foil for Lightning's cold mannerisms. He has also been described in interviews as the [...] "tough guy" [...] type, and not having a jealous side to him. He was originally to have been a more negative delinquent athletic type, but this was changed to his [...] "big brother" [...] persona. Concerning his stance in Lightning Returns, Kitase described Snow as [...] "struggling with all his might to keep himself from falling apart from the sadness of losing Serah." [...] His design was intended to <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of the world, as he had changed from his lighthearted former self because of the world's fate. His darker portrayal was emulated by his weapon in the opening cinematic. Watanabe enjoyed writing the character's story, as he was able to give Snow scenes where he appeared [...] "cool", rather than taking on a [...] "thankless" [...] roles. VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole called his relationship with Lightning and Hope, and the way he coped with Serah's fate, {{one of the most interesting}} aspects of the original game. Aside from his appearance in the XIII games, the character was featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XIII, and his outfit from that game was featured as an optional character costume in [...] along with Lightning's Guardian Corps uniform. Snow is voiced by Troy Baker in English and by Daisuke Ono in Japanese.|$|E
