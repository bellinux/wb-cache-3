5|$|The car {{appeared}} in the early 20th century to be pulled by horse again in the dirty thirties. In 1906, cars could be registered, and plates were issued as early as 1912. In the late 1920s the <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> gravelled near the larger centers such as Yorkton, Saskatoon, the Battlefords, and Lloydminster. All-weather <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> developed in the 1930s, which began to depart from the surveyed township roads connecting centres directly. Roads also were constructed to allow for rain run-off, with a rounded top surface.|$|E
5|$|The <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> just prairie trails which {{wound around}} bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravelâ€”Les Moffatt.|$|E
5|$|The state's <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> in poor {{condition}} when Combs became governor. The Automotive Safety Foundation {{found that}} two-thirds of Kentucky's federal <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> below standards for existing traffic demands. It further found that {{twenty percent of the}} state's major city streets were inadequate, that another fifty-five percent would soon be inadequate due to increasing traffic, and that half of the state's secondary <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> unfit for modern industrial traffic. To address these problems, Combs issued $100million in bonds to increase funding for highways, appointing Earle Clements as state highway commissioner to oversee the correction of the road issues. One of the new roads, the Mountain Parkway, which connected Combs' native Eastern Kentucky to Central Kentucky, was later renamed the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway in Combs' honor. Because of generous funding in Combs' budget, Kentucky finished its portions of the Interstate Highway System much sooner than surrounding states such as Virginia and Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|Alpha dumped torrential rain on {{the island}} of Hispaniola, making it the eighth wettest storm to impact poverty-stricken Haiti. It caused 26deaths, 17 of them in Haiti and all of them caused by floods and rain-related landslides. <b>Roads</b> <b>were</b> blocked for weeks and {{hundreds}} of houses were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|High {{winds and}} heavy rains {{from the storm}} caused {{moderate}} damage to structures and vessels throughout Acapulco, Mexico.

5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, the route was {{improved}} west to Highway10 (Hurontario Street). This work was completed in early 1956. Service <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> installed and 13 intersections eliminated, resulting in a 50% reduction of the accident rate along that section.|$|E
5|$|Resident Office {{moved from}} Marudi to Miri in 1912. Miri grew {{as fast as}} the rate of oil {{production}} by the Shell company. In 1920, <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> built in Miri. Bicycles and motorcycles were also bought into the town. By 1921, there were 40 shop houses in Miri, with one English school and one Chinese school. Motor cars were later introduced to the town. In 1924, Pujut Road was built to link Miri with Lutong. By 1925, rotary drilling was introduced. Oil production continued to increase until it reached a peak of 15,211 barrels per day in 1929. Water supply were improved, jungles were cleared, and more <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> built. Miri became the administrative centre of the entire Baram region in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Some highway {{construction}} ensued as a make work {{project of}} the thirties. A work and wages program provided assistance to farmers during the depression years of the Dirty Thirties. The municipality received improved roads under this program wherein many RM <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> gravelled.|$|E
5|$|The advent motor {{vehicles}} created {{a demand for}} better use of highways. Roads evolved into two way roads, expressways, freeways and tollways during the modern times. Existing <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> developed and highways were designed according to intended use.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{passed to}} the south of most of the Greater Antilles, though its outer rain bands crossed many of the islands, and {{delivered}} hurricane force winds to Jamaica. Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands were mostly spared, though Hurricane Dean passed 50 to 60mi (80 to 95km) south of Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane. In Jamaica the rain caused flooding on {{the eastern side of the}} island and landslides on the northeast end. At least two direct deaths were confirmed. Over 1,500 roofs were lost, primarily to the hurricane force winds, and 1,582 of the 3,127 damaged homes were uninhabitable. Landslides and fallen trees blocked hundreds of roads, particularly in the rural northeast region. As in the Lesser Antilles, Jamaica suffered severe damage to its agricultural sector. Forty percent of the sugarcane crop, 80 to 100% of the banana crop, 75% of the coffee trees under three years old, and 20% of the top layer of the cocoa crop were lost. Hurricane Dean affected 248 roads, including 186 that were blocked: 10 were blocked in the Kingston metropolitan region, 14 sections were blocked in St. Andrew, 43 <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> blocked in St. Catherine, eight <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> blocked in the Western Region (Saint James, Hanover, Westmoreland, and Trelawny), and 110 <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> blocked in the Northeast region.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the park}} by {{tourists}} improved {{in the early years}} of the park, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable. Tourism significantly increased after the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, but the long horseback ride to reach the area was a deterrent. Three stagecoach <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> built in the mid-1870s to provide better access for the growing number of visitors to Yosemite Valley.|$|E

During the implementation of these programs, the administration buildings of the College of Agriculture and the College of Development Communication as well as staff houses and <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> built.|$|E

5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It was a place of great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
5|$|Because of the colder climate, ectothermic {{reptiles}} {{are all but}} absent, {{with two}} species of garter snake and the western painted turtle being the only three reptile species proven to exist. Similarly, only six species of amphibians are documented, although those species exist in large numbers. After a forest fire in 2001, a few park <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> temporarily closed the following year to allow thousands of western toads to migrate to other areas.|$|E
5|$|Before Michigan {{became a}} state, the first land {{transportation}} corridors were the Indian trails. The French-Indian Trail ran through southeastern Michigan between Toledo, Monroe and Detroit. The Saginaw Trail ran north from Detroit to the Saginaw area where it {{connected with the}} original Mackinaw Trail that ran roughly parallel to, and west of, the modern I-75. Another path, the Cheboygan Trail, ran parallel to the modern freeway to the east between the West Branch area and Cheboygan. In the UP, {{an extension of the}} Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie. In the 19th century, the Michigan Legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in the state, many of which replaced the original Indian trails. These <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well. By {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, only 23 of the 202chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century.|$|E
