500|$|For short <b>range</b> <b>use</b> against personnel, {{canister}} and {{the smaller}} naval grapeshot were popular during the 19th century; it comprised smaller iron or lead pellets contained within a case or bag, which scattered on explosion. In 1784, Lt Henry Shrapnel invented a spherical case-shot, which was later named after him. [...] The case was a hollow iron sphere which was filled with musket balls and was detonated by a gunpowder charge. [...] Shot fired from cannon could be so hot that it scorched or set fire to materials that it brushed.|$|E

However, the AMC's 2004 Massachusetts Trail Guide uses [...] "Mt. Holyoke Range" [...] and the United States Board on Geographic Names now uses [...] "Mount Holyoke Range".)
