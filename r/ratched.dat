500|$|The episode {{marked the}} debut of Philip Anglim as Vedek Bareil and Louise Fletcher as Vedek Winn. Bareil and Winn became {{recurring}} characters {{throughout the rest of}} the series. Fletcher, best known for playing the role of Nurse <b>Ratched</b> in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role in recognition of her work. She did not have to read for the role of Vedek Winn, nor was she familiar with the Star Trek series or its heritage before accepting the role. Robin Christopher makes her appearance in this episode for the second and last time as Neela, first appearing in the previous episode, [...] "Duet".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Lansbury {{declined}} several cinematic roles, including {{the lead in}} The Killing of Sister George {{and the role of}} Nurse <b>Ratched</b> in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Instead, she accepted the role of the Countess von Ornstein, an aging German aristocrat who {{falls in love with a}} younger man, in Something for Everyone (1970), for which she filmed on location in Hohenschwangen, Bavaria. That same year she appeared as the middle-aged English witch Eglentine Price in the Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks; this was her first lead in a screen musical, and led to her publicising the film on television programmes like the David Frost Show. She later noted that as a big commercial hit, this film [...] "secured an enormous audience for me".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for the A.V. Club, noting that while the episode wasn't subtle, it did [...] "a good job expanding the show's world, and playing off of undercurrents and themes which have been built in throughout DS9 first season." [...] He described Winn as the [...] "most unsettling of enemies, a true believer whose faith doesn't prevent her from manipulation and deceit". [...] Handlen described the character of Vedek Winn as [...] "terrific". In her analysis of the episode, Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation said she thought the episode was [...] "pretty fantastic" [...] when she originally watched it. Upon re-watching it years later, she thought it had improved even further. Green described the episode as [...] "a no-holds-barred story about the hypocrisy of religious leaders which seems less influenced by the Scopes Trial than by contemporary creationist politicians." [...] She described Fletcher as one of her favourite actresses and thought that she portrayed Vedek Winn as the older sister of Nurse <b>Ratched</b> from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.|$|E

5000|$|In the novel's climax, McMurphy sneaks two prostitutes {{into the}} ward to take Billy's virginity, {{while he and}} the others throw a party. <b>Ratched</b> catches them and threatens to tell Billy's mother—the only woman he fears more than her—which terrifies him so much that he commits suicide by {{slitting}} his throat. Enraged, McMurphy attacks <b>Ratched</b> and nearly strangles her, but is knocked unconscious by one of her associates. For this, <b>Ratched</b> has McMurphy lobotomized, which is {{to be seen as a}} kind of castration: [...] "If she <b>Ratched</b> can’t cut below the belt she’ll do it above the eyes" [...] (Kesey 108).

50|$|McMurphy’s {{domination}} of <b>Ratched</b> {{is described as}} a heroic sacrifice, for the redemption and freedom of the men of the ward.

50|$|One night, after bribing {{the night}} orderly, McMurphy smuggles two prostitute girlfriends with liquor onto the ward and breaks into the {{pharmacy}} for codeine cough syrup, and later unnamed psychiatric medications. McMurphy persuades {{one of the}} women to seduce Billy Bibbit, a timid, boyish patient with a terrible stutter and little experience with women, so he can lose his virginity. Although McMurphy plans to escape before the morning shift starts, he and the other patients instead fall asleep without cleaning up the mess of the group’s antics, and the morning staff discovers the ward in complete disarray. Nurse <b>Ratched</b> finds Billy and the prostitute in each other's arms, partially dressed, and admonishes him. Billy asserts himself for the first time, answering Nurse <b>Ratched</b> without stuttering. <b>Ratched</b> calmly threatens to tell Billy's mother what she has seen. Billy has an emotional breakdown, and once left alone in the doctor's office, commits suicide by cutting his throat. Nurse <b>Ratched</b> blames McMurphy for the loss of Billy's life.

McMurphy is physically restrained and moved to the Disturbed ward.|$|E
50|$|Rache , also spelled racch, rach, and <b>ratch,</b> from Old English ræcc, {{linked to}} Old Norse rakkí, is an {{obsolete}} {{name for a}} type of hunting-dog used in Britain in the Middle Ages. It was a scent hound used in a pack to run down and kill game, or bring it to bay. The word appears before the Norman Conquest. It was sometimes confused with 'brache', (also 'bratchet') which is a French derived word for a female scent-hound.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the supply}} and take-up spools of the {{recording}} tape were no longer individually powered as in the UNITYPER 1, a mechanical solution consisting of a differential spring, <b>ratching</b> escapement and slip clutches was developed to overcome the problem of [...] "differential moment" [...] of accurately moving tape across the head. This was necessary because the supply reel is always decreasing in effective diameter while the take up reel is increasing in effective diameter as the tape moves from one reel to the other during encoding, and again when backspacing or rewinding.|$|R
50|$|However, {{similar to}} the MRT Pink Line, delays in {{finalising}} the technical requirements of the tender {{in relation to the}} selection of monorail rolling stock which will determine the type of track to be constructed resulted in further delay. The subsequent political turmoil of late 2013 and early 2014 caused even more delay. Thereafter, the coup of May 2014 resulted in a new military administration and the tender being deferred for 2014. The MRTA tender was subsequently not released until mid-2016. In early December 2016, BSR Joint Venture (comprising BTS Group Holdings which owns 75%, Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction - STEC, and Ratchaburi Electricity Generation Holding - <b>RATCH),</b> won the bid for the project.

5000|$|Nurse <b>Ratched</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "Big Nurse") is a fictional {{character}} and the main antagonist of Ken Kesey's 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, {{as well as the}} 1975 film. A cold, heartless tyrant, Nurse <b>Ratched</b> has become the stereotype of the nurse as a battleaxe. She has also become a popular metaphor for the corrupting influence of power and authority in bureaucracies such as the mental institution in which the novel is set.|$|E
50|$|The battleaxe is one {{of several}} {{stereotypes}} found in nursing - a tyrannical, fierce matron exemplified by Nurse <b>Ratched</b> or Hattie Jacques in popular medical dramas and comedies.|$|E
50|$|By 1970, {{the village}} {{numbered}} 3,141 people. The village offices couldn't be crammed into Linden Plaza any longer, {{and the new}} village hall that was built in 1974 housed office space, the mayor, the police department, the building inspector, and the village garage. By 1980, the village population had swelled to 6,220. After building an estimated 2,000 homes, Mort Engle sold his remaining 250 acre to the U.S. Home Corporation and 200 acre to the Federal Life Insurance Company and moved to Arizona. Robert <b>Ratch</b> was elected mayor in 1983. Besides the village's 25th anniversary, the 1980s brought the village its first stoplight at Grand Avenue and Sand Lake Road, cable TV access, fast food, and a budget of $1.5 million. Lindenfest was founded by volunteers in 1983. It grew out of tents and booths set up by local clubs and organizations in the village hall parking lot. Today it boasts a carnival, games, contests, marathons, and music. Other additions to Lindenhurst in recent years include Victory Lakes, the Lindenhurst-Lake Villa Chamber of Commerce, and the Lindenhurst Park District.|$|R

In this case, it was possible to confirm that deformation-induced martensitic transformation does not have any effect upon the PC behavior of metastable austenitic stainless steels.
