Moffat also thought that, at the point {{in the middle of the}} series, it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if that would <b>really</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the Ark {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the ark, since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the ark within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already {{told him about the}} original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the ark, and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The ark reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did <b>really</b> <b>happen.</b> Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E

[...] Through TV footage {{we see that the}} explosion was covered-up by Umbrella and explained as an explosion at the nuclear plant.

Alice wakes up in an Umbrella research facility and escapes with help from Carlos, Jill, L.J., and Angela.

500|$|Several {{films have}} focused on the raid, while also {{including}} archival footage of the POWs. Edward Dmytryk's 1945 film Back to Bataan, starring John Wayne, opens by retelling the story of the raid on the Cabanatuan POW camp-with real life film of the POW survivors. Based on the books The Great Raid on Cabanatuan and Ghost Soldiers, the 2005 John Dahl film The Great Raid focused on the raid intertwined with a love story. [...] Prince served as a consultant on the film, and believed it depicted the raid accurately. Marty Katz conveyed his interest in producing the film: [...] "This [...] was a massive operation that had very little chance of success. It's like a Hollywood movie—it couldn't <b>really</b> <b>happen,</b> but it did. That was why we were attracted to the material." [...] Another cover of the raid aired in December 2006 as an episode of the documentary series Shootout!.|$|E

Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will <b>really</b> <b>happen</b> is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{was very}} pleased with the episode, stating that it was [...] "a very good and well-acted episode. I like it because it {{actually}} seemed too real to me. It played less as a paranormal science fiction show than as whether or not something could <b>really</b> <b>happen.</b> The entire cast was wonderful. Overall that was a terrific episode". In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Lazarus" [...] was rated a C+, being described as [...] "as exciting as Scully's taste in men (not very)". The episode's supporting cast, however, was described as [...] "solid". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated episode a B-, finding that it had [...] "no real thematic resonance". He found that the episode left its premise [...] "largely unexplored", and would have benefited from a stronger focus on the relationship between the characters of Willis and Dupre. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode negatively, feeling that it [...] "wasn't up to much", and that it [...] "plays more like an episode of [...] than anything else". However, the exploration of Scully's character history was cited as a positive aspect of the episode. Anna Johns, writing for TV Squad, was critical of [...] "Lazarus", stating that its opening scene was [...] "the only good part" [...] of the episode.|$|E
500|$|In {{a lengthy}} article about Vazaleen in Toronto Life, critic R. M. Vaughan wrote, [...] "In its lewd, spontaneous, hysterical and glamorous way, Vazaleen defined a new Toronto aesthetic, a playful and {{endlessly}} inventive mode of presentation that encompassed everything from lesbian prog- rock to tranny camp to vintage punk revival to good old-fashioned loud-mouthed drag." [...] In {{an editorial in}} C magazine, Amish Morrell wrote, [...] "At [...] {{it was not only}} okay to be gay, but it was okay to be other than gay. One could be just about anything. The effect was that it completely destabilized all preconceptions of gender and sexual identity, in a hyperlibidinous environment where everyone became a performer." [...] Benjamin Boles of Now wrote, [...] "These days it’s normal in Toronto for hip gay scenes to flourish outside of the queer ghetto and to attract a wide spectrum of genders and orientations, but that didn’t <b>really</b> <b>happen</b> until Vazaleen took off and became a veritable community for everyone who didn’t fit into the mainstream homo world. For too long, it was too rare to see dykes, fags, trans people, and breeders hanging out together, and Munro changed that." [...] Vazaleen became a launching pad for such musical acts as Peaches and Lesbians on Ecstasy. Other bands performing at Vazaleen early in their careers were The Hidden Cameras, Crystal Castles, and The Gossip. At the height of the event's popularity, Munro appeared on the cover of Now magazine (made up to look similar to David Bowie's Aladdin Sane album cover), musical guests included Carole Pope, Tracy + the Plastics, Vaginal Davis, Glen Meadmore and Nina Hagen, and Vazaleen appeared on [...] "best-of" [...] nightclub lists internationally.|$|E

2500|$|Giorgi Arveladze, the General Director of Imedi TV, {{stated that}} the purpose of the program was to {{demonstrate}} to Georgians the external threats that they were faced with, saying, [...] "The really unpleasant thing about yesterday's report— and I want everyone to understand this well— is that this report is as close to reality as possible, to what may <b>really</b> <b>happen,</b> and to what Georgia's enemies keep in mind". Arveladze apologised for the panic which the broadcast caused in Georgia, but defended the report, and dismissed calls for him to resign. Whilst Arveladze refused to be drawn into questions on whether the broadcast breached the code of conduct for broadcasters, the Georgian National Communications Commission and the Young Lawyers' Association of Georgia said that Imedi had violated the code with its broadcast. The Imedi chief was also forced to defend against allegations that top officials in the Georgian government, including Saakashvili, were informed about the programme before it went to air. After a finding by the GNMC that the broadcast violated the broadcaster's code of conduct, the broadcaster was directed to make a public apology.|$|E

2500|$|According to James Gunn, one of Wells's major {{contributions}} to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his [...] "new system of ideas". In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could <b>really</b> <b>happen,</b> today referred to as [...] "the plausible impossible" [...] and [...] "suspension of disbelief". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived {{the idea of using}} a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term [...] "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle. He explained that while writing The Time Machine, he realized that [...] "the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the Time Traveller were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts." [...] In [...] "Wells's Law", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the [...] "law" [...] appears in his introduction to The Scientific Romances of H.G. Wells (1933), ...|$|E
