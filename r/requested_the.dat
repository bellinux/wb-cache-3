If the CKB cannot identify the object either, it returns <b>the</b> <b>request</b> to <b>the</b> GKB. The GKB then checks whether the object has been previously identified in its dataset. If not, it determines the class membership for the object using B-kNN and sends the adaptation plan associated with the class to <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> CKB which forwards the response to <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> SAU.
