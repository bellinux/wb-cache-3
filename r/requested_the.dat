If the CKB cannot identify the object either, it returns <b>the</b> <b>request</b> to <b>the</b> GKB. The GKB then checks whether the object has been previously identified in its dataset. If not, it determines the class membership for the object using B-kNN and sends the adaptation plan associated with the class to <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> CKB which forwards the response to <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> SAU. If <b>the</b> GKB determines the environment type {{to be the same}} as the type of <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> CKB and <b>the</b> object is known to the GKB, the GKB sends the class membership and its associated adaptation plan to <b>the</b> <b>requesting</b> CKB.|$|R
