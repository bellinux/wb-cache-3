50|$|In {{larger and}} more modern engines, a <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> transmits the torque of the drive shaft to the propeller's hub. Under a {{damaging}} load the friction of the bushing in the hub is overcome and the rotating propeller slips on the shaft, preventing overloading of the engine's components. After such an event the <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> may be damaged. If so, it may continue to transmit reduced power at low revolutions, but may provide no power, due to reduced friction, at high revolutions. Also, the <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> may perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed failure load.|$|E
50|$|A bushing or <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> {{is a type}} of {{vibration}} isolator. It {{provides an}} interface between two parts, damping the energy transmitted through the bushing. A common application is in vehicle suspension systems, where a bushing made of rubber (or, more often, synthetic rubber or polyurethane) separates the faces of two metal objects while allowing a certain amount of movement. This movement allows the suspension parts to move freely, for example, when traveling over a large bump, while minimizing transmission of noise and small vibrations through to the chassis of the vehicle. A <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> may also be described as a flexible mounting or antivibration mounting.|$|E
50|$|Both metal {{springs and}} <b>rubber</b> <b>bushes</b> {{can be used}} to provide suspension. Metal springs are more robust and longer wearing, but <b>rubber</b> <b>bushes</b> provide damping in {{addition}} to a spring action.|$|R
5000|$|The {{innovative}} {{new design}} isolastic frame made it smoother {{through the use}} of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushes</b> to isolate the engine and swingarm from the frame, forks, and rider. As the <b>rubber</b> <b>bushes</b> deteriorated, however, the bike became prone to fishtailing in high-speed turns. Earlier models therefore required careful maintenance and adjustment of the clearance between frame and mounts using shims.|$|R
5000|$|Suspension {{consists}} of 4 semi-elliptic springs on <b>rubber</b> <b>bushes</b> damped by Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers. Cars after 1931 replaced the <b>rubber</b> <b>bushes</b> with bronze bushes and grease nipples. Wheels {{were of the}} Magnum type with 5 studs fitted with 4.50×19-inch pneumatic tyres. The car had a track of 3 ft [...] in and a wheelbase of 7 ft 8 in.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{each arm}} has a spherical joint (ball joint) or <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> at each end. Consequently, they react to loads along their own length, in tension and compression, {{but not in}} bending. Some multi-links do use a {{trailing}} arm or wishbone, which has two bushings at one end.|$|E
50|$|The inboard (chassis) end of {{a control}} arm is {{attached}} by a single pivot, usually a <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing.</b> It can thus control {{the position of the}} outboard end in only a single degree of freedom, maintaining the radial distance from the inboard mount. Although not deliberately free to move, the single bushing does not control the arm from moving back and forth; this motion is constrained by a separate link or radius rod.|$|E
50|$|In some modern propellers, a hard polymer insert {{called a}} drive sleeve replaces the <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing.</b> The splined or other non-circular {{cross section of}} the sleeve {{inserted}} between the shaft and propeller hub transmits the engine torque to the propeller, rather than friction. The polymer is weaker than the components of the propeller and engine so it fails before they do when the propeller is overloaded. This fails completely under excessive load, but can easily be replaced.|$|E

The simulation data and the experimental data can be seen to agree very closely. This fully proves the reliability of the simulation model.

50|$|This is {{modified}} form of {{the protected}} type flange coupling. This type of coupling has pins and it works with coupling bolts. The rubber or leather bushes are used over the pins. The coupling has two halves dissimilar in construction. The pins are rigidly fastened by nuts {{to one of the}} flange and kept loose on the other flange. This coupling is used to connect shafts which having a small parallel misalignment, angular misalignment or axial misalignment. In this coupling the <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> absorbs shocks and vibration during its operations. This type of coupling is mostly used to couple electric motors and machines.|$|E
5000|$|Whether a <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> can be {{replaced}} or repaired depends upon the propeller; some cannot. Some can, but need special equipment to insert the oversized bushing for an interference fit. Others can {{be replaced}} easily. The [...] "special equipment" [...] usually consists of a funnel, a press and rubber lubricant (soap). If {{one does not have}} access to a lathe, an improvised funnel can be made from steel tube and car body filler; as the filler is only subject to compressive forces it is able to do a good job. Often, the bushing can be drawn into place with nothing more complex than a couple of nuts, washers and a threaded rod. A more serious problem with this type of propeller is a [...] "frozen-on" [...] spline bushing, which makes propeller removal impossible. In such cases the propeller must be heated in order to deliberately destroy the rubber insert. Once the propeller is removed, the splined tube can be cut away with a grinder and a new spline bushing is then required. To prevent a recurrence of the problem, the splines can be coated with anti-seize anti-corrosion compound.|$|E

The {{experiments}} {{of static}} and dynamic characteristics of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> for rear suspension {{telescopic shock absorber}} were carried out at four directions such as axial, radial, torsion and yaw, by MTS 831 and SAGINOMIYA test system. The tests prove that: <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> has great damping, and <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> has obvious nonlinear characteristic; the dynamic stiffness under low frequency and large amplitude excitation is smaller, while the dynamic stiffness under high frequency and small amplitude excitation is greater; at the same amplitude, the dynamic stiffness increases with the increasing excitation frequency.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to utilize the frequency-dependent viscoelastic material model and characterize the dynamic response of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> under external excitation. Furthermore, with appropriate modeling, two heat generation mechanisms of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> are explored and their thermal fields are investigated. Due to the nonlinear force-deflection relationship of the viscoelastic material, finding satisfactory mechanical properties of rubber components still poses a great challenge. However, industry nowadays is in urgent demand for precise finite element analysis (FEA) modeling of rubber components. For example, a proper constitutive relationship of rubber components is critical to providing a reliable and trustable simulation of vehicle suspension systems. As for current FEA commercial software, the frequency-dependent modulus of viscoelastic material hasn 2 ̆ 7 t been presented well and they have failed to provide satisfactory results. Therefore, two approaches, FEA and the multi-body dynamic analysis have been selected together to give a more comprehensive and credible prediction of suspension system 2 ̆ 7 s performance in different working conditions. The FEA approach evaluated the stability of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> in view of the dynamic response and temperature distribution under high frequency excitation. With these results, the life prediction of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> becomes more feasible. The multi-body dynamic analysis explores the structure instability of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> when exposed to extremely high frequency and estimates the energy dissipation in the rubber core. ^ The key innovations of this paper can be classified into four aspects. The first one is the application of multi-body dynamics in the dynamic analysis of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing.</b> Based on experimental modal analysis, the sandwich cylindrical <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> is treated as multi-body. With the multi-body model, the transfer function of the <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> is calculated in order to estimate the dynamic response. The second innovation comes from the development of the FORTRAN program to solve the system transfer function of the structure made of viscoelastic material. Since the geometry and boundary conditions are amenable in FEA compared with the experimental modal testing, this approach is not just applicable in <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> dynamic analysis, but also useful in dynamic analysis of different rubber components. The third innovative contribution of this research is connecting the multi-body analysis with continuum mechanics to evaluate the mechanical properties of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing.</b> The last innovation is the structure-thermal coupling of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> to predict its temperature distribution based on the heat source calculated from the FEA simulation. The finite volume method (FVM) is applied using MATLAB in the simulation of temperature distribution. In this research, the classical standard linear model is applied in the FEA program to characterize the variation of viscoelastic material in the frequency domain. The three parameters of this model have been identified with the batch data measurement using dynamic mechanical analysis equipment (DMA). Specially, two heat generation mechanisms are explored to emphasize the friction-induced hysteresis damping except for the commonly discussed viscous damping. As complementation of FORTRAN program simulation in the frequency domain, the multi-physics commercial software COMSOL is employed to estimate the dynamic response of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> and temperature distribution in the time domain. To verify the results of FEA and multi-body dynamic approach in the dynamic and thermal analysis of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing,</b> dynamic tests have been carried out using torsion and tensile testing machines. The experimental temperature distribution is in good agreement with the simulation results, which indicated the feasibility of the FEA method. ^ However, due to the limited experience and complicated constitutive relationship of the viscoelastic material, the standard linear viscoelastic model is chosen to simulate the heat dissipation mechanism of rubber core. The high-frequency or high-temperature dynamic testing are almost impossible because of the experiment equipments 2 ̆ 7 range of service. As the first step of predicting the dissipation energy density and temperature distribution of rubber components, the initial explorations are significant and provide a proper guidance for further predictions about life expectation. ...|$|E

40|$|Rubber {{bushings}} used in {{the vehicle}} or aerospace can reduce the noise and vibration and absorb the shocks. The heat accumulation in the rubber components is attributed to the nonlinear mechanical behavior of rubber and leads to degeneration of mechanical properties. The viscoelastic damping is treated as the major mechanism of dissipation energy, which is heat source of temperature rising in bushing. A finite element method is expanded from elastic structure to viscoelastic structure and computes the dissipation energy distribution in the rubber core. Based on that heat source, the temperature distribution of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> under radial harmonic excitation has been calculated using finite volume method.

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} in the audible frequency range of magneto-sensitive (MS) rubber {{is the focus}} of this thesis consisting of five papers A-E. Paper A presents results drawn from experiments on samples subjected to different constant shear strains over varying frequencies and magnetic fields. Main features observed are the existence of an amplitude dependence of the shear modulus referred to as the Fletcher-Gent effect for even small displacements, and the appearance of large MS effects. These results are subsequently used in Paper B and C to model two magneto-sensitive rubber isolators, serving to demonstrate how, effectively, by means of MS rubber, these can be readily improved. The first model calculates the transfer stiffness of a torsionally excited isolator, and the second one, the energy flow into the foundation for a bushing inserted between a vibrating mass and an infinite plate. In both examples, notable improvements in isolation are obtainable. Paper D presents a non-linear constitutive model of MS rubber in the audible frequency range. Characteristics inherent to magneto-sensitive rubber within this dynamic regime are defined: magnetic sensitivity, amplitude dependence, elasticity and viscoelasticity. A very good agreement with experimental values is obtained. In Paper E, the magneto-sensitive <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> stiffness for varying degrees of magnetization is predicted by incorporating the non-linear magneto-sensitive audio frequency rubber model developed in Paper D, into an effective engineering formula for the torsional stiffness of a <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing.</b> The results predict, and clearly display, the possibility of controlling over a large range through the application of a magnetic field, the magneto-sensitive <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> stiffness.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an in-wheel vibration absorber for in-wheel-motor electric vehicles (IWM EVs), and a corresponding control strategy to improve vehicle ride comfort. The proposed in-wheel vibration absorber, designed for suppressing the motor vibrations, {{is composed of}} a spring, an annular <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing,</b> and a controllable damper. The parameters of the in-wheel spring and <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> are determined by an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm, which is executed under the typical driving conditions and can absorb vibration passively. To deal with negative interaction effects between vehicle suspension and in-wheel absorber, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) algorithm is developed to control suspension damper, and meanwhile a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) method is developed to control in-wheel damper as well. Through four evaluation indexes, i. e., vehicle body vertical acceleration, suspension dynamic deflection, wheel dynamic load, and motor wallop, simulation results show that, compared to the conventional electric wheel, the proposed suspension LQR control effectively improves vehicle ride comfort, and the in-wheel absorber exhibits excellent performance in terms of wheel and motor vibration suppression...|$|E
