5|$|The {{waters of}} the Severn Estuary, which are heavily laden with silt, flow into the lower reaches of the Parrett and the Tone on each tide. This silt can rapidly gather {{on the banks of}} the rivers, {{reducing}} the capacity and performance of the channel, and increasing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> of surrounding land.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the holiday}} homes were never {{designed}} for long-term residence and {{are now in a}} state of disrepair. According to the Index of Multiple Deprivation of both 2010 and 2015, the eastern half of the village is the most deprived area of England. Jaywick has significant problems with unemployment and is at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding,</b> despite several attempts by the local council and government to transform the area.|$|E
5|$|Flooding in the Niigata area {{continued}} even {{following the}} construction Ohkouzu Channel and another channel, which was originally planned in the Edo period (1700s-1800s), {{was built on}} the western outskirts of Niigata City to further mitigate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> and to help prevent saltwater intrusion into the Shinano estuary. The Sekiya Diversion Channel was originally to be funded by the Niigata Prefecture; however the 1964 Niigata earthquake resulted in the funds no longer being available so it was adopted as a national project.|$|E

50|$|Glaciers in Asia are melting at {{a faster}} rate than ever {{documented}} in historical records. Melting glaciers increase the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> and rock avalanches from destabilized slopes.|$|R
5|$|The flow of {{the river}} has {{decreased}} in power in recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends {{a good deal of}} silt into the system, slowing the flow and creating a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to be relatively clean.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} geology of the North Norfolk {{coast is}} Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs {{just to the}} west of the SSSI, but buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1–2mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> and coastal erosion.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are often}} planted in town environments {{where they are}} known as street trees or amenity trees. They can provide shade and cooling through evapotranspiration, absorb {{greenhouse}} gasses and pollutants, intercept rainfall and reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding.</b> It {{has been shown that}} they are beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes. In London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to one tree for every resident.|$|E

5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a £9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk to human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area {{would be the first to}} be hit by floods in the event of a tidal surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth.|$|E
5|$|In Haiti, about 630,000 {{people were}} still living in tents across areas devastated by the January 2010 {{earthquake}} prior to Emily's arrival. Due {{to the lack of}} sturdy structure to ride out a storm, fears arose over how they would fare with a tropical cyclone passing through the country. Emergency officials in the country set aside 22 large buses to evacuate thousands of people at the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding.</b> Additionally, residents were urged to conserve food and safeguard their belongings. The United Nations placed 11,500 troops in the country on standby to assist in recovery efforts should they be necessitated. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also put emergency teams on standby to deliver food support in addition to the 125,000 people already assisted. In advance of the storm, authorities closed all airports and landing sites in country.|$|E
5|$|Sale's {{shopping}} centre was redeveloped during the 1960s, {{as part of}} the town's post-war regeneration. In 1973, the shopping precinct in the town centre, which had grown up in the mid-19th century, was also redeveloped and pedestrianised in an attempt to increase trade. The construction of the M63 motorway (subsequently renamed the M60) in 1972 {{led to the creation of}} Sale Water Park. To minimise the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding,</b> the new road was built on an embankment, for which the necessary gravel was extracted from what is today an artificial lake and water-sports centre. Opportunities for leisure were increased when the old swimming baths, demolished in 1971, were replaced in 1973 by a new complex built on the same site.|$|E
50|$|Flooding has {{occurred}} on Banwell Moor, despite previous canalisation, and feasibility {{studies have been}} carried out to see if this could be managed to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>floods</b> in the Weston-super-Mare area.|$|R
40|$|CEPRI’s {{thinking}} on the subject begins with the postulate that in densely urbanised cities the future <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> prone areas cannot be reduced to two alternatives: not constructing or continuing to construct as was done over the past decades, i. e. without {{taking into account the}} presence <b>of</b> the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> (overflowing <b>of</b> waterways, coastal <b>flooding,</b> storm water runoff, etc.). It seems that there exists a third possibility: that of developing cities intelligently, taking account of their environment and <b>of</b> the associated <b>risks.</b> Backed up with European urban projects currently being researched or that have been realised, CEPRI has identified six principles making it possible {{to take into account the}} <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> in city planning...|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic {{non-return}} valves are used where a normal non-return valve would be ineffective. This is for example {{where there is}} a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> water entering a site but an equal <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> pollution or a chemical spills leaving a site and polluting the environment.|$|R
5|$|Urmston {{comprises}} {{the areas of}} Davyhulme, Dumplington, Flixton and Urmston, with the River Mersey forming the southern boundary. For administrative reasons, Partington is sometimes considered {{to be part of}} Urmston. The most southerly part of Urmston lies within the flood plain of the River Mersey, an area known as Urmston Meadows, part of the Mersey Valley. Much work was carried out in the 1970s to canalise the Mersey, in an effort to speed up the flow of floodwater and thus reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding.</b> Upstream emergency floodbasins such as Sale Water Park, lying just to the east of Urmston, have also been constructed. The M60 Manchester orbital motorway passes through the northern half of Urmston, from southeast to northwest, and the M62 motorway lies just to the west. The Thirlmere Aqueduct also passes through the Urmston area.|$|E
5|$|Where {{it passes}} through Bristol the river was prone to flooding, but the Northern Stormwater Interceptor, running from Eastville Sluices to the River Avon {{downstream}} of Clifton Suspension Bridge, has since been constructed to control this. At Wade Street, St Judes, the river enters an underground culvert, emerging at what Bristolians call The Centre (formerly the 'Tramways Centre'), but only {{when there is a}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding.</b> The river is otherwise channelled through Mylne's Culvert into the River Avon at a point between Bathurst Basin and Gaol Ferry Bridge. Three further flood relief tunnels- Castle Ditch, Fosseway and Castle Green Tunnel - run under Castle Park in central Bristol to carry excess flows into the Floating Harbour.|$|E
5|$|At 13:00, {{two ships}} {{emerged from the}} gloom {{to the east and}} Lacrosse turned away rather than risk his {{passengers}} in a pointless engagement. The ships persisted and were soon revealed to be the frigates Indefatigable under Captain Sir Edward Pellew, and Amazon under Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds, which had taken on supplies at Falmouth and then returned to their station off Brest. As Droits de l'Homme steered southwest, the winds increased once more and the sea became choppy, preventing Lacrosse from opening the gunports on his lower deck without severe <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> and snapping his topmasts, which reduced his ship's stability. Realising his opponent's difficulties, Pellew closed with the larger ship and began a heavy fire. At 18:45, Amazon came within range and the frigates combined to repeatedly rake the French ship. The combat continued throughout the night, punctuated by short breaks in which the more mobile British ships repaired their battle damage out of range of Lacrosse's guns.|$|E
50|$|Other {{claims were}} that the areas <b>of</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> and drought damage are located mainly in Gangwon Province and other eastern highlands, however most of the project's {{operations}} were conducted in other provinces (Gyunggi, Gyungsang, Junra and Choongchung) and lowlands.|$|R
50|$|The {{bill would}} require FEMA to: (1) rate a covered {{structure}} using the elevation {{difference between the}} floodproofed elevation of the covered structure and the adjusted base <b>flood</b> elevation <b>of</b> the covered structure; and (2) designate a Flood Insurance Advocate to advocate for the fair treatment of policy holders under the National Flood Insurance Program and property owners in the mapping <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> hazards, the identification <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> from <b>flood,</b> and the implementation of measures to minimize the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flood.</b>|$|R
50|$|Suburbs of Sydney like Manly, Botany, Narrabeen, Port Botany, and Rockdale, which lie on rivers {{like the}} Parramatta, face <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> in low-lying {{areas such as}} parks (like Timbrell Park and Majors Bay Reserve), or massive {{expenses}} in rebuilding seawalls to higher levels.|$|R
5|$|With {{the passing}} of the Land Drainage Act 1930, the Welland Catchment Board was created. They had spent £91,537 on the outfall by 1937. Towards the end of the Second World War, E. G. Taverner, the chief {{engineer}} for the drainage board, devised a plan to relieve flooding in Spalding by creating a bypass channel, and building the Greatford Cut to divert the waters of the West Glen river into the Welland upstream of Market Deeping. The scheme cost £723,000, with much of the work being carried out by W. & C. French, and the Coronation Channel around Spalding was opened in September 1953. Fulney lock was constructed {{at the same time to}} exclude the tide from the upper river, as was the Maxey Cut, an embanked channel that bypasses the villages of Market Deeping, Deeping Gate and Deeping St James. During the 1960s and 1970s, several sections of the river above Stamford were made straighter and deeper, to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> of agricultural land. To address the habitat and environmental issues causes by such engineering work, the Welland Rivers Trust, a limited company and charitable trust, was set up in 2010. They are seeking to direct regeneration of the river by co-ordinating various organisations, which are known collectively as the Welland Valley Partnership. They published a major document outlining their proposals in February 2013.|$|E

25|$|Northeast of {{the village}} lies Kinder Reservoir, within a short {{distance}} of the Kinder plateau.

25|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is maintained}} at a level, {{depending on the}} flow rate of the Elbow river, that minimizes the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> around the reservoir and downstream of the dam to the greatest degree possible. During periods when the rate flow of the Elbow River reaches dangerous levels, water may be released from the dam to prevent overflow.|$|E
25|$|Beeston Rylands was {{historically}} {{at greater}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> from the River Trent to the south; {{this meant that}} property here was less desirable and led to more modestly-sized houses being constructed, predominantly for the rental market. The last serious flood, in 1947, reached far beyond the railway line: most of Queens Road was flooded as was Nether Street.|$|E
30|$|However, when {{analyzing}} the reference flows, we observed {{the variability in}} the region near upstream and downstream of the Araguaia River.
