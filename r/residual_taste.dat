40|$|Unilateral {{interruption}} of the chorda-lingual nerve {{led to a}} loss of most epithelial axons and to the deterioration of fungiform taste buds in the anterior portion of the tongue of albino rats, mongolian gerbils, and golden hamsters. By three weeks after surgery the following percentages of fungiform taste buds had completely disappeared: 71 % in gerbils, 28 % in rats, and 26 % in hamsters. <b>Residual</b> <b>taste</b> buds were classified into two groups: atrophic taste buds and taste bud remnants. Atrophic taste buds were smaller than normal and typically had no visible taste pore, although they retained the characteristic oval shape of a taste bud and numerous elongated cells. Taste bud remnants were non-oval fragments of taste buds with few elongated cells. Specific markers for elongated taste cells (monoclonal antibodies to keratin 19) confirmed that atrophic taste buds, as well as some taste bud remnants, had elongated taste cells. By 180 days after chorda-lingual nerve transection, 44 % of rat fungiform taste buds had disappeared; morphometric analysis of the 311 <b>residual</b> <b>taste</b> buds established that 241 atrophic taste buds and 69 taste bud remnants were, respectively, 50 % and 75 % smaller than the average volume of 480 normal taste buds. The aggregate loss of gustatory tissue, calculated from the shrinkage of <b>residual</b> <b>taste</b> buds and the volume lost by the outright disappearance of many taste buds, was 88 % for gerbils, 72 % for rats, and 65 % for hamsters. Evaluation in gerbils of the co-occurrence of taste buds and axons suggests <b>residual</b> <b>taste</b> buds were neurotrophically supported. Every gerbil fungiform papilla that lacked axons lacked a taste bud. Every fungiform papillae that had a <b>residual</b> <b>taste</b> bud had axons; axons were absent from 22 % of empty fungiform papillae. Diminished numbers of gustatory neurotrophic axons could account for both the loss of fungiform taste buds and the reduced volume of <b>residual</b> <b>taste</b> buds. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of food products that {{may contribute to}} attenuate issues related to public health {{in a positive way}} is a challenge for the dairy industry. Due to its negative effects of salt on health, such as increase in blood pressure and decrease in calcium absorption, high intake of salt derived from food in industrialized nations is an important issue for the modern society. Considering that cheese consumption is increasing worldwide, importance should be given to reducing the contribution of salt as a sodium-carrier without affecting its consumption. Various types of cheese have been developed with reduced sodium content by decreasing NaCl or partial/total substitution of this salt with KCl, MgCl 2 and CaCl 2. The results are mostly positive; most variety of cheeses is acceptable, but at times there is a sour <b>residual</b> <b>taste</b> resulting from the substitution of NaCl. Further knowledge is necessary regarding the quality of cheese and levels of salt that is acceptable in the production of cheeses with reduced sodium content. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This happening due the public knowledge of these productâs benefits. The flaxseed (Linum usitatissimun L.) has been considerated a functional ingredient of great importance. This importance is due its functional combinations such as linolenic acid, lignans and fibers that are potentially beneficial to our health. Several researches evidence the positive effects of adding flaxseed to the food to the combat and prevention of many diseases, for example: cancer, constipation, menopause, disease cardiovascular, among others. The passion fruit flour has demonstrated its ability to reduce the bad cholesterol (LDL) and to increase the good cholesterol (HDL). Therefore, the passion fruit flour has been pointed out as an auxiliary in the treatment of diabetes and weight reduction. Thus, this research work has the purpose of developing bread with functional characteristics. We have formulated four experiments. The first one, the standard bread (FP), without the addition of flaxseed and passion fruit flour. In the other three experiments have received 3 % of fiber food (fruit passion flour) and additionally 4 % (FML 4), 7 % (FML 7) and 10 % (FML 10) of flaxseed flour. The experiments were evaluated over their physic, chemical, physic-chemical, sensorial, microbiological and rheologic characteristics. They were put under sensorial tests to prove the global acceptance, acceptance for the attributes of purchasing intention. The data were statically investigated through descriptive analysis and variance analysis (ANOVA) and the Tukey test for comparison of the averages, using the significance level of 5 % (p&# 8804; 0, 05).

Foram analisadas amostras de bolos, formulados com farinha de yacon, denominadas: amostra P (bolo padrão, sem farinha de yacon), amostra A (bolo com 20 % de farinha de yacon) e amostra B (bolo com 40 % de farinha de yacon). Para a avaliação sensorial, foi realizada a Análise Descritiva Quantitativa (ADQ), utilizando 15 provadores treinados, os quais definiram 9 atributos sensoriais (cor, estrutura do miolo, aroma, gosto doce, sabor de chocolate, sabor residual, umectância, maciez e qualidade global). A análise física dos bolos foi realizada através da caracterização cromática. Os dados sensoriais foram submetidos à análise de variância ANOVA, sendo realizado o teste de Duncan para comparação entre as médias de Duncan, ao nível de 5 % de significância. Para verificar as correlações entre as amostras e os atributos, foi realizada a Análise de Componentes Principais (ACP). Na ACP, a soma de componentes principais 1 e 2 foi de 83, 3 %, ou seja, a variabilidade entre as amostras foi explicada por estes dois componentes. Os resultados obtidos demonstraram que a adição de 40 % de farinha de yacon resultou em maiores notas para o aroma (10, 16), gosto doce (7, 60), sabor de chocolate (10, 52), maciez (11, 44) e qualidade global (11, 64). Com relação ao atributo estrutura não houve diferença significativa entre as notas dos bolos P, A e B. Independente da quantidade de farinha de yacon adicionada, o perfil sensorial dos bolos de chocolate foi influenciado e, em particular, o bolo com maior teor de farinha de yacon apresentou as melhores notas. This study {{evaluated the}} use of yacon flour {{in the formulation of}} chocolate cakes by investigating its influence on the sensory quality and chromaticity of the product. The following samples were prepared and analyzed: sample P (standard cake without yacon flour), sample A (20 % of yacon flour), and sample B (40 % of yacon flour). The Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) was used for the sensory analysis with 15 trained panelists who evaluated 9 sensory attributes (color, crumb structure, aroma, sweet taste, chocolate flavor, <b>residual</b> <b>taste,</b> humectancy, tenderness, and overall quality). The physical analysis of the cake was made by color characterization. The data were subjected to sensory analysis of variance ANOVA and the Duncan's test for comparison between the averages, at 5 % level of significance.

The consumption of organic pork meat as well as the parameters of natural and synthetic antioxidants usually used in meat products production were also discussed. The total antioxidant activity (TAA) of rosemary essencial oil, extracted from fresh organic leaves in comparison with the one extracted from dry organic leaves was evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging activity (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryl-hydrazyl). Four different organic pork sausages were formulated: control exempt of additives (Tc), with addition of curing salts (Tsc) and with addition of rosemary essential oil in different concentrations 0, 01 % (T 0, 01 %) e 0, 1 % (T 0, 1 %). The samples were stored under refrigeration and submitted to the following analysis: physical-chemical analysis of water activity, pH and 2 -tiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS); microbiological analysis as determined by RDC 12 / 2001, as well as total heterotrophic bacteria counting, and sensorial analysis such as acceptance purchase, intent and preference tests. A consumer perception test was also carried out. The results showed that the drying operation in rosemary organic leaves adversely affected the essential oil TAA even the statistical analysis did not show significance. Evaluating the performance of rosemary essencial oil substituting traditionally used additives, it was verified that, during storage period, for the four samples, water activity and pH remained stable and in acceptable range for raw meat products. Concerning lipid oxidation results in TBARS values, there were no statistical differences in Tc and T 0, 1 % in the fifth and last day of analysis.

Visando contribuir para o conhecimento do potencial alimentar próprio da Amazônia, trabalhou-se com camu-camu cultivado em terra firme para: acompanhar as mundanças nas características físicas, fisico-químicas, químicas, e fisiológica durante a maturação; estabelecer curvas de maturação para predizer o período ideal de colheita; avaliar a importância nutricional do fruto. Camu-camu procedente de plantas em adaptação às condições edafo-climáticas da terra firme, mantidas na Estação Experimental de Fruticultura Tropical do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia - INPA, em solo Podzólico Vermelho Amarelo, Textura Argilosa, sob clima {{equatorial}} úmido da Amazônia Central Brasileira, foram colhidos aos 58, 71, 85, 95, 104 e 113 dias após a antese e avaliados quanto as características físicas, físico-químicas, químicas e fisiológica. A análise de variância {teste F a nível de 1 % de probabilida¬de) mostrou que o estádio de maturação apresentou efeito alta¬mente significativo sobre as características do fruto. 0 peso do fruto apresentou curva sigmóide simples. 0 peso do endocarpo acompanhou o padrão apresentado peio fruto inteiro, o das sementes alimentou em taxas bem inferiores em relação ao endocarpo e o da casca (epioarpo + mesocarpo) atingiu o máximo aos 95 dias, decrescendo nos estádios subseqüentes. Carotenóides totais» protopectina, extrato etéreo, proteína e sólidos insolúveis em álcool decresceram. Compostos fenólicos e CO 2 decresceram, porém, aumentaram aos 104 e 113 dias após a antese. Sólidos solúveis, acidez titulável, pH, relação Brix/acidez açúcares redutores totais, glicose, frutose, pectina solúvel, antocianinas totais e vitamina C aumentaram com a maturação. Pectina total e amido aumentaram atingindo o máximo aos 65 e 95 dias, respectivamente, mas decrescendo nos estádios subseqüentes. Açúcares não redutores mostraram valores mínimos aos 56, 95, 104 e 113 dias e teores naD detectáveis nos demais. Os minerais decresceram atingindo valores mínimos entre 85 e 95 dias, porém, elevando-se nos estádios subseqüentes, exceto o magnésio e nitrogênio, que continuaram a decrescer até aos 113 dias após a antese. Do ponto de vista nutricional, os estádios de maturação de 104 e 113 após a antese, considerados como sensorialmente aceitáveis, demonstraram que: o camu-camu mostrou-se como fonte insignificante de lipídios, carotenóides, proteína, energia (Kcal), macro e micro minerais. Porém, destacou-se como excelente fonte de vitamina C, com total equivalente a 2, 1 a 3, 1 g/ 100 g de polpa integral. A maior porção do fruto foi o endocarpo, que, acrescido da casca (mesocarpo + epicarpo), que também é comestível, proporcionou alto rendimento em polpa (pericarpo). As características de alta suculência, acidez elevada, sabor acentuado e residual, odor pronunciado e forte coloração vermelho-púrpura indicaram sua adequação ao consumo na forma de sucos. Os dados confirmaram o valor nutricional, sensorial e tecnológico do camu-camu e permitem indicar a sua utilização, sobretudo nas áreas de ocorrência.

Among those species outstands camu-camu Myrciaria dubia (H. B. K.) Mc Vaugh which occurs as a wild species in areas subjected to periodical flooding, and domestication {{of which has been}} initiated recently. Aiming to contribute to the Knowledge of its potential as a food in the Amazon itself, we worked with camu-camu cultivated in the upland to: follow the changes in physical, physico-chemical, chemical and physiological characteristics during maturation; eatabilish curves of maturation to predict the ideal time of fruit harvest; appreciate the nutritional value of fruit. Camu-camu fruits from plants in adaptation to the soil climatic conditions of upland, kept in the Tropical Fruits Experimental Station of Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia (INPA), in red-yellow podsolic soils, clay texture, under humid atorial climate of Brazilian Central Amazon, were harvested at 58, 71, 85,, 104, and 113 days after anthesis and evaluated for: physical, physico-chemical, chemical and physiological characteristics. Analyses of variance (F teBt at 1 % confidence level) showed a highly significant effect of ripening stage on fruit physical and chemical properties. Fruit weight presented a simple sigmoidal curve. Endocarp weight followed the same pattern of whole fruits, but weight of seeds increased in smaller ratios than that of endocarp. The weight of skin (epicarp and meaocarp) reached its maximum at 95 days decreasing thereafter. Total carotenoids, protopectins, ether extract, protein and insoluble solids in alcohol decreased. Phenolic compounds and CG 2 decreased but started resume increasing at 104 and 113 days after anthesis. Soluble solids, titrable acidity, pH, Brix/acidity ratio, total reducing sugars, glucose, fructose, soluble pectin, total anthocyanins and vitamin C increased with maturation. Total pectin and starch increased, reaching their maximum values at 85 and 95 days, respectively, but reducing thereafter. Nonreducing sugars showed minimum values at 56, 95, 104 and 113 days and non detectable values during other stages. Minerals decreased and reached their minimum values at 85 and 95 days, but increased in the following stages, except magnesium and nitrogen which decreased continually up to 113 days after anthesis. At the nutritional point of view, the maturation stages of 104 and 113 days after anthesis, considered to be organoleptically acceptable, showed that: camu-camu was a non-significant source of lipids* carotenoidB, proteins, energy (kcal), and macro and microminerals. However, it outstands as an excellent source of vitamin C, having total amount ranging from 2. 1 to 3. 1 g/ 100 g of whole flesh.
