30|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radio (IR) {{technology}} {{has become a}} popular research topic in wireless communications in recent years. It is a potential candidate for short-range, low-power wireless applications [1]. UWB systems convey information by transmitting sub-nanosecond pulses with a very low duty-cycle.

However, the implementation of <b>Rake</b> <b>receivers</b> is very challenging in UWB systems because <b>Rake</b> <b>receivers</b> need {{a large number of}} fingers to capture significant signal energy.

50|$|Since {{different}} frequency {{components of}} the signal are affected independently, {{it is highly unlikely}} that all parts of the signal will be simultaneously affected by a deep fade. Certain modulation schemes such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) are well-suited to employing frequency diversity to provide robustness to fading. OFDM divides the wideband signal into many slowly modulated narrowband subcarriers, each exposed to flat fading rather than frequency selective fading.

40|$|Abstract — One of {{the major}} issues {{for the design of}} ultrawideband (UWB) {{receivers}} is the need to recover the signal energy dispersed over many multipath components, while keeping the receiver complexity low. To this aim we consider two schemes for reduced-complexity UWB <b>Rake</b> <b>receivers,</b> both of which combine a subset of the available resolved multipath components. The first method, called partial Rake (PRake), combines the first arriving multipath components. The second is known as selective Rake (SRake) and combines the instantaneously strongest multipath components. We evaluate and compare the link performance of these <b>Rake</b> <b>receivers</b> in different UWB channels, whose models are based on extensive propagation measurements. We quantify the effect of the channel characteristics on the receiver performance, analyzing in particular the influence of small-scale fading statistics. We find that for dense channels the performance of the simpler PRake receiver is almost as good as that of the SRake receiver, even for a small number of fingers. In sparse channels, however, the SRake outperforms the PRake significantly. We also show that for a fixed transmitted energy there is an optimum transmission bandwidth.

50|$|Raleigh {{solidified}} {{the case}} for OFDM by analyzing the performance of MIMO with three leading modulation techniques in his PhD dissertation: quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), and discrete multi-tone (DMT). QAM is representative of narrowband schemes such as TDMA that use equalization to combat ISI. DSSS uses rake receivers to compensate for multipath and is used by CDMA systems. DMT uses interleaving and coding to eliminate ISI and is representative of OFDM systems. The analysis was performed by deriving the MIMO channel matrix models for the three modulation schemes, quantifying the computational complexity and assessing the channel estimation and synchronization challenges for each. The models showed that for a MIMO system using QAM with an equalizer or DSSS with a <b>rake</b> <b>receiver,</b> computational complexity grows exponentially (more specifically, quadratically) as data rate is increased.
