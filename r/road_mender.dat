25|$|In Brazil young Sigmund {{adopted the}} name Pedro and worked odd {{jobs as a}} dock worker, a <b>road</b> <b>mender,</b> a {{plantation}} labourer and, in 1895, a cook for a British intelligence expedition. Rosenblum allegedly saved both the expedition {{and the life of}} Major Charles Fothergill when hostile natives attacked them. Rosenblum seized a British officer's pistol and, with single-hand marksmanship, killed the attacking natives. Appropriately for a fantastic story, Major Fothergill rewarded Rosenblum with 1,500 pounds, a British passport and passage to Britain. There Pedro became Sidney Rosenblum. Andrew Cook asserts in Ace of Spies: The True Story of Sidney Reilly (p.32) that the evidence contradicts this tale of Brazil. Cook states that the arrival of Sigmund Rosenblum in London in December 1895 was from France, and was prompted by Rosenblum's unscrupulous acquisition of a large sum of money in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, a residential suburb of Paris, necessitating a hasty flight. According to Cook's account, Rosenblum and Yan Voitek, a Polish accomplice, waylaid two Italian anarchists on 25 December 1895 and robbed them of a substantial amount of revolutionary funds. One anarchist's throat was cut; the other, Constant Della Cassa, died from knife wounds in Fontainebleau Hospital three days later. By the time Della Cassa's death appeared in the newspapers police had learned that one of the assailants, whose physical description matched Rosenblum's, was already en route to Britain. Rosenblum's accomplice, Voitek, later related this incident as well as other dealings with Rosenblum to the British Secret Intelligence Service.|$|E
50|$|A day later, Hannay {{retrieves}} {{his possessions}} from the helpful <b>road</b> <b>mender</b> and stays {{for a few}} days to recover from the explosion. He dines at a public house in Moffat before walking to the junction at Beattock to catch a southbound train to England, changing at Crewe, Birmingham New Street and Reading, to meet Sir Harry's relative at the Foreign Office, Sir Walter Bullivant, at his country home in Berkshire. As they discuss Scudder's notes, Sir Walter receives a phone call to tell him that Karolides has been assassinated.|$|E
50|$|Hannay leaves Sir Harry {{and tries}} {{to hide in the}} countryside, but is spotted by the aeroplane. Soon he spots a group of men on the ground searching for him. Miraculously, he meets a <b>road</b> <b>mender</b> out on the moor, and swaps places with him, sending the workman home. His {{disguise}} fools his pursuers, who pass him by. On the same road he meets, in a passing touring car, a Society sycophant whom he recognizes from London and whom he forces to exchange clothes with him and drive him off the moor.|$|E
2500|$|Stories later {{circulated}} {{that the}} first shot missed but rather than taking shelter in the house, he drew his sword and advanced on his attackers, {{who were able to}} shoot and kill him. These stories often stressed that he had died a martyr. His housemaid testified that she found his drawn sword lying by his side. These details do not feature in the three witness accounts quoted by Keith Jeffery (Reginald Dunne's account smuggled out of prison, or the inquest testimonies of one of two <b>road</b> <b>menders</b> working nearby and of the taxi driver who had just dropped Wilson off). One of the <b>road</b> <b>mender's</b> accounts, as published in the [...] "Daily Mail", mentions Wilson turning on his attackers with the words [...] "you cowardly swine!" [...] but Jeffery suggests this was an embellishment by the newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the school}} opened in 1849, the first teacher was {{probably}} Mary Wilmot. She {{appears in the}} 1851 census for Sevington, aged 45 and with the occupation of schoolteacher. Her son, Nathaniel Wilmot is listed in the school register for 1858. According to local memory, her husband, John Wilmot, a <b>road</b> <b>mender,</b> was also involved with the school. A former pupil, interviewed by the Wiltshire Gazette many years later, describes him as the schoolmaster, adding that [...] "We used to pay so much a week and my father always took the money down but I was not there for very long for I left at seven and went bird-scaring, earning a shilling or two a week. I was the eldest of nine and went out early to help the home." ...|$|E
50|$|Ledwidge {{was born}} at Janeville, Slane, in Ireland, the eighth of nine {{children}} in a poverty-stricken family. His parents, Patrick Ledwidge (the Ledwidge family, from Shropshire, was granted land in Meath after the Norman invasion) and wife Anne Lynch (1853-1926), believed in giving their children the best education they could afford. But when Francis was only five his father Patrick died prematurely, which forced his wife and the children out to work at an early age. Francis left the local national school aged thirteen, and while he continued to educate himself, he worked at what work he could find, as farm hand, <b>road</b> <b>mender</b> and supervisor of roads, as copper miner (sacked for organising a strike for better mining conditions, three years before the general 1913 strike, and was a trade union activist since 1906) and shop assistant. Appointed secretary of the Slane branch of the Meath Labour Union (1913-14) he had aspirations of permanent white-collar work. He {{was known for his}} connections with Sinn Féin.|$|E
