40|$|<b>Radiometric</b> image <b>analysis</b> methods heavily rely on {{reflectance}} models. Due to {{the complexity}} of real materials, methods based on simple models such as the Lambertian model often suffer from inaccuracy. On the other hand, more advanced models such as the Cook-Torrance model severely complicate the analysis problem. We tackle this dilemma by focusing on the low-frequency component of the reflectance. We propose a compact biquadratic reflectance model to represent the reflectance of a broad class of materials precisely in the low-frequency domain. We validate our model by fitting to both existing parametric models and non-parametric measured data, and show that our model outperforms existing parametric diffuse models. We show applications of reflectometry using general diffuse surfaces and photometric stereo for general isotropic materials. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our biquadratic model and its usefulness in <b>radiometric</b> image <b>analysis.</b> 1...|$|R

Common materials exhibit diverse reflectance effects, {{and this is}} a significant source of difficulty for <b>radiometric</b> image <b>analysis.</b> One strategy for dealing with this diversity is to build computational tools that exploit reflectance symmetries, such as reciprocity and isotropy, that are exhibited by broad classes of materials. In this paper, we advocate the real projective plane as a tool for representing and exploiting these symmetries. In this approach, each point in the plane represents a surface normal that is visible from a fixed viewpoint, and reflectance symmetries are analyzed in terms of the geometric structures that they induce. We provide an overview of these structures and explore applications to both calibrated and uncalibrated photometric stereo. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Channel {{adjustment}} and sedimentation rates are needed when determining stream management activities to reduce erosion and sedimentation. Channel adjustment rates are typically determined using historical channel geometry, channel profiles, and air photos, or dendrogeomorphic techniques. When {{this information is}} not available, sediment deposition rates of a downstream waterbody {{may be used as}} a surrogate for long-term channel adjustment rates in the watershed. Methods of determining sediment deposition rates include developing sediment budgets and/or <b>radiometric</b> (137 Cs) <b>analysis.</b> Using these two methods, short-term and long-term depositional rates within the Lower Cache River-Cypress Creek Wetland in southern Illinois were computed and compared. Results provide insights into the historical rate of upstream channel adjustments in the watershed. Specifically, based on sediment core data collected in 2000, the <b>radiometric</b> (137 Cs) <b>analysis</b> determined that the wetland has a long-term sediment deposition rate of 0. 86 cm/yr (1963 - 2000). The sediment budget method, based upon sediment monitoring data collected between 1986 and 2002, computed a nearly identical short-term sediment deposition rate of 0. 79 cm/yr. Since the depositional rates determined by the two methods are very similar, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the sediment deposition in the wetland, as well as the channel adjustment rates in Big Creek, have been steady since at least 1963...|$|R

The study focussed on the effects of instrument measurement effects and software issues. We have also investigated the effect of the water vapour scale height and the presence of water vapour layers in the determination of the path delay. After correcting the software for the instrumental effects and applying empirically determined corrections to the path delay estimates we reached a good agreement between observed path delay variations and the inferred path delay variations determined from the PWV measurements. 01 / 04 / 03 12 : 38 034 /P...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{positioning}} phase of geostationary satellites {{the performance of}} the Apogee Motor Firings is crucial {{to the success of the}} mission. Hence, the capability to monitor and estimate extended maneuvers is of high interest for spacecraft operations. In this paper the features of the completely revised and consid- erably extended ODEM (Orbit Determination System including Ex- tended Maneuvers) orbit determination software, that comprise the replacement of a Kalman Filter by a least-squares estimation algorithm and the extension to modeling and estimation of several instantaneous impulsive maneuvers in addition to the extended maneuver, are applied to the analysis of Apogee Motor Firings. Based on the experience with the previous ODEM version, the impact of Kalman Filter and least-squares estimation methods on the ana- lysis of Apogee Boost Motor (ABM) phases is investigated. To this end, tracking data from the recently performed positioning of the EUTELSAT Hot Bird 1 telecommunication satellite are utilized to compare the reliability, stability, and performance of both esti- mation algorithms. Furthermore, the benefit of a Kalman filter for real-time estimates of extended maneuver parameters is critically reviewed in terms of mission operations aspects. An obvious insufficiency in the boost phase modeling has been noted in the <b>radiometric</b> data <b>analysis,</b> that is partially related to attitude control activities. For example, the transfer from Sun Acquisition Mode to the Earth Aquisition Mode prior to the maneuver imposes small velocity components on the spacecraft orbit that are visible in the tracking data residuals.
