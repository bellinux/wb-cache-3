5|$|The delegates {{voted to}} address the {{platform}} before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the <b>Resolutions</b> <b>Committee</b> already, but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions. On many planks, there was widespread agreement among the delegates. On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws to mandate safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} of his tenure at Darbas, the Socialist Party of America was {{fractured}} into rival Socialist and Communist organizations, marked by launch of the founding convention of the Communist Party of America (CPA) in Chicago on September 1, 1919. Headed by their Translator-Secretary, Joseph V. Stilson, a big majority of the Lithuanian Socialist Federation supported affiliation with the fledgling CPA. At the 10th National Convention of the Lithuanian Socialist Federation, held shortly after the establishment of the Communist Party, Bimba served on the 5 member <b>Resolutions</b> <b>Committee</b> and emerged as a leading spokesman for affiliation with the CPA.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, April 23, {{the most}} complex and thorny issues were debated. The first {{contentious}} issue on the agenda dealt with natural resources industries, such as the oil, gas, and mines, as it became the centre of a major showdown between the Waffle and the labour movement forces. The Waffle faction wanted total nationalization and public ownership of resource industries. The party establishment, and Labour, being more moderate, wanted only to expand public and co-operative ownership. The hour-long debate, quickly transcended into raucous name-calling and physical pushing and shoving at the microphone stands. Sidney Green, Manitoba’s Minister of Mines and Resources in the NDP provincial government, spoke in favour of the moderate <b>resolutions</b> <b>committee</b> motion. He was countered on the convention floor by university professor Peter Usher, a Waffle member from Ottawa, who moved to refer the committee’s motion back for redrafting to push for nationalization of all resource industries. After much heated debate, his motion was defeated in a standing-count vote by a three to one margin. The standing vote was needed because Waffle members challenged two previous voting attempts. Once defeated, the Unity Group, and its labour supporters, pressed for {{the adoption of the}} original eight-point resolution, which then passed easily with a five to one plurality. With the Waffle’s amendment defeated, it seemed unlikely that they could pass other motions that called for the nationalization of other economic sectors like manufacturing, financial, and transportation.|$|E

500|$|By February 1856 Morton {{had made}} his way to the newly formed Republican party at the {{national}} level as a member of the <b>resolutions</b> <b>committee</b> to the preliminary national convention that met in Pittsburgh. He also served as a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Thirty-two-year-old Morton became the People's/Republican candidate for governor of Indiana in 1856. His Democratic opponent was Ashbel P. Willard, a popular state senator. Despite a hard-fought campaign that for the first time brought Morton to the attention of voters around the state, Willard defeated him in the general election by fewer than 6,000 votes, amid charges on both sides of fraudulent voting. Radical Republican George W. Julian, who detested Morton, contended that Morton did not take a strong enough position against slavery, and, as conservative former Whigs claimed, he had been too lenient on the issue in a state where southern-born residents wanted nothing to do with blacks or abolitionism. Despite these criticisms, Morton's anti-slavery speeches made him popular among the Republicans in Indiana. Noted for his [...] "plain and convincing" [...] manner of speaking, Morton's contemporaries said he was not [...] "eloquent or witty", but rather [...] "logical and reasonable".|$|E

2500|$|No {{other issue}} at the {{convention}} caused more worry for the NDP than what its policy should be with regards to Quebec self-determination. The Waffle's position called for the recognition of Quebecers' right to secede {{from the rest of}} Canada, without intervention from the other provinces and the federal government. The Unity Group, and its allies, urged the convention not to take a stance which could be construed by Canadian voters as assisting Quebec separation. In an effort to prevent the whole Quebec issue even reaching the floor, the Unity Group tried to reach a compromise with the Waffle and the NDP's Quebec wing the day before the convention started. In essence, compromise would have been a [...] "commitment to Canadian union while saying that the constitutional arrangements between Ottawa and the provinces must be completely renegotiated." [...] It went on to further state that [...] "The unity of this country cannot be based on force.... If one of our provinces were to choose to separate, freely and democratically, it would be madness to attempt to restrain it by force." [...] A compromise could not be reached as the small Quebec contingent — and the Waffle members in attendance at the <b>resolutions</b> <b>committee</b> — refused to vote to accept the new resolution, forcing the Quebec issue on to the convention floor on Friday, April 23.|$|E
2500|$|Byrne {{was born}} Jane Margaret Burke on May 24, 1933 at John B. Murphy Hospital in the Lake View {{neighborhood}} {{on the north}} side of Chicago, Illinois to Katherine Marie Burke (née Nolan), a stay at home wife and Edward Patrick Burke, vice president of Inland Steel. Raised on the city's north side, Byrne graduated from Saint Scholastica High School and attended St. Mary of the Woods for her freshman year of college. Byrne later transferred to Barat College, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and biology in 1965. Byrne entered politics to volunteer in John F. Kennedy's campaign for president in 1960. During that campaign she first met then Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. After meeting Daley, he appointed her to several positions beginning in 1964 with a job in the city's Head Start program. In June 1965, she was promoted and worked with the Chicago Committee of Urban Opportunity. In 1968, Byrne was appointed head of the City of Chicago's consumer affairs department. In 1972, Byrne served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and chairperson of the DNC <b>resolutions</b> <b>committee</b> in 1973. Byrne was appointed co–chairperson of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee by Daley, despite the rejection by the majority of Democratic leaders in 1975. The committee ousted Byrne shortly after Daley's death in late 1976. Shortly thereafter, Bryne accused the newly appointed mayor Michael Bilandic of being unfair to citizens of the city by placing a 12% increase on cab–fare which Byrne felt was the result of a [...] "backroom deal". Byrne was fired from her post of head of consumer affairs by Bilandic shortly after he was made aware of her charges against him in April 1977.|$|E
