40|$|Ashby's work on {{the effects}} of KCl and NaCl on the {{resistance}} to hypotonic hemolysis of K•-rich and K•-poor erythrocytes <b>has</b> <b>been</b> repeated with great attention to purity of materials and refinement of technique. The results fail to agree with those of Ashby. 1. KCl produces greater loss in resistance to hypotonic hemolysis than does NaCl, irrespective of the species of the animal from which the cells are taken. 2. While cases of an increase in <b>resistance</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>encountered</b> in my experiments, they are either very slight, or else the particular determination is subject to very great uncertainty. The great increases in resistance found by Ashby are not even approached in any of the present series of experiments. 3. Ashby's generalization that KCl and NaCl have opposite effects on red blood cells, and that the sense of these effects depends on whether the cell is K•-rich or K•-poor is not substantiated...|$|R
40|$|Because {{excessively}} {{high rates}} of false <b>resistance</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>encountered</b> with the 10 -μg amikacin disk in diffusion susceptibility tests, a study was performed to examine existing zone diameter interpretative criteria and to compare the accuracy of 10 - and 30 -μg amikacin disks by the error rate-bounded classification scheme. Although current zone diameter interpretative criteria eliminate false susceptibles, there is an unacceptably high rate of false resistants. This problem can be resolved in most instances by revising the zone diameter interpretative criteria for the 10 -μg disk (resistant, ≤ 9 mm; indeterminate, 10 to 11 mm; susceptible, ≥ 12 mm) or, preferably, by replacing the 10 -μg disk with a 30 -μg disk and adopting new interpretative criteria (resistant, ≤ 14 mm; indeterminate, 15 to 16 mm; susceptible, ≥ 17 mm). Because of significant differences in performance among media, {{it is necessary to}} include Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 among controls routinely tested and to exclude from use lots of Mueller-Hinton agar yielding results outside the 75 % tolerance (90 % confidence) limits for amikacin...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s public funds were {{initiated}} by the Swedish government, channelled through the County Administrative Boards, to encourage the establishment of Women Resource Centres (WRCs). Since then, WRCs {{all over the country}} have worked to increase women's participation in regional development. According to an earlier study, WRCs have systematically organized innovation systems at the local, regional and national level in Sweden by linking actors from different spheres of society around topics such as new technology, culture and service industry. 2 Gradually, the Swedish innovation system of WRCs has expanded internationally through funding from various European Union funds encouraging transnational cooperation. In 2006 the European association WINNET Europe was formed, gathering WRCs from 21 countries. In this paper, we set out to analyse how WRCs have organised an innovation system on the European level, gathering actors from different spheres of society encountering both support and resistance. We describe this process of internationalisation in the light of theories of innovation systems and triple helix. The questions we try to answer are: Which actors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mobilised and what <b>resistance</b> and successes <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>encountered?</b> How might these factors be related to the ambition of gender mainstreaming in Sweden and EU?Godkänd; 2009; 20090609 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 5 years, {{clinical}} isolates of gram-positive bacteria with intrinsic or acquired resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>encountered</b> increasingly. In {{many of these}} isolates, resistance arises from an alteration of the antibiotic target site, with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety of peptidoglycan precursors being replaced by groups that do not bind glycopeptides. Although the criteria for defining <b>resistance</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> revised frequently, the reliable detection of low-level glycopeptide resistance remains problematic and {{is influenced by the}} method chosen. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci have emerged as a particular problem in hospitals, where in addition to sporadic cases, clusters of infections with evidence of interpatient spread have occurred. Studies using molecular typing methods have implicated colonization of patients, staff carriage, and environmental contamination in the dissemination of these bacteria. Choice of antimicrobial therapy for infections caused by glycopeptide-resistant bacteria may be complicated by resistance to other antibiotics. Severe therapeutic difficulties <b>are</b> being <b>encountered</b> among patients infected with enterococci, with some infections being untreatable with currently available antibiotics...|$|R

Early blight {{is the most}} destructive of these diseases and hence receives considerable attention in breeding. For over 60 years, breeding for early blight <b>resistance</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> practiced, but the development of cultivars {{with high levels of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> hampered by the lack of sources of strong resistance in the cultivated tomato and by the quantitative expression and polygenic inheritance of the resistance.
