5000|$|Hakonechloa macra can {{be easily}} {{propagated}} by division. The <b>rootball</b> has many stalks coming up from a dense rhizomatous cluster of roots. Apparent on the rhizome are small buds that look like thorns. These are new shoots and with care they can {{be removed from the}} root cluster with a small segment of rhizome taking care to include connected roots.|$|E
5000|$|Both under-watering and over-watering can be {{detrimental}} to a houseplant. The best way {{to determine whether a}} plant needs water is to check the soil moisture. Feeling the soil is most reliable, since moisture meters are often inaccurate. Most potted plants must be allowed to reach an appropriate level of dryness in between waterings, though the amount of watering required varies greatly depending on the species. Proper soil moisture can range from still slightly moist on the soil surface to very dry to nearly the bottom of the pot. Watering a plant by the calendar is not recommended. If a plant does need to be watered, water should be slowly poured over the surface of the soil until it begins to drain out the bottom of the pot, ensuring complete saturation. However, sometimes the soil separates from the sides of the pot if it is allowed to dry out thoroughly, allowing the water to flow down the sides of the <b>rootball</b> and out the bottom too quickly to be absorbed and retained by the soil and roots. If this is the case, {{it may be necessary to}} set the plant in a shallow dish of water long enough for it to soak up enough water to moisten the <b>rootball</b> to its center. Repotting should eliminate this problem. Repotting should be done only when necessary, since the roots of a plant that is in an excessively large pot may rot.|$|E
50|$|When all are {{maintained}} {{in a single}} genus, {{it is the most}} diverse of the Galliformes, having by far the most members. Francolins are terrestrial (though not flightless) birds that feed on insects, vegetable matter and seeds. Most of the members have a hooked upper beak, well-suited for digging at the bases of grass tussocks and <b>rootballs.</b> They have wide tails with fourteen retrice feathers. Most species exhibit spurs on the tarsi.|$|R
50|$|The 1962 {{construction}} of the Charles Stratton Dana Greenhouses was of benefit to the collection. This facility includes a hexagonal, redwood lath house to display the collection {{during the growing season}} and a concrete-block cold storage for winter protection. The latter maintains temperatures between 33 and 35 degrees Fahrenheit. Formerly, the bonsai had been placed in covered pits and cold frames for the winter. This practice compromised the health of the plants and the consequent freezing of the <b>rootballs</b> cracked many of the original Japanese containers.|$|R
50|$|Sabal {{palmetto}} is {{a popular}} landscape plant known for its tolerance of salt spray and cold. Because of their relatively long establishment period and prevalence on ranchlands, few, if any are grown from seed in nurseries. Instead, established plants are dug in the wild with small <b>rootballs</b> since virtually all the severed roots die and must be replaced by new roots in the new location. Most leaves are removed {{at this time to}} reduce transpiration.It is the state tree of South Carolina and Florida. Most references rate the species as hardy to USDA hardiness zone 7b or 8a. Cabbage palms have excellent hurricane resistance, but are frequently over-pruned for a variety of reasons.|$|R
50|$|Marion Rushing (September 3, 1936 - April 26, 2013) was a {{professional}} American football player. Born in Pinckneyville, Illinois, he played {{nine and a half}} seasons in the National Football League (NFL), mainly for the Chicago Cardinals/St. Louis Cardinals. He finished his pro <b>rootball</b> career in 1968 with the Houston Oilers of the American Football League (AFL). While at Southern Illinois University (SIU), Rushing earned more athletic letters than any other athlete in Saluki history. He earned a total of 13 letters while playing football, basketball, track, and wrestling for SIU. Following his career at SIU, Rushing went on to play professional football in both the NFL and AFL. He was inducted into the charter class of the Saluki Hall of Fame in 1978. In 2010 Southern Illinois University honored Saluki Hall of Famer Marion Rushing by renaming a street near the new football stadium, Marion Rushing Lane.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{correlation}} between (1) selected seedling conditions and (2) the participating farmers' knowledge of planting techniques and the seedling mortality of trees supplied by the Pan American Development Foundation's Agroforestry Outreach Project in Haiti. During the spring of 1990 planting season, 18 sample farmers and the trees they received were studied to determine the correlation of several seedling conditions with seedling mortality. <b>Rootball</b> condition, leaf drop, plant turgor, and internal box temperature were measured during seedling transportation from nursery to the field. The farmers' knowledge of planting techniques was determined by a test over a planting guide. The most significant findings were that the seedling mortality was not strongly correlated to either the individual conditions measured or the farmers' knowledge of planting techniques. Collectively, these seedling conditions accounted for approximately 25 percent of the total variation in the seedling mortality...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the combined effect of T. harzianum and FitoMas-E® on germination and growth of tomato seedlings. In the first test tomato seeds cv. Vyta {{they were used to}} treat with solutions FitoMas-E® (2. 0 % v / v) and T. harzianum strain A- 34 concentration of the solid medium of 1. 7 x 109 CFU mL- 1. Germination percentage every six hours by placing 50 seeds per Petri dish of 10 cm diameter with five replicates per treatment is evaluated. In a second test the effect of inoculation of T. harzianum and FitoMas-E® on the growth of tomato seedlings in conditions <b>rootball</b> was evaluated, using trays 264 alveoli and substrate made from peat: soil: rice husks (3 : 2 : 1). Speed and percentage germination of tomato seeds treated FitoMas-E® and T. harzianum was found, combined use increases the values of stem diameter and total and radical mass, which can be exploited for transplanting plants tomato, generating a possible diminution in production costs...|$|E
40|$|Many Mediterranean-type {{ecosystems}} (MTEs) are now {{vulnerable to}} climate change, with some regions predicted {{to undergo a}} shift towards much drier and hotter conditions. Although MTE woodlands are highly resilient to periods of drought and perturbations such as fire, this shift increases the already wide range of threatening processes they face. Without intervention, such as revegetation, many of these woodlands could degrade {{to the point where}} they support little of the original biota. However, in MTEs with hard to predict breaks in the season and nutrient poor soils; seedling establishment success is often very low. Using degraded Eucalyptus gomphocephala woodlands as a case study, we undertook two field trials with five commercially available plant treatments to evaluate their effectiveness in increasing early seedling establishment. We found that the mere addition of seedlings may not be enough to undertake successful revegetation in some degraded woodlands because a) survival rates in controls were, on average 53 % at one of the study sites and b) the supplementation of nutrient resources beneath the <b>rootball</b> when planting increased early seedling growth and health compared with other treatments. We suggest that under emerging and well-recognized challenges to revegetation, supplementing abiotic resources, in particular nutrients applied exclusively beneath planted seedlings, may increase early establishment success...|$|E
40|$|Roots {{are very}} much the ‘hidden half’ of any plant, and no more so that when grown as {{landscape}} plants in the urban environment. Root systems are expected to ‘perform’ {{in a variety of}} difficult and stressful environments, whether they are constrained in containers of limited volume, planted into shallow soils with restricted water / nutrient availability (e. g. green roofs) or even expected to grow in the absence of soil (e. g. within hydroponic systems commonly used in green facades). Lack of appreciation regarding root systems in general is coupled with an incomplete understanding of how root development might influence shoot growth and morphology in urban landscape plants. A limited range of model ornamental species (Philadelphus cv. Aureus, Philadelphus cv. Belle Etoile, Euonymus cv. Silver Queen and Punica granatum) were used, where plant root systems were exposed to a series of typical artificial urban environments such as limited area for growth, compacted soil, waterlogging and physical damage to the root systems in an attempt to identify modifications to root behaviour and the effects on shoot development. Among all the stress factors being studied, flooding was recorded to have the most detrimental effect on urban vegetation where {{there were a number of}} plant deaths recorded in Philadelphus cv. Aureus; whereas Euonymus cv. Silver Queen was observed to be more resistant toward flooding effect. Reduction of root and shoot biomass was an almost universal response when plants were exposed to stress, and this might be due to limited nutrient and water availability especially in compacted soil and smaller <b>rootball</b> geometry. Other commonly observed traits were reductions in height, reductions in leaf marginal area and in some circumstances changes in branching pattern. These physiological adaptations in plants changed the aesthetic character by producing more compact and smaller plants although this was not always significant for all species and environment stresses. In terms of direct root damage, data from one experiment using split-pots systems suggested a certain threshold of root damage needed to be crossed before significant levels of re-growth were activated. Careful species selection is required to ensure urban vegetation is resilient to the stresses commonly encountered, a factor that will be increasingly important with climate change and greater density of urban built infrastructure in future...|$|E
