5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the <b>raised</b> <b>edge</b> of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{badge of}} the Order Nakhimov is a 40mm wide blue {{enamelled}} silver cross pattée {{with a narrow}} <b>raised</b> <b>edge</b> superimposed over a four pointed star, the ruby enamelled rays of which protrude between {{the arms of the}} cross and end in the shape of naval sea anchors. [...] In the center of the obverse, a blue enamelled silver bordered medallion bearing the left profile bust of Admiral Nakhimov over laurel branches.

2500|$|The two entrances {{are further}} defined by side piers and two piers {{directly}} above which {{are decorated with}} raised stone shafts stepping and terminating with floral motifs halfway up the third story. [...] An ornate terra cotta belt separates {{the second and third}} stories. [...] Simple <b>raised</b> <b>edge</b> banding occurs in stone between the eleventh and twelfth stories. The building has no cornice; {{it was one of the}} first buildings in the area to dispense with them. Above the twelfth story, the attic story, is a blind frieze of checkered stonework, terminating in a toothy crown formed by the rise of the piers above the parapet in stepped, zigzag finials. [...] The spandrels between the buildings windows were cast in a geometric pattern and set flush with the piers, spreading the checkered motif downward across the entire facade. [...] The building originally had double hung windows on the upper floors, however they were replaced in 1974 with metal-clad windows.|$|E
2500|$|The 'classic' one-car crash {{results when}} a vehicle slowly drift to the right, hits dirt or rumble strips {{on the right}} {{shoulder}} of the road, and the driver becomes alert and overreacts, jerking the wheel left to bring the vehicle back onto the road. This motion causes the left front tire to strike the <b>raised</b> <b>edge</b> of the pavement at a sharp angle, often causing a rollover or a swerve into oncoming traffic. This form of one-car crash is [...] "classic" [...] because it occurs very often. Raised edges of pavement (or [...] "edge-drops") were once common, but are now recognized as a hazard; it is now standard practice to level the gravel shoulder with the pavement, although edge-drops may reform due to soil erosion. [...] This [...] "slowly drift to the right" [...] scenario applies to jurisdictions with right-hand traffic, so in jurisdictions with left-hand traffic {{it would be a}} [...] "slowly drift to the left" [...] scenario.|$|E
2500|$|It has for a {{long time}} been argued that after Leonardo's death the {{painting}} was cut down by having part of the panel at both sides removed. Early copies depict columns {{on both sides of the}} figure. Only the edges of the bases can be seen in the original. However, some art historians, such as Martin Kemp, now argue that the painting has not been altered, and that the columns depicted in the copies were added by the copyists. The latter view was bolstered during 2004 and 2005 when an international team of 39 specialists undertook the most thorough scientific examination of the Mona Lisa yet undertaken. Beneath the frame (the current one was fitted to the Mona Lisa in 2004) there was discovered a [...] "reserve" [...] around all four edges of the panel. A reserve is an area of bare wood surrounding the gessoed and painted portion of the panel. That this is a genuine reserve, and not the result of removal of the gesso or paint, is demonstrated by a <b>raised</b> <b>edge</b> still existing around the gesso, the result of build up from the edge of brush strokes at the edge of the gesso area.|$|E
50|$|Raindrop {{impressions}} are a geological feature {{characterized by}} small craterlike pits with slightly <b>raised</b> <b>edges</b> {{that are the}} result of the impact of rain on soft sediment surfaces. Sedimentary structures with similar appearance have been found.|$|R

60|$|In fig. 2 {{the leaf}} at the angle is cut, {{exactly in the}} manner of an Egyptian bas-relief, into the stone, with a <b>raised</b> <b>edge</b> round it, and a raised rib up the centre; and this mode of execution, seen also in figs. 4 and 7, is one of the {{collateral}} evidences of early date. But in figs. 5 and 8, where more elaborate effect was required, the leaf is thrown out boldly with an even edge {{from the surface of the}} capital, and enriched on its own surface: and as the treatment of fig. 2 corresponds with that of fig. 4, so that of fig. 5 corresponds with that of fig. 6; 2 and 5 having the upright leaf, 4 and 6 the bending leaves; but all contemporary.|$|E
60|$|Still held {{on without}} a break, the inland barrens and shrubbery, {{the desert and}} the high sand bank with its even slope, the broad white beach, the breakers, the green water on the bar, and the Atlantic Ocean; and we traversed with delight new reaches of the shore; we took another lesson in sea-horses' manes and sea-cows' tails, in sea-jellies and sea-clams, with our new-gained experience. The sea ran hardly less than the day before. It seemed with every wave to be subsiding, because such was our expectation, and yet when hours had elapsed we could see no difference. But there it was, {{balancing}} itself, the restless ocean by our side, lurching in its gait. Each wave left the sand all braided or woven, as it were, with a coarse woof and warp, and a distinct <b>raised</b> <b>edge</b> to its rapid work. We made no haste, since we wished to see the ocean at our leisure; and indeed that soft sand was no {{place in which to}} be in a hurry, for one mile there was as good as two elsewhere. Besides, we were obliged frequently to empty our shoes of the sand which one took in in climbing or descending the bank.|$|E
500|$|The Victoria Cross for Australia is {{identical}} to the original design. It is a [...] "cross pattée 41millimetres high, 36millimetres wide. The arms of the Cross have <b>raised</b> <b>edges.</b> The obverse bears a Crowned Lion standing on the Royal Crown with the words 'FOR VALOUR' inscribed on a semi-circular scroll below the Crown. The reverse bears <b>raised</b> <b>edges</b> on the arms of the cross and the date of the act for which the Cross is awarded is engraved within the circle in the centre. The inscription was originally to have been FOR BRAVERY, until it was changed on the recommendation of Queen Victoria, who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the Victoria Cross were brave in battle. The decoration, suspension bar, and link weigh about 27grams (0.87troy ounces).|$|R
