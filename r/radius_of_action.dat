5|$|After their commissioning, Brummer and Bremse {{served with}} the High Seas Fleet, {{including}} on a sortie into the North Sea in October 1916. The ships laid a minefield off Norderney in January 1917 and guarded minesweepers between March and May that year. In October 1917, Admiral Reinhard Scheer sent the two ships to attack a British convoy to Norway to divert forces protecting convoys in the Atlantic. Scheer chose Brummer and Bremse because of their high speed and large <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Shortly after dawn on 17 October, the two cruisers attacked the convoy, which consisted of twelve merchant ships, two destroyers, and two armed trawlers. The German ships quickly sank the escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve cargo vessels. The British Admiralty was not informed of the attack until Brummer and Bremse were safely steaming back to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Brummer {{was ready}} for service with the fleet by May 1916, though she did not steam {{with the rest of}} the High Seas Fleet for the Battle of Jutland at the end of the month. Despite the fact that they had been built as minelaying cruisers, Brummer and Bremse were never used in this capacity. In the autumn of 1917, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the chief of the Admiralstab, decided to {{supplement}} the U-boat campaign with surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia. In addition to damaging British shipping, Scheer sought to divert escorts from the Atlantic theater, where his U-boats were concentrated. Brummer, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Leonhardi, and Bremse, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Westerkamp, were selected for the first such operation. Their high speed and large <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> coupled with their resemblance to British light cruisers, made them suited to the task. In preparation for the raid, their crews painted the ships dark gray to further camouflage them as British vessels.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of La Violencia, The Air Force had the {{necessity}} to expand its <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> so in 1947 the aeródromo nacional de Apiay was created, named the 17 of November 1948 Base Aérea de Apiay, today it home of the Comando Aéreo de Combate No. 2. In this period, the Air Force became more involved in counterinsurgency tasks and B-26C Invaders were acquired. Also, in 1954, the jet age began for the Colombian Air Force {{with the arrival of}} Silver Star T-33 and six Canadian Sabre Mark IV F-86. The F-86 were retired from service 1966, while the T-33 continued to operate until 1972 when 18 Mirage 5 fighters arrived in three different versions. Sixteen F-80 Shooting Stars were also delivered.|$|E

40|$|A {{theory of}} the {{polarization}} effects in the energy loss of a charged particle is given, in which the mechanism of the loss {{is different from that}} of the Fermi theory. This theory leads to a distribution of the loss between ionization-excitation and emission of Cerenkov radiation which differs considerably from that of the theories on Fermi's lines, although the stopping power is not essentially changed, being somewhat less than in those theories. This treatment leads to an increase of the direct ionization at impact parameters larger than atomic dimensions after the relativistic minimum, the increase being large in the case of gases. The Fermi saturation effect of the loss at distances larger than atomic dimensions does also exist in the present theory, although due to a different mechanism. The relativistic increase of the loss in distant interactions is due largely to an increase <b>of</b> the <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for ionization and excitation (Bohr-Williams mechanism), but there is also a contribution of the Cerenkov radiation (Fermi mechanism). The saturation arises from a limitation of the increase <b>of</b> the <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> due to the polarization of the medium and to the saturation of the emission of Cerenkov radiation. This theory leads to a modification of the formula of Frank and Tamm for the rate of emission of Cerenkov radiation, the emission of high energy Cerenkov radiation being considerably reduced. © 1952 Società Italiana di Fisica.

25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, the U.S. {{military}} tested its forward air control capabilities per FM 31–35 during several joint field maneuvers involving the Army and Air Force. During the maneuvers, radios used for coordinating air action were unreliable; radio nets were overwhelmed with traffic. When the controllers could be contacted, they often had no targets to offer. When they did, they struggled to handle {{more than a}} single flight at a time. The early jet aircraft used for close air support had a voracious appetite for fuel, a short <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> and a short linger time over target. The joint Army/Air Force FAC effort results compared poorly to the U.S. Marines' organic system; it obviously needed drastic improvement.|$|R
25|$|An {{order for}} two {{submarines}} {{had originally been}} placed by Chile in 1911 with the Electric Boat Company of New Jersey. The order was subcontracted to Seattle Construction and Drydock Company {{for a total of}} $818,000. The Electric Boat Company then designed and built a boat in a way that could be taken apart and shipped across country to Seattle to be assembled. After sea trials, the submarines now named Iquique and Antofogasta were refused by the Chilean officials as they had failed to achieve the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> demanded in the contract. At the same time, Chile had allowed its progress payments to fall in arrears. This led the Seattle shipbuilding company to find ways {{to get rid of the}} submarines.|$|E
