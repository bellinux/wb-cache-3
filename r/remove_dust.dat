25|$|The {{statement}} quoted above compares samples {{collected in}} 2001 adjacent to Red Dog industrial activity to samples collected for the Nordic moss monitoring program: samples which are deliberately collected {{as far from}} urban and industrial areas as possible. The Nordic moss monitoring program follows a protocol that demands that samples be collected at least 300 meters from a road and that samples be collected in non-urban areas. Significantly, samples for the study at Red Dog included the loose dust on the moss, while the Nordic moss monitoring program moss samples were shaken to <b>remove</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E

25|$|House dust {{can become}} {{airborne}} easily. Care is required when <b>removing</b> <b>dust</b> to avoid causing the dust to become airborne. A feather duster tends to agitate the dust so it lands elsewhere. Products like Pledge and Swiffer are specifically made for <b>removing</b> <b>dust</b> by trapping it with sticky chemicals.|$|R

2500|$|On August 6, Reuters {{announced}} it would stop all cooperation with Adnan Hajj. Hajj claimed {{he had just been}} trying to <b>remove</b> <b>dust</b> marks, and that he made mistakes due to the bad lighting conditions he was working under. Critics point out that this is impossible, as Hajj's doctored image added an entire plume of smoke, duplicated several buildings, and showed a repeating pattern indicating that one plume of smoke was [...] "cloned" [...] several times.|$|E
50|$|The use of high-gradient {{magnetic}} separation techniques {{should be developed}} to <b>remove</b> <b>dust</b> from the spacesuits following exploration as the fine fraction of the lunar dust is magnetic. Furthermore, vacuums {{can be used to}} <b>remove</b> <b>dust</b> from spacesuits.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, many of {{the most}} famous {{painters}} in the world converged on Provence, drawn by the climate and the clarity of the light.

2500|$|... 1905: A {{manually}} powered domestic {{vacuum cleaner}} is invented by manufacturer Walter Griffiths of 72, Conybere Street, Highgate. It is originally patented as 'Griffiths' Improved Vacuum Apparatus for <b>Removing</b> <b>Dust</b> from Carpets'. Although an electric cleaner is patented in 1901 by H. Cecil Booth, Griffiths' design is {{more similar to}} modern portable cleaners than Booth's cart-mounted device.|$|R
50|$|Dust-Off was {{developed}} and introduced in 1970 by an employee at Falcon Safety Products who discovered that the pressurized blasts used to sound the alarm in the company’s signal horns could also <b>remove</b> <b>dust</b> from photography equipment and film without having to touch the surface.|$|E

5000|$|Whilst the {{majority}} of the grain falls through the concave, the straw is carried by a set of [...] "walkers" [...] {{to the rear of the}} machine, allowing any grain and chaff still in the straw to fall below. Below the straw walkers, a fan blows a stream of air across the grain, <b>removing</b> <b>dust</b> and fines and blowing them away.|$|R
30|$|Sublimation <b>removes</b> <b>dust</b> {{particles}} {{with temperatures}} higher than their sublimation temperature. In the spectral energy distribution, the flux density from a disk reduces with decreasing wavelength, if the wavelength is {{shorter than the}} peak one of the blackbody spectrum with the sublimation temperature. That {{could be seen as}} a sublimation evidence. However, it is difficult to find signs from a sublimation ring in the spectral energy distribution.|$|R
