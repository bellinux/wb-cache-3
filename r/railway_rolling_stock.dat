5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of Japanese air {{opposition}} to the American bomber raids, VIIFighter Command was solely tasked with ground attack missions from July. These raids were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft being held in reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots only occasionally encountered Japanese fighters in the air, the airfields were protected by anti-aircraft batteries and barrage balloons. By the end of the war, VIIFighter Command had conducted 51 ground attack raids, of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships along with large numbers of buildings and <b>railway</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.|$|E

A total of 17 Australian bombers were lost during these operations, including six that German fighters shot down during {{an attack on the}} marshalling yards at Lille on the night of 10/11 May. In addition, Australians took part in 29 of the 46 raids conducted by 2TAF's light bombers against French railway infrastructure. Australian fighter pilots, including all of No.453 Squadron on occasion, escorted some of these raids and conducted ground attack sorties targeting <b>railway</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> 2TAF's fighter-bombers also attacked bridges over the river Seine from April {{as part of an effort}} to seal off the Normandy region, and Australian pilots posted to British squadrons were involved in a small number of these operations. No.453 Squadron attacked bridges and viaducts near Normandy on 27 April and 2 May.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} actively {{promoted the}} export of high-speed rail technology to countries including Mexico, Thailand, the United Kingdom, India, Russia and Turkey.

Egorias discharged crew, {{which had been}} engaged in a survey mission for a cable-laying project to Vancouver, New Zealand, exchanged places with the relieving crew aboard Port Victor for the return voyage to Britain. Port Victor was back in Melbourne by May 1890, with a cargo of ammunition and <b>railway</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> for the government, in addition to four draught horses presumably brought out for breeding purposes.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} period, with Crawford Gordon as president, A.V. Roe Canada Ltd. {{purchased}} {{a number of}} companies, including Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, Canada Car and Foundry (1957), and Canadian Steel Improvement. By 1958, A. V. Roe Canada Ltd. was an industrial giant with over 50,000 employees in a far-flung empire of 44 companies involved in coal mining, steel making, <b>railway</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> aircraft and aero-engine manufacturing, as well as computers and electronics. In 1956 the companies generated 45% of the revenue of the Hawker Siddeley Group. In 1958, annual sales revenue was approximately $450 million, ranking A.V. Roe Canada as the third largest corporation in Canada by capitalization. By {{the time of the}} cancellation of the Arrow and Iroquois, aircraft-related production amounted to approximately 40% of the company's activities with 60% industrial and commercial.|$|E
500|$|The Ohio & Indiana Railway Company was {{incorporated}} in 1903. [...] During the same year, a [...] line was built from the New York Central Railroad {{station in the}} nearby city of Angola to {{the southern tip of}} Lake James. Following difficulties in acquiring rolling stock, additional financial backers joined the company and renamed it the Angola Railway and Power Company—although the railroad was always known as the Lake James Electric <b>Railway.</b> <b>Rolling</b> <b>stock</b> totaled only three pieces of equipment: two electric passenger cars and an open trailer.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{isolated}} and rural {{nature of the}} Isle of Wight's <b>railways,</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> has tended to be made up from displaced older vehicles, rebuilt or modified as required. Following the work undertaken during the line's closure {{during the winter of}} 1966 - 67, the ceiling of Ryde Tunnel is 10 inches too low for standard National Rail vehicle types to clear.|$|R
50|$|On 22 July 1870, the {{mobilisation}} for the Franco-Prussian War {{made the}} main line unusable by the public at several points between Rastatt and Offenburg. The Baden State <b>Railway’s</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> fleet at that time mostly consisted of two-axle compartment coaches, while the Royal Württemberg State Railways had sets of open coaches from the beginning. Baden later also moved to this system.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} {{with the rest of}} the Rhaetian <b>Railway's</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> the Be 4/4 commuter trains are fitted with automatic couplings and air brakes; mixed use of the vehicles with other <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> is therefore not possible. In 1979, the Rhaetian Railway acquired two practically identical three car trains with traffic numbers ending in 15 and 16. After four additional intermediate cars (B 2417-2420) joined the fleet in 1988, four car trains could also be operated.|$|R
