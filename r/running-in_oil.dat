40|$|Bosch Rexroth Hägglunds Drives AB {{manufactures}} hydraulic motors, {{a mechanical}} device that transforms energy from a liquid medium to kinetic energy. The piston assembly in the motor consists of both sliding and rolling interfaces. During start {{and when the}} speed is low, these surfaces will be in contact without any separating lubrication film. This is called boundary lubrication and causes high friction losses. When the motor obtains its lift-off speed a transition from a mixed lubrication regime where the surfaces in the piston assembly are partly separated to a full film lubrication where they are completely separated by a lubrication film takes place. Running-in of an assembly is made to assure good conformity of the surfaces. The wear rate of the surfaces is high during running-in, but when the asperities of the surface are worn down, the wear that occurs after the running-in period will be mild and controlled. In this thesis work investigations were performed {{to determine if a}} lubricant in conjunction with a diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating can be used to improve running-in of the roller-piston interface of the motor. This could thereby decrease the lift-off speed and boundary friction. The running-in lubricant is proposed to be used during the 30 minute delivery test that is performed at Bosch Rexroth Hägglunds Drives to ensure improved and reliable functioning of the motor. In the experiments, varying concentrations of anti-wear (AW) and extreme pressure (EP) additives were blended into mineral base oil and reciprocating conformal and counterformal tribological tests were performed. The wear and the surface roughness of the samples after the test were investigated with an optical profiler and scanning electron microscopy. It could be concluded that a high content of EP additive gave the highest amount of wear of the tested additive combinations, while the AW content did not seem to affect the results. Oil with high EP content could therefore work as a <b>running-in</b> <b>oil,</b> and should be further tested in a piston test rig. Validerat; 20110617 (anonymous...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{engineering}} often uses fluid lubrication {{to limit}} friction. Even {{in the presence}} of a lubricant, metallic contact between the sliding surfaces may readily occur. In <b>running-in,</b> the <b>oil</b> film thickness can be so thin that contact arises at the summit of asperities, thus, increasing both the friction coefficient and wear. Such regimes are the so-called mixed or boundary lubrication. In these situations, the friction coefficient varies continuously and it is therefore, necessary to calculate the friction coefficient at any given moment. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{tribological}} {{properties of}} Hi-HVOF sprayed WC-Cr-Ni cermet coatings were investigated experimentally under lubricated rolling-sliding contact. Coatings were deposited onto the induction hardened carbon steel and carburized hardened steel materials. Substrate surfaces were prepared by axially grinding, blasting and circumferentially grinding. Under the operating conditions of contact pressure PH= 1. 4 GPa and slip ratio s=- 28. 0 %, {{the effects of}} substrate hardness and substrate surface kind on the tribological properties of the cermet coat-ing were examined. It was found that cermet coating showed a long life and durability was not influenced by the substrate hardness and sub-strate surface kind. It was also found that during the <b>running-in</b> process, <b>oil</b> film formation was hardly influenced by the substrate hardness and substrate surface kind. On the other hand, surface hardness and surface roughness of the coating were more influenced {{in the case of}} circumferen-tially ground substrate than {{that in the case of}} axially ground or blasted substrate. In addition, coating material loss was very high in the case of circumferentially ground substrate when the sub-strate material was induction hardened carbon steel...|$|R
