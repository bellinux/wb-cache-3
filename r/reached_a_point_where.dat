25|$|The {{crowning}} {{achievement of the}} Progressive era was {{the passing of the}} Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Volstead Act, which together outlawed the sale of liquor. Even before this most communities in Texas and across the U.S. had <b>reached</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> most vice activities, including gambling and liquor, were firmly outlawed. Prohibition of liquor, though publicly embraced by community leaders, was privately widely unpopular in the state. Moonshining, the illegal production of liquor, had become increasingly common in the late 19th century. Moonshiners, notorious gamblers, and other outlaws had come to be seen by many as folk heroes. The passage of Prohibition nationwide had the immediate effect of creating a lucrative opportunity for organized crime and other individuals to supply the now illegal beverages. Among the greatest beneficiaries were the organized crime syndicates in Galveston, which became the primary importers and suppliers for Houston, Dallas, Denver, St. Louis and Omaha, as well as numerous other communities in Texas and the Midwest. This development became the genesis of a thriving tourist industry on the island run by organized crime figures Sam and Rosario Maceo.McComb (McComb), p. 33.|$|E

25|$|After {{defeating}} Khwarazm in 1221, Genghis prepared his armies {{to punish}} Western Xia for their betrayal. Meanwhile, Emperor Shenzong {{stepped down from}} power in 1223, leaving his son, Xianzong, in his place. In 1225, Genghis Khan attacked with a force of approximately 180,000. After taking Khara-Khoto, the Mongols began a steady advance southward. Asha, commander of the Western Xia troops, {{could not afford to}} meet the Mongols as it would involve an exhausting westward march from the capital Yinchuan through 500 kilometers of desert. With no army to meet them in pitched battle, the Mongols picked the best targets for attack and as each city fell the Mongols would draw on prisoners, defectors, supplies, and weapons to take the next one. Enraged by Western Xia's fierce resistance, Genghis engaged the countryside in annihilative warfare and ordered his generals to systematically destroy cities and garrisons as they went. Two months after taking Khara-Khoto, the Mongols <b>reached</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> the Qilian Mountains force the Etsin River eastward, about 300 kilometers south of Khara-Khoto. At this point, Genghis divided his army, sending general Subutai {{to take care of the}} westernmost cities, while the main force moved east into the heart of the Western Xia Empire. Genghis lay siege to Suzhou, which fell after five weeks. Genghis then moved to Ganzhou, the hometown of his general Chagaan. Chagaan's father still commanded the city garrison, so Chagaan attempted negotiations with him. However, the second-in-command of the city staged a coup, killed Chagaan's father, and refused to surrender. The city took five months to subdue, and though the now furious Genghis threatened vengeance, Chagaan convinced him to only kill the 35 conspirators who killed Chagaan's father.|$|E

Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore.
