Using a local fitness function, the algorithm greedily expands natural communities of seeds until the whole graph is covered. The hierarchy of communities is obtained analytically by calculating <b>resolution</b> <b>levels</b> at which communities grow rather than numerically by testing different <b>resolution</b> <b>levels.</b> This analytic procedure {{is not only}} more exact than its numerical alternatives such as LFM and GCE but also much faster. Critical <b>resolution</b> <b>levels</b> can be identified by searching for intervals in which large changes of the resolution do not lead to growth of communities.

40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for activation detection in event-related functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). The method is based on the analysis of selected <b>resolution</b> <b>levels</b> (a subspace) in translation invariant wavelet transform (TIWT) domain. Using a priori knowledge about the activation signal and trends, we analyze their power in different <b>resolution</b> <b>levels</b> in TIWT domain and select an optimal set of <b>resolution</b> <b>levels.</b> A randomization-based statistical test is then applied in the wavelet domain for activation detection. This approach suppresses the effects of trends and enhances the detection sensitivity. In addition, since TIWT is insensitive to signal translations, the power analysis is robust with respect to signal shifts. The randomization test alleviates the need for assumptions about fMRI noise. The method has been applied to simulated and experimental fMRI datasets. Comparisons have been made between the results of the proposed method, a similar method in the time domain and the cross-correlation method. The proposed method has shown superior sensitivity compared to the other methods.

40|$|We {{show that}} unless the target density is {{particularly}} smooth, cross-validation applied directly to nonlinear wavelet estimators produces an empirical value of primary resolution which fails, by an order of magnitude, to give asymptotic optimality. We note, too, that in the same setting, but for different reasons, cross-validation of the linear component of a wavelet estimator fails to give asymptotic optimality, if the primary <b>resolution</b> <b>level</b> that it suggests {{is applied to the}} nonlinear form of the estimator. We propose an alternative technique, based on multiple cross-validation of the linear component. Our method involves dividing the region of interest into a number of subregions, choosing a <b>resolution</b> <b>level</b> by cross-validation of the linear part of the estimator in each subregion, and taking the final empirically chosen level to be the minimum of the subregion values. This approach exploits the relative resistance of wavelet methods to over-smoothing: the final <b>resolution</b> <b>level</b> is too small {{in some parts of the}} main region, but that has a relatively minor effect on performance of the final estimator. The fact that we use the same <b>resolution</b> <b>level</b> throughout the region, rather than a different level in each subregion, means that we do not need to splice together different estimates and remove artificial jumps where the subregions abut...|$|R
