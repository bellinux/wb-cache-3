5000|$|The spark {{ignition}} engine was a refinement of the early engines which used Hot Tube ignition. When Bosch developed the magneto it became the primary system for producing electricity to energize a spark plug. [...] Many small engines still use magneto ignition. Small engines are started by hand cranking using a <b>recoil</b> <b>starter</b> or hand crank [...] Prior to Charles F. Kettering of Delco's development of the automotive starter all gasoline engined automobiles used a hand crank.|$|E
5000|$|The Zia is {{constructed}} from fiberglass with a carbon fiber wing spar. The aircraft has fixed tricycle gear featuring wheel pants. The specified engine is the [...] Rotax 277 two-stroke, which is {{started with a}} manual <b>recoil</b> <b>starter.</b> The aircraft has flaps which deploy to 45° and retract anytime the flap handle is released, intentionally preventing the use of flaps and throttle at the same time. Fuel is 4 u.s.gal L carried in the left wing root tank.|$|E
5000|$|Another motorglider {{conversion}} {{was used}} by [...] "Vestjysk Svæveflyveklub" [...] in Denmark: it had a small Wankel rotary engine mounted in a nacelle on an aluminium stick above the main spar. The engine wase started with a <b>recoil</b> <b>starter</b> like a lawn mower. The high RPM of the device made it extremely unpopular: the propeller tips created a permanent sonic boom, that made the plane extremely noisy. The harassed citizens of Esbjerg nicknamed the plane 'the flying circular saw' and the engine was removed.|$|E
5000|$|Electric {{starting}} {{is available}} for small engines and is found primarily on high-feature garden machinery and larger generators particularly where {{there is already a}} complex electrical system and there may be a need for auto-starting on demand. However, a self-retracting rope-pull mechanism called a <b>recoil</b> <b>starter</b> is the predominant method of starting small engines; it does not require a battery to power a starter motor, nor an alternator to keep a battery charged. Before the invention of the <b>recoil</b> <b>starter,</b> a notched pulley was attached to the engine's flywheel; the operator would manually wind a rope around the pulley then jerk the rope to rotate the engine so that it would start. Another starting method briefly popular in the 1960s was the [...] "impulse" [...] or [...] "wind-up" [...] starter. These were operated by winding a heavy spring by means of a rotating crank handle equipped with a sprag clutch, then releasing the spring's tension by means of a lever or knob so that it would spin the engine. These were discontinued when safety problems became apparent: it was possible to leave the starter wound up and ready to start the engine unintentionally, even long after the crank was wound up, if the release were jarred.|$|E
50|$|The 215 is a {{conventional}} single-cylinder engine that weighs 39 lb in its 215R aircraft version. The engine features single breaker and points ignition, with single {{capacitor discharge ignition}} used on the current models. It also incorporates piston porting, tuned exhaust system, single carburetor, fan cooling, fuel pump, a cast iron cylinder liner, ball, needle and roller bearings throughout. The 215R aircraft version was offered with an optional belt reduction system and the modern industrial versions have an optional gearbox with ratios of 2.04, 2.65 and 3.06. Starting is a <b>recoil</b> <b>starter</b> with a custom electric starter available as an option.|$|E
50|$|The Elan was {{a popular}} {{snowmobile}} that was built by Skidoo from 1971 to 1996. They were offered with a rather large variety of option including 1 or 2 cylinder engines, different designs on the hood, and other choices. In 1971 the Elans originally came with rotax engines 250cc (247cc) single cylinder rated at 12 hp which had the options of having an electric start {{as well as a}} <b>recoil</b> <b>starter.</b> in 1973 they introduced 2 new engines, a 250cc (247cc)twin cylinder rated at 16 hp had a standard muffler and a single HR carb, and the SS model that was a 250 (247cc) twin cylinder rated at 22 hp with dual HR carbs, tuned exhaust, disc brake, and new standard chrome bumper.|$|E
5000|$|To start a glow engine, {{a direct}} current (around 3 amps and 1.25 to 2 volts, often {{provided}} by a single, high current capacity rechargeable NiCd, NiMH or lead-acid battery cell, or a purpose-built [...] "power panel" [...] running on a 12VDC source) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, initially heating the filament. (The name 'glow plug' {{comes from the fact that}} the plug's filament glows red hot.) The engine is then spun from the outside using a manual crank, built-in rope-based <b>recoil</b> <b>starter,</b> spring-loaded motor or purpose-built electric motor, or by hand, to introduce fuel to the chamber. Once the fuel has ignited and the engine is running, the electrical connection is no longer needed and can be removed. Each combustion keeps the glow plug filament glowing red hot, allowing it to ignite the next charge, thus sustaining the power cycle.|$|E
5000|$|The D-400 series engine or the Iron Horse {{engine was}} a {{light-duty}} two-stroke engine used for powering lawnmowers {{produced in the}} 1960s to the early 1980s. D-400 engines were single-cylinder engines designed and manufactured by the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC; Johnson and Evinrude) for Lawn-Boy and Masport. The D-400 engines displaced 109 cc, generated 2.61 kW of power, and operated {{in the range of}} 2400-3300 RPM. The engines have a distinctive rectangular cowling that has created a nickname of Brick-top mowers. Another distinctive feature is the two-finger vertical <b>recoil</b> <b>starter.</b> The kidney-shaped muffler and exhaust unit is mounted beneath the mowers' deck and gives the engine a small, low profile design when compared to the newer and more powerful lawnmower engines. The ignition system employs a magneto, points, and a condenser (capacitor) set-up with an unusual spark-advance system which utilised a weight on the crankshaft to adjust the spark-advance amount depending on engine speed. The sprung governor was also unusual with a throw-yoke which operated under the flywheel and was linked to the throttle. The carburettor was a float design and fed into a pair of reed valves.|$|E
5000|$|The Seagull {{outboard}} motor had a simple single cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. Atop {{the engine was}} a magneto, and on its port side was a simple carburetter with no air filter. Even a rudimentary rubber [...] "storm cowl" [...] was an optional extra, and induction noise when running was pronounced. Above the cylinder head was bolted a small brass fuel tank whose 10:1 fuel/oil mix was gravity-fed to the carb via a clear plastic tube that served to capture dirt particles in its U-bend. A simple plastic filter filter on the banjo union to the carb gave rudimentary secondary filtering, {{but it was still}} not unusual for the carb jets to become blocked. Starting was effected with a hand-wound pull-rope, although a <b>recoil</b> <b>starter</b> became an option in due course. Connecting the motor to the gearbox and propeller werere two downtubes, the forward one containing the drive shaft and the aft tube serving as the exhaust, which vented underwater. This arrangement meant that the engine could not be rotated 360 degrees as can more modern engines. The Seagull handbook advises that the engine can be safely run at full throttle (partly to prevent the spark-plug from oiling up) but adds that is wasteful to try to exceed the maximum design speed of a displacement hull, suggesting a [...] "one-third open throttle" [...] usually suffices. The engines proved very rugged as they used high quality materials, and would last for years even in harsh marine environments and in developing countries. Seagull outboards were utilitarian in nature with a relatively slow-turning prop, and so were ideal for use in dinghies, tenders and small yachts. The Silver Century Plus model could propel a displacement hull of up to 26 feet in length; but all Seagull outboards were unsuitable for high speed craft.|$|E
