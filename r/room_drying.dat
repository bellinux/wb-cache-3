40|$|The {{effects of}} loading frequency, strain amplitude, and {{saturation}} on elastic moduli and attenuation have been measured in {{samples of the}} Topopah Spring Member welded tuff. Four different laboratory techniques {{have been used to}} determine Young`s modulus and extensional wave attenuation at frequencies ranging from 10 {sup {minus} 2 } to 10 {sup 6 } Hz.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of anisotropic strength and deformation behavior of coal measure shale. The effect of two factors (i. e., anisotropy and water content) on shale strength and deformation behavior was studied. A series of uniaxial and triaxial compression {{tests were conducted}} on both <b>room</b> <b>dried</b> and water saturated samples for different lamination angles. The test results indicate that (1) the compressive strength, cohesion, internal friction angle, tangent Young’s modulus, and axial strain corresponding to the peak and residual strengths of <b>room</b> <b>dried</b> specimens exhibit anisotropic behavior that strongly depends on the orientation angle (β); (2) {{in comparison to the}} <b>room</b> <b>dried</b> samples, the compressive strength and Young’s modulus as well as the anisotropy are all reduced for water saturated specimens; and (3) the failure mechanism of the samples can be summarized into two categories: sliding along lamination and shearing of rock material, with the type occurring in a particular situation depending strongly on the lamination orientation angles with respect to the major principal stress. According to the findings, it is strongly recommended that the effect of anisotropy and water content on the strength and deformation behavior of the rock must be considered in ground control designs...|$|R

The RNLI saw a change in the pattern of casualties with an increasing number of services required to rescue bathers washed out to sea, people on lilos, dinghies, and various small water craft. It was realised locally that a faster first response was needed to attend such situations and to relieve the bigger neighbouring stations of Cromer, Sheringham, Caister and Great Yarmouth and Gorleston.In 1965 the Happisburgh Inshore Lifeboat Station was opened.

40|$|Abstract. Hydroxyapatite (HA) {{scaffold}} was fabricated using template method. Secondary {{phase of}} poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was then {{introduced into the}} porous structure of the HA scaffold by the freeze drying method or the <b>room</b> <b>drying</b> process. Compression test and SEM were done to examine the mechanical properties and the microstructural morphology of the composite scaffolds. It {{was found that the}} compressive strength and modulus tend to increase with increasing PCL concentration. HA/PCL scaffolds fabricated under the <b>room</b> <b>drying</b> process exhibited higher compression strength and modulus than HA/PCL scaffolds prepared by the freeze drying method because the porous HA surfaces were completely covered by PCL in the <b>room</b> <b>drying</b> scaffolds. XRD test was also used to study the phase stability of the scaffolds. It was confirmed that there was no chemical reaction between PCL and HA. On overall, the results indicated that the introduction of secondary PCL phases into the porous HA scaffold can improve the low strength and toughness of the pure HA scaffold and the HA/PCL composite scaffolds might be a potential candidate in bone tissue engineering...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 81 - 86) The {{effect of}} three drying methods (room, tray, and freeze drying) moisture content, and packaging during storage on folacin content of mulukhiyah, {{which is one}} of the most common vegetables in Egypt, was investigated. It was found that fresh mulukhiyah contained 556 mcg free folic acid (FFA) and 800 mcg total folic acid (TFA) per 100 g fresh weight basis, and room dried mulukhiyah contained 662 mcg FFA, and 1138 mcg TFA per 100 g dry weight. Therefore, mulukhiyah is an excellent source of folate in the Egyptian diet. The destruction of folic acid in mulukhiyah was high in all three drying methods studied. The retention of FFA ranged from 34 to 42 percent, and TFA ranged from 42 to 48 percent. Retention of TFA was always higher than that of FFA during drying because of 70 percent of the TFA in mulukhiyah is FFA, which is more sensitive to heat than total folacin. Freeze drying method resulted in high folacin retention than the other drying methods. Approximately 10 percent more TFA was preserved by the freeze drying method than that retained by the <b>room</b> <b>drying</b> method while the differences in folacin retention between the tray drying and the <b>room</b> <b>drying</b> methods was 7 percent. The retention of folacin in room dried mulukhiyah during storage varied depending on the packaging method. There was a significant difference (P< 0. 01) in folacin retention between mulukhiyah packed in colored or clear jars under nitrogen or air atmosphere, and length of storage time. There was a significant decrease in folic acid retention with storage time of 48 weeks under all the conditions. Mulukhiyah stored in brown jars packed under nitrogen had the highest retention of folic acid followed by the brown jars with air. The clear jars with nitrogen had similar folic acid retention as that stored in brown jars with air. Severe destruction of folic acid occurred in clear jars with air atmosphere. It is recommended that <b>room</b> <b>drying</b> be continued as a home dehydration method for mulukhiyah because it causes insignificant higher folacin loss than the other methods. Tray drying might be adopted on a commercial level while freeze drying would be too costly for the purpose of folacin retention. It is also recommended that dried mulukhiyah be stored in colored containers and, if possible, under nitrogen packing...|$|E
