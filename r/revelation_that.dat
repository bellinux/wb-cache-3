5|$|It {{soon became}} {{evident that the}} Dominicans needed to {{reestablish}} themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, while de las Casas was in Spain, Francisco Marroquín, bishop of Guatemala, placed the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real. The Dominicans dedicated themselves to destroying indigenous temples and idols, and preached sermons with destructive imagery, such as from the Book of <b>Revelation,</b> <b>that</b> were more familiar to the Mesoamerican worldview. Saints were associated with animals, {{in much the same}} way as the Indians identified themselves with nahual spirit-forms. Different Mesoamerican otherworlds were tied to Christian concepts, where the Mictlan world of the dead became Hell, Ihuicatl became Heaven, and Tlalocan became Paradise.|$|E

5|$|Later volumes {{were also}} praised; Otaku USAs Joseph Luster {{appreciated}} the series' battles and Allen's development. The <b>revelation</b> <b>that</b> Allen {{would be an}} enemy of the Order and the 14th Noah was well received by Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock and Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post. However, Goodman criticized early-volume reliance on comedy rather than plot. Beveridge and Erkael of Manga News were impressed with Kanda's dark past. Douresseaux liked Allen's situation in volume 21 (due to the character's connections with the Noah), and wanted to see more of that and less of Kanda's fight with Alma Karma.|$|E

5|$|The Theban Cycle {{deals with}} events {{associated}} especially with Cadmus, the city's founder, and {{later with the}} doings of Laius and Oedipus at Thebes; a series of stories {{that lead to the}} eventual pillage of that city {{at the hands of the}} Seven Against Thebes and Epigoni. (It is not known whether the Seven Against Thebes figured in early epic.) As far as Oedipus is concerned, early epic accounts seem to have him continuing to rule at Thebes after the <b>revelation</b> <b>that</b> Iokaste was his mother, and subsequently marrying a second wife who becomes the mother of his children — markedly different from the tale known to us through tragedy (e.g. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex) and later mythological accounts.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} marred by the <b>revelation</b> <b>that</b> a Texas player had been {{competing}} under an assumed name. Other off-the-field incidents also took place prior to the game.
