40|$|This paper {{provides}} an axiomatization of a cardinal welfare measure {{for the evaluation}} of income and opportunity. Following Roemer's (1998) formulation of equality of opportunity, we divide the society in n <b>effort</b> <b>groups</b> consisting of subsets of agents who exert a comparable degree of effort. We show that social welfare can be measured as the sum of n partial indices, one for each <b>effort</b> <b>group,</b> each of which consists of a function of the aggregate income of the group and its dispersion (measured by Theil's first inequality index). ...|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} study examined how {{different types of}} praise moderated the effect of normative information on students’ self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation when they face challenges. Two hundred and Fifty Form 1 and 2 students (114 females, 136 males) {{were randomly assigned to}} six different conditions, using a 2 (Normative information: with normative information, without normative information) X 3 (Praise: ability praise, effort praise, no praise) between-groups design. Students first worked on a logical reasoning task and received a bogus quantitative feedback of a high score (8 out of 10) and a written qualitative feedback according to their assigned conditions. Students then did a similar but more challenging task and checked their scores before completing measures of self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Self-reported measure showed that after facing setbacks, students <b>receiving</b> <b>effort</b> praise and normative information in the first task indicated significantly lower self-efficacy than the students only <b>receiving</b> <b>effort</b> praise. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Keywords: effort praise, ability praise,published_or_final_versionEducational PsychologyMasterMaster of Social Science...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{embedded}} {{indicators of}} suboptimal effort on objective neurocognitive testing {{is essential for}} detecting increasingly sophisti-cated forms of symptom feigning. The current study explored whether Symbol Span, a novel Wechsler Memory Scale-fourth edition measure of supraspan visual attention, {{could be used to}} discriminate adequate effort from suboptimal effort. Archival data were collected from 136 veterans classified into Poor Effort (n 42) and Good <b>Effort</b> (n 94) <b>groups</b> based on symptom validity test (SVT) performance. The Poor <b>Effort</b> <b>group</b> had significantly lower raw scores (p,. 001) and age-corrected scaled scores (p,. 001) than the Good <b>Effort</b> <b>group</b> on the Symbol Span test. A raw score cutoff of, 14 produced 83 % specificity and 50 % sensitivity for detection of Poor Effort. Similarly, sensitivity was 52 % and specificity was 84 % when employing a cutoff of, 7 for Age-Corrected Scale Score. Collectively, present results suggest that Symbol Span can effectively differentiate veterans with multiple failures on established free-standing and embedded SVTs...|$|R

Jordy Nelson set a new school record for receiving yards in a season after collecting 125 yards on nine catches, breaking James Terry's mark of 1,232 set back in 2003.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{clinical}} utility of memory minus Working Memory Index (memory-WMI) discrepancy scores on the WMS-III for detecting poor effort in 145 personal injury litigants (19 poor effort, 126 adequate effort). On average, participants in the poor <b>effort</b> <b>group</b> performed significantly lower on all WMS-III memory indexes and demonstrated larger memory-WMI discrepancy scores compared to participants in the adequate <b>effort</b> <b>group.</b> Discriminant function analyses using memory-WMI discrepancy scores as independent variables revealed poor overall classification rates (60. 0 % to 63. 4 %). Based on the prevalence of unusually suppressed attention-concentration ability relative to memory functioning using unidirectional memory-WMI discrepancy scores, high specificity and negative predictive power values were found. However, there was unacceptably low sensitivity and positive predictive power. These results suggest that memory-WMI discrepancy scores on the WMS-III do not provide clinically useful information regarding response set and should be used cautiously as an indicator of poor effort...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyze and relate the leadership behaviors and communication styles required of Infantry junior officers in their daily command tasks, in order to influence their subordinates to achieve extraordinary <b>effort,</b> <b>group</b> effectiveness and satisfaction. For this study, was used quantitative method and a survey was implemented comprising three questionnaires: one on leadership competences, one on communication styles, and one on with three criterion factors (extraordinary <b>effort,</b> <b>group</b> effectiveness and satisfaction). The survey was administered to a sample of 804 soldiers (30 Junior Officers, 81 Sergeants and 693 privates and corporals). The analysis of the data revealed that subordinates perceive that their commanders (junior officers) practice task oriented leadership behaviors, particularly on “orientation to the mission” and “decision making”. The behaviors exhibited by the officers strongly and positively relate with the “assertive” communication style. Moreover, all leadership behaviors practiced by the officers are strongly associated to the criterion factors, {{with the exception of the}} leadership dimension “vision”, which presents weaker correlations. The leadership dimensions that junior officers can conduct to promote satisfaction is “conflict management” and “participative leadership”. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

In response to each problem <b>received,</b> <b>effort</b> is applied in real time to generate a solution and problem solving ends when a solution is rendered. We examine continual computation, reasoning policies that capture a broader conception of problem by considering the proactive allocation of computational resources to potential future challenges. We explore policies for allocating idle time for several settings and present applications that highlight opportunities for harnessing continual computation in real-world tasks...|$|R
