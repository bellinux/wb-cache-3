The locomotive then made a series of appearances on the Great Central Railway, for both testing and <b>running-in</b> purposes, but has since returned to Didcot where it is now being prepared to operate on the main line. In 2014, the GWS was given derogation by network rail to use a portable GSMR radio unit on 6023, Saving money and enabling the unit to be used on the GWS's locomotives yet to work on the mainline such as 2999 and 4079.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the belt}} usually {{continues}} {{to change its}} shape so that it eventually acquires the same shape as before being turned but in the opposite direction.

5000|$|The N15 {{design was}} {{approved}} by the LSWR management committee, though the order for construction was postponed until wartime control of raw materials was relaxed. Government approval was obtained in mid - 1918, and Eastleigh Works began to produce the LSWR’s first new locomotive class since 1914. The first locomotives, later known by crewmen as the [...] "Urie N15s", were built in two ten-engine batches by the LSWR's Eastleigh Works between 1918 - 19 and 1922 - 23. Of the first batch, the prototype, No. 736 entered service on 31 August 1918, with four more appearing between September 1918 and April 1919. They shared a similar profile to Urie's H15 class with the use of flat-sided Drummond-style cabs with gently curving roofs. The double bogie tenders were outwardly similar in appearance to those used on the H15s, although strengthened during construction with extra internal bracing to hold 5000 imp gal of water. A shortage of copper delayed completion of Nos. 741 - 745, and the last of the batch emerged from Eastleigh in November 1919. After the <b>running-in</b> of Nos. 736 - 745 and an intensification of the LSWR timetable to the West Country, a second batch of ten was ordered in October 1921. They entered service over the period June 1922 - March 1923, and were numbered in the series 746 - 755.|$|E

It was located close to the start-finish line of the Southern 100 circuit and was removed after a considerable time out of use in April 2014. This was the first [...] "new" [...] station on the line since the halt serving Lough Ned Country Park (between Douglas and Port Soderick) was established in 1979; this however was closed in 1986 upon {{the demise of the}} park. School Hill was fitted with a vinyl banner as a station <b>running-in</b> board in the current house style, featuring bilingual titling°. When in operation the halt was manned by a station attendant and control of it was via internal radio communication with the station.

Today there is no trace of the temporary on the site.|$|E
50|$|DG 772/DG 2255 {{was saved}} by the Diesel Traction Group in 1983. In 1988, 772 was repainted into the {{traditional}} NZR red with larch yellow nose stripes on {{the noise of the}} loco (as it was introduced) for the Ferrymead 125 celebrations, during which it hauled its first excursion train with DE 511 to Springfield and return. During the early 1990s, it also hauled a few more excursion including on the Otago Central Railway and on the Midland Line. In 1995, 772 was then placed on loan to the Weka Pass Railway to cover for their DG 770 while it was out of service for repairs. It was then placed into storage between mid to late 1990s, the loco was place into storage until 2002 when it was decided to overhaul the locomotive to current mainline standards. as part of this, the locomotive's Westinghouse A7EL brake system was replaced by the newer 26L system, and it was fitted with ditch lights, a VHF radio and an events recorder to allow it to run on the main line. The overhaul was completed in 2009, just in time of the 125th anniversary of the Otago Central Railway. Before it was sent south for the anniversary, the 'DG' was leased to the Weka Pass Railway for <b>running-in</b> purposes. The loco has ran several excursions since then, as well it has been occasionally been seen running on the Ferrymead Railway at the Ferrymead Heritage Park.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title is}} {{believed}} to derive from the once prolific mining activity in the surrounding area, being {{a reference to the}} [...] "level" [...] of one of the mine adits; the mine ruins are still discernible in the hills directly above the area. It is one of two areas that carry the colloquial name, the other being Level Rushen, although the two are often confused as they are in the same sheading of the island. The name was adopted by the railway when the site officially became a request stop as early as 1928 when it first appeared in the timetable. Today the painted <b>running-in</b> board declares the halt as The Level (bilingual since 2008 to include the Yn Laare translation into the gaelic) but in the past it has been variously called Colby Level, Level, Level (Rushen) etc., and a metal nameboard stating Colby Level - Crossing installed in 1973 remained in place until 2013; the timetable uses [...] "The Level" [...] in all literature. The origin of the name comes from the stretch of main road {{at the top of the}} lane that leads from the level crossing, being a straight level section when macadamed, the name being used in local parlance ever since. The halt is usually timetabled in the railway's literature but the 2011 timetable for example omits to give the stopping places; the halt however remains open as a request stop despite this. It is also called the level due to the adit level at Colby, as part of the Ballacorkish mine near Colby. Today, all references to [...] "Colby" [...] are removed from timetabling literature in order to avoid confusion with Colby Station itself which is a mandatory stopping place whereas The Level remains a request stop only.|$|E
