50|$|It is most {{commonly}} used to help remove air from a pneumothorax. The valve is usually designed as a <b>rubber</b> <b>sleeve</b> within a plastic case where the <b>rubber</b> <b>sleeve</b> is arranged so that when air passes through the valve one way the sleeve opens and lets the air through. However, when air is sucked back the other way, the sleeve closes off and no air is allowed backwards. This construction enables it {{to act as a}} one-way valve allowing air (or fluid) to flow only one way along the drainage tube. The end of the drainage tube is placed inside the patient's chest cavity, within the air or fluid to be drained. The flutter valve is placed in the appropriate orientation (most packages are designed so the valve can only be connected in the appropriate orientation) and the pneumothorax is thus evacuated from the patient's chest.|$|E

30|$|At present, most {{scholars}} {{have investigated the}} material properties of packer rubber {{by the use of}} dumbbell-shaped specimens and simple cylindrical specimens, and their conclusions indicated that many rubber materials such as HNBR and AFLAS have better pressure resistance and high-temperature resistance. However, the influence of the actual structures and shapes on sealing performance of packer rubber is seriously considered. The packer rubber made of high-performance material may have poor sealing performance under conditions of high pressure and high temperature in low-permeability reservoirs because of an unreasonable structure. In this paper, the study begins with packer rubber with a conventional structure and optimizes the materials and the structure of the packer rubber by ABAQUS software simulation and experimental research. In the experiments, <b>rubber</b> <b>sleeves</b> are installed on a packer and a function test scheme of the packer is designed which can simulate the packer setting and its working conditions.|$|R

40|$|A small {{portable}} chamber for {{the recovery}} of anaerobic bacteria is described. This rigid chamber is constructed of clear acrylic with dimensions of 30 inches (ca. 76. 2 cm) wide, 18 inches (ca. 44. 7 cm) deep, and 18 inches (ca. 44. 7 cm) high. Conventional bacteriological techniques can be used inside the chamber to efficiently isolate strict anaerobic organisms. An adapter allows the attachment of a standard anaerobic jar {{to the outside of}} the chamber. The jar can be used to store reduced media. Once the jar is attached to the chamber and the media is removed to the interior of the chamber, the jar is available to receive inoculated media. The anaerobic jar can then be removed from the chamber, without contaminating the jar or chamber with oxygen, and be placed in a conventional 37 degreesC incubator. This chamber also allows the microbiologist to process cultures without wearing gloves as was necessary with previous anaerobic chambers.

40|$|Ten {{thermocouple}} psychrometers (TCPs) {{to measure}} water potential (WP) were installed in three holes in G-Tunnel at the Nevada Test Site {{as part of}} the Prototype Engineered Barrier System Field Tests. These integrated tests measured several parameters as a function of location and time within a few meters of a heater emplaced in welded tuff. The primary goal of the TCP experiment was to find out whether the combination of laboratory calibration and field use of the TCP can provide useful data for determining the change of moisture condition in the field. We calibrated the TCPs in NaCl solutions up to 80 {degree}C(176 {degree}F) in the laboratory. In two holes, we used <b>rubber</b> <b>sleeves</b> and packers to house TCPs, and in the third hole, we used foam. All three holes were grouted behind the TCP assemblages. Field results of the heater test showed that small temperature gradients were present for all measurements. Nevertheless, the WP calibration made the necessary correction for the nonisothermal condition. A drying and re-wetting cycle peaked at about day 140 with a WP of - 65 bar in borehole P 3, located below the heater. A similar cycle but reduced in scale was found at about day 175 with a WP of - 45 bar in borehole P 2, above the heater. This difference in drying behavior above and below the heater was also observed from neutron data and was explained as a gravity effect. As temperatures increased, the evaporation rate of pore water increased, In unfractured rock, the gas-phase flow was primarily outward. Water condensed above the heater would drain back to keep the boiling region wet, but water condensed below the heater would drain away from the boiling region. This conceptual model explained both the time and magnitude differences for data from holes above and below the heater. 7 refs., 14 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R

30|$|Lead {{is used as}} {{a sleeve}} {{material}} to avoid the diffusion and penetration of CO 2 through the <b>rubber</b> core <b>sleeves.</b> The ductility of lead sleeve allowed a confining external overburden pressure to be transferred to the core in a radial mode to simulate reservoir overburden pressure. The steel core holder can simulate reservoir confining pressures of up to 50  MPa. This pressure is applied by filling the annular space between the core sleeve and the core holder with non-damaging saline brine. Test fluids were stored in titanium accumulators that were connected to a variable-rate injection pump. The CO 2 cells were kept outside the oven with a temperature-controlled air bath for safety reasons. However, the injected CO 2 was initially passed through stainless steel coils to heat up to reservoir temperature before it entered the core sample. The simulated reservoir temperature was regulated by a high-quality thermocouple. Pressure readings across the core sample were instantly recorded by high-precision pressure transducers that were digitally synchronized to a laboratory PC.|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} {{carbon capture}} and geological storage, the long-term behavior of stored CO 2 {{in the underground}} geological formation is a crucial issue to be carefully considered. This {{is because of the}} fact that the injection of CO 2 into the formation would impact rock formation integrity, reactivating pre-existing fractures and reopening seal that eventually lead to potential CO 2 leakage to the underlying groundwater containing layers and the surface. Therefore, the deformation of the reservoir rock during injection of supercritical CO 2 needs to be well understood and defined while designing the project. 	 	In this paper, we developed an experimental design using a newly developed flow pump permeability test to measure the change of strain and stress on the Ainoura sandstone cores under the injection of supercritical CO 2. The experiment was set up to reproduce the similar condition of deep underground reservoir with 20 MPa confining pressure, 10 MPa pore pressure, 35 ??C temperature and 3 ??l/min CO 2 injection rate. As CO 2 was injected to the specimen, the hydraulic pressure increased and generated a stress alteration. The strain in the core was monitored. The injection was halted at 15. 3 MPa hydraulic pressures over the period of 565. 9 hours since the hydraulic pressure can reach the confining pressure applied on the core and this may break the silicon on the <b>rubber</b> <b>sleeves</b> covering the core. Therefore, in order to model the hydromechanical response of the core during the injection as well as to predict the strain propagated beyond the injection period measured in the experiment, a numerical investigation using coupling hydromechanical simulation was conducted. In this exercise, we employed a two phase flow reservoir simulator of TOUGH 2 (ECO 2 N) coupled with rock mechanics computation of FLAC 3 D. A core specimen, with the rock properties and initial conditions similar to the experimental data, was generated and supercritical CO 2 injection with a constant rate of 3. 56 ?? 10 - 8 kg/s was simulated. It was observed that, the increased hydraulic pressure and strain shown in the numerical simulation have well agreement with the experimental result. The results also indicated that, during injection, the hydraulic pressure on the core increased transiently, and became constant at almost 60 MPa over the period of 5833 hours. The core specimen deformed elastically due to the increase of pore pressure caused by injection. The deformation of the specimen would not propagate failure even if the pore pressure exceeds the confining pressure applied on it. The results confirmed that the injection of supercritical CO 2 into low permeable rocks has considerable effects on the integrity of low permeable rocks even at low flow rates...|$|R
50|$|Direct laser {{engraving}} of flexographic printing cylinders and plates {{has been an}} established process since the 1970s. This first began {{with the use of}} a carbon dioxide laser used to selectively ablate or evaporate a variety of <b>rubber</b> plate and <b>sleeve</b> materials to produce a print ready surface without the use of photography or chemicals. With this process there is no integral ablation mask as with direct photopolymer laser imaging (see below). Instead a high-power carbon dioxide laser head burns away, or ablates, unwanted material. The aim is to form sharp, relief images with steep first relief and contoured shoulder supported edges to give a high standard of process color reproduction. A short water wash and dry cycle follows, which is a lot less involved than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo platemaking using photopolymer plates. After engraving, the photopolymer is exposed through the imaged black layer and washed out in the traditional photopolymer process requiring photography and chemicals. See below.|$|R
