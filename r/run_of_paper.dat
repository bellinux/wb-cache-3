2500|$|In {{his works}} on the Missale Speciale, Stevenson {{addressed}} {{the relationship between the}} presence of specific watermarked paper and the date of printing, and developed the principle of [...] "runs and remnants". Many bibliographers had argued that the fact that a watermark in a book whose date is in question also appears in a book with a specific date gives no indication (other than a terminal date) for the printing of the undated book because the printer of the dated book could have used old paper which he or someone else had held for many years. Stevenson observed that, while an individual might hold on to a supply of writing paper for a number of years, a printer, for whom the cost of paper for books was his largest capital investment, would ordinarily use paper soon after it was purchased. In fact, [...] "As a rule a particular lot of paper seems to have been obtained and set out for a particular job." [...] Where there is a <b>run</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with a specific watermark, as opposed to an isolated sheet or two, that should indicate that the book was printed shortly after the paper was manufactured and purchased. In contrast, the presence of a single or few sheets with a particular watermark (a [...] "remnant") might reflect an older paper used, and not be indicative of the actual printing date of a book. Stevenson confirmed this principle by identifying numerous examples of the same watermarks in the Missale Speciale in other dated or datable incunables, the deteriorating states of which fit the chronology of the known dates of the books.|$|E

At the same course two days later he met Rolla again in a race over two miles and reversed the form at odds of 7/1.

This edition received official recognition: William Cecil and the Privy Council directed the church to ensure that copies were available to parishioners, and in 1571, the Convocation ordered that every cathedral church and the household of every {{senior member of the}} clergy should own a copy.

25|$|Uusi Kotimaa (The New Homeland) (1923-December 1934) — In 1923 Finnish-Americans in the Communist Party {{purchased}} the old Minnesota newspaper, Uusi Kotimaa, a paper {{which was established}} in 1880. Previously conservative, {{the orientation of the}} New York Mills, Minnesota newspaper was changed to a radical farmer-labor publication following the Communist Party's line, edited by leading Finnish-American communist K.E. Heikkinen. With the demise of the farmer-labor party strategy, Uusi Kotimaa began to be oriented more towards industrial workers, although generally one page of content was directed towards farmers. The paper appeared three times weekly until 1932, when it was cut back to a weekly publication cycle. In 1931 the paper was moved to Superior, Wisconsin, where it was published directly by the Työmies Publishing Co. until the paper's demise at the end of 1934. An excellent <b>run</b> <b>of</b> the <b>paper</b> exists for the Superior period on three reels of microfilm available from the Wisconsin Historical Society.|$|R
