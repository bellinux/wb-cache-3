In the next year (50 BC) there were mopping-up operations. During the Roman civil wars Gallia was left pretty much on its own. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa became its first governor in 39-38 BC. In 39 BC he settled the Ubians on the west bank of the River Rhine and in 38 BC he suppressed a rebellion in Aquitania. He built a <b>radial</b> <b>network</b> of roads centred on [...] Gallic capital, Lugdunum (Lyon). Gallia was divided into three Roman provinces; Gallia Aquitania, Gallia Lugdununensis and Gallia Belgica. Only the Arverni kept their independence thanks to their victory against Caesar at the Battle of Gergovia.|$|E

A problem with <b>radial</b> <b>networks</b> is that faults on the feeders {{result in the}} loss of electricity supply to all customers if they are not sectionalised. Some <b>radial</b> <b>networks</b> emanating from one feeder from the sub-station may consist of up to 300 km of line, taking into account spurs, which makes fault detection difficult and increases customer outage time. Protective devices such as reclosers, sectionalisers and fuses are place on distribution systems {{to reduce the number of}} customers that will not have service at one time or another due to any fault on the system. There do not appear to be clear rules with regard to the placement of these protective devices. With the installed cost of devices such as sectionalisers bieng over fifty thousand rand, this is naturally of concern to a power utility...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} proven that the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the optimal power flow problem over <b>radial</b> <b>networks</b> is exact {{in the absence}} of generation lower bounds. In this paper, we investigate the situation where generation lower bounds are present. We show that even for a two-bus one-generator system, the SDP relaxation can have all possible approximation outcomes, that is (1) SDP relaxation may be exact or (2) SDP relaxation may be inexact or (3) SDP relaxation may be feasible while the OPF instance may be infeasible. We provide a complete characterization of when these three approximation outcomes occur and an analytical expression of the resulting optimality gap for this two-bus system. In order to facil-itate further research, we design a library of instances over <b>radial</b> <b>networks</b> in which the SDP relaxation has positive optimality gap. Finally, we propose valid inequalities and variable bound tightening techniques that significantly improve the computational performance of a global optimization solver. Our work demonstrates the need of devel-oping efficient global optimization methods for the solution of OPF even in the simple but fundamental case of <b>radial</b> <b>networks.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a simple approach for load flow {{analysis of a}} <b>radial</b> distribution <b>network.</b> The proposed approach utilizes forward and backward sweep algorithm based on Kirchoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchoff’s voltage law (KVL) for evaluating the node voltages iteratively. In this approach, computation of branch current depends only on the current injected at the neighbouring node and the current in the adjacent branch. This approach starts from the end nodes of sub lateral line, lateral line and main line and moves towards the root node during branch current computation. The node voltage evaluation begins from the root node and moves towards the nodes located {{at the far end}} of the main, lateral and sub lateral lines. The proposed approach has been tested using four radial distribution systems of different size and configuration and found to be computationally efficient.

40|$|This two-part paper details {{a theory}} of solvability for the power flow {{equations}} in lossless power networks. In Part I, we derive a new formulation of the lossless power flow equations, which we term the fixed-point power flow. The model is stated for both meshed and <b>radial</b> <b>networks,</b> and is parameterized by several graph-theoretic matrices [...] the power network stiffness matrices [...] which quantify the internal coupling strength of the network. The model leads immediately to an explicit approximation of the high-voltage power flow solution. For standard test cases, we find that iterates of the fixed-point power flow converge rapidly to the high-voltage power flow solution, with the approximate solution yielding accurate predictions near base case loading. In Part II, we leverage the fixed-point power flow to study power flow solvability, and for <b>radial</b> <b>networks</b> we derive conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a high-voltage power flow solution. These conditions (i) imply exponential convergence of the fixed-point power flow iteration, and (ii) properly generalize the textbook two-bus system results...|$|R

The algorithm's performance is compared with the successive shortest path algorithm developed in our previous work. The simulation is implemented for both meshed and <b>radial</b> <b>networks.</b> The simulation results show the advantages of the cost-scaling push-relabel algorithm over the shortest path algorithm in the <b>radial</b> <b>networks</b> with respect to significantly reduced number of exchanged messages on the agent platform, and thus the reduced time for calculation.
