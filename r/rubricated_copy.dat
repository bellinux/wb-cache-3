5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} printed books of the kind was that issued about 1475 for the Diocese of Constance, of which a <b>rubricated</b> <b>copy</b> {{is to be found}} in the British Museum. It is a small folio in size, of one hundred and twelve leaves, and after the ordinary calendar it supplies summary rules, under thirty-five heads, for drawing up the special calendar for each year according to the Golden Number and the Dominical Letter. Then the Ordo for each of the thirty-five possible combinations is set out in detail. The name most commonly given to these [...] "Pyes" [...] on the Continent was [...] "Ordinarius", more rarely [...] "Directorium Missæ". For example, the title of such a book printed for the Diocese of Liège in 1492 runs: [...] "In nomine Domini Amen [...] [...] [...] Incipit liber Ordinarius ostendens qualiter legatur et cantetur per totum anni circulum in ecclesia leodiensi tam de tempore quam de festis sanctorum in nocturnis officiis divinis." [...] Such books were also provided for the religious orders. An [...] "Ordinarius Ordinis Præmonstratensis" [...] exists in manuscript at Jesus College, Cambridge, and an early printed one in the British Museum. When the use of printing became universal, the step from these rather copious directories, which served for all possible years, to a shorter guide of the type of our modern [...] "Ordo recitandi", and intended only for one particular year, was a short and easy one. Since, however, such publications are useless after their purpose is once served, they are very liable to destruction, and it seems impossible to say how early we may date the first attempt at producing an Ordo after our modern fashion. The fact that at the Council of Trent (Sess. XXIII, De Reform., cap. xviii) it was thought necessary to urge that ecclesiastical students should be trained in the understanding of the computus, by which they could determine the ordo recitandi in each year for themselves, seems to imply that such Ordos as we now possess were not in familiar use in the middle of the sixteenth century.|$|E

40|$|The Auchinleck MS (National Library of Scotland, Advocates 2 ̆ 7 MS 19. 2. 1) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} surviving Middle English Manuscripts. The manuscript is a miscellany of 43 secular and religious items, all but two of them in English verse, and includes 17 of the earliest or unique versions of Middle English metrical romances and other long fictional poems. Besides its role in literary history, the place of the manuscript in the history of production of books is important. In 2 ̆ 2 The Auchinleck MS and an Possible London Bookshop of 1330 - 402 ̆ 2 PMLAS, 57 (1942), 595 - 627), Laura Hibbard Loomis developed the thesis that the manuscript was produced by a group of hack writer/translators and scribes working together in a commercial London bookshop. There is, however, no evidence whatsoever that such scriptoria existed in England before the 15 th century. Nevertheless, the so-called 2 ̆ 2 bookshop theory 2 ̆ 2 has remained largely unchallenged. This dissertation reviews Loomis 2 ̆ 7 s theory in the light of more recent studies of manuscripts and their production. ^ Both aspects of the Auchinleck MS, its physical characteristics and the nature of its literary contents, are discussed within the context of contemporary manuscripts produced in England. The primary focus, however, is on the physical make-up of the Auchinleck MS. Discussion of the manuscript is based on detailed examination of <b>copying,</b> <b>rubricating,</b> and illuminating practices evident in it. The sequence in which much of the scribal work was done is established by comparison of the major scribe 2 ̆ 7 s hand in various fascicles of the manuscript and of changes in page-format and allowance for decoration that occur after work on the manuscript began. It is shown that at times more than one scribe was at work on the manuscript, while at others the major scribe was working alone. The use (and possible sharing) of exemplars is considered in relation to this sequence. The Auchinleck MS is also compared with other manuscripts of the early 14 th century containing romance material, and with the other major collections of romances from the late 14 th and the 15 th centuries. The view is arrived at that the manuscript is not a commercial product made on speculation, but the bespoke product of the traditional scriptorium of a religious house in which inmates worked together with lay craftsmen. ...|$|R
