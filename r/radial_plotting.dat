Five sediment samples were submitted to the luminescence laboratories at SUERC for dating. All samples were subjected to laboratory preparation of sand-sized quartz, and purity checked using scanning electron microscopy. Dose rates for the bulk sediment were evaluated using analyses of the uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations obtained by high resolution gamma spectrometry coupled with beta dose rate measurement using thick source beta counting, and in situ field gamma spectroscopy. Equivalent doses were determined by OSL from 32 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot-regenerative (SAR) procedure. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. <b>Radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods revealed good internal homogeneity in the dose distributions obtained for each sample. The chronology established for the sampled sands on the site spans from the mid 16 th century (AD 1540 ± 40; SUTL 2441) through to the early 19 th century (AD 1810 ± 25), with the dates falling within three clusters - the waning stages of the Little Ice Age, the mid 18 th century (AD 1730 ± 25 to 1760 ± 25) and the early 19 th century (AD 1810 ± 25).

The samples were collected {{with the aim of}} establishing a relative chronology of the fluvio-glacial and post-glacial events. Sampling was undertaken by E. Muñoz-Salinas. Analyses were performed at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, East Kilbride. In total four dating samples were submitted to the laboratory. All samples were subjected to laboratory preparation of sand-sized quartz. Dose rates for the bulk sediment were obtained by high resolution gamma spectrometry coupled with in-situ field gamma spectrometry and beta dose rate measurement using thick source beta counting. Equivalent doses were determined by OSL from 16 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot-regenerative (SAR) procedure. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. Dose distributions from the aliquots were examined using <b>radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods. Three of the four samples produced finite ages. Although each of these samples showed considerable scatter in the stored dose estimates from the 16 aliquots measured; this reflects poor bleaching at time of deposition and/or mixing of poorly bleached and unbleached material at deposition (some of which had large residual signals). The fourth sample showed natural luminescence signals in excess of the saturation signals for the regenerative dose curves. Age estimates of 15. 7 ± 1. 0 ka, 10. 7 ± 1. 6 ka and 8. 1 ± 1. 0 ka were obtained for the sampled fluvio-glacial and post-glacial debris flows in the Gredos and Las Pozas gorges. The Gredos mountain range was glaciated between 21 and 15 ka. A relative chronology, based on field relationships, indicates that the sampled debris flow in the Gredos gorge is between 21 and 15 ka in age, and that the sampled debris flows in Las Pozas gorge are younger than 15 ka. The fourth sample did not yield a finite date. In an attempt to produce a finite age for this sample a thermally-transferred OSL (TT-OSL) protocol was run on a further set of 8 aliquots. The TT-OSL method is believed to extent the working dose range of quartz up to and above 1 kGy. TT-OSL signals in quartz extracted from the problematic sample were not adequately reset at time of deposition...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating investigations of sediments associated with, and enclosing artefacts of First Nations historic significance in the Battle River Valley area, near Hardisty, east central Alberta. The OSL ages reported here provide chronological control to the archaeological investigations at this site, led by Rob Wondrasek, which have identified thousands of historical artefacts, including projectile points and lithic fragments indicative of occupation. The investigations were commissioned by Enbridge, ahead {{of the construction of}} the Edmonton-Hardisty Pipeline, and form one part of a historic resources impact assessment study, to characterise the archaeological site, and evaluate/mitigate the impact of the pipeline related excavations. This report describes the background to the investigation, sampling, and luminescence analysis undertaken to generate sediment chronologies for the Hardisty sediment stratigraphies. Ken Munyikwa visited the archaeological investigations at Hardisty in June 2014 to sample key stratigraphic units within the sediment stratigraphies for OSL dating. Samples were collected from two profiles: from strata encompassing the artefact-bearing horizon, and from strata immediately beneath and overlying this horizon, thus providing terminus post quem (TPQ) and terminus ante quem (TAQ) on the age of this unit. Samples were submitted to the luminescence laboratories at SUERC for dating in August 2014. All samples were subjected to laboratory preparation of sand-sized quartz, and purity checked by scanning electron microscopy. Dose rates for the bulk sediment were evaluated using analyses of the uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations obtained by high resolution gamma spectrometry coupled with beta dose rate measurement using thick source beta counting. Equivalent doses were determined by OSL from 64 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot-regenerative (SAR) procedure. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. Dose distributions from the aliquots were examined using <b>radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods. All samples revealed some heterogeneity in their equivalent dose distribution, reflecting variable bleaching at deposition and indicating that each sample enclosed mixed-age materials. Age estimates were based on the weighted mean estimate of the stored dose, which weights the stored dose estimate towards the lowest population of equivalent doses, potentially representing the better bleached (at deposition) component. The quartz OSL ages reported herein for the sand sequences at Hardisty- 1 and Hardisty- 2, have provided the first means to assess the temporal distribution of artefacts within the Hardisty profiles, and furthermore provide TPQ and TAQ for the inferred occupational phases. The sediment chronologies established for each profile are internally coherent, spanning at HD- 01 from 7. 8 ± 0. 7 ka (SUTL 2692) to 11. 7 ± 0. 5 ka (SUTL 2694), and at HD- 02 from 4. 5 ± 0. 2 ka (SUTL 2695) to 8. 7 ± 0. 5 ka (SUTL 2697; Table 4 - 1). TPQ for the occupation of the Hardisty site is provided by SUTL 2697 at 8. 7 ± 0. 5 ka. TAQ for the occupation of the Hardisty site is provided by SUTL 2695 at 4. 5 ± 0. 2 ka...|$|E

40|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>plots</b> are bivariate (xj,yj) scatterplots where: (1) View the MathML source with zj a {{transformation}} of some data and σ(zj) the corresponding measurement uncertainty. For example, if zj = log(tj) then σ(zj) = σ(tj) /tj. z 0 is a convenient central value such as the weighted mean. The slope of a line connecting the origin (x = 0,y = 0) of a <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> with a data point (xj,yj) equals zj, and the horizontal distance along x-axis is a measure if its precision. Thus, the <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> simultaneously visualises a measurement's value and precision. No other graphical method achieves this goal with the same elegance (Galbraith, 1988). This makes the <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> the method of choice for visualising heteroscedastic data, i. e. data with (large and) variable measurement uncertainties. Traditional applications in the Earth Sciences are fission track and luminescence dating, which are governed by Poisson processes (e. g., [Galbraith, 1990] and [Galbraith et al., 1999]). In principle, however, <b>radial</b> <b>plots</b> {{can be used for}} any kind of data. RadialPlotter is a user-friendly application for generating <b>radial</b> <b>plots.</b> It has the following advantages over existing programs such as Trackkey or MacTrack. (1) The program was developed solely for <b>radial</b> <b>plots</b> and does not perform other functions for data reduction or interpretation. Therefore, <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> functions are not buried deep inside the menu structure and the interface is very straightforward. (2) RadialPlotter was written in Java (version 5) and is, therefore, perfectly platform independent. (3) In addition to fission track <b>radial</b> <b>plots,</b> RadialPlotter also offers the possibility to generate <b>radial</b> <b>plots</b> for luminescence dating, or any other kind of data such as (U-Th) /He or 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages. RadialPlotter can be downloaded free of charge from [URL] The program consists of a single executable jar file (RadialPlotter. jar). This makes installation straightforward: it suffices to download and open this file to run RadialPlotter. For testing purposes, three example input files are provided on the website, one {{for each of the three}} possible input formats (‘Fission Tracks’, ‘Luminescence’ and ‘Other’). The graphical output can be saved as either bitmap or vector images, in a. png or. pdf format, respectively. RadialPlotter automatically performs a χ 2 -test for statistical homogeneity of fission track data. For populations that have failed this test, the program implements the mixture modeling algorithm of Galbraith and Green (1990) (Fig. 1). Data points can be colour-coded to show an additional variable such as chemical composition or a kinetic parameter. Colour-coding can also be a useful tool for double-dating, which is rapidly gaining popularity in detrital studies (e. g., Campbell et al., 2005 I. H. Campbell, P. W. Reiners, C. M. Allen, S. Nicolescu and R.

40|$|This report present {{optically}} stimulated luminescence (OSL) {{dates for}} six sediment samples collected from archaeological sites on the shoreline of Lake Superior (Ontario, Canada). The Ontario Ministry of Transport (MTO) commissioned Western Heritage to undertake rescue archaeological work ahead of the four-lane expansion of Highway 11 / 17 in 2010. Previous archaeological investigations in this region have uncovered evidence of early human occupations, potentially associated with early occupation in the region following the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. 18 samples were submitted to the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) for OSL dating, from four archaeological sites {{in the vicinity of}} Thunder Bay: Mackenzie, Woodpecker 1 and 2, and Hodder. In February 2012, approval was given for quartz SAR OSL analysis on 3 samples each from Mackenzie and Woodpecker 1. Section drawings were provided with luminescence profiles obtained using portable OSL instrumentation developed at SUERC. All samples were subjected to laboratory preparation of sand-sized quartz, and purity checked by scanning electron microscopy. Dose rates for the bulk sediment were evaluated using analyses of the uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations obtained by high resolution gamma spectrometry coupled with beta dose rate measurement using thick source beta counting, in combination with the in-situ gamma dose measurements. Equivalent doses were determined by OSL from 16 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot-regenerative (SAR) procedure. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. Dose distributions from the aliquots were examined using <b>radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods. All samples revealed some heterogeneity in their equivalent dose distribution, reflecting the main sediment source in the region i. e. glacial sediments. The profile at the Mackenzie site encompasses the lower and upper fills of a cultural pit feature: two samples were taken from the lower fill, in its basal and upper layers, and a single sample was taken from the upper fill. The lower fill (unit 4) is dated to between 6. 09 ± 0. 41 ka (4080 ± 410 BC) and 5. 77 ± 0. 44 ka (3760 ± 440 BC); and the upper fill (unit 6) from 5. 50 ± 0. 32 ka (3490 ± 320 BC). The profile at the Woodpecker 1 site is taken through a series of alluvial units and palaeosols that occur adjacent to a pit-like feature; the upper units in this succession cap/seal the sediments in the pit-like structure in the profile, thereby providing a terminus ante quem for the age of the pit structure. The sample at c. 50 cm DBS in the sequence of alluvial units, at the top of unit 6 is dated to 7. 51 ± 0. 47 ka (5500 ± 470 BC). The samples taken from the basal and upper layers of unit 3, between 15 and 25 cm DBS in the succession, are dated to 6. 19 ± 0. 45 ka (4180 ± 450 BC) and 2. 91 ± 0. 25 ka (900 ± 250 BC), respectively. The OSL investigations at SUERC have verified that there is sufficient quartz in the sediment for dating purposes and that this quartz has promising behaviour for luminescence dating. Having established the suitability of the quartz SAR OSL method for dating the sediment in profiled sections at Mackenzie and Woodpecker 1, it would now be possible to undertake a further programme of work to date additional units at both sites, and the sequences at Hodder and Woodpecker 2. Further work on additional material would have the potential for examining the relationships between the landscape de-glaciation history and its occupation by early human settlers...|$|E
40|$|Optically stimulated {{luminescence}} (OSL) {{investigations have}} been undertaken on sediment collected from several stratigraphies at the Lumbini World Heritage Site (Rupandehi District, Western Terai, Nepal) {{to provide a}} chronology to interpret the early alluvial history and cultural activity at the site. These investigations are {{one part of a}} larger project, funded by UNESCO/Japanese Funds-in-Trust for the Preservation of the World Cultural Heritage, and initiated in 2011, to identify, evaluate and interpret the archaeological signature of the Lumbini World Heritage Site. The project is under the directorship of Robin Conningham. Archaeological investigations at Lumbini in January 2011, 2012 and 2013 have provided the opportunity to undertake geoarchaeological investigations of the soils and sediment in a number of stratigraphies through the Maya Devi Temple and the Lumbini Village Mound. Following the excavations in 2011, sediment samples were submitted to the luminescence laboratories at SUERC, to obtain chronologies for three sediment stratigraphies, including two within the Maya Devi Temple, and one through the Lumbini Village Mound (see Kinnaird et al., 2011). The dates obtained indicated a significant degree of antiquity within the Maya Devi Temple, with the earliest occupational layers identified {{at the site of the}} temple dated at 990 ± 290 BC and 1080 ± 245 BC dates, some 600 years before the visit of Asoka. Additionally, the results indicated two distinct phases of occupation on the Village Mound, an early phase dated at 670 ± 160 BC, and a later phase, AD 260 ± 170 to 640 ± 110. A further fifteen samples were submitted for dating following fieldwork in 2012 (see Cresswell et al., 2012); OSL age determinations provide the chronology to interpret the natural and cultural processes that led to the formation of the sedimentary sequences in a further section from the Maya Devi Temple (C 13), a second section through the Lumbini Village Mound (Trench LVM- 12), and a section through an accumulation of natural/cultural material in a palaeo-channel (LPC- 12). X samples were submitted following fieldwork in 2013. The dating questions associated with the samples taken from the stratigraphy within the Temple, relate to the early phases of cultural activity on the site, with a particular focus on pre- Mauryan levels. The questions associated with the material obtained from the stratigraphies through the Village Mound and palaeo-channel are related to their depositional sequences, which encompass the natural/cultural transition, the early human-environment interactions. Furthermore, the samples provide a means of appraing the multiple phases suggested during the first OSL study. Sample preparation and analysis was undertaken at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC). OSL SAR dating utilises extracted quartz from the samples to determine the radiation dose experienced by the sediments since their last zeroing event, assumed to be by exposure to light prior to final deposition. This is combined with dose rate analysis based on field and laboratory measurements of environmental radioactivity. The age is determined as the ratio of dose divided by dose rate. In this work, dose rates for the bulk sediment were quantified using high resolution gamma spectrometry and thick source beta counting in the laboratory, coupled with water content analysis and in-situ gamma dose rate measurements. Quartz was extracted using standard laboratory procedures, and purity checked with scanning electron microscopy. Equivalent doses were determined, initially, on 16 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot regenerative (SAR) procedure. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. <b>Radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods were used to appraise sample homogeneity, and robust statistics were used, for aliquots satisfying SAR acceptance criteria, to estimate equivalent doses.

Archaeological investigations in this region, led by Rob Wondrasek, have identified thousands of historical artefacts, including projectile points and lithic fragments indicative of occupation. Ken Munyikwa visited the archaeological sites at Hardisty in June 2014 and January 2015 to sample key units within the sediment stratigraphies for OSL dating. The sediments associated with the artefacts were appraised through five profiles, Hardisty- 1 (HD 01) to Hardisty- 5 (HD 05), comprised of 43 field-profiling and 14 dating samples. Profiles HD 01 and HD 02 were sampled in June 2014; and profiles HD 03 through to HD 05 in January 2015. The dating questions associated with these materials relate to the age of artefact-bearing horizon, through dating the enclosing sediments above and beneath the archaeological soil, {{it should be possible to}} provide terminus post quem (TPQ) and terminus ante quem (TAQ) on the age of the artefacts. The conventional quartz SAR OSL approach was examined as a potential method for providing the depositional ages of the sediment enclosing the artefacts. Luminescence profiling during fieldwork had revealed stratigraphically progressive IRSL and OSL signals, indicating sediment with dating potential. Dose rate estimates from these sediments were assessed using a combination of high resolution gamma spectrometry (HRGS) and thick source beta counting (TSBC), reconciled with each other, water contents and modelled micro-dosimetry. Where appropriate, the external gamma dose rates received at the position of the dating sample were reconstructed from the adjacent bulk gamma spectrometry samples, yielding wet gamma dose rates between 0. 42 and 0. 54 mGy a- 1, which are comparable with those recorded at each sampling position. Equivalent doses were determined by OSL from 16 - 48 aliquots of quartz per sample (depending on quartz yields) using a single-aliquot-regenerative (SAR) approach. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. <b>Radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods revealed some heterogeneity in the equivalent dose distributions of each sample, indicating that each sample enclosed mixed-age materials, reflecting variable bleaching at deposition. The field profiles provide some measure of control on this. Luminescence ages were calculated using standard microdosimetric models, with uncertainties that combined measurement and fitting errors from the SAR analysis, all dose rate evaluation uncertainties, and allowance for the calibration uncertainties of the sources and reference materials. The quartz OSL ages reported here for the sand sequences at HD 03 to HD 05, contribute to the expanding catalogue of chronological data on the depositional sequences at Hardisty, and further, provide the means to assess the temporal and spatial distribution of artefacts across the site. The sediment chronologies established for each profile are internally and mutually coherent, spanning at HD 03 from 7. 3 ± 0. 3 ka (SUTL 2778) to 9. 0 ± 0. 5 ka (SUTL 2780), at HD 04 from 7. 0 ± 0. 3 ka (SUTL 2781) to 8. 3 ± 0. 4 ka (SUTL 2782), and at HD 05 from 8. 3 ± 0. 5 ka (SUTL 2783) to 9. 6 ± 0. 6 ka (SUTL 2785). The field profile at HD 05 reveals some complexity to its depositional history, with notable maxima and inversions in intensities from 150 cm depth, potentially reflecting reworking and re-deposition of sediment within this sequence. TAQ for this phase of reworking is provided by the youngest unit examined in the profile, which at 7. 5 ± 0. 6 ka (SUTL 2784), is consistent with the occupational phase recorded in the adjacent sections. The sediment chronologies established in this dating campaign, and in the 2014 campaign, are synchronous suggesting contemporaneous deposition across the site, and presumably, with local knowledge, scope for further age modelling including the use of Bayesian methods to refine the TAQ and TPQ age limits...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{results of}} {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) dating of eight sediment samples collected from raised beaches in the Pwani district of the southern Tanzanian coast. Six samples were collected in a vertically stratified sequence from Tundwisogani Quarry, approximately 10 km inland from the present coast line. The remaining two samples were collected a further 8 - 9 km inland at Maragoro-Mkuranga and Koga-Mimba. The {{purpose of the study}} was to appraise the suitability of the material for OSL dating, with a view to constraining the rates and periods of recent uplift in this area due to tectonic activity. The sampling was conducted on behalf of Heritage Oil, and the analyses performed at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre in East Kilbride, Scotland. All samples were subjected to laboratory preparation of sand-sized quartz, and purity checked using scanning electron microscopy. Dose rates for the bulk sediment were evaluated using analyses of the uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations obtained by high resolution gamma spectrometry coupled with beta dose rate measurement using thick source beta counting. Equivalent doses were determined by OSL from 16 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot-regenerative (SAR) procedure. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. Dose distributions from the aliquots were examined using <b>radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods, which revealed some heterogeneity. The uppermost sample from Tundwisogani Quarry, approximately 10 km from the present coastline, produced an age estimate of 14 ± 2 ka. Samples from Maragoro-Mkuranga and Koga-Mimba, approximately 17 km and 20 km from the present coastline, produced age estimates of 13 ± 2 and 20 ± 2 ka respectively. If these dates are taken as indicative of the depositional age the corresponding uplift rates would range from 5. 3 to 11. 5 mm per year, which seem remarkably high. However, the spread in equivalent doses raises the possibility that these upper layers may have been reworked since deposition, in which case the SAR ages will under-estimate the original depositional age and hence over-estimate uplift rates. The remaining five samples, from lower strata at Tundwisogani Quarry, showed natural quartz OSL signals in excess of the saturation values from the regenerative dose curves, resulting in minimum age estimates in excess of 45 ka. Additional work to explore the feasibility of applying other luminescence approaches to determining finite ages was also undertaken for two of these deeper samples. This further work confirmed that post-OSL thermally stimulated signals have the potential for extending the quartz dose response to several hundred Gy doses, as do elevated temperature infra-red stimulated luminescence signals recorded from K feldspars after removal of conventional IR-stimulated luminescence. The sediments from Tundwisogani quarry were shown to contain K feldspars. Exploratory studies confirm that both the high temperature quartz approaches and the post-IR IRSL feldspar signals are capable of extending the luminescence dating age range to several hundred ka. The age range for the lower strata at Tundwisogani obtained in the exploratory study is between 90 and 60 ka. The uplift rates implied for the lower layers at Tundwisogani based on these exploratory analyses would be 0. 53 – 1. 3 mm per year. Having established the suitability of both the quartz OSL method for samples younger than 100 - 150 ka, and the potential of the high temperature methods for longer timescales in the region it would now be possible to undertake a further programme of work to examine the geographical distribution of depositional ages and post-depositional alterations to further constrain the uplift rates of the region, and to provide an observational framework for further understanding the episodic nature of the regional movements that have formed the marine terraces in the area...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) investigations of sediment collected from the University of Newcastle archaeological excavation at Mothecombe Beach (Mothecombe, Devon). Four sediment samples were submitted to the luminescence laboratories at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) for dating. The samples are taken from contexts in association with an archaeological structure of expected post-Roman age. OSL single aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) dating utilises extracted quartz from the samples to determine the radiation dose experienced by the sediments since their last zeroing event, assumed to be by exposure to light prior to final deposition. This is combined with dose rate analysis based on laboratory measurements of environmental radioactivity. The age is determined as the ratio of dose divided by dose rate. In this work, dose rates for the bulk sediment were quantified using high resolution gamma spectrometry (HRGS) and thick source beta counting (TSBC) in the laboratory, coupled with water content analysis. Significant differences were noted between the beta dose rate estimates obtained by HRGS and TSBC. These were investigated and shown to arise from contrasting radioactivity levels between the fine sedimentary matrix and associated clasts. This was taken into account when estimating the dose rates used in age evaluation. Quartz was extracted from the finer sediment fractions using standard laboratory procedures, and purity checked with scanning electron microscopy. Equivalent doses were determined on 16 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz SAR procedure. <b>Radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods were used to appraise sample homogeneity, and robust statistics were used, for aliquots satisfying SAR acceptance criteria, to estimate equivalent doses. The sediment samples are taken from colluvial units that occur in association with structures at Mothecombe beach that have been dated to the 5 th- 7 th century AD. The chronology for the site is based on two radiocarbon dates - 450 - 610 cal. AD and 430 - 580 cal. AD - {{and the presence of}} c. 20 sherds of eastern Mediterranean pottery. Given the associations between the sediment samples and the archaeological features, it was postulated that the sediment should yield luminescence ages in the first millennium AD. However, the quartz SAR ages obtained from the site span from the 3 rd millennium BC to the late 16 th century. The luminescence ages obtained for the colluvial units that are believed to seal the two archaeological structures are 400 ± 110 BC (colluvial unit 2) and 710 ± 130 BC (colluvial unit 3). If one accepts the chronology implied by the radiocarbon dates, the luminescence dates could be interpreted as recording earlier depositional events {{in the history of the}} site (when the colluvial units were last bleached). In this scenario, the deposits, would have to be re-worked, subsequently transported down-slope, and re-deposited in their archaeological contexts without significant exposure to light. In support of this hypothesis, the luminescence ages obtained for the units 2 and 3 are inverted, as one would expect in such a depositional scenario. Interestingly, however, the equivalent dose distributions obtained for the colluvial units are tight, which would normally indicate well-bleached sediment. Resolving the hypotheses concerning the colluvial re-deposition process, and the relationship between these materials and the archaeological features, including the cut features, ceramics and 14 C samples, would require further investiagtions on-site and in the laboratory. The OSL investigations at SUERC reported here have verified that there is sufficient quartz in the sediment for dating purposes and that this quartz has suitable behaviour for luminescence dating. Having established the protocols for estimating environmental dose rates on site, through reconciliation of the different contributions from the natural radioactivity of the clasts and matrix, and shown the effectiveness of the quartz SAR OSL technique for dating the sediment samples, it would now be possible to extent the study to date further units at the site if required. For future work, consideration should be given to the use of luminescence profiling methods (including the use of portable OSL instrumentation), to search for, and identify discontinuities in the colluvial sequence, and to target specific well-zeroed material for dating. Coupled with in-situ field gamma spectrometry, this would provide a means to test the hypotheses outlined above...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) investigations on sediment collected from a profile in the upper Lachlan River catchment area in New South Wales, southeast Australia. The samples were collected {{as part of a}} larger study that is investigating land-use change in this region, traditionally associated with the arrival of Europeans in SE Australia. Sampling was undertaken by E. Muñoz-Salinas and P. Bishop. Analyses were performed at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, East Kilbride. In total three dating samples, and five profiling samples were submitted to the laboratory. Field profiling undertaken by E. Muñoz-Salinas and P. Bishop provided a basic assessment of the luminescence characteristics of the section sampled. On the basis of this work three units have been defined (Muñoz-Salinas et al., 2010) : a pre-‘Swampy Meadow’ deposit (> 185 cm depth in profile), a ‘Swampy Meadow’ deposit (185 – 61 cm) and the ‘Post-Settlement Alluvium’ (> 61 cm). Profiling and full dating samples were subjected to laboratory preparation of sand-sized quartz (Burbidge et al., 2007; Kinnaird et al., 2007). Laboratory profiling samples were taken from both the ‘pre-Swampy Meadow’ and ‘Swampy Meadow’ deposits. Aliquots of HF etched quartz and polymineral concentrates were subjected to simple single-aliquot dose determinations (calculated relative to a single regenerative dose of 5 Gy, normalised to a 1 Gy test dose), which were used to plot dose-depth and luminescence sensitivity profiles. Stored doses and sensitivities obtained from the quartz separates are consistent across the pre-‘Swampy Meadow’/‘Swampy Meadow’ boundary. Normalised ratios were scaled to account for the test dose change between the profiling (1 Gy) and full SAR (2 Gy) measurements. These normalised values were then fitted to a composite dose response curve generated from the full dating samples. Dose rates for each profiling sample location were estimated from the adjacent full dating locations. Apparent ages were calculated for each profiling sample from base to top these are: 4. 56 ± 0. 22, 4. 48 ± 0. 09, 3. 87 ± 0. 47, 3. 36 ± 0. 02 and 1. 05 ± 0. 01 ka. Dose rates for the tube samples (and when available bulk sediment) were obtained by high resolution gamma spectrometry coupled with in-situ field gamma spectrometry and beta dose rate measurement using thick source beta counting. Equivalent doses were determined by OSL from 16 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot-regenerative (SAR) procedure. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. Dose distributions from the aliquots were examined using <b>radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods. An age estimate of 5. 66 ± 0. 43 ka (215 cm) was obtained for the ‘pre-Swampy Meadow’ deposit. Age estimates of 5. 17 ± 0. 30 ka (163 cm) and 2. 43 ± 0. 14 ka (103 cm) were obtained for the ‘Swampy Meadow’ deposit. The full dating samples analysed in this study do not show excess scatter in their dose distributions which might indicate partial zeroing at time of deposition. The age estimates suggest that sedimentation is continuous across the ‘pre-Swampy Meadow’/’Swampy Meadow’ contact at a rate of 1. 1 mm/yr. The hypothesis that ‘enhanced erosion and gullying in the Grabben Cullen Creek region was a result of the introduction of pastoral farming by European settlers’ has been tested in this study. A linear extrapolation through the profiling apparent ages would estimate the age of the ‘Swampy Meadow’/’Post-Settlement Alluvium’ boundary at 390 yrs. The Grabben Creek region of the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales is believed to have been settled by Europeans since the 1820 s (Wasson et al., 1998). If the ‘Post-Settlement Alluvium’ was generated as a response to land clearing and the introduction of sheep and cattle associated with settlement, then it should be no older than 200 yrs. We accept that there are a large number of inherent assumptions in projecting an age for the Swampy Meadow’/’Post-Settlement Alluvium’ boundary, however, it is interesting to note that the age constraints presented herein apparently question the accepted hypothesis.

40|$|This report {{provides}} an Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) chronology for the construction, occupation and abandonment {{sequence of the}} Baile Sear Wheelhouse structure in North Uist. The structure was exposed following coastal erosion in 2005, and was excavated by SCAPE with community support in 2009 and 2010. The site was visited by David Sanderson in September 2010 to collect OSL samples. The sediments associated with the monument and its immediate environment were reviewed, and luminescence profiling was undertaken to evaluate the sequence, and to identify sampling positions for OSL dating. Luminescence profiling, using portable field equipment, was used to guide sampling and interpretation. Field gamma spectrometry was used to record the environmental dose rates in {{the positions of the}} OSL dating tube samples. Luminescence profiling was undertaken in 7 sections. Profiles 1 and 2 examined substrates below the wheelhouse structure, and an underlying burnt earth surface which represents an earlier structure. The dating questions associated with this material, relate to the age of the earlier structure and the construction of the wheelhouse. Profiles 3 and 4 examined the stratigraphy of sediments immediately outside the southern wheelhouse wall, which record a collapse of the southern wall, and subsequent repacking. The dating questions here relate to the timing of the collapse and repacking events relative to wheelhouse construction and the occupation evidence within the southern chamber. Profile 5 examined the infill of the southern interior area, including materials associated with part of the occupation period and deliberate abandonment of this part of the wheelhouse. The chronology of this abandonment relative to the wall collapse is of interest. Profiles 6 and 7 examined the infill of the central and northern interior areas, including occupation evidence, a hearth sequence, and aeolian sands associated with the final abandonment. In total 58 profiling samples and 11 tube samples with associated field dosimetry were collected, from these 7 profiles, which together represent all of the key phases of activity associated with the construction, use and abandonment of the Baile Sear wheelhouse. The wheelhouse itself is located within a broader sequence of mounds in the vicinity, and which may, together with the other monuments in the surrounding landscape have also contributed to the archaeological materials in proximity to the site. OSL analyses of the profiling samples, both in the field, and in the laboratory have been reported elsewhere. This report concerns the OSL dating measurements conducted using the Single Aliquot Regenerative (SAR) method from 10 of the OSL dating samples, and there use to determine a chronology for the site. Sample preparation and analysis was undertaken at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC). OSL SAR dating utilises extracted quartz from the samples to determine the radiation dose experienced by the sediments since their last zeroing event, assumed to be by exposure to light prior to final deposition. This is combined with dose rate analysis based on field and laboratory measurements of environmental radioactivity. The age is determined as the ratio of dose divided by dose rate. In this work, dose rates for the bulk sediment were quantified using high resolution gamma spectrometry and thick source beta counting in the laboratory, coupled with water content analysis and in-situ gamma dose rate measurements. Quartz was extracted using standard laboratory procedures, and purity checked with scanning electron microscopy. Equivalent doses were determined, initially, on 16 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot regenerative (SAR) procedure, with additional investigation of further sets of 16 to build statistical power for selected pre-heating groups. <b>Radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods were used to appraise sample homogeneity, and robust statistics were used, for aliquots satisfying SAR acceptance criteria, to estimate equivalent doses. The quartz OSL SAR age estimates have been assessed relative to the stratigraphy of the wheelhouse, in combination with profiling data using both conventional assimilation methods and also a Bayesian approach. Both approaches lead to similar conclusions concerning the overall chronology of site construction, occupation and abandonment as summarised here. (i) 	OSL profiling verifies that material associated with the earliest Iron Age occupation of the wheelhouse and preceding structure(s) in the vicinity can be found, outside the wheelhouse, in midden deposits which surround and overlie the surviving structures. This material goes back to approximately 400 BC, and some of it predates the wheelhouse construction. (ii) 	The preceding burnt surface represents a structure of short-lived duration, which spanned the period first/second century BC to the first century AD. Material associated within this structure and its use may be present in the midden deposits around the wheelhouse. (iii) 	The most probable period for construction of the wheelhouse is in the first/second century AD. (iv) 	In the monument, material dating to the earliest occupation of the wheelhouse is preserved in the northern chamber, and its associated pits. OSL profiling indicates that the northern chamber was in use during all period of occupation, from the Iron Age construction of the wheelhouse (c AD 150) through to the first millennium AD abandonment of the site (c AD 900 - 1000). (v) 	In the southern chamber, the earliest occupation phases are poorly represented in surviving debris. The collapse of the southern wall (c AD 600 - 750), the rebuild (c AD 750), the last occupation the southern chamber (c AD 750), and abandonment of the southern chamber (c AD 750) all occur in the later part of the first millennium AD, significantly after the wheelhouse construction and earlier phases of occupation. (vi) 	After the southern chamber was abandoned, the central and northern chambers remained in use. The central chamber contains a hearth sequence, which indicates occupation of this chamber through a later phase of occupation (700 AD) until the Norse period (AD 940). OSL profiles provide some evidence of earlier occupation in the central area. (vii) 	Final abandonment of the site is registered by clean abandonment sands starting from the tenth century AD, consistent with abandonment in the Norse period, and with the upper occupation in the northern and central chambers. Later evidence of aeolian activity through the Little Ice Age (up to 16 th century AD) is also recorded in the upper sand fills of the central and northern chambers. The combination of field and laboratory luminescence profiling techniques, and quartz OSL SAR dating, has provided a chronological framework to interpret the complete sequence of construction, occupation and phased abandonment of the wheelhouse structure. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that field and laboratory luminescence profiling techniques coupled to quantitative OSL SAR analysis and Bayesian assimilation methods have been applied to define the complete sequence of construction, occupation and abandonment of a site of this type. A further review of other artefact, environmental and dating evidence, would be useful as the rest of the post-excavation work advances...|$|E

Spatial analysis of CG lightning relative to both compass directions and the direction of motion were compiled. Additionally, a radial analysis of this data was performed within both a 300 km radius and a 50 km radius range. Finally, all analyses were stratified into all tropical cyclones and hurricane categories for further consideration. The National Lightning Detection Network recorded 307, 593 CG lightning flashes within 300 km of the storms in this study. Negative flashes had an average first stroke peak current of - 49 kA and a mean multiplicity of 2. 7. Positive flashes occurred at a rate of 5. 3 percent, with a mean peak current of 43 kA and 1. 2 multiplicity average. Detected CG lightning characteristics changed significantly with a network upgrade in 1994. CG lightning flashes for all tropical cyclones favored the area south and west of the cyclone center.

We also apply tree competition models to determine {{the degree to which the}} relationship between SA 1. 3 and tree basal area at 1. 3 m height (BA 1. 3) is influenced by competition. Methods: We visited 25 recently harvested southeastern Australian forest sites consisting of 1379 trees and 5 Eucalyptus species to evaluate a new efficient data collection method for estimating SA 1. 3 with tree taper and stump dimensions data using mixed effects models. The locations of 784 stumps within one 5 -ha site were accurately mapped using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and four distance-dependent tree competition models were applied across the site to explain within-stand variation in the ratio of SA 1. 3 to BA 1. 3. Data from 24 additional sites, consisting of ten 15 m <b>radial</b> <b>plots</b> per site, were used to analyse within-site variation in R Ha (the ratio of stand sapwood area SA Ha to stand basal area BA Ha). The <b>radial</b> <b>plots</b> were merged within each site to evaluate between-site variations in R Ha across the landscape. For predicting SA Ha with forest inventory data, we computed the relationship between SA Ha and a new index of total stem perimeter per hectare, defined as √BA Ha N T, where N T is tree stocking density. Important Findings: Our 1379 measured stems represent the most comprehensive measure of sapwood area, surpassing the 757 measured stems in native eucalypt forests published in literature. The species-specific R Ha varied considerably across sites and therefore extrapolating SA Ha with spatially distributed BA Ha maps and a generalized R Ha would introduce local uncertainty. We found that the species-specific stem perimeter index was more effective at capturing variability in SA Ha across the landscape using forest composition, structure and density data (R²: 0. 72 – 0. 77). The strong correlation between tree SA 1. 3 and BA 1. 3 improved slightly using tree competition models (R² increased from 0. 86 to 0. 88). Relating SA Ha to routinely measured forest inventory attributes within permanent plots and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data may provide opportunities to map forest water use in time and space across large areas disturbed by wildfire and logging...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{magnification}} calibration for transmission {{electron microscopy}} is best achieved {{with the use of}} appropriate standards and an objective calibration technique. We have developed a reliable method for calibrating the magnification of images from frozen-hydrated specimens. Invariant features in <b>radial</b> density <b>plots</b> of a standard are compared with the corresponding features in a “defocused ” X-ray model of the same standard. Defocused X-ray models were generated to mimic the conditions of cryo-electron microscopy. The technique is demonstrated with polyoma virus, which was used as an internal standard to calibrate micrographs of bovine papilloma virus type 1 and bacteriophag...|$|R
