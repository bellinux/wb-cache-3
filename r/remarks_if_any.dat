50|$|On 13 May 1990 (before {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia) Serbian club Red Star Belgrade was in Zagreb to play Dinamo Zagreb at the Maksimir Stadium. Red Star was {{accompanied}} by 3000 Delije, the organized supporters of the club. Before the match {{a number of small}} fights broke out. Police reinforcements soon arrived with armoured vehicles and water cannons, focusing to separate the fans. Dinamo's player Zvonimir Boban kicked one policeman, defending a Dinamo's fan beaten by the police. The fighting lasted for over an hour and hundreds of people were injured. Football hooliganism in Croatia is sometimes connected with racism and nationalism, although the racist <b>remarks,</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> appear, are pointed solely to opposing club's players, never to own squad.|$|E

60|$|In {{the course}} of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active and healthy, yet his {{strength}} left him suddenly; and when he was confined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing vexed him; and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits. This was especially to be <b>remarked</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> one attempted to impose upon, or domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do him an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child's pride and black tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice, Hindley's manifestation of scorn, while his father was near, roused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and shook with rage that he could not do it.|$|R

60|$|We {{have heard}} a {{discussion}} to-night on the disappearance of literature. That's no new thing. That's what certain kinds of literature have been doing for several years. The fact is, my friends, that the fashion in literature changes, and the literary tailors have to change their cuts or go out of business. Professor Winchester here, if I remember fairly correctly what he said, <b>remarked</b> that few, <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> of the novels produced to-day would live {{as long as the}} novels of Walter Scott. That may be his notion. Maybe he is right; but so far as I am concerned, I don't care if they don't.|$|R
40|$|A DISCUSSION OF {{the impact}} of federally funded {{research}} in librarianship should begin with an attempt to define or establish parameters for the terms employed. If this discussion were limited to those research activities funded exclusively by the federal government, the conclusions, <b>remarks</b> and recommendations (<b>if</b> <b>any)</b> could be contained {{in two or three}} paragraphs. However, very few projects have been supported solely by federal funds. In most instances, projects receive multiple sources of funding, either from local, or other private, municipal, or state sources-and perhaps this is as it should be. Another limiting factor is related to the intent of the legislation which might provide financial resources. Many sources of funding within the fqderal government-the National Scienc...|$|R
5000|$|Bermudian English {{has been}} called [...] "one of the most {{severely}} underresearched varieties of English". It primarily shows a mixture of traits typical of British English and American English, and is generally classified {{as a form of}} American (rather than Caribbean) English. The most detailed scholarly study of Bermudian English, in 1933, stated that this type of speech [...] "would create least <b>remark,</b> <b>if</b> indeed <b>any,</b> between, say, Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina"; British-Bermudian actor Earl Cameron noted that because the Bermudian accent sounded American, he was able to land a speaking role in 1942. Large scale West Indian immigration to Bermuda, especially Sandys and Pembroke parishes, began with the expansion of the Royal Naval Dockyard (as a result of the lack of cheap, unskilled labour in Bermuda) {{at the turn of the}} 19th/20th Century, and affected the dialect of certain demographic groups. Consequently, in certain aspects of vocalization, some Bermudian English dialects are close to some versions of Caribbean English, and some would bracket all these varieties to the broad region of the [...] "English-speaking West Indies". Azorean Portuguese has also impacted on Bermudian English as a result of immigration since the 1840s.|$|R

60|$|Perhaps few {{persons who}} are {{accustomed}} to weigh and test evidence, who know the weaknesses of human memories, and the illusions which impose themselves upon our recollections, will lay great stress on the discrepancies between Henderson’s first deposition (in August), his second (in November), and the statement of the King. In the footnote printed below, {69a} Hudson explains the origin of certain differences between the King’s narrative and Henderson’s evidence, given in August. Hudson declares that James boasted of having taken the dagger out of Ruthven’s hands (which, in fact, James does not do, in his published narration), and that Henderson claimed to have snatched the dagger away, ‘to move mercy by more merit.’ It is clear that James would not accept his story of disarming Ruthven; Henderson omits that in his second deposition. For the rest, James, who was quite clever enough to discover the discrepancies, let them stand, {{at the end of}} his own printed narrative, with the calm <b>remark,</b> that <b>if</b> <b>any</b> differences existed in the depositions, they must be taken as ‘uttered by the deponer in his own behouf, for obtaining of his Majesty’s princely grace and favour.’ {69b} Henderson’s first deposition was one of these which James printed with his own narrative, and thus treated en prince. He was not going to harmonise his evidence with Henderson’s, or Henderson’s with his. On the other hand, from the first, Henderson had probably the opportunity to frame his confession on the Falkland letter of August 5 to the Chancellor, and the Provost of Edinburgh; and, later, on the printed narrative officially issued at the close of August 1600. He varied, when he did vary, in hopes of ‘his Majesty’s princely grace and favour,’ and he naturally tried to make out that he was not a mere trembling expostulating caitiff. He clung to the incident of the garter which he snatched from the Master’s hand.|$|R
