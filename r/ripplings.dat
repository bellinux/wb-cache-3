60|$|Upon a long {{layer of}} the slaty stone were marks of <b>ripplings</b> of some now waveless sea; mid which were tri-toed {{footprints}} of some huge heron, or wading fowl.|$|E
60|$|A rude noise broke {{on these}} fine <b>ripplings</b> and whisperings, at once {{so far away}} and so clear: a {{positive}} tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.|$|E
40|$|The {{rippling}} heuristic {{has been}} rather successfully used to guide inductive proofs in a functional framework. We present here how that heuristic can be formalized in a relational framework, more adapted to logic programming. The rippling heuristic is first analysed to identify its key components. A formalization of these to a relational framework is then presented. The applicability {{and the power}} of our methods is illustrated on two examples: the simulation of the functional <b>rippling's</b> behaviour, and program transformation...|$|R
60|$|A pretty {{quarter of}} the moon threw a {{pleasant}} light over forest and river, making a picture {{that would be a}} delightful piece of landscape study, could an artist only hold it down to his canvas. The motion of the engines had ceased, the puffing of the escaping steam was stilled, and the enveloping silence closed upon us, and such silence it was! Usually in a forest at night one can hear the piping of frogs, the hum of insects, or the dropping of limbs; but here nature was dumb. The dark recesses, those aisles into this cathedral, gave forth no sound, and even the <b>ripplings</b> of the current die away.|$|E
60|$|The {{earliest}} {{rocks in}} the record are called by geologists the Azoic rocks, because they show no traces of life. Great areas of these Azoic rocks lie uncovered in North America, and they are of such a thickness that geologists consider that they represent a period of {{at least half of}} the 1,600,000,000 which they assign to the whole geological record. Let me repeat this profoundly significant fact. Half the great interval of time since land and sea were first distinguishable on earth has left us no traces of life. There are <b>ripplings</b> and rain marks still to be found in these rocks, but no marks nor vestiges of any living thing.|$|E
60|$|Constance, on her Saturdays and Sundays, {{looked on}} {{with a kind of}} wonder. She was not exactly of either set. The {{children}} were all so young as to look on her as a grown-up person, though willing to let her play with them; and she was outside the group of young married people, and could not enter into their family fun; but this kind of playfulness and merriment was quite a revelation to her. She had never before seen mirth, except, of course, childish and schoolgirl play, that had not in it something that hurt her taste and jarred on her feeling as much as did Ida's screeching laughter in comparison with the soft <b>ripplings</b> of these young matrons.|$|E
60|$|For {{he loved}} Li Faa. Moon-faced, rotund as a water-melon seed, canny {{business}} man, wise {{with half a}} century of living-- nevertheless Ah Kim became an artist when he thought of her. He thought of her in poems of names, as woman transmuted into flower- terms of beauty and philosophic abstractions of achievement and easement. She was, to him, and alone to him of all men in the world, his Plum Blossom, his Tranquillity of Woman, his Flower of Serenity, his Moon Lily, and his Perfect Rest. And as he murmured these love endearments of namings, {{it seemed to him that}} in them were the <b>ripplings</b> of running waters, the tinklings of silver wind- bells, and the scents of the oleander and the jasmine. She was his poem of woman, a lyric delight, a three-dimensions of flesh and spirit delicious, a fate and a good fortune written, ere the first man and woman were, by the gods whose whim had been to make all men and women for sorrow and for joy.|$|E
6000|$|Starting early, on the 4th of October, {{the same}} S.S.W wind continued, {{and we began}} to fear that we should hardly clear the {{southern}} point of Gilolo. The night of the 5th was squally, with thunder, but after midnight it got tolerably fair, {{and we were going}} along with a light wind and looking out for the coast of Gilolo, which we thought we must be nearing, when we heard a dull roaring sound, like a heavy surf, behind us. In a short time the roar increased, and we saw a white line of foam coming on, which rapidly passed us without doing any harm, as our boat rose easily over the wave. At short intervals, ten or a dozen others overtook us with bleat rapidity, and then the sea became perfectly smooth, as it was before. I concluded at once that these must be earthquake waves; and on reference to the old voyagers we find that these seas have been long subject to similar phenomena. Dampier encountered them near Mysol and New Guinea, and describes them as follows: [...] "We found here very strange tides, that ran in streams, making a great sea, and roaring so loud that we could hear them before they came within a mile of us. The sea round about them seemed all broken, and tossed the ship so that she would not answer her helm. These <b>ripplings</b> commonly lasted ten or twelve minutes, and then the sea became as still and smooth as a millpond. We sounded often when in the midst of them, but found no ground, neither could we perceive that they drove us any way. We had in one night several of these tides, that came mostly from the west, and the wind being from that quarter we commonly heard them a long time before they came, and sometimes lowered our topsails, thinking it was a gust of wind. They were of great length, from north to south, but their breadth not exceeding 200 yards, and they drove a great pace. For though we had little wind to move us, yet these world soon pass away, and leave the water very smooth, and just before we encountered them we met a great swell, but it did not break." [...] Some time afterwards, I learnt that an earthquake had been felt on the coast of Gilolo the very day we had encountered these curious waves.|$|E

50|$|Hydrogenation of {{graphene}} on substrate affects {{only one}} side, preserving hexagonal symmetry. One-sided hydrogenation of graphene is possible {{due to the}} existence of <b>ripplings.</b> Because the latter are distributed randomly, the obtained material is disordered in contrast to two-sided graphane. Annealing allows the hydrogen to disperse, reverting to graphene. Simulations revealed the underlying kinetic mechanism.|$|E
30|$|Because {{of their}} {{extremely}} large in-plane rigidity {{compared to their}} out-of-plane bending rigidity [21], graphene shells were frequently observed to undergo isometric deformation, featuring local folds [12, 15 – 18, 22 – 26]. Previous analyses showed that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) may undergo beam or shell buckling under bending [23, 25], compression [23], or twisting [23, 24], depending on the aspect ratio of the tube. However, due {{to the presence of}} inter-wall van der Waals (vdW) interactions, the physical mechanisms governing the instability of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), composed of concentric graphene shells, appear to be more complex [12, 15 – 18, 27]. For example, wave-like periodic <b>ripplings</b> appear in twisted MWCNT [18], and Yoshimura patterns are present in a bent MWCNT [15, 17]. It has been elucidated that these unique deformation patterns are driven by the in-plane strain energy release, penalized by the inter-wall vdW energies [16, 18, 27, 28]. Under pure bending or compression, MWCNTs with inter-wall covalent bridges exhibit evolving morphologies [17]. More recently, we have showed that helically arranged diamond pattern appears in thick, uniaxially compressed MWCNTs [16]. The helically arranged diamond pattern appears to be a coordinated deformation morphology of the rigid inner walls and compliant outer walls in the MWCNTs.|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al Congreso del ANQUE-ICCE-BIOTEC: Science, {{the key for}} {{a better}} life; celebrado en Madrid del 1 al 4 de julio de 2014. In natural environments, the {{microbial}} populations are complex communities composed of several species of microorganisms that {{interact with each other}} competing or collaborating in order to survive. In this work we have studied the interaction between different typical soil bacteria as Myxococcus xanthus and several species of Streptomyces in laboratory conditions. M. xanthus, a motile bacteria, exerts its predatory effect on most of Streptomyces species inducing the lysis of the Streptomyces hyphae in the contact zone. These interactions triggers the production of antibiotics either in M. xanthus or in some of the Streptomyces species but not in all. Nevertheless, induction of silent pathways was observed neither in M. xanthus nor in the Streptomyces species under the conditions assayed. Changes in the differentiation pattern was observed in M. xanthus in the interactions with some species of Streptomyces such as S. griseus that induces the grouping of Myxococcus and the formation of <b>ripplings.</b> These results open new possibilities for increasing the production of some antibiotics by conducting co-culture or by adding the inducer molecules produced by other bacteria to cultures of producing microorganisms (Pérez et al. Microb Biotechnol 2011 4 : 175 - 183). Peer Reviewe...|$|E
