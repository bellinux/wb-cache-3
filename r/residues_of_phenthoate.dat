40|$|AbstractOrganophosphate {{poisoning}} is {{not uncommon}} in Taiwan. However, no case of intermediate syndrome (IMS) has been published. We report a case of delayed-onset IMS presenting with abrupt respiratory failure following the acute cholinergic crisis <b>of</b> <b>phenthoate</b> poisoning. Based on electrophysi-ological studies from the literature, IMS results from an excess amount of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junction nicotinic acetylcholine receptors due to prolonged inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. This phenomenon leads to downregulation of the acetylcholine receptor and promotes muscle weakness. There are still no appropriate parameters to predict the development of IMS. Perhaps electrophysiological studies can be applied in the future. Ventilatory support {{is the most important}} treatment; the benefits of pra-lidoxime treatment are still controversial. IMS is still a challenging complication of organophosphate poisoning. Physicians should not overlook IMS...|$|R

5000|$|Proinsulin {{is made up}} <b>of</b> 81 <b>residues</b> {{and formed}} by three {{distinct}} chains. The A chain, B, chain, and the area connecting the two named the C peptide. The correct structure of proinsulin is crucial for the correct folding of mature insulin, as {{the placement of the}} C peptide sets the molecule up to create correctly positioned disulfide bonds in and between the A and B chains. There are three disulfide bonds that are necessary for mature insulin to be the correct structure. Two of these disulfide bonds are between the A and B chains, and one is an intra-A chain bond. [...] The disulfide bonds occur between the seventh <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> the A and B chain, the 19th <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> the A chain and the 20th <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> the B chain, and the 6th and 11th <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> the A chain.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{measure the}} <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> {{spinosad}} and chlorhexidine in the tissues of sheep after treatment of blowfly strike. Procedure Fourteen sheep with natural myiasis and 12 with artificial infestations of Lucilia cuprina larvae had the wool removed over their infestations and {{were treated with}} an aerosol wound dressing containing spinosad and chlorhexidine. Sheep were killed up to 14 days after treatment and <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> the chemicals measured in tissues. Results Chlorhexidine was not detected in any tissue. <b>Residues</b> <b>of</b> spinosad were highest in fat, lowest in muscle and intermediate in liver and kidney. The highest residue detected was 0. 2 mg/kg spinosad in perirenal fat 7 days after generous treatment of a sheep with a large fly strike. <b>Residues</b> <b>of</b> spinosad in fat peaked 3 to 7 days after treatment and 1 to 3 days after treatment in liver and kidney. Conclusion These studies present a realistic worst-case in struck sheep and at the highest dose studied, equivalent to 5. 8 mg spinosad per kg body weight, the maximum <b>residue</b> detected <b>of</b> 0. 2 mg/kg in peri-renal fat was 20 % of the Australian maximum residue limit.

40|$|In {{this study}} we tested the {{hypothesis}} that functional erythrocyte-type glucose transporters (GLUT 1) exist as oligomeric complexes by expressing chimeric transporter proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells harboring endogenous GLUT 1 transporters. The chimeric transporters were GLUT 1 - 4 c, in which the 29 C-terminal <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> human GLUT 1 were replaced by the 30 C-terminal <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> rat skeletal muscle glucose transporter (GLUT 4), and GLUT 1 n- 4, containing the N-terminal 199 <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> GLUT 1 and the 294 C-terminal <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> GLUT 4. Endogenous GLUT 1 was quantitatively co-immunoprecipitated by using an anti-GLUT 4 C-terminal peptide antibody from detergent extracts of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing either of the chimeric proteins, as detected by immunoblotting the precipitates with an anti-GLUT 1 C-terminal peptide antiserum. No co-immunoprecipitation of native GLUT 1 with native GLUT 4 from extracts of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, which contain both these transporters, was observed with the same antibody.
