40|$|Respiration rate is an {{important}} indicator of an individual's health. Existing <b>respiration</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems are usually contact based, and so the sensing device {{is attached to the}} subject's body.

The method involves image and signal processing techniques to extract chest and abdominal movements' information from a sequence of video images recorded using a single video camera. The system provided a real-time <b>respiration</b> <b>monitoring</b> information consisting of a plot of respiration signal and the value of respiration rate. The respiration data could also be stored to allow for off-line analysis to be performed.

It was found that the accuracy of the Spiroflo and Wright instruments were acceptable, but the Birchover was limited in its application and became less accurate in the variations of use described. Monitoring of ventilation is of importance in both clinical anaesthesia and intensive therapy. Several electronic ventilation monitors have become avail-able recently. Each consists of a gas flow trans-ducer head and a meter for the display of minute volume and, in some cases, tidal volume. To test their suitability, three of these instruments have been assessed under a variety of conditions simulating both the normal and the extremes of clinical use. MATERIALS The units evaluated were the Wright <b>respiration</b> <b>monitor,</b> 1 the Spiroflo electronic respirometer, 2 and the Birchover respiratory flowmeter. 3 The Wright <b>respiration</b> <b>monitor</b> and Spiroflow operate on the same principle: mass flow past a vane causes the vane to rotate at a speed propor-tional to the gas flow rate. A transducer converts the rotation of the vane into a train of pulses whose repetition rate is, to a first approximation, linearly proportional to gas flow. The vanes are designed to give a response to gas flow in one direction only, allowing the heads to be used in a tidal air stream without the need for one-way valves. The flow head of the Wright <b>respiration</b> <b>monitor</b> (fig. 1) has been developed from the Wright respirometer (Wright, 1955). Gas flows through tangential slots in a stator ring (B) after entering through the inlet mount (A). It rotates the two-bladed rotor (D) and leaves through the outlet mount (C).

Based on the observation that respiration induced chest/abdomen motion is an independent motion system in a video, our basic idea is to exploit the intrinsic properties of respiration to find the respiratory RoI and extract the respiratory signal via motion factorization.

Progress in computational intelligence and medical sensors has facilitated the development of smart bedside monitors that can integrate multiple parameters into a single monitoring system. This paper describes non-contact monitoring of neonatal vital signals based on infrared thermography as a new biomedical engineering application. One signal of clinical interest is the spontaneous respiration rate of the neonate. It will be shown that the respiration rate of neonates can be monitored based on analysis of the anterior naris (nostrils) temperature profile associated with the inspiration and expiration phases successively. Objective The {{aim of this study}} is to develop and investigate a new non-contact <b>respiration</b> <b>monitoring</b> modality for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using infrared thermography imaging. This development includes subsequent image processing (region of interest (ROI) detection) and optimization. Moreover, it includes further optimization of this non-contact <b>respiration</b> <b>monitoring</b> to be considered as physiological measurement inside NICU wards. Results Continuous wavelet transformation based on Debauches wavelet function was applied to detect the breathing signal within an image stream. Respiration was successfully monitored based on a 0. 3 °C to 0. 5 °C temperature difference between the inspiration and expiration phases. Conclusions Although this method has been applied to adults before, this is the first time it was used in a newborn infant population inside the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the use of}} radar for heartbeat and <b>respiration</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Medical radar {{can be used for}} detecting vital signs at distances up to several meters. A medical radar works by transmitting electromagnetic waves towards a person, and receiving echoes reflected off the person. Vital signs appear as modulations in the radar data in period with the heartbeats and respiration. We have measured and analyzed these modulations. The ability to detect human heartbeats from a distance can be used for monitoring patients’ heartbeats without the need of attaching the measurement equipment to the patient. A radar system can be placed over a bed, integrated in a mattress or chair or used for non-intrusive home monitoring. It could also be used {{as an alternative to the}} diagnostic monitoring tools of today. In this thesis, the understanding of radar heartbeat detection is explored. Although heartbeats and <b>respiration</b> <b>monitoring</b> using radar have been reported many times before, the optimal frequencies, waveforms and aspect angle of detection were not known. We have described the vital signs modulations as functions of frequency and aspect angle, and found both narrowband and ultra wideband radar to be suited for the task. In addition to quantizing the modulations, an experimental approach to understanding why heartbeat and respiration detection with radar is possible was made. We found that small body surface movements are the cause of the observed heartbeat modulations in radar data, discarding the theory that reflections from internal body organs are seen. On-body radar have been used as well, and a closer connection between the actual movements of the heart and the radar recordings were found than what is achievable using remote radar. With on-body radar and the processing presented in this thesis, details of the heart mechanics can be identified using radar.

Such systems aim to extract respiratory signals from time-series pressure sequences.

40|$|Respiration rate {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{indicators}} of an individual's health and therefore it requires accurate quantification. Its value can be used to predict life threatening conditions such as the child death syndrome and heart attacks. The current <b>respiration</b> rate <b>monitoring</b> methods are contact based, i. e. a sensing device needs to be attached to the person's body. Physically constraining infants and young children by a sensing device can be stressful to the individuals which in turn affects their respiration rate. Therefore, measuring respiration rate in a non-contact manner (i. e. without attaching the sensing device to the subject) has distinct benefits. Currently there is not any non-contact <b>respiration</b> rate <b>monitoring</b> available for use in medical field. The aim of this study was to investigate thermal imaging as a means for non-contact <b>respiration</b> rate <b>monitoring.</b> Thermal imaging is safe and easy to deploy. Twenty children were enrolled for the study at Sheffield Children Hospital; the children were from 6 month to 17 years old. They slept comfortably in a bed during the recordings. A high resolution high sensitivity (0. 08 degree Kelvin) thermal camera (Air A 40) was used for the recordings. The image capture rate was 50 frames per second and its recording duration per subject was two minutes (i. e. 6000 image frames) A median digital lowpass filter was used to remove unwanted frequency spectrum of the images. An important issue was to localize and track the area centered on the tip of the nose (i. e. respiration region of interest, RO!). A number of approaches were developed for this purpose. The most effective approach was to identify use the warmest facial point (i. e. the point where the bridge of the nose meets the corner of one of the eyes). A novel method to analyse the selected ROI was devised. This involved segmenting the ROI into eight equal segments centred on the tip of nose. A respiration signal was produced for each segment across the 6000 recorded 'images from each subject. The study demonstrated that the process of dividing the ROI into eight segments improves determination of respiration rate. The respiration signals were processed both in the time and frequency domains to determine respiration rates for the 20 subjects included in the study. The respiration values obtained from the two domains were close. During each recording <b>respiration</b> rate was <b>monitored</b> using conventional contact methods (e. g. nostril thermistor, abdomen and chest movement sensor etc).

The method proved valuable for tracking the ROI in all these head movement types. It was also possible to use this tracking method to <b>monitor</b> <b>respiration</b> rate involving a number of head movement types. Currently, more investigations are underway to improve the tracking method so that it can track the ROI in cases larger head movements...|$|R
