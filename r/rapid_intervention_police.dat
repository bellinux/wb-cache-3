5|$|Angola {{held the}} first round of its 1992 presidential {{election}} on 29–30 September. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. Savimbi sent Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round. The election process broke down on 31 October, when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids with the <b>Rapid</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Police,</b> killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. Assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy on 2 November, pulling him out of his car and shooting him and two others in their faces. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. He then proceeded to resume armed struggle against the MPLA.|$|E

40|$|Trends {{in serious}} {{violence}} in England and Wales {{were derived from}} anonymous information about treatment of injuries collected from {{a representative sample of}} 32 major A&E departments in England and Wales. · Trends in violence recorded by the police and violence-related A&E attendances were compared in five cities with public space Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and five similar cities without public space CCTV in the two years before and the two years after CCTV installation. · There were significant overall decreases in serious violence of 13 % in England and of 20 % in Wales over the five years 2000 - 2004 : it is estimated that 25, 700 fewer people attended major A&Es after violence-related injury in England in 2004 compared with 2000 : 2, 800 fewer in Wales. · There were significant national decreases in violence affecting males, females, males and females aged 0 to 10, males and females aged 11 to 17, females aged 18 to 30 and females aged 51 and over. No increases were found. · The greatest decreases in England and Wales were observed in 2004. · Those at highest risk of violence-related injury were males and those aged 18 to 30. · The installation of city centre CCTV was followed by an increase in police detection of violence and disorder, and a decrease in serious violence according to injury data. · Effectiveness of CCTV probably lies less in preventing assaults and their precursors, but more in preventing injury through detection and <b>rapid</b> <b>intervention</b> by the <b>police</b> thereby reducing burdens on A&E departments. ...|$|R
