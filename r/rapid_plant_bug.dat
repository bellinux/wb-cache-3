50|$|Adelphocoris lineolatus, {{common names}} for which are <b>rapid</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> or superb plant bug, is {{a species of}} Hemiptera in the family Miridae, {{that can be found}} {{everywhere}} in the United States (except for central), and in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada. The species are larger than other members of the family (7-8 millimetres or 0.28-0.31 inch), and are either yellowish-black or orange-black coloured.|$|E
50|$|Females can lay 35-100 eggs. The greenish-white {{coloured}} {{eggs are}} laid singly in the stems of plants. The eggs {{could also be}} yellow coloured and can turn red {{by the time of}} hatching. They are 1.2-1.3 millimetres (0.047-0.051 in) in length and are 0.3 millimetres (0.012 in) wide. The eggs shape are cylindrical and are curved, which causes them to be mistaken for the eggs of tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bugs</b> and pale legume bugs. However, the difference between the species eggs is that <b>rapid</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug's</b> eggs have a distinct extension or spine. The incubation of the eggs takes 15-20 days of summer.|$|R

50|$|Alfalfa <b>plant</b> <b>bugs</b> {{require a}} certain set of optimal {{conditions}} {{in order to}} thrive and become a pest in any country. A. lineolatus are primarily located in humid environments with cold temperatures. Commonly one can find these <b>plant</b> <b>bugs</b> in either fields or grasslands, in both dry and damp areas. However, alfalfa <b>plant</b> <b>bugs</b> are not successful in salty lakes, deserts, sand dunes, windy weather, or very warm climates. Adelphocoris lineolatus will easily adapt to cooler environmental conditions, which has allowed them to invade {{a large amount of}} territory in Canada.|$|R

40|$|The {{tarnished}} <b>plant</b> <b>bug,</b> known principally as {{an agricultural}} pest, injures young hybrid Populus by feeding on the stems and meristems. Tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> eggs, fungi associated with some lesions, and simple mechanical stimuli alone from feeding appeared not to cause lesion formation. Of 20 Populus hybrids {{tested in a}} clonal trial, four appeared to be consistently susceptible to lesion injury, with Populus nigra var. betulifolia x trichocarpa the most susceptible. Several clones showed high resistance in the trial but a few were susceptible in other plantings and in host preference tests when caged with tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bugs.</b> Lesions diminished tenfold on Populus where horseweed, the insect 2 Ì† 7 s principal wild host, grew along with susceptible poplars.

40|$|Yield loss {{estimates}} {{attributed to}} tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bugs</b> are typically low, compared with losses associated with other cotton insect pests. However, this pest is pivotal because early-season spraying for <b>plant</b> <b>bugs</b> reduces beneficial insects and exacerbates other insect pest problems. Studies {{reported in the}} literature indicate the sensitivity of cotton genotypes is, to some degree, dependent on their morphological characteristics. Genotypes expressing the Frego bract characteristic are highly sensitive to <b>plant</b> <b>bugs,</b> while nectariless genotypes have some resistance. The effects of other characteristics are not well established. Earlier work done in Texas suggested that in a mixed planting of two genotypes possessin...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The western {{tarnished}} <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> Lygus hesperus is {{an economically}} important pest {{that belongs to}} a complex of morphologically similar species that makes identification problematic. The present study provides evidence {{for the use of}} DNA barcodes from populations of L. hesperus from the western United States of America for accurate identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study reports DNA barcodes for 134 individuals of the western tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> from alfalfa and strawberry agricultural fields in the western United States of America. Sequence divergence estimates of < 3 % reveal that morphologically variable individuals presumed to be L. hesperus were accurately identified. Paired estimates of F(st) and subsequent estimates of gene flow show that geographically distinct populations of L. hesperus are genetically similar. Therefore, our results support and reinforce the relatively recent (< 100 years) migration of the western tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> into agricultural habitats across the western United States. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that despite wide host plant usage and phenotypically plastic morphological traits, the commonly recognized western tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> belongs to a single species, Lygus hesperus. In addition, no significant genetic structure was found for the geographically diverse populations of western tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> used in this study...|$|R
