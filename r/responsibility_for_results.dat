40|$|This article investigates how and to {{what extent}} {{performance}} indicators in Dutch central government are actually embedded in performance management. In a case study encompassing 12 government organizations, the relevance of the indicators presented is analysed in three stages: (1) with respect to the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>results</b> intended in performance measurement, (2) with respect to responsibilities actually implied in resource allocation and (3) with respect to responsibilities ultimately to be inferred from governance – planning and control – systems applied. In our research, management control systems appear to be only partially tuned to the performance indicators specified in advance. The familiar expression ‘What you measure is what you get’ is thereby invalidated by all kinds of restrictions imposed on a manager’s actual <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> measurement outcomes...|$|R

5000|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{empowerment}} {{has become}} a point of interest in management concepts and business administration. In this context, empowerment involves approaches that promise greater participation and integration to the employee in order to cope with their tasks as independently as possible and responsibly can. A strength-based approach known as [...] "empowerment circle" [...] {{has become a}}n instrument of organizational development. Multidisciplinary empowerment teams aim {{for the development of}} quality circles to improve the organizational culture, strengthening the motivation and the skills of employees. The target of subjective job satisfaction of employees is pursued through flat hierarchies, participation in decisions, opening of creative effort, a positive, appreciative team culture, self-evaluation, taking <b>responsibility</b> (<b>for</b> <b>results),</b> more self-determination and constant further learning. The optimal use of existing potential and abilities can supposedly be better reached by satisfied and active workers. Here, knowledge management contributes significantly to implement employee participation as a guiding principle, for example through the creation of communities of practice.|$|E

5000|$|The Circular No. 59 {{reorganization}} {{directed the}} AAF to operate under a complex division of administrative control {{performed by a}} policy staff, an operating staff, and the support commands (formerly [...] "field activities" [...] of the OCAC). The former field activities operated under a [...] "bureau" [...] structure, with both policy and operating functions vested in staff-type officers who often exercised command and policy authority without <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>results,</b> a system held over from the Air Corps years. The concept of an [...] "operating staff," [...] or directorates, was modeled on the RAF system that had been much admired by the observer groups sent over in 1941, and resulted from a desire to place experts in various aspects of military aviation into key positions of implementation. However functions often overlapped, communication and coordination between the divisions failed or was ignored, policy prerogatives were usurped by the directorates, and they became overburdened with detail, all contributing to the diversion of the directorates from their original purpose. The system of directorates in particular handicapped the developing operational training program (see Combat units below), preventing establishment of an OTU command and having a tendency to micromanage {{because of the lack}} of centralized control. Four main directorates—Military Requirements, Technical Services, Personnel, and Management Control—were created, each with multiple sub-directorates, and eventually more than thirty offices were authorized to issue orders in the name of the commanding general.|$|E
