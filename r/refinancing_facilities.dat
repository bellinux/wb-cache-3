50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Fed, the ECB normally does not buy bonds outright. The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called <b>refinancing</b> <b>facilities.</b> In these facilities, bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions: repurchase agreements, or collateralised loans. These two transactions are similar, i.e. bonds are used as collaterals for loans, the difference being of legal nature. In the repos the ownership of the collateral changes to the ECB until the loan is repaid.|$|E
40|$|A {{central bank}} {{possesses}} various instruments to provide liquidity. These are either outright monetary transactions (OMT) of securities or other <b>refinancing</b> <b>facilities,</b> primarily repos, which are executed with standard tenders. The eligible securities (i. e. bonds or equities) need to conform with certain credit risk criteria (i. e., satisfactory credit rating or low default probability). This paper introduces a monetary model {{to address the}} role of collateralized securities {{on the effectiveness of}} monetary policy. Our results suggest that credit rating downgrading may precipitate into a disproportionate credit contraction...|$|E

Some lessons are suggested for their implementation in developing countries or economies in transition. ...|$|R

However, in a difficult lettings market the building struggled to find enough tenants to fill it and in September 2013 only 59% of the available office space had been let.

40|$|ABSTRACT From the literature, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that there exist a huge untapped potential for financial intermediation at the micro and rural levels of the Nigerian economy. Attempts by the government in the past to fill this gap, through supply – driven creation of financing institutions and schemes have failed due to high operating cost, repayment problem, weak <b>refinancing</b> <b>facilities,</b> client apathy and drop out among others. To this end, the paper suggested some success imperatives including group delivery methodology, efficient Management Information System (MIS), involvement of clients and intensive use of microfins and monitoring among others to achieve the stated microfinance policy objectives within the ambit of the Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) by 2015.

30|$|Another {{justification}} for {{this paper is}} the goal of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other stakeholders to implement a national financial inclusion strategy that will decrease the number of Nigerians that are excluded from financial services from 46.3 % to 20.0 % by 2020 and to increase the number that are included from 30 % in 2010 to 70 % by 2020, as committed to in the Maya Declaration. The CBN (2012) noted that this goal will be achieved through a broad range of coordinated interventions that include the implementation of Credit Enhancement Schemes/Programs to empower micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises; these schemes/programs include the following: the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development Fund, of which 60 % is targeted at supporting the on-lending activities of microfinance banks and institutions to women enterprises and clients; implementation of the Nigerian Incentive-based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL); Entrepreneurship Development Centers (EDCs); Restructuring and <b>Refinancing</b> <b>Facilities</b> for SMEs; and the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme.|$|E

The Bank must however continue to provide an appropriate working capital facility (i.e. continue to make available an overdraft) should existing borrowing be refinanced and the customer still wishes an overdraft. The level of any continuing overdraft is to be determined by the Bank in that it does not necessarily require to equal the amount of the overdraft which is being refinanced by EFG.|$|R
