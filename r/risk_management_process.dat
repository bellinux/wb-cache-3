2500|$|Hazard {{identification}} or {{assessment is}} an important step in the overall risk assessment and <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>process.</b> It is where individual work hazards are identified, assessed and controlled/eliminated as close to source (location of the hazard) as reasonably as possible. As technology, resources, social expectation or regulatory requirements change, hazard analysis focuses controls more closely toward the source of the hazard. Thus hazard control is a dynamic program of prevention. Hazard-based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are [...] "acceptable risks" [...] in the workplace. A hazard-based program {{may not be able to}} eliminate all risks, but neither does it accept [...] "satisfactory" [...] – but still risky – outcomes. And as those who calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the risks are a different group, workers, a hazard-based approach can by-pass conflict inherent in a risk-based approach.|$|E

40|$|Accidents {{and threats}} {{have always been}} present in society, but the {{increasing}} complexity and interconnectedness within society, including the public sector, contribute {{to the emergence of}} new types of risk and more complex causalities. The ability to understand the emergence of risk, and to manage and control risk is a prerequisite for individuals, organizations, and society to survive and operate safely. Over the past years the role of the state, as a regulator and risk manager, has increased. The management and control of risk within the state takes place at many system levels, ranging from policy level to street level bureaucrats by means of laws, rules, and instructions. Each level can influence the others in an integrated and tightly coupled control system. These levels constitute subsystems within the state and offer different organizational interfaces or points of contacts between the organizational subsystem and its members. Managing risk and preventing accidents in the public sector therefore depend on activities and interfaces among actors at different system levels. This thesis draws attention to multilevel <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes</b> in two public sectors: public healthcare and municipalities (local government). The <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes</b> covered are those ensuring patient safety in the specialized healthcare sector and municipal emergency management in the municipal sector. The thesis explores and analyzes how the society establishes regimes to regulate and manage risk within the public sector, by applying the socio-technical system perspective as a framework. This approach allows the shifting of levels of analysis within the socio-technical system involved in public <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> and gives rise to issues like regulatory regimes; tools and strategies applied in controlling and managing risk; understanding the emergence of and adaptation to, risks; information flow and learning processes among system levels; and characteristics of organizational interfaces among different agencies and institutions of national, regional, and local character of importance for public <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes.</b> The main focus of the thesis is the organizational interfaces involved in <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes</b> in the public sector. The overall research problem is: How can organizational interfaces across system levels explain <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes</b> in the public sector? Several theoretical contributions in risk, regulation, and organizational studies are applied to explore and interpret these organizational interfaces. A qualitative research strategy was chosen to provide insight into organizational matters, <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes,</b> and discourses within different risk regulation regimes. In four research articles, the thesis documents that organizational interfaces across system levels can explain <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes</b> in the public sector. Two articles describe organizational interfaces across the entire sociotechnical system; how risk amplification and attenuation and learning function in the interfaces; and how regulatory enforcement influences <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes.</b> Two articles investigate how the organizational interface between regulators and regulatees affects public risk management; how different enforcement strategies promote or counteract learning processes; and how a system or an individual focus in enforcement activities makes different contributions to <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes.</b> [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the central}} goals of federal {{securities}} laws is to protect investors by ensuring that they receive {{a steady flow of}} timely, complete, and accurate information. However, that goal is partially undermined by the SEC’s failure to require public companies to disclose anything about their strategic <b>management</b> <b>processes</b> despite increasing requirements on the disclosure of associated <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes.</b> Like <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes,</b> strategic <b>management</b> <b>processes</b> are designed to create firm value. But instead of focusing on loss-creating <b>risks,</b> strategic <b>management</b> focuses on wealth-creating opportunities. As a result, investors are given a lopsided — rather than a complete or accurate — picture of firm processes to create value. To address this concern, I propose that the SEC require public firms to disclose those qualities of their strategic <b>management</b> <b>processes</b> equivalent to what they disclose about their <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>processes.</b> I also propose that firms disclose how those two processes relate to one another. This new disclosure would give investors a more balanced picture of firm processes to create value. It would also reinforce the reality that the path to long-term success for a firm lays not merely with managing its risks, but also with formulating and implementing an effective strategy for growth — a process that unfortunately may suffer from neglect amidst the box-checking exercise that flows from compliance with scores of risk-based regulations...|$|R
