25|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to {{eliminate}} turtles to improve upon the speed of bubble sort. Cocktail sort is a bi-directional bubble sort that goes from beginning to end, and then <b>reverses</b> <b>itself,</b> going end to beginning. It can move turtles fairly well, but it retains O(n2) worst-case complexity. Comb sort compares elements separated by large gaps, and can move turtles extremely quickly before proceeding to smaller and smaller gaps to smooth out the list. Its average speed is comparable to faster algorithms like quicksort.|$|E
25|$|East of Cazenovia, US20 resumes its southward drift as it {{climbs into}} the high ground again and expands to four lanes, passing the small village of Morrisville in the process. It descends from there to its next state highway, NY46, where it reverts to two lanes for a brief concurrency, after which NY46 leaves for {{isolated}} Hamilton. The southern trend <b>reverses</b> <b>itself</b> after this junction, with first NY26 and later NY12B joining US20 to create another three-route overlap. This persists for three very straight miles until both leave to the north {{in the town of}} Madison. After another , the highway crosses into Oneida County.|$|E
25|$|Although oak barrels {{have long}} been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. It is a common {{misconception}} that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. This is not so. The butter flavors come from lactic acid, naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to diacetyl. This process <b>reverses</b> <b>itself,</b> although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the diacetyl remains. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips {{have the benefit of}} imparting intense oak flavoring {{in a matter of weeks}} while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards the vanilla extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts. The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are a very practical alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak planks or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels. Improvements in micro-oxygenation have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.|$|E

2500|$|According to Harvard University's [...] Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Noah Feldman, [...] "a {{decision}} can {{be wrong}} {{at the very}} moment it was decided [...] and therefore should not be followed subsequently." [...] Justice Anthony M. Kennedy applied this approach in Lawrence v. Texas to overturn Bowers v. Hardwick and thereby strike down anti-sodomy laws in 14 states. [...] The implication is that decisions which are wrong when decided should not be followed even before the Court <b>reverses</b> <b>itself,</b> and Korematsu has probably the greatest claim to being wrong when decided of any case which still stands. [...] Legal scholar Richard Primus applied the term [...] "Anti-Canon" [...] to cases which are [...] "universally assailed as wrong, immoral, and unconstitutional" [...] and have become exemplars of faulty legal reasoning.
