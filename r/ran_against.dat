5|$|In 1820 Harrison <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> Jennings in his re{{election}} bid. Jennings {{won the election}} by a large majority, 11,256 votes to Harrison's 2,008. Jennings's win by a three-to-one margin suggests he remained a popular politician and the state's voters were not overly concerned by attacks on the governor's character.|$|E

5|$|Chotiner {{initially}} {{registered to}} vote as a Democrat, but soon switched parties, joining the Republicans. He involved himself in Republican politics, working on Herbert Hoover's unsuccessful presidential re-election campaign in 1932. In 1938, the young attorney <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> longtime Republican incumbent Charles W. Lyon for the California State Assembly. Lyon cross-filed and secured his re-election by winning both primaries, defeating Chotiner in the Republican poll, and narrowly beating Robert A. Heinlein (who subsequently turned to writing science fiction) in the Democratic contest.|$|E

Dunderdale <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she knew she would not win the election she felt she had to send premier Clyde Wells a message about the way he was treating municipalities.

McClellan, a Democrat, <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> President Lincoln, on a peace platform {{calling for a}} truce with the Confederacy.

5|$|The inquiry's {{final report}} was {{released}} just 12 {{days before the}} 2014 municipal election.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|During the 1809 {{election}} for Hampshire County's two {{seats in the}} Virginia House of Delegates, White <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> fellow Federalist Alexander King, and Democratic-Republicans William Donaldson and Jonathan Pugh.

5|$|Franklin asked Timothy Folger, {{his cousin}} twice removed (Nantucket Historical Society), a Nantucket Island whaling captain, for an answer. Folger {{explained}} that merchant ships routinely crossed the then-unnamed Gulf Stream—identifying it by whale behavior, {{measurement of the}} water's temperature and the speed of bubbles on its surface, {{and changes in the}} water's color—while the mail packet captains <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> it. Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the Gulf Stream and giving it the name by which it is still known today. He offered this information to Anthony Todd, secretary of the British Post Office, but it was ignored by British sea captains.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, {{incumbent}} Pryce {{announced her}} retirement {{at the end}} of her elected term. The Democrats felt that the seat continued to be vulnerable. Kilroy announced her intention to again seek the 15th District seat in 2008. She <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> Republican Steve Stivers, a State Senator from the 16th District, Libertarian Mark M. Noble, and Independent candidate Don Elijah Eckhart. The race was considered to be one of the most important U.S. House of Representatives races to watch in the country. The last Democrat to hold the 15th district was Robert T. Secrest in the mid-1960s, but with Republican voters moving out of the district into the northern suburbs of Columbus, Ohio since the 1990s, the district became more evenly matched.|$|E
5|$|Reagan <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> Democratic {{incumbent}} Jimmy Carter {{and independent}} candidate John B. Anderson. He was praised by supporters {{for running a}} campaign of upbeat optimism. Aided by the Iran hostage crisis and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation, Reagan won the election in a massive landslide. The 1980 presidential election {{marked the beginning of}} the Reagan Era, and signified a conservative realignment in national politics. At 69 years old, Reagan became the oldest person ever elected U.S. president until 2017, when President Donald Trump was sworn in at the age of 70.|$|E

He faced one opponent in the Democratic primary on August 26: lifelong Republican and Washington, D.C. resident H.

After the two fought back and forth for a few minutes, Brown threw DDP against the ropes while he <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> the opposite ropes and performed a running shoulder block {{in the center of the}} ring to complete a move he named the Pounce.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} her defeat in the Derby, La Fleche <b>ran</b> <b>against</b> fillies in the Oaks. Although some {{regarded}} her as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad Corrie before taking {{the lead in the}} straight apparently poised for an easy victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely pressed by The Smew, a filly she had dealt with easily in the 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La Fleche won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad Corrie by a length and a half.|$|E
