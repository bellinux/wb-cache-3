Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The two female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen. The previous president, Jerzy Buzek was the first East-Central European to lead an EU institution, a former Prime Minister of Poland who <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Solidarity movement in Poland that helped overthrow communism in the Eastern Bloc.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the caldera, and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E

5|$|Mills {{took over}} as manager of Second Division Notts County on 9 January 2004 after the {{resignation}} of Bill Dearden, with the club lying 23rd in the Second Division table. His first match in charge came just a day later, in which Marc Goodfellow scored a stoppage time winner for Bristol City as County were beaten 2–1 at home. After a run of good form from late February to early March 2004 County <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the relegation zone, but a run of one victory from the last 12 matches of 2003–04 saw the club relegated to League Two in 23rd place. Despite having a healthier playing budget and a reorganisation of the squad {{during the summer of}} 2004, County made a disappointing start to 2004–05. As a result, Mills was dismissed on 4 November 2004 with the club 21st in League Two, and he declined the offer of a lesser position with the club. He resumed his playing career during early 2005 with Northern Counties East League Premier Division club Glapwell, playing under Lee Wilson, who Mills had previously played with and managed.|$|E

500|$|Although other storm kelpies are {{reported}} as inhabiting the Gulf of Corrievreckan, described by poet, writer and folklorist Alasdair Alpin MacGregor as [...] "the fiercest of the Highland storm kelpies", the blue men {{are confined to}} a very restricted area. According to Donald A. Mackenzie they have no counterparts {{elsewhere in the world}} or even in other areas of Scotland; such limited range is rare for beliefs in spirits and demons. Folklorist and Tiree minister John Gregorson Campbell states that they were unknown in Argyll on the nearby coast of the mainland for instance, although Church of Scotland minister John Brand, who visited Quarff in Shetland in mid-1700, recounts a tale of what may have been a blue man in the waters around the island. In the form of a bearded old man it <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water, terrifying the passengers and crew of a boat it was following.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{continued}} warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, seed ferns or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. Synapsids, commonly known as [...] "mammal-like reptiles", were common in Antarctica during the Early Triassic and included forms such as Lystrosaurus. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period (206–146Ma), and islands gradually <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ocean. Ginkgo trees, conifers, bennettites, horsetails, ferns and cycads were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, coniferous forests dominated through the entire Cretaceous period (146–66Ma), though southern beech became more prominent {{towards the end of}} this period. Ammonites were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only three Antarctic dinosaur genera (Cryolophosaurus and Glacialisaurus, from the Hanson Formation, and Antarctopelta) have been described to date. It was during this era that Gondwana began to break up.|$|E

The first test, a climb to Alpe d'Huez, was seen as a dress rehearsal for the Tour de France, to be held in July, with the , 8.6% average hors catégorie climb featuring twice on that race's eighteenth stage. From there, it was a short descent to the second climb, the second-category Col de Sarenne, which averaged almost 7% over [...] of climbing. An immediate long descent followed, before the first-category Col d'Ornon, which averaged 6.1% over its [...] duration. The riders enjoyed a respite from the climbs for around an hour across the Valbonnais, passing through the intermediate sprint at Corps.

500|$|In {{addition}} to his rapping, Nas achieved significance for his poetic use of language. Professor Adilifu Nama of California State University Northridge writes, “With Illmatic, hip-hop witnessed the birth of an urban griot telling hard-boiled tales of ghetto alienation and triumph like a spoken-word of a Chester Himes novel" [...] Author and music writer Todd Boyd wrote of Nas' urban realism, stating that his [...] "poetic lyrics {{are some of the}} most poignant words ever to describe the postindustrial urban experience. His spoken-word like delivery and his vivid use of metaphor placed him at the top of the game in terms of overall skills as an MC and as a cultural commentator." [...] An OhWord.com columnist similarly described Nas as a [...] "genius introvert who <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the rubble of Reaganomics to bless the mic with a forward brand of introspective, redemptive street poetry". Princeton University professor Imani Perry also describes Illmatic as [...] "ars poetica, a definitive statement for the art of hip-hop poetry." ...|$|E
500|$|Investigations {{into the}} effect {{revealed}} what was causing the problem. While {{in the ground}} effect, the high-pressure air under the craft was trapped, filling the entire area and thus providing a stable base. When the craft <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ground effect, the air formed itself into a single narrow column, described by Frost as [...] "tree trunking". At intermediate altitudes the craft would momentarily transition from one regime to the other, during which time {{one side of the}} vehicle would be entirely supported while the support was disappearing under the other. This led to a strong pitching motion towards the unsupported side. As soon as this occurred that side would approach the ground and re-establish the supporting air, while the other side would then be raised above this limit. This process would repeat itself, with the craft rolling from side to side. Modifications were carried out {{in order to try to}} solve the problem. Eventually a series of 52 holes were drilled in the bottom of the vehicle, located radially three feet from the center. These were to provide a central jet to stabilize the ground cushion.|$|E

500|$|Several {{aspects of}} the episode had to be {{compromised}} due to budget constraints. The true form of the aliens could only be shown {{for a few seconds}} each as it was very expensive to do, and these shots were spread throughout the episode. In the original script a big monster <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water in Isabella's death scene, but this would have been too expensive and Moffat was forced to ask Whithouse to make it [...] "invisible". Many of the costumes in the episode were taken from artwork from the 15th and 16th centuries. This included veils that women wore, which were used for the vampire girls. Guido trades clothes with Rory when Rory must disguise himself as a Venetian to enter Amy into the school; this was an idea of Moffat's which Whithouse was against as he thought Guido was a [...] "tragic character", but he eventually thought the sight of the character in Rory's stag party T-shirt was funny. McCrory's costume was designed to be similar to her alien creature to make the transition smooth. McCrory was coached to move like a fish, which she pursued diligently. Each pair of teeth for the vampires was unique and moulded to their mouths. They were hard to speak with and Alex Price's lines were re-voiced, though he commented he got [...] "quite good" [...] at speaking with them.|$|E
500|$|Putana (also {{called as}} poothani), the [...] "killer of infants", {{was sent by}} Krishna's evil uncle Kamsa to kill Krishna. Putana assumed the {{disguise}} of a young, beautiful woman and came to Gokul (Vraj) - Krishna's home-town. Her beauty resulted in her being mistaken by gopas (cowherds) {{as a manifestation of}} goddess Lakshmi. Stunned by her beauty, Krishna's foster-mother Yashoda allowed Putana to take the infant Krishna into her lap and breast-feed him. Putana had smeared her breast with a mandana, an intoxicant, to kill Krishna. [...] However, Krishna squeezed her breasts and took her life away(prana), as well as her milk. (Putana had got blessing [...] in her previous life from Lord Vishnu that she will meet lord Vishnu's avtaar in human form in her next life but she forgot about it). In pain, Putana screamed, pleading for her release, but in vain. She ran out of the town with Krishna still clinging to her and finally fell dead. [...] She then assumed her real demonic form, turning trees to a distance of three gavyuti (a unit of distance equivalent totally to 12 miles) to dust. The people of Vraj cut Putana's body, burying her bones and feet and burning the flesh and skin. The fragrant smoke <b>rose</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the flames, as Putana was cleansed of all sin by breast-feeding Krishna and she attained the same heaven that Yashoda acquired. Thus, Putana, like Yashodha, is also considered as a foster-mother of Krishna as she breast-fed him.|$|E
