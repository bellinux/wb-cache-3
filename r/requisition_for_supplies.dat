2500|$|Bragg had a {{reputation}} for being a strict disciplinarian and one who adhered to regulations literally. There is a famous, apocryphal story, included in Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs, about Bragg as a company commander at a frontier post where he also served as quartermaster. He submitted a <b>requisition</b> <b>for</b> <b>supplies</b> for his company, then as quartermaster declined to fill it. As company commander, he resubmitted the requisition, giving additional reasons for his requirements, but as the quartermaster he denied the request again. Realizing that he was at a personal impasse, he referred the matter to the post commandant, who exclaimed, [...] "My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarreled with every officer in the army, and now you are quarreling with yourself!" [...] It is alleged that some of his troops attempted to assassinate him on two occasions in August and September 1847, but he was not injured either time. In the more serious of the two incidents, one of his soldiers exploded a 12-pound artillery shell underneath his cot. Although the cot was destroyed, somehow Bragg himself emerged without a scratch. Bragg had suspicions about the identity of the perpetrator, but had insufficient evidence to bring charges. Later, an Army deserter named Samuel R. Church claimed credit for the attack.|$|E
50|$|Other Losses {{states that}} after visiting {{many of the}} camps in August 1945, General Robert Littlejohn (Quartermaster of the ETO) {{concluded}} that the U.S. Army was reporting 3.7 million prisoners while it actually possessed 5.2 million, thereby corroborating the conclusions made in a report three months earlier from General J. Lee (in charge of logistics for the ETO), which he had sent to SHAEF headquarters. Other Losses states that Littlejohn subsequently wrote in a report to Washington that because <b>requisitions</b> <b>for</b> <b>supplies</b> were based on these faulty numbers, 1.5 million prisoners were getting no food.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in 1777, Congress {{repeatedly}} {{asked the}} states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780 Congress was making <b>requisitions</b> <b>for</b> specific <b>supplies</b> of corn, beef, pork and other necessities—an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.|$|R
60|$|The city of Tyre, before Alexander besieged it, as it lived {{entirely by}} commerce, and was {{surrounded}} by the sea, had {{to depend on the}} neighboring countries <b>for</b> a <b>supply</b> of food. The people were accordingly accustomed to purchase grain in Phoenicia, in Judea, and in Egypt, and transport it by their ships to the island. Alexander, in the same manner, when besieging the city, found that he must depend upon the neighboring countries <b>for</b> <b>supplies</b> of food; and he accordingly sent <b>requisitions</b> <b>for</b> such <b>supplies</b> to several places, and, among others, to Judea. The Jews, as Josephus says, refused to send any such supplies, saying that it would be inconsistent with fidelity to Darius, under whose government they were.|$|R
50|$|SUPPLY OPERATIONS. Most unit {{logistics}} were accomplished at regimental level. Theregimental QM was {{normally a}} line lieutenant {{designated by the}} regimental commander. Hisduties included submitting <b>requisitions</b> <b>for</b> all QM <b>supplies</b> and transport, accounting forregimental property including tentage, camp equipment, extra clothing, wagons, forage, andanimals; issuing supplies and managing the regimental trains. The regimental commissaryofficer, also designated from the line, <b>requisitioned,</b> accounted <b>for,</b> and issued rations. Theregimental ordnance officer had similar duties regarding arms and ammunition and managedthe movement of the unit ammunition train.In theory, logistical staff positions above the regiment were filled by a fully qualifiedofficer of the supply department concerned, However, experienced officers were inperpetual short supply, and many authorized positions were filled by officers andnoncommissioned officers from line units or left vacant, the duties performed by someone inaddition to their own. This problem existed in both armies, where inexperience andignorance of logistical principles and procedures generally reduced levels of support.|$|R
5|$|Hindman set to {{work and}} issued a series of harsh {{military}} edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and <b>requisitioning</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> {{the defense of the}} State. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear {{that they did not have}} an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|R
5000|$|Mobay {{was one of}} the {{suppliers}} of the dioxin-contaminated 2,4,5-T used to produce the Agent Orange sprayed in Operation Ranch Hand (1962-1972). Prior to the Gulf War, in April 1990, Mobay and Occidental Chemical Corporation refused to sell chemicals to the Department of Defense for military use (particularly, with thionyl chloride, a chemical needed for the production of sarin.) The government unleashed the dogs upon the disobedient company, considering filing suit against Mobay and Occidental for violating Title III of the Defense Production Act of 1950, which gives the government the power to <b>requisition</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> warfare. According to congresswoman Helen Delich Bentley (Rep., MD), when challenged, “they told the Army, ‘It is policy—so sue us.’” ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. F. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 In 'The Equation for Love Has Not Been Written', {{the speaker}} confronts the obvious but {{nonetheless}} startling truth of middle age: life is half over. Time {{to get a}} clipboard and go down the aisles making note of what you've got too much of, what's almost depleted, and what ran out a long time ago. Time to <b>requisition</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> the second half. The speaker seeks ways to assess {{the different types of}} love - and loss she has known. Because love is a force as inexplicable as poetry, a stable vantage point is difficult to find. The speaker's aesthetic distance shifts between first person and third person, and she borrows some new personas, too. Most of the speaker's explorations are expressed in free verse, but where appropriate, the poems are in form...|$|R
6000|$|The {{second edition}} of the Furioso did not extricate the author from very serious difficulties; {{for the next year}} he was {{compelled}} to apply to either to relieve him from his necessities, or permit him to look for some employment more profitable than the ducal service. The answer of this prince, who was now rich, but had always been penurious, and who never laid out a farthing, if he could help it, except in defence of his capital, was an appointment of Ariosto to the government of a district in a state of anarchy, called Garfagnana, which had nominally returned to his rule in consequence of the death of Leo, who had wrested it from him. It was a wild spot in the Apennines, on the borders of the Ferrarese and papal territories. Ariosto was there three years, and is said to have reduced it to order; but, according to his own account, he had very doubtful work of it. The place was overrun with banditti, including the troops commissioned to suppress them. It required a severer governor than he was inclined to be; and Alfonso did not attend to his <b>requisitions</b> <b>for</b> <b>supplies.</b> The candid and good-natured poet intimates that the duke might have given him the appointment rather for the governor's sake than the people's; and the cold, the loneliness and barrenness of the place, and, above all, his absence from the object of his affections, oppressed him. He did not write a verse for twelve months: he says he felt like a bird moulting[22]. The best thing got out of it was an anecdote for posterity. The poet was riding out one day with a few attendants--some say walking out in a fit of absence of mind--when he found himself {{in the midst of a}} band of outlaws, who, in a suspicious manner, barely suffered him to pass. A reader of Mrs. Radcliffe might suppose them a band of condottieri, under the command of some profligate desperado; and such perhaps they were. The governor had scarcely gone by, when the leader of the band, discovering who he was, came riding back with much earnestness, and making his obeisance to the poet, said, that he never should have allowed him to pass in that manner had he known him to be the Signor Ludovico Ariosto, author of the Orlando Furioso; that his own name was Filippo Pacchione (a celebrated personage of his order); and that his men and himself, so far from doing the Signor displeasure, would have the honour of conducting him back to his castle. [...] "And so they did," [...] says Baretti, [...] "entertaining him all along the way with the various excellences they had discerned in his poem, and bestowing upon it the most rapturous praises[23]." ...|$|R
50|$|In 324 BC, Alexander the Great had the Exiles Decree proclaimed in Greece. The {{effect of}} this decree was that {{citizens}} of Greek cities {{that had previously been}} exiled would be able to return to their cities of origin. Though this affected many of the cities of Greece, two regions where this had a major effect were Athens and the Aetolian League. This was a problem for the Aetolians as they had previously occupied the city of Oeniadae and evicted the original inhabitants of the city, settling it with their own citizens. Similarly, the Athenians had taken over and colonized the island of Samos. The outcome of the decree was that the Aetolians and Athenians would be required to surrender control of these occupied territories. The hostility to Macedonian suzerainty was compounded by a grain shortage in Greece, worsened by the fact the Alexander was <b>requisitioning</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> his campaigns in the East.|$|R

50|$|Rio Tinto's {{status as}} a mainly British-owned company, located in Spain and {{producing}} pyrites - an important material for military applications - created a complicated set of circumstances for the company's operation in the 1930s and 1940s. During the Spanish Civil War, the region in which Rio Tinto's mines were located came {{under the control of}} General Franco's Nationalists in 1936. However, Franco increasingly intervened in the company's operations, at times <b>requisitioning</b> pyrite <b>supplies</b> <b>for</b> use by Spain and its Axis allies Germany and Italy, forcing price controls on the company's production, restricting exports, and threatening nationalisation of the mines. Although company management (and indirectly, the British government) managed to counteract some of these efforts by Franco, much of the mine's pyrite production was channelled to Axis powers before and during World War II. Nonetheless, Franco's meddling caused the mine's production and profitability to fall precipitously during and after the war, leading the company to ultimately exit from its Spanish operations in 1954.|$|R
