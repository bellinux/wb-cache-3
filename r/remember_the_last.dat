Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
25|$|The Singing Revolution, {{the pursuit}} to restore Estonian {{independence}} and to cool regional tensions, {{found its way}} to football as well. On 18 July 1990, an exhibition match was held between Estonian and Latvian footballers at Kadriorg Stadium, to <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> official match between the two teams as independent nations 50 years previously. The principle of assembling the squad was controversial. 63 players made a public addressing (Päevaleht, 24 April 1990) calling out the football governing bodies to only select the descendants of Estonians, leaving out immigrants who came to Estonia after World War II.|$|E

Ryan, who {{was unable}} to <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> four {{years of his life}} because of amnesia, is able to rescue her, and in doing so recovers his memories of the love they once shared. Greenlee and Aidan are married, but when she uses a tainted bottle of perfume she admits on their honeymoon that she wants to have Ryan's baby still. Aidan leaves Greenlee, who helps Ryan rescue his daughter Emma from Annie, who has become increasingly unstable after she killed Richie. Ryan and Greenlee are both divorced and decide to reunite, and on December 30, 2008, he proposes. She initially turns him down, fearing Annie's increasingly psychotic threats against them, but ultimately accepts.|$|E

25|$|Australia squared the ODI {{series by}} winning a game where England missed their captain Michael Vaughan due to injury. Marcus Trescothick, the {{stand-in}} captain, won the toss {{and decided to}} chase at the Riverside Ground, thus giving his own side the task of batting under floodlights. Chris Tremlett who had made an impressive debut against Bangladesh, struggled early on with his line and length, and the Australian openers Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist punished him for runs. In his fifth over, however, Tremlett got a breakthrough, Gilchrist mistiming a cut and Geraint Jones taking the catch behind. However, Ricky Ponting didn't toss his wicket away early, leaving it to Hayden to hit the runs, {{and at the end}} of 15 overs the Australians were 73 for 1. Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison, the change bowlers, kept the pressure up on the batsmen, however, not letting too many runs away even though they bowled the occasional wide, and they could reap the rewards with two quick wickets, Ponting for 27 and Hayden for 39, and people began to <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ODI between the sides.|$|E

She recites the lines from her play that mirror her adventure to that point, but she still cannot <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> line. As Jareth begs her to obey him, promising he will love her, she remembers the line, [...] "You have no power over me!"

500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine {{called the}} episode a potential classic and a [...] "phenomenal follow up showing" [...] {{to the season}} premiere [...] "Sexual Healing", {{which he did not}} enjoy. Delgado said the script was intelligent and praised the theme of over-analyzing art. He also praised the vomiting jokes, and said he could not <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time he laughed so hard during a South Park episode. Entertainment Weekly television columnist Ken Tucker said it was better than the season premiere, which he also praised. Tucker particularly enjoyed the satire of pop culture criticism, and wrote, [...] "I'd compare the Scrotie episode to the work of Rabelais, Henry Miller, and Dennis Cooper, but then I'd be part of the boys' satire, wouldn't I?" ...|$|E

500|$|AIDS in the United States first struck {{gay men and}} IV {{drug users}} in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco due to unsafe sexual and drug-taking practices. Shilts' sources in the gay {{community}} tried to <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time everyone they knew was healthy, which was the United States Bicentennial celebration in 1976, when sailors came {{from all over the}} world to New York. Some of them carried sexually transmitted diseases and rare tropical fevers. A marked difference in these cities arose in two phases of consciousness in the gay community: [...] "Before" [...] in 1980, and [...] "After" [...] by 1985. [...] "Before", according to Shilts, was characterized by a care-free innocence, preceding the period when gay men were aware of a deadly infectious disease. [...] "After" [...] signified the realization that gay men knew most or all of their friends were infected with AIDS, and the syndrome became pervasive throughout the media.|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network {{had four}} editors review {{the first episode}} of the anime: Carl Kimlinger saw {{potential}} in its take on a typical anime premise, praising Tatsuya as the lead protagonist and its handling of mysteries surrounding the plot; Theron Martin, although hopeful because of its male lead and plot concept, expressed criticism towards the indistinguishable animation and constant exposition for the viewers; and Rebecca Silverman {{felt that it was}} bland and nothing special. The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't even <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time I saw something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." [...] Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons.|$|E
500|$|At Salon.com, Joyce Millman writes, [...] "there hasn't been a finer hour {{of drama}} on TV {{this year than}} ... 'The Body' ... You have {{to hand it to}} the writers; Joyce's demise came as a {{complete}} surprise. In that instant, Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if Buffy gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time I saw a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss." [...] Andrew Gilstrap at PopMatters declares it [...] "possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none... It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one." [...] Gilstrap went on to say the series did not again address death and grief of this magnitude until, in another shocking turn of events, Tara dies of a stray gunshot in the sixth season. Jerry McCormick in The San Diego Union-Tribune agrees, rating Joyce's death as having the same emotional impact as Tara's in [...] "Seeing Red", both of which he listed as the saddest in the series.|$|E

He stated that despite [...] "nothing remotely innovative about it... I can't <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time I heard a ballad of this type so completely fleshed-out and fully realized". Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! noted that songs on the album, such as Rocket", effectively display genre diversity, Beyoncé's vocal range and [...] "a penchant of musical experimentation". Although describing it as a [...] "pitch-perfect rehash" [...] of [...] "Untitled" [...] and noting that it succeeded in turning Beyoncé's [...] "sex life into topography", Fact Chris Kelly felt [...] "Rocket" [...] was unnecessary on the album. Philip Cosores of Paste stated that the song was [...] "dragging on {{a minute or two}} too long". Janice Llamoca from the website HipHopDX called it suitable for a bonus track on Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience (2013). Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph criticized the song as a [...] cut meant for The 20/20 Experience.

Erin Strecker Entertainment Weekly also called it the best video of the album, and highlighted Spears' look, the ending scene and the [...] "fun story". Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said it is [...] "probably the best video of the Femme Fatale era." [...] Tom Townshend of MSN stated that although the video was not appropriate for Spears' younger fans, [...] " [...] is actually rather compelling and feels more like a short film rather than a pop starlet's music video." [...] A writer for VH1 said that part of the reason the video works is the comic sensibility between Spears and Marrs Piliero, explaining that [...] " [...] point to one of Spears's greatest talents: giving the impression that although she takes her career extremely seriously, she nevertheless doesn't take it too seriously." [...] The critic summarized the review by saying that the video is [...] "entertaining [...] a bad-girl adventure story, and her role here is essentially that of a (wait for it) femme fatale." ...|$|E

[...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life."

2500|$|In 1998, the {{legislature}} passed the same legislation, the Defense of Marriage Act, and expected {{the governor to}} allow it to become law without his signature. Instead, he vetoed it a second time, saying that [...] "Our laws right now prohibit same-gender marriages, and I oppose this legislation because it is trying to make illegal something that is already illegal". Democrats who feared the impact of having the legislation on the November ballot helped override his veto. One Democratic leader in the House said: [...] "I'll vote to override.

2500|$|Unsurprisingly, lower order {{partnerships}} {{are usually}} {{much smaller than}} those for the early wickets, but are often the most tactically intense. A lot of spectator enjoyment derives either from the frequent combination of a last recognised batsman adopting extremely aggressive play (in an effort to score as many runs as possible before he runs out of batting partners - one reason why aggressive batsmen like Andrew Flintoff and Adam Gilchrist are often deliberately placed relatively low in the batting order) and the constant risk of a wicket, the alternative situation where no recognised batsmen remains and the tail-enders (relieved of their responsibility to bat carefully for anybody else) often unleash their rarely seen arsenal of attacking shots, or alternatively the extremely tense situation which sometimes emerges {{towards the end of}} a match when a batting side, facing defeat, can only salvage a draw and save the match by batting {{to the end of the}} final day, which becomes difficult once the worst batsmen are in, and their survival is always nerve-wracking [...] English fans fondly <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> wicket stand of Angus Fraser and Robert Croft, batting out the last few overs of the drawn Third Test against South Africa at Old Trafford in 1998, when the dismissal of either of them would have resulted in a loss.
