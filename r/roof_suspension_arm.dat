40|$|As {{magnetic}} computer disks {{are developed}} to ever-greater data storage densities, the accuracy required for head positioning is moving beyond the accuracy provided by present technology using single-stage voice-coil motors in hard disk drives. This thesis details work {{to develop a}} novel active <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> with 2 -dimensional actuation for use in advanced hard disk drives. The arm developed is capable of high-bandwidth data tracking as well as precision head flying height control motion. High-bandwidth data tracking is facilitated {{by the use of}} piezoelectric stack actuator, positioned closer to the head. The <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> is also capable of motion in the orthogonal axis. This motion represents active flying height control to maintain the correct altitude during drive operation. To characterise the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm's</b> structural dynamics, a high-resolution measurement system based on the optical beam deflection technique has been developed. This has enabled the accurate measurement of minute end-deflections of the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> in 2 -dimensions, to sub-nanometre resolution above noise. The design process of the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> has led into the development of novel piezoelectric-actuated arms. In the work involving lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thick films as actuators, work in this thesis shows that reinforcing the films with fibre improves the overall actuation characteristics of the thick films. This discovery benefits applications such as structural health monitoring. The final <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> design has been adopted because it is simple in design, easier to integrate within current hard disk drive environment and easier to fabricate in mass. Closed-loop control algorithms based on proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller techniques have been developed and implemented to demonstrate high bandwidths that have been achieved. The <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> developed presents an important solution in head-positioning technology in that it offers much higher bandwidths for data tracking and flying height control; both very essential in achieving even higher data storage densities on magnetic disks at much reduced head flying heights, compared to those in existing hard disk drives...|$|R

40|$|Hard {{disk drives}} {{function}} perfectly satisfactorily {{when used in}} a stable environment, but in certain applications they are subjected to shock and vibration. During the work reported in this thesis {{it has been found}} that when typical hard disk drives are subjected lo vibration, data transfer failure is found to be significant at frequencies between 440 Hz and 700 Hz, at an extreme, failing at only Ig of sinusoidal vibration. These failures can largely be attributed to two key components: the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> and the hard disk. At non-critical frequencies of vibration the typical hard disk drive can reliably transfer data whilst subjected to as much as 45 g. When transferring data to the drive controller, the drive's operations are controlled and monitored using BIOS commands. Examining the embedded error signals proved that the drive predominantly failed due lo tracking errors. Novel piezo-electric sensors have been developed to measure unobtrusively <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> and disk motion, the results from which show the disk to be the most significant failure mechanism, with its First mode of resonance at around 440 Hz. The <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> movement {{has been found to be}} greatest at IkHz. Extensive modelling of the flexure of the disk, clamped and unclamped, has been undertaken using finite element analysis. The theoretical modelling strongly reinforces the empirical results presented in this thesis. If <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> movement is not directly coupled with disk movement then a flying height variation is created. This, together with tracking variations, leads to data transfer corruption. This has been found to occur at IkHz and 2 kHz. An optical system has been developed and characterised for a novel and inexpensive flying height measurement system using compact disc player technology...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} suspension system and its lower arm. These analyses were specifically applied on lower <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> to determine its vibration and stress behaviour during its operation. The suspension system {{is one of the}} most important components of vehicle, which directly affects the safety, performance, noise level and style of it. The main objectives are to have less stress on lower <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> system as well as to reduce imposed load by optimization. The optimization of imposed load on lower <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> system is directly related to imposed force on the vehicle created by the road. This load has a direct effect on the value of imposed force on lower arm, where the lower arm force will be minimized by reducing the applied load. Hence, genetic algorithms for optimization and MATLAB optimization toolbar are used, as well as, specific M-file codes have been developed into MATLAB for optimization. By determining optimized design values of suspension system for reducing road force, it is possible to survey vibration condition of lower arm according to frequency respond of suspension system and its natural frequency. Therefore, frequency response of its acceleration has been determined according to the whole mass of suspension system. Using FFT technique and making transfer function for frequency response of suspension system, will present responded frequency of suspension system which is using for vibration analysis. For stress analysis, load condition of lower <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> system must be determined in advance. Hence, a typical model of McPherson suspension system has been selected for analysis. According to the road profile considered for analysis and the velocity of vehicle, it is possible to obtain both velocity and acceleration equations for whole components of McPherson suspension system.
