5|$|Tisdale {{testified to}} passing the order by {{telephone}} to Blue River and to Red Pass Junction, {{and that it}} was correctly read back to him by both operators. He also testified to a brief gap in communications several days before the crash, saying that in the <b>rough</b> <b>country</b> through which the railway line passed it was not uncommon for objects falling against the communication line to cause brief outages. Parsons also testified that Atherton had correctly repeated back the order.|$|E
5|$|At 10:05, {{the leading}} {{troops of the}} 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade; not to be {{confused}} with the 7th Mounted Brigade near Ras Ghannam to the south of Beersheba), were seen approaching Tel el Sakaty. By 11:17, they reported their advance was increasingly difficult due to hostile units defending the high ground south of Sakaty. An Ottoman convoy of 10 wagons was seen leaving Beersheba on the road to Jerusalem, and the regiment was ordered to cut the road before the convoy escaped. Through heavy shell and shrapnel bombardment and point-blank machine-gun fire, they galloped to a position just south of the road. While an artillery battery got into position to support the light-horse regiment's attack on Tel el Sakaty, at 11:40 the 5th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was ordered to engage the Ottoman left flank. As they crossed the Wadi Khalil and the road to Jerusalem, the 5th Light Horse Regiment was also heavily shelled by artillery and fired on by machine guns from the high ground north and northwest overlooking the area. Five minutes later, the 7th Light Horse Regiment cut the road and captured the convoy (47 prisoners, eight horses and eight wagons loaded with forage). However, the regiment was pinned down just beyond, in a small wadi in the <b>rough</b> <b>country</b> north of Wadi Khalil by the gun battery and machine guns located on Tel el Sakaty (above the road). With the arrival of the 5th Light Horse Regiment, by 13:30 the two regiments (supported by artillery) were advancing to attack the high ground northeast of Sakaty. At 14:45, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade reported that three Ottoman guns appeared to have been put out of action by EEF artillery fire. While they continued to hold the road to Jerusalem, the 5th and 7th Light Horse Regiments found cover in the Wadi Aiyan (although targeted from the high ground north of Sakaty by five Ottoman machine guns) where they remained until evening. The 1,100-strong Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division defended this hilly area north of Beersheba.|$|E

South of White Pike is a {{profound}} drop to an area of <b>rough</b> <b>country</b> before the shapely pyramid of Caw rises skyward.|$|E
60|$|When {{a mile or}} more of this up-and-down travel {{had been}} traversed Fay halted and {{appeared}} to be at fault. The plateau was losing its rounded, smooth, wavy characteristics, and to the west grew bolder, more rugged, more cut up into low crags and buttes. After a long, sweeping glance Fay headed straight for this <b>rougher</b> <b>country.</b> Thereafter from time to time she repeated this action.|$|R
50|$|The next day, a {{division}} under Major General Sir Walter Gilbert {{took up the}} pursuit. The remnants of Sher Singh's forces retreated across the Jhelum and into progressively <b>rougher</b> <b>country</b> for eleven days, but Sher Singh was finally forced to agree to British terms for surrender. His army, reduced to 20,000 men (mainly irregular cavalry) and 10 guns, handed over its arms at a two-day ceremony on 12 March and disbanded.|$|R
50|$|The {{pastoral}} lease and {{station of}} Melangata {{is smaller than}} its neighbours Jingemara Station (to the west), Dalgaranga Station (to the east), and Meka Station to the north, and has <b>rougher</b> <b>country</b> compared to the adjacent stations. Originally a sheep station {{it has been more}} recently a goat export receival station. The station is on the older Yalgoo to Cue track that was a route much more direct than rail connection between Yalgoo and Cue that travels to Mount Magnet.|$|R
25|$|Warren {{rejected}} Meade's {{suggestion to}} consider alternate routes {{because it would}} take too long to move his corps, even considering the existing delays. Ayres had received Warren's order {{to move to the}} Boydton Plank Road at about 10:00p.m. This required him to move over about two miles of <b>rough</b> <b>country</b> and cross a branch Gravelly Run. Warren allowed Crawford's and Griffin's men to rest where they were until he learned that Ayres's division had made contact with Sheridan's cavalry.|$|E
25|$|Custer's defenders, however, {{including}} historian Charles K. Hofling, have {{asserted that}} Gatling guns {{would have been}} slow and cumbersome as the troops crossed the <b>rough</b> <b>country</b> between the Yellowstone and the Little Bighorn. Custer rated speed in gaining the battlefield as essential and more important. Other Custer supporters have claimed that splitting the forces was a standard tactic, so as to demoralize the enemy {{with the appearance of}} the cavalry in different places all at once, especially when a contingent threatened the line of retreat.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} regions are settled with prosperous and {{contented}} people. However, this naturally {{is lacking in}} scope for plot. Numerous pockets throughout the land of Oz are {{cut off from the}} main culture, for geographic or cultural reasons. Many have never heard of Ozma, making it impossible for them to acknowledge her as their rightful queen. These regions are concentrated {{around the edges of the}} country, and constitute the main settings for books that are set entirely within Oz. The Lost Princess of Oz, for instance is set entirely in <b>rough</b> <b>country</b> in Winkie Country, between two settled areas.

500|$|The third area of {{operations}} was around the village of Utitsa. The village was {{at the southern end}} of the Russian positions and lay along the old Smolensk road. [...] It was rightly perceived as a potential weak point in the defense as a march along the road could turn the entire position at [...] Borodino. Despite such concerns the area was a tangle of <b>rough</b> <b>country</b> thickly covered in heavy brush well suited for deploying light infantry. The forest was dense, the ground marshy and Russian Jaeger were deployed there in some numbers. Russian General Nikolay Tuchkov had some 23,000 troops but half were untrained Opolchenye (militia) armed only with pikes and axes and not ready for deployment.|$|E

[...] "B" [...] Squadron, 10th Light Horse Regiment attacked and captured the rearguard. One troop had dismounted while the remaining troops {{in single file}} due to the <b>rough</b> <b>country,</b> moved round the flank mounted. They attacked and captured the position, 12 German, 41 Ottoman prisoners, one field gun, one machine gun, one motor lorry and an ammunition dump.
