25|$|On July 18, 1907, de Forest {{made the}} first {{ship-to-shore}} transmissions by <b>radiotelephone</b> — race reports for the Annual Inter-Lakes Yachting Association (I-LYA) Regatta held on Lake Erie — which were sent from the steam yacht Thelma to his assistant, Frank E. Butler, located in the Fox's Dock Pavilion on South Bass Island. De Forest also interested the U.S. Navy in his <b>radiotelephone,</b> which placed a rush order to have 26 arc sets installed for its Great White Fleet around-the-world voyage that began in late 1907. However, {{at the conclusion of}} the circumnavigation the sets were declared to be too unreliable to meet the Navy's needs and removed.|$|E
25|$|The company set up {{a network}} of <b>radiotelephone</b> {{stations}} along the Atlantic coast and the Great Lakes, for coastal ship navigation. However, the installations proved unprofitable, and by 1911 the parent company and its subsidiaries were {{on the brink of}} bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|SKOT R-4 - Unarmed {{command vehicle}} used by {{division}} and army command. It {{is equipped with}} 4 radios, 3 radio receivers and 3 <b>radiotelephones.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mobile radio, in 1983 roughly 30% of {{the billing}} with {{products}} like police radio systems and <b>radiotelephones</b> for taxis. By the mid 1980s this business goes stagnant.|$|R
50|$|<b>Radiotelephones</b> may {{operate at}} any {{frequency}} {{where they are}} licensed to do so, though typically they {{are used in the}} various bands between 60 and 900 MHz. They may use simple modulation schemes such as AM or FM, or more complex techniques such as digital coding, spread spectrum, and so on. Licensing terms for a given band will usually specify the type of modulation to be used. For example, airband <b>radiotelephones</b> used for air to ground communication between pilots and controllers operates in the VHF band from 118.0 to 136.975 MHz, using amplitude modulation.|$|R
25|$|In 1911 Matthews said he {{had invented}} an Aerophone device, a <b>radiotelephone,</b> and {{transmitted}} messages between a ground station and an aeroplane {{from a distance of}} two miles. His experiments attracted government attention and on 4 July 1912 he visited Buckingham Palace. However, when the British Admiralty requested a demonstration of the Aerophone, Matthews demanded that no experts be present at the scene. When four of the observers dismantled part of the apparatus before the demonstration began and took notes, Matthews cancelled the demonstration and drove observers away.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, Couch visited Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, {{and radio}} station KDKA, {{a pioneer of}} modern broadcasting. On the trip he also met Lee de Forest, {{inventor}} of the wireless <b>radiotelephone</b> and the vacuum tube. Couch bought equipment and decided {{to set up a}} radio station in his home state, “to advertise Arkansas and, incidentally, AP He saw great potential benefits for his company and Arkansas. AP had already been planning to create a radio system so its generating plants around the state would have easy communication. Couch demonstrated the radio in November 1921 to the Pine Bluff Rotary Club.|$|E
500|$|... 1959 {{brought a}} new option, the Rush-Matic {{automatic}} transmission, which featured two modes: Rush (fully automatic) and Road (manual gear selection). The same year, assembly of the Vedette started at Simca do Brasil. Also during 1959, a new top-of-the-line model joined the Vedette range, the Présidence, featuring a luxurious interior, a <b>radiotelephone</b> (a European first) and a continental kit. French coachbuilder Chapron built two 2-door Présidence convertibles for a governor {{of one of the}} French colonies. Chapron had another order the next year, to build two four-door convertibles for the French President Charles de Gaulle. The Beaulieu was dropped in autumn 1960, but the other models remained unchanged until the 1961 model year, when they received new seats, new chrome decor, and the engine was fitted with a new anti-vibration crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>radiotelephones</b> and two-way radio is becoming blurred {{as the two}} technologies merge. The backbone or infrastructure supporting the system defines which category or taxonomy applies. A parallel to this concept is the convergence of computing and telephones.|$|R
50|$|<b>Radiotelephones</b> are {{full-duplex}} (simultaneous {{talk and}} listen), circuit switched, and primarily communicate with telephones {{connected to the}} public switched telephone network. The connection sets up based on the user dialing. The connection is taken down when the end button is pressed. They run on telephony-based infrastructure such as AMPS or GSM.|$|R
50|$|The modulus, N, is {{generally}} restricted to integer values, as the comparator will match when the waveform is in phase. Typically, the possible frequency multiples {{will be the}} channels for which the radio equipment is designed for, so fr will usually be equal to the channel spacing. For example, on narrow-band <b>radiotelephones,</b> a channel spacing of 12.5 kHz is typical.|$|R
2500|$|The Department of Commerce {{created a}} new {{top-level}} license in 1923, the Amateur Extra First Grade, that conveyed extra operating privileges. It required a more difficult written examination and a code test at twenty words per minute. In 1929, a special license endorsement for [...] "unlimited <b>radiotelephone</b> privileges" [...] became available in return for passing an examination on <b>radiotelephone</b> subjects. This allowed amateurs to upgrade and use reserved <b>radiotelephone</b> bands without having to pass a difficult code examination.|$|E
2500|$|... 1933 – <b>Radiotelephone</b> system inaugurated {{between the}} UK and India.|$|E
2500|$|Class B licensees did {{not have}} the right to operate on the {{reserved}} <b>radiotelephone</b> bands. [...] Amateur First Class licensees were grandfathered into this class.|$|E
50|$|IMO and ITU both {{require that}} the DSC-equipped MF/HF and VHF radios be {{externally}} connected to a satellite navigation receiver (GPS). That connection will ensure accurate location information is sent to a rescue coordination center if a distress alert is transmitted. The FCC requires that all new VHF and MF/HF maritime <b>radiotelephones</b> type accepted after June 1999 {{have at least a}} basic DSC capability.|$|R
50|$|The {{research}} {{that took place}} during the war was done in secret. After the war, it was revealed that University staff had tested radio communication with submarines, in addition to working with the Army Signal Corps to develop <b>radiotelephones</b> for aviation use. The University also provided radio technology training classes for Signal Corps recruits. Additionally, weather information was transmitted to ships operating on the Great Lakes.|$|R
25|$|During World War I. Chief Signal Officer George Owen Squier {{worked closely}} with private {{industry}} to perfect radio tubes while creating a major signal laboratory at Camp Alfred Vail (Fort Monmouth). Early <b>radiotelephones</b> developed by the Signal Corps were introduced into the European theater in 1918. While the new American voice radios were superior to the radiotelegraph sets, telephone and telegraph remained the major technology of World War I.|$|R
2500|$|In 1933, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) reorganized amateur {{operator}} licenses into Classes A, B [...] and C. [...] Class A conveyed all amateur operating privileges, including certain reserved <b>radiotelephone</b> bands. [...] Amateur Extra First Grade licensees and Amateur First Class licensees with [...] "unlimited radiotelephone" [...] endorsements were grandfathered {{into this}} class.|$|E
2500|$|... {{overdrive}} effects {{such as the}} use of a fuzz box can be used {{to produce}} distorted sounds, such as for imitating robotic voices or to simulate distorted <b>radiotelephone</b> traffic (e.g., the radio chatter between starfighter pilots in the science fiction film Star Wars). [...] The most basic overdrive effect involves clipping the signal when its absolute value exceeds a certain threshold.|$|E
2500|$|These {{effects were}} used, in {{conjunction}} with other filtering techniques, during World War II as a simple method for speech encryption. <b>Radiotelephone</b> conversations between the US and Britain were intercepted and [...] "decrypted" [...] by the Germans; they included some early conversations between Franklin D. Roosevelt and Churchill. [...] In fact, the signals could be understood directly by trained operators. [...] Largely to allow secure communications between Roosevelt and Churchill, the SIGSALY system of digital encryption was devised.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1921, the C. D. Tuska Company {{was issued}} a license for a Limited Commercial radio station with the call letters WQB, which was located at Tuska's home at 136 Oakland Terrace. The station {{was used to}} {{investigate}} developing <b>radiotelephones</b> for two-way mobile communication, and an August 1921 report noted the successful test of [...] "a full-fledged wireless outfit {{in the rear of}} Chief John C. Moran's Marmon touring car".|$|R
50|$|While {{clipping}} limiters {{are often}} used {{as a form of}} last-ditch protection against overmodulation, a properly designed vogad circuit actively controls the amount of gain to optimise the modulation depth in real time. As well as preventing overmodulation, it boosts the level of quiet signals so that undermodulation is also avoided. Undermodulation can lead to poor signal penetration in noisy conditions, consequently vogad is particularly important for voice applications such as <b>radiotelephones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The US Coast Guard {{was one of}} {{the more}} {{aggressive}} proponents of the DGPS system, experimenting with the system on an ever-wider basis through the late 1980s and early 1990s. These signals are broadcast on marine longwave frequencies, which could be received on existing <b>radiotelephones</b> and fed into suitably equipped GPS receivers. Almost all major GPS vendors offered units with DGPS inputs, not only for the USCG signals, but also aviation units on either VHF or commercial AM radio bands.|$|R
2500|$|The first U.S. {{patent for}} SSB {{modulation}} {{was applied for}} on December 1, 1915 by John Renshaw Carson. The U.S. Navy experimented with SSB over its radio circuits before World War I. SSB first entered commercial service on January 7, 1927 on the longwave transatlantic public <b>radiotelephone</b> circuit between New York and London. [...] The high power SSB transmitters were located at Rocky Point, New York and Rugby, England. [...] The receivers were in very quiet locations in Houlton, Maine and Cupar Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|AM was the {{earliest}} modulation method used to transmit voice by radio. It was {{developed during the}} first two decades of the 20th century beginning with Landell de Moura and Reginald Fessenden's <b>radiotelephone</b> experiments in 1900. [...] It remains in use today in many forms of communication; for example it is used in portable two-way radios, VHF aircraft radio, Citizen's Band Radio, and in computer modems (in the form of QAM). [...] "AM" [...] is often used to refer to mediumwave AM radio broadcasting.|$|E
2500|$|The FCC regulates {{broadcast}} stations, repeater stations as well {{as commercial}} broadcasting operators who operate and repair certain <b>radiotelephone,</b> television and radio stations. Broadcast licenses are to be renewed if the station meets the [...] "public interest, convenience, or necessity". [...] The FCC's enforcement powers include fines and broadcast license revocation (see FCC MB Docket 04-232). Burden of proof {{would be on the}} complainant in a petition to deny. [...] Fewer than 1% of station renewals are not immediately granted, and {{only a small fraction of}} those are ultimately denied.|$|E
50|$|While {{the concept}} of using the {{airplane}} as an offensive weapon was generally discounted before World War I, {{the idea of using}} it for photography was one that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces in Europe had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs, attached to their reconnaissance departments. <b>Radiotelephones</b> were also being explored on airplanes, notably the SCR-68, as communication between pilots and ground commander grew more and more important.|$|R
50|$|Solar {{cells have}} many applications. They {{have long been}} used in {{situations}} where electrical power from the grid is unavailable, such as in remote area power systems, Earth-orbiting satellites and space probes, handheld calculators, wrist watches, remote <b>radiotelephones</b> and water pumping applications. More recently, they are starting {{to be used in}} assemblies of solar modules (photovoltaic arrays) connected to the electricity grid through an inverter, that is not to act as a sole supply but as an additional electricity source.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} method {{of working for}} <b>radiotelephones</b> is half-duplex, operation, which allows one person to talk {{and the other to}} listen alternately. If a single channel is used, both ends take turns to {{transmit}} on it. An eavesdropper would hear both sides of the conversation. Dual-frequency working splits the communication into two separate channels, but only one is used to transmit at a time. The end users have the same experience as single frequency simplex but an eavesdropper with one receiver would only hear one side of the conversation.|$|R
2500|$|... 16 {{months after}} his escape from La Catedral, Pablo Escobar died in a shootout on 2 December 1993, amid another of Escobar's {{attempts}} to elude the Search Bloc. A Colombian electronic surveillance team, led by Brigadier Hugo Martínez, used radio trilateration technology to track his <b>radiotelephone</b> transmissions and found him hiding in Los Olivos, a middle-class barrio in Medellín. With authorities closing in, a firefight with Escobar and his bodyguard, Alvaro de Jesús Agudelo (a.k.a. [...] "El Limón"), ensued. The two fugitives attempted to escape by running across the roofs of adjoining houses to reach a back street, but both were {{shot and killed by}} Colombian National Police. Escobar suffered gunshots to the leg and torso, and a fatal gunshot through the ear.|$|E
2500|$|During World War One the U.S. {{government}} had prohibited {{the operation of}} radio transmitters by civilians, and the ban wasn't lifted until October 1, 1919. Shortly thereafter, Doubleday-Hill's radio department manager, Francis C. Potts, announced {{that the company was}} in the process of installing a De Forest <b>radiotelephone</b> transmitter, to be used for communication with a second station to be located at the company's branch store in Washington, D.C. A month later, in late November, Potts reported that the company had been unable to obtain the commercial license needed to operate the business plan, however, [...] "a special amateur license has been applied for, to cover the wireless telephone demonstration station which the company has ordered installed and which is expected to be opened in the near future".|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, {{the regular}} Army also {{initiated}} {{a form of}} CAP – US Army Civil Action Patrol Team – similar to the Marine CAP on a smaller scale. However, they didn't live in the villages as the Marines did. Typically they were a 3-man team including an officer, enlisted instructor and <b>radiotelephone</b> operator. The HQ was in a nominally secure area, and they ventured out to arranged meeting places to provide instructional support in weapons maintenance, etc. One such element was an adjunct of the 1st/502d Inf, 101st Airborne Division and was sited at Eagle Beach in June 1970. (The foregoing per former Army CAPT member, [...] "M-60" [...] Mike Kelley, in an E-mail to F. J. Taylor, USMC (Ret.), formerly of CAP Oscar-2. Unfortunately, the original E is no longer extant.) ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{frequency}} synthesizer is an electronic circuit that generates {{a range of}} frequencies from a single reference frequency. Frequency synthesizers are used in many modern devices such as radio receivers, televisions, mobile telephones, <b>radiotelephones,</b> walkie-talkies, CB radios, cable television converter boxes [...] satellite receivers, and GPS systems. A {{frequency synthesizer}} may use the techniques of frequency multiplication, frequency division, direct digital synthesis, frequency mixing, and phase-locked loops to generate its frequencies. The stability and accuracy of the frequency synthesizer's output {{are related to the}} stability and accuracy of its reference frequency input. Consequently, synthesizers use stable and accurate reference frequencies, such as those provided by crystal oscillators.|$|R
25|$|A crystal {{detector}} includes a crystal, a special thin wire that contacts the crystal, and the stand that holds those components in place. The most common crystal used {{is a small}} piece of galena; pyrite was also often used, as it was a more easily adjusted and stable mineral, and quite sufficient for urban signal strengths. Several other minerals also performed well as detectors. Another benefit of crystals was that they could demodulate amplitude modulated signals. This device brought <b>radiotelephones</b> and voice broadcast to a public audience. Crystal sets represented an inexpensive and technologically simple method of receiving these signals {{at a time when the}} embryonic radio broadcasting industry was beginning to grow.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} signal {{did not permit}} the departure, the freight train driven by Roschek left Otloczyn at {{approximately}} 4:20, heading towards Torun. Later investigation did not explain why the engineer decided to proceed without permission to do so. Roschek’s train was on the wrong track, the same track on which the passenger train to Lodz Kaliska was speeding. It has been established that at Torun rail center, nobody was expecting the 11599 to be moving. During the following minutes, rail service personnel at both Otłoczyn and Brzoza Torunska {{found out about the}} freight train going wrong way, but it was already too late. Both trains were pulled by Diesel engines, neither of which was equipped with <b>radiotelephones.</b>|$|R
