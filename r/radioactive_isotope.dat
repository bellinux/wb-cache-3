5|$|Commercially, the <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotope</b> bismuth-213 can be {{produced}} by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia.

5|$|Each <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotope</b> has a {{characteristic}} decay time period—the half-life—that {{is determined by}} the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life.

Cigarette smoke contains at least 73 known carcinogens, including benzopyrene, NNK, 1,3-butadiene and a <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotope</b> of polonium, polonium-210. Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking (70% for women). Smoking accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases.|$|E

40|$|<b>Radioactive</b> <b>isotopes</b> are now {{available}} from Chalk River for use by Canadian biologists. Experience {{has shown that the}} handling of <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotopes</b> may involve health hazards unless adequate precautions are taken. The nature of these hazards and the type of precautions which must be taken when working with <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotopes</b> are considered. Successful work with <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotopes</b> other than in the smallest tracer amounts requires the use of laboratories and equipment especially designed for the purpose and this is dealt with briefly. The operation of a radioactive laboratory requires certain auxiliary equipment and services, such as health instruments, film monitoring, special laboratory clothing, special cleanable surfaces and disposal of radioactive waste materials. These topics are discussed briefly. Handling of <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotopes</b> involves certain special precautions and a few of these, such as protection of hands, cleaning of glassware, handling of solutions, etc. are reviewed. In addition to protecting all personnel in a laboratory from harmful amounts of radiation, it is necessary to keep the laboratory and the building in which it is housed as free as possible from radioactive substances and this important fact has been stressed...|$|R

5|$|Gallium-67 salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate {{are used}} as {{radiopharmaceutical}} agents in the nuclear medicine imaging known as gallium scan. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotope</b> 67Ga is used, and the compound or salt of gallium is unimportant. The body handles Ga3+ in many ways {{as though it were}} Fe3+, and the ion is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.|$|E
5|$|The Hideous Sun Demon (sometimes {{billed as}} The Sun Demon, {{or in the}} UK as Blood on His Lips) is a 1958 science-fiction horror film written, {{directed}} and produced by Robert Clarke, who also starred in the film. It also stars Patricia Manning, Nan Peterson, Patrick Whyte and Fred La Porta. The film focuses on a scientist (portrayed by Clarke) who is exposed to a <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotope</b> and soon finds out that it comes with horrifying consequences.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{widespread}} application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotope</b> thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, {{was the main}} substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator {{which is similar to}} the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.|$|E

5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotope</b> of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used to create the painting.|$|E
5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from tidal heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's internal heating, which is derived primarily from <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotope</b> decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational pull on the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes frictional heating in its interior. Without this tidal heating, Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E
5|$|Franklin was {{a pioneer}} in the field of archaeometry, which applies modern {{materials}} analysis to archaeology. She worked for example, on the dating of prehistoric bronze, copper and ceramic artifacts. In the early 1960s Franklin was {{one of a number of}} scientists who participated in the Baby Tooth Survey, a project founded by Eric and Louise Reiss along with other scientists such as Barry Commoner, which investigated levels of strontium-90—a <b>radioactive</b> <b>isotope</b> in fallout from nuclear weapons testing—in children's teeth. This research contributed to the cessation of atmospheric weapons testing. Franklin published more than a hundred scientific papers and contributions to books on the structure and properties of metals and alloys as well as on the history and social effects of technology.|$|E
