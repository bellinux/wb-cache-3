25|$|In 1822 Vesey was {{alleged to}} be the {{ringleader}} of a planned slave revolt.

In 1891, the Democratic-controlled Arkansas General Assembly passed a new election law making voting more complicated and eliminating numerous illiterate voters; together with a poll tax amendment passed in 1892, these measures disenfranchised most blacks {{in the state and}} many poor whites. The Republican Party offered Jones the positions of Recorder of Deeds in the District of Columbia and Ambassador to the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Haiti,</b> but he declined both appointments to concentrate on local affairs.|$|E
25|$|France came to own Hispaniola in 1795 when by the Peace of Basel Spain ceded Santo Domingo as a {{consequence}} of the French Revolutionary Wars. The recently freed Africans led by Toussaint Louverture in 1801, took over Santo Domingo in the east, thus gaining control of the entire island. In 1802 an army sent by Napoleon captured Toussaint Louverture and sent him to France as prisoner. Toussaint Louverture’s lieutenants and the spread of yellow fever succeeded in driving the French again from Saint-Domingue, which in 1804 the rebels made independent as the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Haiti.</b> Eastwards, France continued to rule Spanish Santo Domingo.|$|E
25|$|After the Dessalines coup d'état, the {{two main}} conspirators divided the country in two rival regimes. Christophe created the authoritarian State of Haiti in the north, and the Gens de couleur Pétion helped {{establish}} the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Haiti</b> in the south. Christophe attempted to maintain a strict system of labor and agricultural production akin to the former plantations. Although, strictly speaking, he did not establish slavery, he imposed a semi-feudal system, fumage, in which every able man was required to work in plantations (similar to Latifundios) to produce goods for the fledging country. His method, though undoubtedly oppressive, produced the most revenues of the two governments.|$|E
25|$|The name Haïti {{was adopted}} by Haitian revolutionary Jean-Jacques Dessalines in 1804, as the {{official}} name of independent Saint-Domingue, {{as a tribute to}} the Amerindian predecessors.

From 1868 to 1921, the Archives was abandoned. This included the Celebration of the first Centennial of Independence in 1904. In 1922, the archives repository was moved to a premise which was initially designed to shelter a public market. 19 years passed before a Decree Law issued on October 20, 1941, changed the [...] "Service in charge of the State's Archives" [...] into the [...] "National Archives." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1801, L'Ouverture {{arrived in}} Santo Domingo, proclaiming the {{abolition}} of slavery on behalf of the French Republic. Shortly afterwards, Napoleon dispatched an army which subdued the whole island and ruled it for a few months. Mulattos and blacks again rose up against these French in October 1802 and finally defeated them in November 1803. On 1 January 1804 the victors declared Saint-Domingue to be the independent <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Haiti.</b> Even after their defeat by the Haitians, a small French garrison remained in Santo Domingo. Slavery was reestablished and many of the émigré Spanish colonists returned. In 1805, after crowning himself Emperor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines invaded, reaching Santo Domingo before retreating {{in the face of a}} French naval squadron. In their retreat through the Cibao, the Haitians sacked the towns of Santiago and Moca, slaughtering most of their residents and helping to lay the foundation for two centuries of animosity between the two countries.|$|E
25|$|In 1846, the era {{of peace}} was coming to a close. The United States had annexed the Republic of Texas, and the islands of the Caribbean seemed to be likely targets for further expansion. The Republic of Santo Domingo (the present-day Dominican Republic) had broken off from the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Haiti</b> in 1844, and the United States State Department needed to {{determine}} the new nation's social, political, and economic stability. The suitability of the Bay of Samana for U.S. Navy operations was also of interest. To find out, Secretary of State James Buchanan asked Porter to undertake a private investigation. He accepted the assignment, and on March 15, 1846, he left home. He arrived in Santo Domingo after some unexpected delays and spent two weeks mapping the coastline. On May 19, he began a trek through the interior that left him without communication for a month. On June 19, he emerged from the jungle, bitten by insects, but with the information that the State Department wanted. He then discovered {{that while he was}} away the United States had gone to war with Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Sumner, {{opposed to}} American imperialism in the Caribbean and fearful that {{annexation}} {{would lead to}} the conquest of the neighboring black <b>republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Haiti,</b> became convinced that corruption lay behind the treaty, and that men close to the president shared in the corruption. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sumner initially withheld his opinion on the treaty on January 18, 1870. Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State, Bancroft Davis, that U.S. Naval ships were being used to protect Báez. Sumner's committee voted against annexation and at Sumner's suggestion and quite possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or the president from embarrassment, the Senate held its debate of the treaty behind closed doors in executive session. Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14, 1870, and May 31, 1870. In closed session, Sumner spoke out against the treaty; warning that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals, noting the chronic rebellion that took place on the island, and the risk that the independence of Haiti, recognized by the United States in 1862, would be lost. Sumner stated that Grant's use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of International law and unconstitutional. Finally, on June 30, 1870 the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the required 2/3 majority for treaty passage.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the {{doctrine}} of Manifest Destiny had become increasingly sectionalized as the decade progressed. While there were still Northerners who believed the United States should dominate the continent, most were opposed to Cuba's annexation, particularly as a slave state. Southern-backed filibusters, including Narciso López, had failed repeatedly since 1849 to 1851 to overthrow the colonial government despite considerable support among the Cuban people for independence, {{and a series of}} reforms on the island made Southerners apprehensive that slavery would be abolished. They believed that Cuba would be [...] "Africanized," [...] as {{the majority of the population}} were slaves, and they had seen the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Haiti</b> established by former slaves. The notion of a pro-slavery invasion by the U.S. was rejected in light of the controversy over the Kansas–Nebraska Act. During internal discussions, supporters of gaining Cuba decided that a purchase or intervention in the name of national security was the most acceptable method of acquisition.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{island of}} Hispaniola was first claimed on 5 December 1492, by Christopher Columbus, for Queen Isabella, {{and the first}} Viceroy of the Americas was {{established}} along {{with a number of}} colonies throughout the Island. With the later discovery of Mexico and Peru many of the early settlers left for the main land, but some twelve cities and a hundred thousand souls remained, mainly in the Eastern part of the Island. Through the Treaty of Riswick in 1697, King Louis XIV received the western third of the Island [...] from Spain as retribution and formalized the first French pirate settlement in existence since the mid-1600s, with the colony administered by a governor-general representing the French crown, an arrangement that stood until the French Revolution toppled the monarchy of France on 21 September 1792. Though the French government retained control over the region of Saint-Domingue, on 22 September 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who had served as Governor-General of Saint-Domingue since 30 November 1803, declared himself as head of an independent Empire of Haiti, with his coronation as Emperor Jacques I taking place on 6 October that year. After his assassination on 17 October 1806, the country was split in half, the northern portion eventually becoming the Kingdom of Haiti on 28 March 1811, with Henri Christophe installed as King Henri I. When King Henri committed suicide on 8 October 1820, and his son, Jacques-Victor Henry, Prince Royal of Haiti, was murdered by revolutionaries ten days later, the kingdom was merged into the southern <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Haiti,</b> of which Faustin-Élie Soulouque was elected president on 2 March 1847. Two years later, on 26 August 1849, the Haitian national assembly declared the president as Emperor Faustin I, thereby re-establishing the Empire of Haiti. But this monarchical reincarnation was to be short lived as well, as a revolution broke out in the kingdom in 1858, resulting in Faustin abdicating the throne on 18 January 1859.|$|E
