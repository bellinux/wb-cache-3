40|$|An {{increasing}} number of molecular studies are indicating that, {{in a wide variety}} of species, genes directly related to fertilization evolve at extraordinarily high rates. We try to gain insight into the dynamics of this rapid evolution and its underlying mechanisms by means of a simple theoretical model. In the model, sexual selection and sympatric speciation act together in order to drive rapid divergence of gamete <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins.</b> In this process, intraspecific competition for fertilizations enlarges male gamete protein variation by means of evolutionary branching, which initiates sympatric speciation. In addition, avoidance of competition for fertilizations between the incipient species drives the rapid evolution of gamete <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins.</b> This mechanism can account for both strong stabilizing selection on gamete <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins</b> within species and rapid divergence between species. Moreover, it can explain the empirical finding that the rate of divergence of fertilization genes is not constant, but highest between closely related species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Reproductive {{character}} displacement (RCD) is {{a common}} and taxonomically widespread pattern. In marine broadcast spawning organisms, behavioral and mechanical isolation are absent and prezygotic barriers between species often operate only during the fertilization process. Such barriers are usually a consequence of differences {{in the way in}} which sperm and egg proteins interact, so RCD can be manifest as faster evolution of these proteins between species in sympatry than allopatry. Rapid evolution of these proteins often appears to be a consequence of positive (directional) selection. Here, we identify a set of candidate gamete <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins</b> (GRPs) in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis and showed that these GRPs evolve more rapidly than control proteins (those not involved in gamete recognition). Choosing a subset of these gamete <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins</b> that show evidence of positive selection (CIPRO 37. 40. 1, CIPRO 60. 5. 1, CIPRO 100. 7. 1), we then directly test the RCD hypothesis by comparing divergence (omega) and polymorphism (McDonald-Kreitman, Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D and F, Fay and Wu's H) statistics in sympatric and allopatric populations of two distinct forms of C. intestinalis (Types A and B) between which there are strong post-zygotic barriers. Results Candidate gamete <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins</b> from two lineages of C. intestinalis (Type A and B) are evolving more rapidly than control proteins, consistent with patterns seen in insects and mammals. However, ω (d N /d S) is not significantly different between the sympatric and allopatric populations, and none of the polymorphism statistics show significant differences between sympatric and allopatric populations. Conclusions Enhanced prezygotic isolation in sympatry has become a well-known feature of gamete <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins</b> in marine broadcast spawners. But in most cases the evolutionary process or processes responsible for this pattern have not been identified. Although gamete <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins</b> in C. intestinalis do appear to evolve more rapidly, on average, than proteins with other functions, rates of evolution are not different in allopatric and sympatric populations of the two reproductively isolated forms. That sympatry is probably human-mediated, and therefore recent, may explain the absence of RCD. </p...|$|R

40|$|Summary Enhanced {{repair of}} DNA adducts {{may be a}} cause of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) {{resistance}} in solid malignancies. Binding of specific damage <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins</b> to the sites of DNA damage {{may be involved in}} the initial steps of DNA repair, or alternatively may block access of repair proteins to damaged DNA. Proteins which bind specifically to CDDP-modified DNA were identified in cell extracts from human ovarian carcinoma cell lines by two assays, the gel mobility shift assay and the southwestern blot. In the first assay, proteins complexed with CDDP-modified oligonucleotide and produced two retarded bands, Bl and B 2. The B 2 complex was partially purified from an ovarian cell extract by anion exchange FPLC, and was shown to bind to DNA damaged by CDDP but not by transDDP or UV irradiation. Using the southwestern blot, proteins of 97, 48, and 25 kD were identified; each of these bound to CDDP-modified but not undamaged oligonucleotide. The partially purified B 2 protein fraction contained both the 97 and the 25 kD damage <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins.</b> A human ovarian carcinoma cell line selected in vitro for CDDP-resistance (OVlP/DDP), which is 5 -fold more resistant to CDDP than the parental line (OVIP), showed an increase in binding of the 97 and 48 kD damage <b>recognition</b> <b>proteins</b> compared with the parental line.
