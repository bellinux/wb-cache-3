50|$|With proper techniques, rice hulls can {{be burned}} {{and used to}} power steam engines. Some rice mills {{originally}} disposed of hulls in this way.Unfortunately the direct combustion of rice hulls produces large quantities of smoke. An alternative is gasification. Rice hulls are easily gasified in top-lit updraft gasifiers. The combustion of this <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> gas produces a blue flame, and <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> biochar makes a good soil amendment.|$|E
50|$|Refined salt for {{domestic}} use {{is made by}} evaporating salt water in large open vats using ovens with rice husks used as the fuel source. This method produces very clean, fine grained salt in which the impurities are removed during cooking. Traditionally, the stove used in salt making was wood-fueled. Wood became more expensive, prompting a shift to <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> stoves. The abundance of rice hulls has made it economically feasible to reprocess the salt and is a renewable source of fuel. The residue, <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash, (RHA) is then sold back to farmers for use as fertilizer.|$|E

40|$|A {{microorganism}} utilizing <b>rice</b> <b>hulls</b> {{as a substrate}} for {{the production}} of carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) was isolated from seawater and identified as Bacillus lincheniformis by analyses of its 16 S rDNA sequences. The optimal carbon and nitrogen sources for production of CMCase were found to be <b>rice</b> <b>hulls</b> and ammonium nitrate. The optimal conditions for cell growth and the production of CMCase by B. lincheniformis LBH- 52 were investigated using the response surface method (RSM). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of results from central composite design (CCD) indicated that a highly significant factor (“probe>F ” less than 0. 0001) for cell growth was <b>rice</b> <b>hulls,</b> whereas those for pro-duction of CMCase were <b>rice</b> <b>hulls</b> and initial pH of the medium. The optimal conditions of <b>rice</b> <b>hulls,</b> ammonium nitrate, initial pH, and temperature for cell growth extracted by Design Expert Software were 48. 7 g/l, 1. 8 g/l, 6. 6, and 35. 7 ℃, respectively, whereas those {{for the production of}} CMCase were 43. 2 g/l, 1. 1 g/l, 6. 8, and 35. 7 ℃. The maximal production of CMCase by B. lincheniformis LBH- 52 from <b>rice</b> <b>hulls</b> under optimized conditions was 79. 6 U/ml in a 7 l bioreactor. In this study, <b>rice</b> <b>hulls</b> and ammonium nitrate were developed to be substrates for the production of CMCase by a newly isolated marine microorganism, and the time for production of CMCase was reduced to 3 days using a bacte-rial strain with submerged fermentation...|$|R

40|$|Sugarcane bagasse, <b>rice</b> <b>hulls,</b> peanut shells, and cassava stalks are {{abundant}} lignocellulosic residues {{that could be}} considered as raw materials for ethanol production in tropical countries. The knowledge on the composition of lignocellulosic materials is important for their effective utilisation.

30|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>hull</b> is an {{agricultural}} by-product which is poorly utilized. More than 100 {{million tons of}} <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> is generated annually in the world (Okafor and Okonkwo 2009). The collection and disposal of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> is becoming more difficult and expensive and is, therefore, left unused as waste or simply burned in the fields, thereby creating significant environmental problems (Mansaray and Ghaly 1997). It has useful properties as a growing media such as low in weight, inert with respect to adsorption and desorption of nutrients and also has good drainage, aeration and low rate of decomposition (Saparamadu 2008). Ghehsareh (2013) reported some physicochemical properties of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> media such as porosity (73  %), water holding capacity (88  %), bulk density (0.09  g/cm 3), organic matter content (88.52  %), electrical conductivity (2.24  ds/m) and pH (6.2). The composition of N, P, and K in <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> is 0.5, 0.08 and 0.4  %, respectively, and the C/N ratio of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> is 25 : 1 (Marulanda and Izquierdo 1993).
