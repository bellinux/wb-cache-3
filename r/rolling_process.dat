2500|$|Cast iron used in rails proved {{unsatisfactory}} {{because it}} was brittle and broke under heavy loads. The wrought iron invented by John Birkinshaw in 1820 replaced cast iron. Wrought iron (usually simply referred to as [...] "iron") was a ductile material that could undergo considerable deformation before breaking, making it more suitable for iron rails. But iron was expensive to produce until Henry Cort patented the puddling process in 1784. In 1783 Cort also patented the <b>rolling</b> <b>process,</b> which was 15 times faster at consolidating and shaping iron than hammering. These processes greatly lowered the cost of producing iron and rails. The next important development in iron production was hot blast developed by James Beaumont Neilson (patented 1828), which considerably reduced the amount of coke (fuel) or charcoal needed to produce pig iron. Wrought iron was a soft material that contained included slag or dross. The softness and dross tended to make iron rails distort and delaminate and they lasted less than 10 years. Sometimes they lasted as little as one year under high traffic. All these developments {{in the production of}} iron eventually led to replacement of composite wood/iron rails with superior all iron rails.|$|E

40|$|Objective of the Study The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the role of internal communication in the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process.</b> The study analysed the role of internal communication through four research questions: 1) What communication practices are connected with the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process?</b> 2) Which organisational attributes influence the internal communication climate in the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process?</b> 3) How is management and strategic communication incorporated in the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process?</b> and 4) How does the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process</b> influence the communication lines in the organisation? Methodology and Theoretical Framework The qualitative case study was chosen as the research strategy. The data consisted of eight theme interviews conducted in four companies with business professionals involved in financial forecasting process. The data collection and analysis concentrated on key themes, which emerged from existing literature. The starting point for the theoretical framework was a management steering model created by Hope, Fraser and Åkerberg (1999). The model is based on forecasts, performance reviews and strategy evaluation that are carried out on a rolling basis. The theoretical framework consists of four core elements: internal communication practices, organisational context, strategic planning and management approach. Findings and Conclusions The findings of the study show that efficient internal communication is one of the prerequisites of a well-designed <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process.</b> Internal communication in general has a multifaceted role in the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process.</b> The communication practices were case-specific and unstructured among the case organisations. History, organisational structure and organisational culture were considered as the most significant organisational attributes that influence internal communication climate. Interviewees highlighted the importance of management communication especially during the implementation of the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process</b> whereas the incorporation of strategic communication in the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process</b> was dependent on how the entire business planning process is organized in the company. As a conclusion, the key elements of functional internal communication in the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process</b> consists of coordinated communication framework and practices, adaptable communication climate and management endorsement. Moreover, findings indicate that the <b>rolling</b> forecast <b>process</b> calls for open and cooperative communication but the process itself can also spur communication across the organisation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Within past 20 years, high surface {{qualities of}} cold strip were demanded by {{automotive}} industry and electrical engineering. Main purposes of cold <b>rolling</b> <b>processed</b> are to provide high quality surface and generate appropriate roughness for different customs. Emulsion {{is a common}} coolant used in cold <b>rolling</b> <b>processes,</b> Properties of base oil in emulsion, concentration, roughness of work roll, rolling speed and reduction are important parameters, which dominate the surface qualities of cold rolled strip. Hence, a powerful cold rolling model which can describe complicate tribological behavior in roll bite is required. In this article, a cold rolling model which integrates roll deformation and mixed lubrication in inlet zone and biting area was developed. The thickness of oil film, fraction of contact area and coefficient of friction in roll bite are calculated...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the application of}} neural networks in the modeling of hot <b>rolling</b> <b>processes.</b> This relatively new technique of Artificial Intelligence was conceived {{more than fifty years}} ago, but it only became really feasible with the arrival of low cost computer processing power.

Although the first results were promising, there is still some lack of confidence about its real performance under industrial conditions, which is preventing the exclusive use of this new tool in the modeling of hot <b>rolling</b> <b>processes.</b> However, neural networks are already being used, as a standard feature, in hybrid automation models for hot strip mills, where they calculate adjusting coefficients for theoretical models. However, continuous use of these tools and its continuous development certainly will contribute to increase the general confidence in this revolutionary method and pave the way for a more intensive application in practical cases...|$|R

50|$|In metalworking, rolling is a {{metal forming}} {{process in which}} metal stock is passed through one or more pairs of rolls to reduce the {{thickness}} {{and to make the}} thickness uniform. The concept is similar to the rolling of dough. Rolling is classified according to the temperature of the metal rolled. If the temperature of the metal is above its recrystallization temperature, then the process is known as hot rolling. If the temperature of the metal is below its recrystallization temperature, the process is known as cold rolling. In terms of usage, hot <b>rolling</b> <b>processes</b> more tonnage than any other manufacturing <b>process,</b> and cold <b>rolling</b> <b>processes</b> the most tonnage out of all cold working processes. Roll stands holding pairs of rolls are grouped together into rolling mills that can quickly process metal, typically steel, into products such as structural steel (I-beams, angle stock, channel stock, and so on), bar stock, and rails. Most steel mills have rolling mill divisions that convert the semi-finished casting products into finished products.|$|R
