40|$|As a {{building}} {{block in the}} development of smart lift-enhancement devices, a new concept for flow control using active vortex generators (AVGs) is presented. <b>Ramp,</b> <b>wedge,</b> and doublet wedge (Wheeler) VG configurations are investigated. The AVGs are designed to conform {{to the surface of the}} wing section at low alpha. As the section approaches the stall, they are deployed and accordingly, alpha(stall) and C(lmax) are increased. A qualitative analysis of the flow around the various VG configurations was conducted in a low speed wind tunnel at 1. 6 ft/s and a Reynolds number of approximately 3400. The results demonstrate that ramp VGs produce vortices that have the longest distance at breakdown. The VGs were also applied to a 25 -in. span, 8 -in. chord NACA 4415 wing section. Optimization studies were conducted on the spanwise spacing, chordwise position, and size of statically deployed VGs. The test results demonstrate a 14 -percent increase in C(lmax) while increasing alpha (stall) by up to 3...|$|E

25|$|A surf {{break is}} an area with an {{obstruction}} or an object that causes a wave to break. Surf breaks entail multiple scale phenomena. Wave section creation has microscale factors of peel angle and wave breaking intensity. The microscale components influence wave height and variations on wave crests. The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the <b>ramp,</b> platform, <b>wedge,</b> or ledge that may be present at a surf break. Macroscale processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves. Types of surf breaks are headlands (point break), beach break, river/estuary entrance bar, reef breaks, and ledge breaks.|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} experimental {{as well as}} computational {{analysis of}} hypersonic flows over heated <b>ramp</b> and <b>wedge</b> configurations has been initiated. This paper presents {{an overview of the}} ongoing work on the numerical simulation using two different, well validated Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes solvers with a variety of turbulence models. Different surface temperatures are specified to investigate the impact on the shock / boundary layer interaction and {{on the size of the}} separation. To analyze the effect of an entropy layer behind a blunt leading edge on the structure of the boundary layer as well as on the development of the inviscid flow field, flows over double wedge configurations with different nose radii are computed and compared to the experimental result...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to explore various regimes of shock-induced combustion that may occur as a result of supersonic flow of a reactive gas mixture past a simple compression <b>ramp</b> or <b>wedge.</b> Attention was confined to combinations of wedge angles, fuel-air mixture ratios and freestream velocities that permit the resulting oblique shock or oblique detonation wave to remain attached. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, both inviscid and viscous, were performed and analyzed in order to investigate two modes of compression ramp flameholding; namely, complete oblique detonation wave (ODW) and shock-induced combustion. In addition, the possibility of flame persistence or hysteresis was explored. It was preliminarily concluded that inclusion of viscous effects may be essential to accurately predict the occurrence of the various flameholding modes...|$|R
5000|$|Ed Leedskalnin and his megalithic creation, Rock Gate, {{better known}} as Coral Castle, {{became a part of}} the American popular culture due to the {{magnitude}} of a single man's effort, perseverance, and determination. With the advent of the Internet, Leedskalnin's fame spread far beyond Florida. Along with the recognition came speculations about his seemingly superhuman powers: either it was his purported access to alien technology or esoteric ancient knowledge, or his assumed ability to levitate blocks of stone and move them with the aid of the Earth's magnetic energy. Other currently available explanations center on Leedskalnin's stonemason and logging experiences that presumably allowed him to apply his work skills creatively to a tedious process of moving large blocks of stone using levers, wheels, axles, pulleys, <b>ramps,</b> and <b>wedges</b> without any power equipment.|$|R
50|$|The Tacoma Fault Zone {{marks the}} south end of the Seattle Uplift, of which the similar and related Seattle Fault Zone marks the north end. This uplift is {{believed}} to be either a slab of rock about 15 km thick being pushed up a <b>ramp,</b> or a <b>wedge</b> being popped up between these two faults, by tectonic forces from the south or south-west as tectonic plates riding on top of the Juan de Fuca Plate are pushed against the North American craton.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of turbulence models for high speed flows is presented. The flows consist of simple 2 D flows over flat plates and complex shock-wave boundary-layer interaction flows over <b>ramps</b> and <b>wedges.</b> The flows {{are typical of}} those encountered by high speed vehicles such as the NASP. The turbulence models investigated include various two-equation models which, as a class, {{are considered to be}} well suited to the design of high speed vehicles. A description and discussion of the specific models is given and includes both baseline or uncorrected models, and model corrections which are needed to improve predictions of complex flows. It is found that most of the models studied are able to give good predictions of the flat plate flows, and some of the models are able to predict some of the complex flows, but none of them are able to accurately predict all of the complex flows. Recommendations for future model improvements are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this text is to {{document}} many of the lessons that have been learned during the author’s {{more than forty years}} in the field of blast and shock. The writing therefore takes on an historical perspective, in some sense, because it follows the author’s experience. The book deals with blast waves propagating in fluids or materials that can be treated as fluids. It begins by distinguishing between blast waves and the more general category of shock waves. It then examines several ways of generating blast waves, considering the propagation of blast waves in one, two and three dimensions as well as through the real atmosphere. One section treats the propagation of shocks in layered gases in a more detailed manner. The book also details the interaction of shock waves with structures in particular reflections, progressing from simple to complex geometries, including planar structures, two-dimensional structures such as <b>ramps</b> or <b>wedges,</b> reflections from heights of burst, and three-dimensional structures. Intended for those with a basic knowledge of algebra and a solid grasp of the concepts of conservation of mass and energy, the text includes an introduction to blast wave terminology and conservation laws as well as a discussion of units and the importance of consistency...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} and analyse methods/algorithms for image processing provided by various commercial software programs used in direct digital dental imaging and to map them onto a standardized nomenclature. Methods: Twelve programs {{presented at the}} 28 th International Dental-Show, March, 2001, Cologne, Germany and the Emago advanced software were included in this study. An artificial test image, comprised of gray scale <b>ramps,</b> step <b>wedges,</b> fields with Gaussian-distributed noise, {{and salt and pepper}} noise, was synthesized and imported to all programs to classify algorithms for display; linear, non-linear and histogram-based point processing; pseudo-coloration; linear and non-linear spatial filtering; frequency domain filtering; measurements; image analysis; and annotations. Results: The 13 programs were found to possess a great variety of image processing and enhancement facilities. All programs oer gray-scale image display with interactive brightness and contrast adjustment and gray-scale inversion as well as calibration and length measurements. While Emago enables arbitrary spatial filtering with user-defined masks up to 767 pixels in size, most programs sparsely include filters and tools for image analysis and comparison. Moreover, the naming and implementation of provided functions dier. Some functions inappropriately use standardized image processing terms to describe their operations. Conclusions: Image processing and enhancement functions are rarely incorporated in commercial software for direct digital imaging in dental radiology. Until now, comparison of software was limited by the arbitrary naming used in each system. Standardized terminology and increased functionality of image processing should be oered to the dental profession...|$|R
40|$|AbstractShock wave {{diffraction}} {{occurs when a}} normal travelling wave passes through a sudden area expansion. Turbulent, compressible, and vortical are the characterising adjectives that describe the flow features, which are slowly smeared out due to the dissipative nature of turbulence. The study of this phenomenon provides insight into several flow structures such as shear layer formation, vortex development, and vortex/shock interaction whose applications include noise control, propulsion or wing aerodynamics. A large amount of research {{has been carried out}} in the analysis of shock {{wave diffraction}} mainly around sharp wedges, but only few studies have considered rounded corners. This project has the aim to examine and compare the flow features which develop around three different geometries, ramp, symmetric and rounded, with experimental incident shock Mach numbers of 1. 31 and 1. 59, and Reynolds numbers of 1. 08 × 106 and 1. 68 × 106. Schlieren photography is used to obtain qualitative information about the evolution of the flow field. The results show that <b>ramp</b> and symmetrical <b>wedges</b> with a tip angle of 172 ° behave in the same manner, which exhibit clear dissimilarities with a curved corner. The flow field evolves more rapidly for a higher incoming Mach number which is also responsible for the development of stronger structures...|$|R
40|$|Fueling {{the core}} airflow of a {{circular}} or elliptical scramjet combustor cross-section often requires intrusive geometries. Intrusive geometries can distribute the fuel evenly across the combustor cross-section {{and act as}} a flameholder for the fu-el/air mixture. Compared to conventional transverse or angled wall injection, intru-sive geometries allow easier penetration into the core combustor airflow and reduced fuel injection pressures. The design and testing of an intrusive pylon geometry for scramjet combustor fueling {{is the subject of}} this research. Three pylon configurations are compared: a basic pylon, a ramp pylon, and an alternating wedge pylon. All three pylon configurations exhibit the same frontal area and inject fuel parallel to the combustor airflow with long, thin rectangular injection ports (thin film fueling). However, the three pylon configurations incorporate different aft shapes to facilitate fuel/air mixing. A cold flow fuel injection study is accomplished to compare mixing capabilities and total pressure losses of the three pylon configurations. Four experi-mental techniques are used: 1) computational fluid dynamics, 2) aerothermal probing, 3) Raman spectroscopy, and 4) planar laser induced fluorescence. The <b>ramp</b> and al-ternating <b>wedge</b> pylons show decisive increases in mixing capability compared to the basic pylon. They also exhibit a slight increase in total pressure loss compared to the basic pylon. i...|$|R
