25|$|Traditional Japanese {{papermaking}} {{uses the}} inner bark fibers of plants. This fiber is soaked, cooked, <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> traditionally hand-beaten {{to form the}} paper pulp. The long fibers are layered to form strong, translucent sheets of paper. Three traditional fibers are abaca, kozo and gampi. Today, this paper is used for calligraphy, printing, book arts, and three-dimensional work, including origami.|$|E
25|$|Paper is {{both made}} {{and used to}} make crafts in Mexico. Paper-making is a skill {{that goes back to}} pre-Hispanic times. The bark of two trees are {{primarily}} used, that of the morus or mulberry family for white paper and that of the ficus or fig family for darker varieties. Traditionally, the bark was cut and scraped by men, but the making the paper itself was done by women. The process begins by washing the bark, then boiling it with ashes. It is then <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> beaten until the fibers knit together, then dried in the sun. Banderolas, or cut-paper banners, are hung in the streets for special occasions.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the midwife}} {{received}} the infant, {{placed it in}} pieces of cloth, cut the umbilical cord, and cleansed the baby. The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” to soak up the birth residue, <b>rinsed,</b> <b>and</b> then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put olive oil in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the midwife made the initial call {{on whether or not}} an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for congenital deformities and testing its cry to hear {{whether or not it was}} robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant’s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.|$|E

In a {{previous}} study, we {{have suggested that}} the salivary ATP swab test provides a simple and valid method to establish oral hygiene. (The assessment of oral hygiene with the ATP detection test : A comparative study of tooth brushing and garglerelated variation using the salivary ATP swab test) The purpose of the current study is to assess oral hygiene before and after tooth-brushing followed by either <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling three times with 150 mL tap water or twice with 150 mL saline. Saliva ATP values were 4. 12 and 2. 98 times higher than the baseline after first <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling with tap water and saline, respectively. In addition, after second <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling either with tap water or saline, the ATP values were close to those of the saliva before tooth-brushing. Moreover, after third <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling with tap water, the ATP value was lower prior to tooth-brushing. Significant difference was found in comparing the mean ATP values in saliva. First <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling with saline increased ATP values, whereas, the second <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling decreased ATP values to below the pre-rinsing baseline, although the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, the saliva was contaminated by tooth-brushing, however, it was considered possible that rinsing off with more than 300 mL liquid can remove debris stagnant in the oral cavity...|$|R

500|$|When {{an animal}} is ritually {{slaughtered}} (shechted) the raw meat is traditionally cut, <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> salted, prior to cooking. Salting of raw meat draws out {{the blood that}} lodges on the inner surface of the meat.

Afterwards, the residue of salt is rinsed away with water, and the meat cooked. Meat that is roasted requires no prior salting, as fire acts as a natural purgatory of blood.|$|E
500|$|Briarcliff Farms {{intended}} {{to prove that}} optimal farming practices could be profitable. Law believed that kind treatment would produce better cattle, and was intolerant of animal abuse: [...] "Cruelty to a cow {{is the same as}} cruelty to me, and shall never be permitted on this farm." [...] He knew everyone who lived at the farms, and the farm workers knew the name of each cow (which was on a brass plate {{at the front of the}} cow's stall). The cows were sponged several times a day, and workers wore white cotton suits which were sterilized daily by boiling. Law treated his workers as intelligent co-workers, rather than laborers. Each cow was groomed before milking, and a pail of warm water and a brush would then be used on her sides, flanks and udders. The flank and udder were washed again with a one-percent creolin solution, <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> dried. Workers would milk into a fine wire strainer placed over a pail; during milking no talking, laughing, smoking or spitting was permitted, since such behavior was claimed to have a [...] "perceptible effect upon their milk". The workers were required to wash their hands thoroughly after cleaning the udders and before milking each cow. Each worker had a set of towels and washed, cared for and milked 15 or 16 cows. The cattle grazed from early spring until late autumn, and were in the barns only for milking. In 1901, The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review said it doubted that any other large New York-area dairy did this.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Bacterial {{elimination}} {{from the}} root canal {{is the ultimate}} goal of endodontic treatment. Many supplementary systems and substances have been introduced to improve root canal disinfection. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of sonic and ultrasonic-activated irrigation, a chlorhexidine (CHX) final <b>rinse,</b> <b>and</b> a calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2] dressing in eliminating bacteria after chemomechanical preparation of root canals using the self-adjusting file (SAF). Methods: Eighty maxillary and mandibular premolars were inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis for 4 weeks, instrumented with SAF, and randomly distributed into four test groups (n =  15) according to the supplementary approach used for bacterial elimination: EndoActivator (EA) irrigation, passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), CHX final <b>rinse,</b> <b>and</b> Ca(OH) 2 dressing. Two groups (n = 10) used as a positive and negative controls. Bacteriological samples were obtained from the canals before and after SAF preparation and after the supplementary approaches. The number of bacteria in each sample was determined by plate count. Results: The bacterial population significantly decreased after SAF preparation (P <  0. 001). EA irrigation and PUI were significantly more effective than the CHX <b>rinse</b> <b>and</b> Ca(OH) 2 dressing in decreasing bacterial colony-forming units (P <  0. 05). Conclusions: EA irrigation and PUI after chemomechanical preparation using SAF were more effective than the CHX final <b>rinse</b> <b>and</b> Ca(OH) 2 dressing in decreasing root canal infection...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of multiple decontamination procedures for salivary contamination after curing of a universal adhesive on dentin bond strength according to its etch modes. Materials and Methods Forty-two extracted bovine incisors were trimmed by exposing the labial dentin surfaces and embedded in cylindrical molds. A universal adhesive (All-Bond Universal, Bisco) was used. The teeth were randomly divided into groups according to etch mode and decontamination procedure. The adhesive was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions for a given etch mode. With the exception of the control groups, the cured adhesive was contaminated with saliva for 20 sec. In the self-etch group, the teeth were divided into three groups: control, decontamination with <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> drying, <b>and</b> decontamination with <b>rinsing,</b> drying, <b>and</b> adhesive. In the etch-and-rinse group, the teeth were divided into four groups: control, decontamination with <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> drying, decontamination with <b>rinsing,</b> drying, <b>and</b> adhesive, <b>and</b> decontamination with <b>rinsing,</b> drying, re-etching, <b>and</b> reapplication of adhesive. A composite resin (Filtek Z 350 XT, 3 M ESPE) was used for filling and was cured on the treated surfaces. Shear bond strength was measured, and failure modes were evaluated. The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variation and Tukey's HSD test. Results The etch-and-rinse subgroup that was decontaminated by <b>rinse,</b> drying, re-etching, <b>and</b> reapplication of adhesive showed a significantly higher bond strength.
