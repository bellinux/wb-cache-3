6000|$|... "Why, dear?" [...] asked Miss Henny, busily {{arranging}} the small dish of delicate tidbits, which left little but {{the skeleton of}} the <b>roast</b> <b>fowl</b> for the kitchen.|$|R

6000|$|... 'An {{excellent}} {{dinner was}} provided: <b>roast</b> <b>fowl</b> with taro, a nutritious root somewhat like potato, rice and jam, bananas and delicious fruit, bread and Scotch cheese, with glasses of cocoa-nut milk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I say!" [...] {{said the}} fisher-boy. He could say no more, for the sight and scent of apples, jelly, <b>roast</b> <b>fowl,</b> home-made pastry, {{and other things}} was almost too much for him.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrangement}} of the clerk, peasant, and soldier underneath the tree suggests the men as the spokes of a wheel, where the tree is the hub. The <b>roasted</b> <b>fowl</b> lies {{in the place where}} a fourth spoke could be.|$|R
6000|$|On {{which the}} Billickin would retort (Rosa not having spoken a word), ‘If you was better {{accustomed}} to butcher’s meat, Miss, {{you would not}} entertain {{the idea of a}} lamb’s fry. Firstly, because lambs has long been sheep, and secondly, because there is such things as killing-days, and there is not. As to <b>roast</b> <b>fowls,</b> Miss, why you must be quite surfeited with <b>roast</b> <b>fowls,</b> letting alone your buying, when you market for yourself, the agedest of poultry with the scaliest of legs, quite as if you was accustomed to picking ’em out for cheapness. Try a little inwention, Miss. Use yourself to ’ousekeeping a bit. Come now, think of somethink else.’ ...|$|R
25|$|White {{truffles}} {{are generally}} served raw, and shaved over steaming buttered pasta, salads, or fried eggs. White or black paper-thin truffle slices may be inserted into meats, under the skins of <b>roasted</b> <b>fowl,</b> in foie gras preparations, in pâtés, or in stuffings. Some speciality cheeses contain truffles, as well.|$|R

6000|$|He gave vent to {{a sigh of}} relief, and was congratulating himself {{upon his}} wisdom, when his eyes chanced to fall on the flask of water and cold <b>roast</b> <b>fowl</b> and loaf lying {{conspicuous}} in the full glare of light that flooded the front part of the cave! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 2. How, {{in another}} quarter, there was set aloft IN RE, by some Pastry-cook of {{patriotic}} turn: [...] "An actual Ox roasted whole; filled with pheasants, partridges, grouse, hares and geese; Prussian Eagle atop, made of <b>roasted</b> <b>fowls,</b> larks and the like,"--unattainable, I doubt, except for money down. [Helden-Geschichte, ii. 359.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I should also,' {{observed}} the doctor, who {{had passed the}} foot-bath on the stairs, 'I should also,' said the doctor, {{in the voice of}} an oracle, 'put her feet in hot water, and wrap them up in flannel. I should likewise,' said the doctor with increased solemnity, 'give her something light for supper--the wing of a <b>roasted</b> <b>fowl</b> now--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look at Ma,' whispered Lavinia to Bella {{when this}} was done, and they stood over the <b>roasting</b> <b>fowls.</b> 'If one was the most dutiful child in {{existence}} (of course on the whole one hopes one is), isn't she enough to make one want to poke her with something wooden, sitting there bolt upright in a corner?' ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the story}} of Abraham hosting the three visitors, Abraham offers cakes, a well {{prepared}} young calf, curds, and milk. This meal has similar elements to an earlier meal described in {{the story of}} Sinuhe, an Egyptian nobleman who lived for a time in Canaan around 1900 BCE, at which bread, wine, cooked meat, <b>roast</b> <b>fowl,</b> and dairy products were served.|$|R
5000|$|In Ethel Turner's Seven Little Australians, the {{children}} express dissatisfaction with their food. [...] "My father and Esther ... are having <b>roast</b> <b>fowl,</b> three vegetables, and four kinds of pudding", Pip says angrily. [...] "It isn't fair!" [...] His sister notes that [...] "we had dinner at one o'clock." [...] "Boiled mutton and carrots and rice pudding!" [...] her brother replies, witheringly.|$|R
25|$|Bacon, or bacon fat, {{is often}} used for barding <b>roast</b> <b>fowl</b> and game birds, {{especially}} those that have little fat themselves. Barding consists of laying rashers of bacon or other fats over a roast; a variation is the traditional method of preparing filet mignon of beef, which is wrapped in rashers of bacon before cooking. The bacon itself may afterwards be discarded or served to eat, like cracklings.|$|R
60|$|When he {{got back}} to the Slaughters', the <b>roast</b> <b>fowl</b> was of course cold, in which {{condition}} he ate it for supper. And knowing what early hours his family kept, {{and that it would be}} needless to disturb their slumbers at so late an hour, it is on record, that Major Dobbin treated himself to half-price at the Haymarket Theatre that evening, where let us hope he enjoyed himself.|$|R
60|$|Supper was comfortably {{served and}} hot, though my aunt's rooms were very high up--whether {{that she might}} have more stone stairs for her money, or might be nearer to the door in the roof, I don't know--and {{consisted}} of a <b>roast</b> <b>fowl,</b> a steak, and some vegetables, to all of which I did ample justice, and which were all excellent. But my aunt had her own ideas concerning London provision, and ate but little.|$|R
60|$|As {{the coachman}} only laughed, and as Tom was curious himself, he {{unpacked}} it, {{and put the}} articles, one by one, upon the footboard. A cold <b>roast</b> <b>fowl,</b> a packet of ham in slices, a crusty loaf, a piece of cheese, a paper of biscuits, half a dozen apples, a knife, some butter, a screw of salt, {{and a bottle of}} old sherry. There was a letter besides, which Tom put in his pocket.|$|R
60|$|Out come their suppers: a whole <b>roast</b> <b>fowl,</b> {{hunks of}} kid, legs of lamb, huge breads. The fowl is dismembered with a {{jack-knife}} in a twinkling, and shared. Everything among the soldiers is shared. There {{they sit in}} their pent-house with its open ends, crowded together and happy, chewing with all their might and clapping one another on the shoulder lovingly, and taking swigs at the wine bottles. We envy them their good food.|$|R
6000|$|Merton {{descended the}} turnpike stair, {{holding on to}} the rope {{provided}} for that purpose in old Scotch houses. He found Logan standing by the fire in the hall. They were waited on by the old man, Bower. By tacit consent they spoke, while he was present, of anything but the subject that occupied their minds. They had quite an edible dinner--cock-a-leekie, brandered haddocks, and a pair of <b>roasted</b> <b>fowls,</b> with a mysterious sweet which was called a 'Hattit Kit.' ...|$|R
40|$|If you are fortunate, you {{may have}} turkey or other <b>roasted</b> <b>fowl</b> for Christmas dinner. But even the brownest, juiciest turkey is not {{complete}} without vegetables, salad greens, dessert, sweetmeats and the little 2 ̆ 2 fillers 2 ̆ 2 one looks for on the Christmas table. Christmas, the time of holly and fir trees, suggests r ed and green for the color scheme of the Christmas menu, and a world of good things may be found to conform to these colors...|$|R
50|$|Ross Frank {{has argued}} that the {{painting}} is a political satire directed at the participants in the first stages of the Dutch Revolt (1568-1648), where the <b>roasted</b> <b>fowl</b> represents the humiliation and failure of the nobleman (who would otherwise form the fourth spoke of the wheel) in his leadership of the Netherlands, and the overall scene depicts the complacency of the Netherlandish people, too content with their abundance to take the risks that would bring about significant religious and political change.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You {{must take}} some wine, sir,’ said Mrs. Tope, ‘and the jelly that I had ready for you, {{and that you}} wouldn’t put your lips to at noon, though I warned you what would come of it, you know, and you not breakfasted; and {{you must have a}} wing of the <b>roast</b> <b>fowl</b> that has been put back twenty times if it’s been put back once. It shall all be on table in five minutes, and this good gentleman belike will stop and see you take it.’ ...|$|R
60|$|So he sent {{to demand}} {{formally}} of Hereward those three hens; and was unpleasantly disappointed when Hereward, instead of offering to fight him, sent him them in an hour, and a lusty young cock into the bargain, with this message,--That he hoped they might increase and multiply; for {{it was a shame}} of an honest Englishman if he did not help a poor Breton churl to eat <b>roast</b> <b>fowls</b> {{for the first time in}} his life, after feeding on nothing better than furze-toppings, like his own ponies.|$|R
60|$|She {{had some}} reason to be astonished, {{for the person who}} proffered the gracious {{invitation}} was no other than Daniel Quilp. The little door out of which he had thrust his head was close to the inn larder; and there he stood, bowing with grotesque politeness; as much at his ease as if the door were that of his own house; blighting all the legs of mutton and cold <b>roast</b> <b>fowls</b> by his close companionship, and looking like the evil genius of the cellars come from underground upon some work of mischief.|$|R
60|$|We dined {{soon after}} I awoke, off a <b>roast</b> <b>fowl</b> and a pudding; I sitting at table, {{not unlike a}} trussed bird myself, and moving my arms with {{considerable}} difficulty. But as my aunt had swathed me up, I made no complaint of being inconvenienced. All this time I was deeply anxious {{to know what she}} was going to do with me; but she took her dinner in profound silence, except when she occasionally fixed her eyes on me sitting opposite, and said, 'Mercy upon us!' which did not by any means relieve my anxiety.|$|R
60|$|We encamped near {{a solitary}} log-house, {{for the sake}} of its water, and dined upon the plain. The baskets {{contained}} <b>roast</b> <b>fowls,</b> buffalo's tongue (an exquisite dainty, by the way), ham, bread, cheese, and butter; biscuits, champagne, sherry; lemons and sugar for punch; and abundance of rough ice. The meal was delicious, and the entertainers were the soul of kindness and good humour. I have often recalled that cheerful party to my pleasant recollection since, and shall not easily forget, in junketings nearer home with friends of older date, my boon companions on the Prairie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we must choose," [...] said Martin, [...] "whether {{we will be}} <b>roasted</b> like <b>fowls</b> in an oven, or go {{down and}} have our throats cut like pigs in the open." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{could have}} told him that I should like a dozen cups and a great many slices of bread-and-butter, if {{there was nothing else}} more {{substantial}} to be had. However, I only said, [...] "Thank you," [...] and followed him in to where his wife, a nice-looking woman, with black hair and olive face, was seated behind the teapot. Imagine my surprise when I found that besides tea there was a big hot repast on the table--a ham, a <b>roast</b> <b>fowl,</b> potatoes and cabbage, a rice pudding, a dish of stewed fruit, bread-and-butter, and other things.|$|R
60|$|A stout country lad {{opened a}} door {{at the end of}} the passage, and the three friends entered a long, low-roofed room, {{furnished}} with a large number of high-backed leather-cushioned chairs, of fantastic shapes, and embellished with a great variety of old portraits and roughly-coloured prints of some antiquity. At the upper end of the room was a table, with a white cloth upon it, well covered with a <b>roast</b> <b>fowl,</b> bacon, ale, and et ceteras; and at the table sat Mr. Tupman, looking as unlike a man who had taken his leave of the world, as possible.|$|R
60|$|The {{resident}} Director acquiesced rather sulkily, {{as if the}} gratification of replenishing {{his stomach}} had been impaired by the unsettlement of his preconceived opinions in reference to its situation. But {{the appearance of the}} porter and under-porter with a tray covered with a snow-white cloth, which, being thrown back, displayed a pair of cold <b>roast</b> <b>fowls,</b> flanked by some potted meats and a cool salad, quickly restored his good humour. It was enhanced still further by the arrival of a bottle of excellent madeira, and another of champagne; and he soon attacked the repast with an appetite scarcely inferior to that of the medical officer.|$|R
60|$|Calais up {{and doing}} at the railway station, and Calais down and dreaming in its bed; Calais with {{something}} of 'an ancient and fish- like smell' about it, and Calais blown and sea-washed pure; Calais represented at the Buffet by savoury <b>roast</b> <b>fowls,</b> hot coffee, cognac, and Bordeaux; and Calais represented everywhere by flitting persons with a monomania for changing money--though I never shall {{be able to understand}} in my present state of existence how they live by it, but I suppose I should, if I understood the currency question--Calais en gros, and Calais en detail, forgive one who has deeply wronged you.--I was not fully aware of it on the other side, but I meant Dover.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will name," [...] said Our Missis. [...] "There was <b>roast</b> <b>fowls,</b> hot and cold; {{there was}} smoking roast veal {{surrounded}} with browned potatoes; there was hot soup with (again I ask shall I be credited?) nothing bitter in it, and no flour to choke off the consumer; {{there was a}} variety of cold dishes set off with jelly; there was salad; there was--mark me! fresh pastry, and that of a light construction; there was a luscious show of fruit; there was bottles and decanters of sound small wine, of every size, and adapted to every pocket; the same odious statement will apply to brandy; and these were set out upon the counter so that all could help themselves." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, {{those six}} days which {{were to have}} run out so slowly, had run out fast and were gone, and to-morrow {{looked me in the}} face more {{steadily}} than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my splendor until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by the inevitable <b>roast</b> <b>fowl,</b> and we had some flip to finish with. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits.|$|R
