50|$|Adult <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease</b> may {{be divided}} into the adult <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease</b> 1 and adult <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease</b> 2 subtypes. The former stems from {{mutations}} in the phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (PAHX aka PHYH) gene, on the PHYH locus at 10p13 on chromosome 6q22-24. It was initially believed this was the sole mutation; however 55% of cases are now attributed to mutations in other genes.|$|E

50|$|Adult <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with infantile <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease,</b> a peroxisome biogenesis disorder resulting from deficiencies in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids and branched chain fatty acids (such as phytanic acid) and plasmalogen biosynthesis.|$|E
40|$|The {{infantile}} {{and classical}} forms of <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> are {{generally considered to}} belong to the newly recognized group of peroxisomal disorders. In this study we carried out a detailed investigation into different peroxisomal functions in classical <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> by analyses of plasma (very long chain fatty acids, di- and trihydroxycoprostanoic acid and pipecolic acid) and cultured skin fibroblasts from the patients (de novo plasmalogen biosynthesis, very long chain fatty acid oxidation and amount of particle-bound catalase). The results obtained indicate that, except for a deficient phytanic acid oxidation, peroxisomal functions were found to be normal in classical <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> in contrast with the findings in infantile <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease,</b> {{in which there is a}} general impairment of peroxisomal functions. Based on these results it is concluded that peroxisomal biogenesis is normal in classical (but not in infantile) <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> and that the classical and infantile form of <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> hence represent distinct entities. Since available evidence suggests that phytanic acid is oxidized in mitochondria rather than in peroxisomes, at least in rat liver, it remains to be established whether classical <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> is a peroxisomal disorder or no...|$|R

40|$|The author reports his {{experience}} on <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> and that gained after personally examining in detail 64 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease {{over the past}} ten years. The "cerebellar" inco-ordination in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (with or without distal wasting) and in <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> is analysed. Some variations in the motor and sensory neuropathy of Charcot-Marie-Tooth <b>disease</b> and <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> are discussed. The adequacy of motor conduction velocity in genetically distinguishing types of the above mentioned familial peripheral neuropathies is reviewed. Data on the neuropathy assessed by modern techniques of three original patients of Roussy and Levy (1926) are given. The possibility of extensor plantar responses in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth and <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> without structural lesion of the pyramidal tract is pointed out. The existence of the association between Friedreich's ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is criticised.

50|$|<b>Refsum</b> <b>disease,</b> {{also known}} as classic or adult <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease,</b> heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis, phytanic acid oxidase {{deficiency}} and phytanic acid storage disease, is an autosomal recessive neurological disease that results from the over-accumulation of phytanic acid in cells and tissues. It {{is one of several}} disorders named after Norwegian neurologist Sigvald Bernhard Refsum (1907-1991). <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease</b> typically is adolescent onset and is diagnosed by above average levels of phytanic acid. Humans obtain the necessary phytanic acid primarily through diet. It is still unclear what function phytanic acid plays physiologically in humans, but has been found to regulate fatty acid metabolism in the liver of mice.|$|E
50|$|Infantile <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease</b> (IRD), {{also called}} {{infantile}} phytanic acid storage disease, {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive congenital peroxisomal biogenesis disorder within the Zellweger spectrum. These are disorders of the peroxisomes that are clinically similar to Zellweger syndrome and associated with mutations in the PEX family of genes. IRD is associated with deficient phytanic acid catabolism, as is Adult <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease,</b> but they are different disorders {{that should not be}} confused.|$|E
50|$|<b>Refsum</b> <b>disease,</b> an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder {{that results from}} the accumulation of large stores of phytanic acid in tissues, frequently manifests peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, and hearing loss. Although humans cannot derive phytanic acid from chlorophyll, they can convert free phytol into phytanic acid. Thus, patients with <b>Refsum</b> <b>disease</b> should limit their intake of phytanic acid and free phytol. The amount of free phytol in numerous food products has been reported.|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the production of}} 14 CO 2 from exogenous [1 - 14 C] phytanic acid in fibroblast monolayers from patients with classical <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> and peroxisomal disorders. Activities in the different disorders were (percentage of control) : classical <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> (5 %), isolated peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency (75 %), Zellweger syndrome (4 %), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (5 %), and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctate (3 %). Absence of complementation was demonstrated between Zellweger syndrome and infantile <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> lines after polyethylene glycol fusion, with decreases of average activity of 11 % relative to unfused cell mixtures. Classical <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease,</b> rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy lines all complemented one another, and Zellweger syndrome or infantile <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> lines, with average activity increases of 522 %- 772 %. No intragenic complementation was observed within either group. Four complementation groups were detected suggesting that at least four genes are involved in phytanic acid alpha-oxidation: one gene for the enzyme phytanic acid alpha-hydroxylase (probably mitochondrial); one gene for a regulatory factor {{for the expression of}} phytanic acid alpha-decarboxylation activity and two membrane-bound peroxisomal enzymes involved in the synthesis of plasmalogens; two genes for the assembly of functional peroxisomes and/or import of proteins into peroxisome...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Studies {{utilizing}} mevalonic acid- 2 - 14 C and D 20 as precursors {{failed to}} provide evidence for an appreciable rate of endogenous biosynthesis of phytanic acid in a patient with <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease.</b> Orally administered tracer doses of phytol-U- 14 C were well absorbed both by seven normal control subjects (61 to 94 %) and by two patients with <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> (74 and 80 %). The fraction of the absorbed dose converted to 14 COQ in 12 hours was 3. 5 and 5. 8 % in <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> patients and averaged 20. 9 % in seven control subjects. Labeled phytanic acid was demonstrated in the plasma of both control subjects and patients given phytol-U-_ 4 C, establishing phytol in the diet as a potential precursor of phytanic acid. This labeled phytanic acid had disap-peared almost completely from the plasma of the seven control subjects by 24 to 48 hours, whereas it persisted at high concentrations in the plasma of the two patients for many days. We conclude that the phytanic acid accumulating in <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> is primarily of exogenous origin and that patients with <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> have a relative block in the degradation of phytanic acid and possibly other similar branched-chain compounds. This may relate to a deficiency in mechanisms for release of phytanic acid from stored ester forms or, more probably, to reac-tions essential to oxidative degradation of the carbon skeleton...|$|R
40|$|<b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> (hereditary motor sensory {{neuropathy}} type IV, heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder the clinical features of which include retinitis pigmentosa, blindness, anosmia, deafness, sensory neuropathy, ataxia and accumulation of phytanic acid in plasma- and lipid-containing tissues. The transport and biochemical pathways of phytanic acid metabolism {{have recently been}} defined with the cloning of two key enzymes, phytanoyl-CoA 2 -hydroxylase (PAHX) and 2 -hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase, together with the confirmation of their localization in peroxisomes. PAHX, an iron(II) and 2 -oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase is located on chromosome 10 p 13. Mutant forms of PAHX {{have been shown to}} be responsible for some, but not all, cases of <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease.</b> Certain cases {{have been shown to be}} atypical mild variants of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 a. Other atypical cases with low-plasma phytanic acid may be caused by alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency. A sterol-carrier protein- 2 (SCP- 2) knockout mouse model shares a similar clinical phenotype to <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease,</b> but no mutations in SCP- 2 have been described to-date in man. This review describes the clinical, biochemical and metabolic features of <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> and shows how the biochemistry of the alpha-oxidation pathway may be linked to the regulation of metabolic pathways controlled by isoprenoid lipids, involving calcineurin or the peroxisomal proliferator activating alpha-receptor...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Four {{children}} each exhibiting {{a profound}} deficiency of phytanic acid oxidase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts but {{with very different}} phenotypes, are described. A consistently raised plasma phytanic acid value, {{generally considered to be}} pathognomonic for <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> (phytanic acid oxidase deficiency), was observed in three of these children but not in the fourth, who also showed no evidence of accumulation of phytanic acid in liver or fat biopsies. Our data suggest that the clinical diagnosis of <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> in children is more difficult because the full spectrum of clinical features usually observed in adults with the disorder is not always present. Moreover, a failure to detect a raised plasma phytanic acid value may not necessarily indicate normal fibroblast phytanic acid oxidase activity. <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> is an inherited disorder of phytanic acid (3, 7, 11, 15 -tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) metabolism, 1 and seems to be caused by a defect in the enzymatic oxidation of phytanate.

40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> show mutations in the enzyme {{necessary for the}} degradation of phytanic acid. Accumulation of this tetramethyl-branched fatty acid in inner organs leads to severe neurological and cardiac dysfunctions which can even result in death. Thus, patients with <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> have to follow a specific diet resigning foods {{with high levels of}} phytanic acid and trans-phytol like products from ruminant animals with a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of ≤ 10 mg/d. We recently reported the occurrence of phytyl fatty acid esters (PFAE, trans-phytol esterified with a fatty acid) in bell pepper with trans-phytol amounts of up to 5. 4 mg/ 100 g fresh weight (FW). In this study we carried out in vitro-digestion experiments of PFAE with artificial digestion fluids. Our results demonstrate that PFAE actually are a source for bioavailable trans-phytol and thus add to the TDI. Eating only one portion of bell pepper (∼ 150 g) could therefore lead to exploitation of the TDI of up to 81 %. Analysis of additional vegetable matrices showed that also rocket salad with up to 4. 2 mg/ 100 g FW trans-phytol bound in PFAE represents a risk-relevant food for patients with <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease</b> and should therefore be taken into account...|$|R

40|$|Phytanic acid (PA) is an {{epimeric}} metabolite of the isoprenoid {{side chain}} of chlorophyll. Owing {{to the presence}} of its epimeric beta-methyl group, PA cannot be metabolized by beta-oxidation.

PhyH (phytanoyl-CoA 2 -hydroxylase, also known as PAHX), an Fe(II) and 2 OG (2 -oxoglutarate) oxygenase, catalyses hydroxylation of phytanoyl-CoA. Mutations of PhyH ablate its role in alpha-oxidation, resulting in PA accumulation and ARD (adult <b>Refsum's</b> <b>disease).</b> The structure and function of PhyH is discussed in terms of its clinical importance and unusual selectivity.
