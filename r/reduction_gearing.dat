5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b> A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Westinghouse then {{developed}} {{steam turbines}} for maritime propulsion. Large turbines were most efficient at about 3,000rpm, while an efficient propeller operated at about 100rpm. That required <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing,</b> but building <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> that could operate at high rpm and {{at high power}} was difficult, since a slight misalignment would shake the power train to pieces. Westinghouse and his engineers devised an automatic alignment system that made turbine power practical for large vessels.|$|E
25|$|The Kestrel was {{produced}} in 40 distinct variants which {{can be divided into}} three main groups: normally aspirated, medium supercharged, and fully supercharged. One variant, the Kestrel VIII, was configured as a 'pusher engine' for the Short Singapore flying boat. Apart from supercharging, the variant differences centred on varying compression ratios and propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The P-39, P-63, and Douglas XB-42 Mixmaster used V-1710-Es, exchanging the {{integral}} <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> for an extension shaft driving a remotely located <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> and propeller. Aircraft {{such as the}} P-38, P-40, P-51A, and North American P-82E used close-coupled propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gears,</b> {{a feature of the}} V-1710-F series.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this engine was the {{epicyclic}} propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> which contained a clutch designed to limit the maximum torque, thus protecting the <b>reduction</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also {{available}} {{as an option}} was a front winch with 8-10 tonnes capacity, powered from the <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> using through a multi-joint shaft and worm gear. The direction of the winch can be reversed using the <b>reduction</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
25|$|Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde built Slamat in Vlissingen on the River Scheldt, {{completing}} her in 1924. Her boilers had oil-burning furnaces, and her engines were {{steam turbines}} that drove her twin screws via double <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b> She {{was equipped with}} submarine signalling apparatus, which in the 1920s {{was seen as an}} alternative to radio. She also had wireless direction finding equipment.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} systems were employed. The earlier, fitted to the 1965 through 1968 Ford-built {{cars and the}} 1971–1972 Nissan Cedric, employed an electric motor driving, through <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing,</b> a set of three slow-turning cams. These cams would actuate switches {{to turn on the}} lights in sequence. Later Ford cars and the 1969 Imperial used a transistorised control module with no moving parts to wear, break, or go out of adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Persistent {{difficulties}} with the geared 200hp Hispano-Suiza 8B prompted {{development of the}} Dolphin Mk III, which used a direct-drive version of the 200hp engine. The Mk III first flew in October 1918 and went into production just as hostilities ended. Many existing Dolphins were also converted to Mk III standard at aircraft repair depots, by removing the <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> and fitting a modified cowling to accommodate the resultant lowered thrust line.|$|E
50|$|Engine No. 2 also {{received}} the new style cylinder banks and was tested both {{with and without}} the <b>reduction</b> <b>gear.</b> The direct drive and <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> units were interchangeable, and were switched between the two engines as needed.|$|R

25|$|Two {{different}} classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations {{took place on}} the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> that operated a crank and connecting rod to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.|$|E
25|$|The {{scarcity}} and unreliability of the French-built Hispano-Suiza 8B engine {{proved to}} be the most serious problem in the deployment and use of the Dolphin. Use of insufficiently hardened metal in the pinion gears led to numerous failures of the <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing,</b> particularly in engines built by the French firm Brasier. The engine also suffered persistent lubrication problems. Limited production capacity for the Hispano-Suiza engine and the priority afforded to French aircraft like the SPAD S.XIII slowed Dolphin deliveries. Availability of the Hispano-Suiza improved in early 1918 as the French firm Emile Mayen began deliveries on an order placed by the British Admiralty.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} marine diesel power {{was at a}} {{relatively}} early stage of development, and RML considered it unable to increase the two ships' speed to the required level. Lord Essendon therefore recommended steam turbines, and two options for the drive system: either conventional <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing,</b> or the newer turbo-electric transmission that had been pioneered in the USA and successfully applied to US, UK and French ocean liners. Whichever transmission was chosen, the cost of re-engining Asturias and Alcantara was estimated at about £500,000. Lord Essendon also urged RML directors to order a third ship of similar speed to share the route with Asturias and Alcantara.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{dual-mode}} ignition, the KR200 had a steering bar reminiscent of {{that of an}} aircraft. To steer the KR200, the driver would swivel the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. The mechanism was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common steering mechanisms which involved <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b> The gearshift lever had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would {{put the car in}} neutral regardless of what gear it had been in before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|E

A low pressure steam turbine drove the ship's single screw propeller through double <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> and a hydraulic coupling. She had a total of 6,500 indicated horsepower, which gave her {{a top speed of}} [...]|$|E
500|$|The Mahans' {{propulsion}} plant was considerably improved over {{that of the}} Farraguts. Steam pressure was raised from [...] to [...] in some ships, and superheated steam temperature was raised from [...] to [...] in all ships. Double <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> replaced single <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing,</b> allowing smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. Boiler economizers, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to [...] at , [...] farther than the Farraguts. Design shaft horsepower was increased from [...] to [...] in the same space and weight as in the Farraguts. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the Mahans' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were impulse-type, also called Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft, {{in a similar manner}} to the machinery illustrated at the following reference. Steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the LP turbine, which exhausted to a condenser. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, thus improving fuel economy. This general arrangement with double <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> became standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of these had cruising turbines.|$|E

500|$|A {{two-stage}} setup used {{an internal}} power turbine {{to drive the}} rear wheels {{through the use of}} <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b> [...] Due to the wide variable output of the turbine and the high level of torque, a standard gearbox was not necessary, leaving the Howmet TX with only a single gearing speed. [...] However, the gearing ratios were able to be quickly changed in the differential, allowing the car to be adapted to various circuits. [...] Due to the use of a single-speed transmission, there was no gearing for reverse. [...] Although Heppenstall initially wished to do without reverse, the FIA mandated its use and a small electric motor powered by the turbine was installed, allowing the car to move in reverse.|$|E
500|$|The Mogador-class ships {{retained}} the unit arrangement of their propulsion spaces used in earlier contre-torpilleurs. They used a new high-pressure Indret boiler rated at [...] While this gave more power for its weight and size, {{it proved to}} be fragile and difficult to maintain. Each set of Rateau-Bretagne geared turbines was rated at [...] and consisted of four main turbines, a high-pressure, a medium-pressure and two low-pressure with a reversing turbine in each of the main low-pressure turbine cases. There were also two small cruise turbines operating in parallel in each engine room. At low speeds, steam was directed to the cruise turbines, but at higher speeds it was diverted to the high-pressure turbine. At [...] the cruise turbines were decoupled entirely using a Vulcan clutch. This didn't work properly and several ship's captains recommended that the cruise turbines be deleted from future classes entirely. Each of the two shafts was driven by single <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b> The port shaft was driven by the rear engine room and was significantly shorter than the starboard shaft which was driven by the forward engine room. This caused a significant disparity between the turning circle, depending on which direction the ship was turning.|$|E
500|$|As the sinologist {{historian}} Derk Bodde points out, Su Song's {{astronomical clock}} {{did not lead}} to a new generation of mass-produced clockworks throughout China since his work was largely a government-sponsored endeavor for the use of astronomers and astrologers in the imperial court. Yet the mechanical legacy of Su Song did not end with his work. In about 1150, the writer Xue Jixuan noted that there were four types of clocks in his day, the basic waterclock, the incense clock, the sundial, and the clock with 'revolving and snapping springs' ('gun tan'). The rulers of the continuing Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368 AD) had a vested interest in the advancement of mechanical clockworks. [...] The astronomer Guo Shoujing helped restore the Beijing Ancient Observatory beginning in 1276, where he crafted a water-powered armillary sphere and clock with clock jacks being fully implemented and sounding the hours. [...] Complex gearing for uniquely Chinese clockworks were continued in the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), with new designs driven by the power of falling sand instead of water to provide motive power to the wheel drive, and some Ming clocks perhaps featured <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> rather than the earlier escapement of Su Song. [...] The earliest such design of a sand-clock was made by Zhan Xiyuan around 1370, which featured not only the scoop wheel of Su Song' device, but also a new addition of a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated, much like new European clocks of the same period.|$|E

500|$|The Navy's General Board {{had been}} wrestling with {{proposed}} design changes, first considering 12 torpedo tubes with one fewer /38 caliber gun, and then proposing to retain all five guns with the twelve torpedo tubes, but configuring those guns only for surface targets, not air targets. The Chief of Naval Operations objected, recommending against [...] "subordinating {{the gun to}} the torpedo", and a compromise was struck that included a new engineering plant and a new battery arrangement for the Mahan class and others. In the final design, No. 3 gun {{was moved to the}} aft deckhouse (just ahead of No. 4) {{to make room for the}} third quadruple torpedo tube; the two middle torpedo tubes were moved to the sides, releasing the centerline space for extension of the aft deckhouse. All five 5 in/38s were kept and remained dual purpose guns, able to target aircraft as well as ships, but only No. 1 and No. 2 had gun shields. The traditional destroyer machinery was replaced with a new generation of land-based machinery. This change ushered in a new steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight steam turbine, which proved simpler and more efficient to operate. Double <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> also reduced the size of the faster-turning turbines and allowed cruising turbines to be added. These changes led to a ten percent increase in displacement over the Farraguts.|$|E
500|$|The double-expansion engines {{consist of}} a {{high-pressure}} (HP) turbine and a low-pressure (LP) turbine. The steam is first passed through the HP turbine which turns at up to 2,100 [...] rpm. The steam, largely depleted at this point, is then passed through a large conduit to the LP turbine. By the time it reaches the LP turbine, it has no more than 50 psi (300 kPa) of pressure left. The LP turbine increases efficiency and power by extracting the last little bit of energy from the steam. After leaving the LP turbine, the exhaust steam passes into a condenser and is then returned as feed water to the boilers. Water lost in the process is replaced by three evaporators, which can make a total of 60,000 US gallons per day (3 [...] liters per second) of fresh water. After the boilers have had their fill, the remaining fresh water is fed to the ship's potable water systems for drinking, showers, hand washing, cooking, etc. All of the urinals and {{all but one of}} the toilets on the Iowa class flush with saltwater in order to conserve fresh water. The turbines, especially the HP turbine, can turn at 2,000 rpm; their shafts drive through <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> that turns the propeller shafts at speeds up to 225 rpm, depending upon the desired speed of the ship. [...] The Iowas were to be outfitted with four screws: the outer pair consisting of two four-bladed propellers roughly [...] in diameter and the inboard screws that have five blades and are roughly [...] in diameter. The propeller designs were adopted after earlier testing had determined that propeller cavitation caused a drop in efficiency at speeds over [...] [...] The two inner shafts were housed in skegs to smooth the flow of water to the propellers and improve the structural strength of the stern. The engineering plant on Iowa and Missouri consisted of four General Electric cross-compound steam turbine engines, each driving a single shaft. The equivalent machinery on New Jersey and Wisconsin was provided by Westinghouse.|$|E
