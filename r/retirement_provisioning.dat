This methodological article focuses on {{the analysis of the}} impact of financial incentives on labour supply at ages 55 and more based on reduced forms of the original model proposed by Stock and Wise [1990]. The results are very sensitive to the way incentives are summed up in a single variable, and to the uncertainty linked to the eligibility to early <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> (the rigorous analysis of which would require a model of labour demand by firms). But they show strong evidence that behavioural effects may have a very large amplitude in countries, like France, whose <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> before the reforms strongly deviate from actuarial fairness. retirement, labour supply, actuarial fairness...|$|R

40|$|Generous early <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> {{account for}} a large {{proportion}} of the drop in the labour force participation of elderly workers. The aim of this paper is to provide a political-economic explanation of the wide spread adoption of early retirement. We suggest that the political support for generous early <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> relies on: (i) the existence of an initial, significant group of redundant elderly workers with incomplete working history, who are not entitled to an old age pension; and (ii) the policy persistence that this provision introduces by inducing low-ability workers to retire early. The majority which supports a social security system with early retirement in a bidimensional voting game is composed of elderly workers with incomplete working history and low-ability workers. A descriptive analysis of eleven OECD countries confirms the relevance of the initial group of redundant elderly workers. Early <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> were adopted during the deindustrialization process, almost always, immediately after the first severe decrease in industrial employment.

The prudential rules laid down in this Directive are intended both to guarantee a high degree of security for future pensioners through the imposition of stringent supervisory standards, and to clear the way for the efficient management of occupational pension schemes...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} (sequential) {{introduction}} of early <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> to Canada's two public pension plans. These reforms provide {{a unique opportunity}} to assess the effect of public pension plan parameters on labor supply behavior, free of the biases that potentially affect the simple time-series or cross-section inference presented in many previous studies. We find that the reforms led to an increase in pension receipt but had little immediate effect on labor market behavior. This {{is due to the fact}} that men who initially took advantage of the early <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> would otherwise have had limited labor market participation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on earlier work by the authors (Bateman and Piggott 1997, 1998), and {{provides}} an updated account of developments in Australia’s retirement policy reforms. A {{version of this paper}} is to appear in a book co-authored by Geoffrey Kingston. Financial support from the Australian Research Council is gratefully acknowledged. Formal <b>retirement</b> income <b>provision</b> in Australia can be traced back to occupational superannuation schemes first offered by banks and state governments in the 19 th century. However the year 1909 marks the beginning of a national retirement income policy with the introduction of a means-tested age pension. Since then <b>retirement</b> income <b>provision</b> has evolved into a multi pillar arrangement comprising the Age Pension, occupational superannuation and other long term saving through property, shares and managed funds. The 1990 s saw the introduction of private mandatory retirement saving in the form of the Superannuation Guarantee. With the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee, Australia joined a growing group of countries which centre their retirement income policy on private mandatory retirement saving. 1 Evolution of private mandating of <b>retirement</b> <b>provision</b> in Australi...|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} {{of older people}} in modern industrial society is markedly removed from the early industrial norm of continued participation in gainful employment {{until the end of}} life. Acceptance of a retirement age some 13 years before the end of average male life expectancy has brought with it serious social problems. At the same time, however, an increasingly productive economy has provided both the willingness and ability to complement the <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> of individual initiative with public programs of old age income maintenance. This public support began in Canada with the voluntary approach embodied in the government annuities plan. A program of “public assistance” followed. These were succeeded, first, by the “universal payment” under the Old Age Security Act and, more recently, by the social insurance approach of the Canada Pension Plan. Along with improved public support, the role of occupational pension plans and of individually initiated <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> continues to be substantial. Current interest in, and in some cases legislation on, such problems as vesting and solvency are leading to improvements in private pension programs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Retirement</b> <b>provision</b> is an {{important}} aspect of financial decision making that can influence the financial quality of life experienced by individuals in old age, regardless of their ethnic group. However, individuals belonging to the Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) group are more financially vulnerable in retirement than other groups, such as the White British. Previous research indicates that labour market disadvantages, low socio-economic status, and the inadequate access to financial resources are contributing factors that limit their ability to save effectively for retirement. This thesis investigates these issues further by examining the economic position of the BME group and the socio-cultural factors that positively influence or inhibit their <b>retirement</b> <b>provision.</b> This investigation is essential as many of the first generation of BME migrants, some of whom have provided migrant labour to the British economy since the Second World War, are entering the retirement stage, and are at a risk of financial difficulty due to low pension income. Although there are variations in the migration pattern and age structure of the BME group, individuals within this group are less likely to have occupational and private pension coverage. The term ‘BME group’ is used throughout this thesis to refer to individuals from African, Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds, since they represent the largest numbers of BME individuals in the UK. With increased individual responsibility for pension provision, this thesis explores the retirement phenomena of the BME group in three interrelated empirical chapters. The first empirical chapter uses secondary data to examine the labour market characteristics and income of the BME group at the aggregate level. With the access to retirement resources being significantly dependent on income and labour market position, these characteristics of the BME group are explored in relation to those of the White British group. The findings in this chapter substantiates much of the existing debate regarding the homogeneity of BME individuals based on their low level of income, under-representation in full-time employment and low levels of occupation. As a result, the ability of some BME individuals to save in the new workplace pension scheme may be compromised. The second empirical chapter uses secondary data to investigate further the socio-economic characteristics of the BME group at the dis-aggregated level. With limited research highlighting the relative importance of heterogeneity among BME sub-samples, the findings in the second chapter raises important implications in terms of the ability of some BME sub-samples to make <b>provisions</b> for their <b>retirement</b> given the significant levels of heterogeneity that exists in the socio-economic characteristics of the BME group. This indicates that stratified approaches to <b>retirement</b> <b>provision</b> may exist due to the possession of different levels of economic, social and cultural capital. The third empirical chapter utilises primary data to explore the retirement strategies of the five BME sub-samples at the dis-aggregated level. It provides an alternative perspective on the issues faced by the BME group and aids in further explanation of the findings in the two previous empirical chapters. The findings in the third chapter present new evidence in the form of various interrelated factors that inhibit the ability of BME individuals to make <b>provisions</b> for <b>retirement.</b> The findings presented throughout the thesis have generated {{a better understanding of the}} ways in which social structures and various forms of social, economic and cultural capital contribute to social stratification within the BME group, thus influencing their disposition towards certain <b>retirement</b> <b>provision.</b> The findings indicate that while some BME individuals have adequate <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions,</b> there are others who face financial difficulty in old age. By highlighting the socially constructed nature of ‘retirement provision’ and the economic, social and cultural factors inhibiting effective <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions,</b> from the perspective of the BME people, this thesis contributes to the ongoing debate regarding the characteristics and circumstances of BME individuals in the UK. Based on the findings presented, policy implementations may be developed to promote social inclusion, social equity and better retirement saving among this group...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a rising}} share of {{individuals}} spending {{at least some}} part of their working life abroad and acquiring pension rights. While the portability of pensions and other social benefits has received some analytical attention over the recent decade there is currently limited analytical guidance on the taxation of <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> within a country, and there is virtually none for the taxation of internationally portable pensions. For both national and international taxation of pensions, the actual taxation approaches are characterized by {{a high level of}} diversity, complexity and inconsistency within and across countries that risk harming labor mobility and creating fiscal unfairness. The proposed taxation approach for internationally portable pensions mixes notional front-loaded taxation (as the tax due on contributions/savings is deferred) with actual back-loaded taxation as the taxes are due when the benefits are disbursed (in source or residency country) or when accumulated savings effectively leave the country. This approach promises to establish broadly neutrality for international labor mobility decisions, fiscal fairness of tax revenue around <b>retirement</b> <b>provisions</b> between source and residency country, and bureaucratic efficiency, including a consistency with EU regulations and most double-taxation treaties...|$|R
