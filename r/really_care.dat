5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't <b>really</b> <b>care</b> because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the name came from a Pee-wee brand miniature harmonica and the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. Reubens thought the name Pee-wee Herman was a name that sounded too real to be made up, and like a real name a parent would give a child that they didn't <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about.|$|E

25|$|For Thích Trí Quang, Thiệu was {{a symbol}} of the Diệm era of Catholic domination, when {{advancement}} was based on religion. He had desired that General Thi, known for his pro-Buddhist position would lead the country, and denounced Thiệu for his alleged past crimes against Buddhists. The Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang said that “Thi is nominally a Buddhist, but does not <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about religion”.|$|E

500|$|According to Rockwell, {{who did not}} <b>really</b> <b>care</b> {{much for}} the work, the theme [...] "was based on a rather smug idea.

500|$|Prior to {{the game}} Hershiser {{explained}} why he wanted to win a World Series more than break the scoreless innings streak: [...] "You can break a record or win a Cy Young and go home and celebrate with your wife and friends, but after it's over there's {{only a few people}} that <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about it. But if you win a team thing, you've got 24 guys and all their families, all their friends, a whole city celebrating." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} were {{critical of the}} choice of setting. Though Lawrence claimed that it [...] "illustrated how good Pemberton and Shearsmith are at creating maximum tension on a minimal budget", others found that it interfered with their enjoyment of the episode. For Owen, it [...] "offered a definite production challenge that was made to look effortless ... but an appreciation of how well something was made isn't enough". Similarly, Lawrence felt that [...] "amid the karaoke din, {{it was hard to}} get a proper handle on the characters or, indeed, <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about their fates".|$|E

500|$|Producer Glen Schofield {{stated the}} biggest {{challenge}} the developers were facing was [...] "just trying to match the breathtaking {{look and feel of}} the movies". Similarly, Neil Young said [...] "We wanted to make something that's authentic and true to the movie. The people on our team <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about making a game that aspires to more than just a sequel, they want to make this equivalent to the movie experience itself." [...] EA Redwood Shores worked closely with New Line Cinema to make the games as authentic as possible, using the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props, lighting studies and motion capture data. EA's partner relations director, Nina Dobner said ...|$|E
500|$|... "Exposé" [...] was {{the fourteenth}} {{episode of the}} series {{directed}} by Stephen Williams, and the ninth written by the screenwriting duo Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Kitsis and Horowitz intended to make the episode an homage to film noir, with two con artists who did the [...] "perfect crime", that eventually goes wrong due to them getting stranded on the island. A reference to the genre was added by having Sawyer read Agatha Christie's Evil Under the Sun. A recurring theme is Nikki and Paulo's selfishness, which eventually leads to their deaths due to them being greedy and [...] "too focused on their own petty needs to <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about anyone else".|$|E
500|$|Exiled 1989 student leader Wang Dan {{said he was}} [...] "ecstatic". Human {{rights lawyer}} Li Heping called the award [...] "huge {{encouragement}} for the Chinese people... an affirmation {{that there are people}} around the world who <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about human rights and the legal system in China, that the world hasn't forgotten us." [...] He added that others, such as Gao Zhisheng, Chen Guangcheng, and Hu Jia, also deserved the prize. The Globe and Mail said that while many activists agreed he was worthy of the award, some radical reformers within Chinese democracy movement, such as Wei Jingsheng, see the moderate Liu as the wrong choice due to his advocacy of a gradual path to constitutional democracy in China.|$|E

500|$|Having been {{temporarily}} {{unable to}} begin production {{on the film}} for some time, due to De Laurentiis owning the rights, Lynch stopped actively pursuing Ronnie Rocket as a viability in the early 1990s. However, he has never officially abandoned the project; frequently referring to it in interviews as [...] "hibernating". The director has expressed interest in filming the project {{in the same manner}} as Eraserhead, using a small crew, building the sets himself and living on them during the length of the production. He has also claimed that he will revisit the film when he is at the stage in his career [...] "when I don't <b>really</b> <b>care</b> what happens, except that the film is finished".|$|E
500|$|Ian Dunn from One Giant Leap {{also wrote}} positively: [...] "The series has been amazingly gripping. The {{situation}} of the show allows it to be set just about anywhere, much like Doctor Who. The plot is enticing and you <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about the characters." [...] He also commented: [...] "One intriguing thing about the series so far {{is that some of}} the scenarios have been rather adult for a show broadcast at 6pm. One episode, set in a Roman world featured a scene in a sex dungeon. Another featured Cerberus doing what all dogs do (no matter how many heads they have) and urinate on a motorbike – well, half man-half motorbike." ...|$|E
500|$|Drea de Matteo, {{known for}} her role on The Sopranos, an HBO {{television}} series about the Italian-American Mafia, was immediately offered the role in July 2009. De Matteo {{did not know the}} character's name or storyline when she accepted the role. She acknowledged that the character was similar to her previous television roles and admitted that while she initially feared being typecast, she decided to accept the role. She explained, [...] "Now that I am old and don't <b>really</b> <b>care,</b> and remember how much fun I had playing that character — I'd rather be playing a character like that than some straight, normal, non-accented person." [...] The character's name was reported by several media outlets as Angie Vitale following the news of de Matteo's casting.|$|E

500|$|Another common {{criticism}} {{was that the}} book was aimed at fans of The Simpsons and not a general audience. A preview in People said the bottom line was that the book is [...] "for die-hard fans only." [...] Bacchus concurred, saying [...] "Cartwright writes {{as if she were}} speaking to devotees of The Simpsons Fan Club, too often providing bland tidbits of background that only obsessives would ever <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about." [...] Rob Sheridan of the National Post also believes that the book is [...] "aimed squarely at rabid Simpsons fans", and criticized the writing, commenting that [...] "the chronology of her story is sometimes muddled, and a lot of sentences have that first-draft feeling [...] But none of this is anything to have a cow about." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{murder of}} {{the heir to the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire and his wife {{produced}} widespread shock across European royal houses, and there was initially much sympathy for the Austrian position. Ordinary people did not <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about what happened, and on the evening of the assassination the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.. Within two days of the assassination, Austria-Hungary and Germany advised Serbia that it should open an investigation, but Secretary General to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Slavko Gruic, replied [...] "Nothing had been done so far and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government." [...] An angry exchange followed between the Austrian Chargé d'Affaires at Belgrade and Gruic.|$|E
500|$|Game Revolution's Eduardo Reboucas mainly {{criticized the}} story, stating that [...] "characters don't offer {{a lot of}} {{explanation}} and the little that is given seems more like a hastily put-together excuse to shoot up some fools and push some buttons on the way." [...] He also said {{that none of the}} conversation paths influence the game, giving no sense of closure or importance. Similarly, Maurice Tan of Destructoid criticized the ending sacrifice for lacking [...] "a good reason to <b>really</b> <b>care</b> about it", but still considered [...] "Arrival" [...] a worthwhile purchase due to its potential impact on Mass Effect 3. Despite the general criticism about the story, the pack's intense atmosphere has been highlighted, with Game Revolution noting that [...] "you'll never be bored by the visuals".|$|E
