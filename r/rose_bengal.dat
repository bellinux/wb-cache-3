40|$|Abstract Background Photothrombosis was {{introduced}} {{as a model}} of ischemic stroke by Watson et al. in 1985. In the present paper, we describe a protocol to induce photothrombotic infarcts in rats. Findings The photosensitive dye <b>Bengal</b> <b>Rose</b> is intravenously administered and a laser beam is stereotactically positioned onto the skull. Illumination through the intact skull leads to local activation of <b>Bengal</b> <b>Rose,</b> which results in free radical formation, disturbance of endothelial function and thrombus formation in illuminated small cortical vessels. Conclusions Photochemically induced infarcts cause long-term sensorimotor deficits, allow long-term survival and are particularly suitable to assess the effectiveness of neuroregenerative therapies in chronic stroke studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{different}} staining methods for the evaluation of sperm morphology by light microscopy and also to describe the morphometry of the entire sperm in collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu). Semen from 10 males was obtained by electroejaculation and evaluated for sperm motility, vigor, and concentration. Semen smears were prepared through three different staining methods: <b>Bengal</b> <b>rose,</b> brome-phenol blue, and eosin-nigrosin. Smears were evaluated under light microscopy and sperm morphologic alterations were determined in percentage. In addition, sperm morphometric analysis was conducted by light microscopy coupled to image analyzer software. The smears stained with <b>Bengal</b> <b>Rose</b> provide the best results for the visualization of the sperm tail, midpiece, and head. The use of eosin-nigrosin stain did not allow an adequate impregnation, and some sperm presented a few contrasts with the background. A higher incidence of bent coiled tails was verified in the use of brome-phenol blue staining (P< 0. 05). Through morphometric evaluation, it was observed that the tail occupies the greatest proportion (89 %) of the sperm which presents a discretely elongated head. According to the results, the use of the <b>Bengal</b> <b>Rose</b> stain is recommended for the morphologic evaluation of the collared peccary sperm...|$|R

This thesis should answer the question, {{if there is some}} difference in vascular density according to the distance from the lesion and if there is some diference between the vascular density in normal brain and the brain with the lesion. Materials and Methods: Cerebral ischemia was induced in P 7 rat pups with photothombic method. Intravenous administration of <b>bengal</b> <b>rose</b> dye was followed by illumination of beam of green laser over the cortex for 5 minutes at 0, 5 s on/off cycles. <b>Bengal</b> <b>rose</b> dye is potent photosensitive substance and the ilumination resulted in agregation of trombocytes and thrombosis.

40|$|Stable {{carbon and}} oxygen isotope ratios (δ 13 C and δ 18 O) of the epibenthic foraminiferan Elphidium macellum var. aculeatum were {{measured}} and compared both in raw aliquots and after various pre-analytical treatments.

We also assessed the effects of using preservatives (formaldehyde and ethanol) and stains (<b>Bengal</b> <b>Rose</b> and Sudan Black B) prior to δ 13 C and δ 18 O analyses. Although the effects were generally small, three of the pre-treatments {{had a significant effect}} on δ 13 C or δ 18 O values. The use of Sudan Black B for vital identification caused a significant enrichment in the 13 C of the samples (0. 24 ‰). In addition, sample oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and ultrasonic cleaning each led to a slight decrease in δ 18 O values (– 0. 18 ‰, in both cases). Our results demonstrate that Sudan Black B should be avoided prior to isotopic analysis. <b>Bengal</b> <b>Rose</b> showed no significant effect and should be used instead for staining. Because palaeoclimatic studies are based in small isotopic shifts, we discourage the pre-analysis use of unnecessary harsh cleaning treatments of foraminifera shell samples that may lead to isotopic fractionation and hence confound ecological interpretation.

40|$|Bambusa vulgaris var. vulgaris Schrader ex Wendland is {{a species}} of a great {{economic}} importance and in the conservation of soils. Nevertheless, little information exists on the microbial communities associated to its plantations, {{and their impact on}} the soil. For that reason it is necessary to identify the cultivable filamentous fungi to understand their roll and contribution to the development of this forest species and their impact in the environment. Considering these criteria the current work had as objectives to quantify, to characterize, to identify and to conserve filamentous fungi in soils cultivated with Bambusa vulgaris var. vulgaris Schrader ex.

Samples from three soils with plantations of Bambusa vulgaris var. vulgaris Schrader ex Wendland, yagruma (Cecropia peltata L.) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis L.) as well as soil without any crop, used as control, were collected for the microbiological analysis. Decimal dilutions of soil were done in <b>Rose</b> Agar <b>Bengal</b> culture medium for strain isolation. The cultural and morphologic characteristics were described.
