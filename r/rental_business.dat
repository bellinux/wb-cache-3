The company's primary goal was to supply software services to the oil and gas industries throughout Texas, but it was not very successful.

25|$|Thaksin and {{his wife}} began several {{businesses}} {{while he was still}} in the police, including a silk shop, a cinema, and an apartment building. All were failures and left him over 50 million baht in debt. In 1982, he established ICSI. Using his police contacts, he leased computers to government agencies with modest success. However, later ventures in security systems (SOS) and public bus radio services (Bus Sound) all failed. In April 1986, he founded Advanced Info Service (AIS), which started off as a computer <b>rental</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of assets in organisations today can be a challenging task and optimising their usage is critical to ensure maximum profit. For <b>rental</b> <b>businesses</b> offering tangible products efficient {{management of}} movable assets are {{an essential part of}} the business strategy. The main purpose of this study is to investigate how asset management and asset information management can be carried out in <b>rental</b> <b>businesses</b> and in what ways information technology can support it. By doing a literature review combined with a case study where three <b>rental</b> <b>businesses</b> and their use of information technology were examined we could identify several important aspects regarding asset information management. The results we have found is that <b>rental</b> <b>businesses</b> with a high degree of digitization in existing asset information management systems are able to rationalize existing work processes, which in some ways changes the roles of employees. Our research also shows that use of identification technologies may contribute to making organisations less dependent on personnel. The study concludes with some recommendations for further research. ...|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} days, the pointed G logo was used on two other {{subsidiary}} businesses. Firstly came the 'Red Arrow Television Rental' chain. During {{the days when}} many families preferred to rent their TV sets to offset poor reliability and changing fashions, this company fared well alongside the established 'heavy hitters' such as Radio Rentals. The company's opening promotion was to give every new customer a small, Hiawatha-style figurine to stand {{on top of their}} new TV set. Upon its success, the name was later changed to 'Granada TV Rental'. Based on the results of this company, Granada Television dipped its toes into the office furniture <b>rental</b> <b>business,</b> and carpet sales and fitting for larger business customers, with 'Black Arrow'. This business was less successful.|$|E

A Bicycle <b>Rental</b> <b>business</b> rents bikes by the hour nearby on the East side of Downtown. Oakland's Bicycle Master Plan, and Oakland's Measure DD park improvement plan for Lake Merritt calls for an automobile lane reduction and re-striping of bike lanes onto two of the district's streets: Lakeside Drive and Madison Street, and on nearby Webster and Franklin Streets, North of 14th Street. The plan also calls for the installation of a separated class one bikeway and multi-use trail immediately {{around the perimeter of}} Lake Merritt, and class two bicycle lanes on all arterial streets surrounding the lake, such as Grand Avenue, between Harrison and Macarthur, where a bike lane already exists, and on Lakeshore Boulevard, onto which a bicycle lane has been planned and contracted to be striped.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{what makes}} the flapamba’s {{characteristic}} sound is the tuning; for instance, the resonators are not tuned to the bars as in other standard keyboard percussion instruments. Renowned studio percussionist Emil Richards bought his original flapamba from Professional Drum Shop in Hollywood in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and added it to his giant instrument collection, the Emil Richards Collection. The staff at the store convinced him to buy it, as they told him that they were {{getting out of the}} percussion <b>rental</b> <b>business</b> since Emil was dominating much of the work in town. Emil couldn't find any info on the history or maker of the flapamba when he purchased it, but nevertheless he started using it on recording sessions, as the chromatic layout of the instrument made it an easy transition from other keyboard mallet instruments. He used the softest mallets possible or the meat of the fingers to get a warm, resonant, wooden sound. This original flapamba had a range from middle C (C4), up two full octaves.|$|E

500|$|When Citi Bike first launched, {{some local}} bike shops in tourist areas {{reported}} {{a decline in}} their bike <b>rental</b> <b>business,</b> and some complained that Citi Bike's advertising was misleading tourists. At least one bike shop owner {{said that he was}} forced to close down his business in 2014 due to the popularity of Citi Bike. Dorothy Rabinowitz of the Wall Street Journal said, {{a few days after the}} system opened, that under the [...] "autocratic" [...] mayoralty of Bill de Blasio, [...] "we now look at a city whose best cities are absolutely begrimed by these blazing blue Citibank bikes." [...] Some people disliked the bright blue color and branding of the bicycles, while others pointed out that the stations blocked fire hydrants on the street. The concrete wheel stops at the end of each kiosk also poses a hazard, as these barriers act as a sudden, sharp speed bump. Another complaint was that bike stations take up car parking space for each eight bikes, a sentiment repeated in future stall installations.|$|E
500|$|At age 18, Jackson {{and one of}} the boys, Phillip Storey, {{dropped out}} of {{university}} and became partners in an electronics business. They used their surname initials to form the company name: J Research Electronics Pty Limited. The partnership's largest customer, Roger Foley, doing business as Ellis D Fogg, a producer of psychedelic lighting effects, refused to write out the full company name and instead wrote JandS on his checks. The partners added an equipment rental company with the name JANDS Pty Limited, in response. After moving the company from Point Piper to Rose Bay, JANDS made [...] "whatever the hell they felt like", according to Jackson: lighting equipment, guitar amplifiers and public address system components such as column loudspeakers. He described how, with so many American servicemen stationed in Vietnam spending their recreation time in Sydney, Australian bands and clubs were doing well: [...] "the live music scene was jumping, and we were busy". JANDS' successful <b>rental</b> <b>business</b> paid for the design of new gear. After two years, Jackson and Storey quarrelled and the two decided to disband the company. They sold out to Paul Mulholland, David Mulholland and Eric Robinson, who were operating a small lighting company Jubillee Gaslight, on Sydney's north shore. Later, JANDS grew under Mulholland and Robinson to become Australia's largest sound and lighting company. [...] Jackson and Storey served as consultants to JANDS, from time to time.|$|E

The same study found the overall industry has declined {{at an annual rate}} of 14.8% over the five years to 2013. In addition to the obvious competition and threats to <b>rental</b> <b>businesses,</b> it also blamed recent developments from Pay TV and free-to-air television, both radically increasing their channel selections. Another impact stems from the reduced cost of DVD and Blu-ray discs, seeing the average 2013 price of a DVD settle at $16, compared to $20 in the early-2000s. This has acted as a double-edged sword for the industry, boosting the numbers of DVD sales, but also turning renters into buyers.|$|R
