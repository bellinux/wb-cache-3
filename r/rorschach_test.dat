40|$|Depression {{appeared}} {{to be one of}} the most frequent secondary psychic disturbances in the evolution of post-traumatic stress disorder and/or 'Post-concussional syndrom'. This depressive state begins almost always months or years after the trauma and gives significant characteristics on <b>Rorschach's</b> <b>test.</b> The influence of the trauma and the post-traumatic anxiodepressive repercussions were analysed in the <b>Rorschach's</b> <b>test</b> of 50 post-traumatic depressive patients.

25|$|The Exner scoring system, {{also known}} as the Rorschach Comprehensive System (RCS), is the {{standard}} method for interpreting the <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test.</b> It was developed in the 1960s by Dr. John E. Exner, as a more rigorous system of analysis. It has been extensively validated and shows high inter-rater reliability.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Krasner mostly {{concentrated}} on creating {{works on paper}} with gouache. These works were named either earth, water, seed, or hieroglyphics and often looked similar to a <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test.</b> Some scholars claim that these images were a critique of Greenberg's theory {{about the importance of}} the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.|$|E
50|$|As {{time went}} on, other psychologists created tests that {{exemplified}} Freud's idea of free association including Rorschach's Inkblot Test and The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) by Christina Morgan and Henry of Harvard University. Although <b>Rorschach's</b> <b>test</b> has been met with significant criticism over the years, the TAT is still used today, especially with children.|$|R
5000|$|... "Illusory correlation" [...] was {{originally}} coined by Chapman and Chapman (1967) to describe people's tendencies to overestimate relationships between two groups when distinctive and unusual information is presented. [...] The concept {{was used to}} question claims about objective knowledge in clinical psychology through the Chapmans' refutation of many clinicians' widely used Wheeler signs for homosexuality in <b>Rorschach</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
40|$|Ward (1985) {{investigated}} {{individual differences}} in the tendency to process stimulus dimensions {{in a manner that}} is either primarily separable or integral. He employed a restricted classification task that allows participants to classify items on the basis of component dimensions (separable perception) or overall similarity (integral perception) The purpose of the present study was to examine the relations between integral-separable perception and the responses on the <b>Rorschach</b> inkblot <b>test.</b> In this experiment, sixty-eight students in the nurses' training school were given the <b>Rorschach</b> inkblot <b>test</b> and then showed the category generalization task of schematic girls with five dimensions varying in two values and they were required to classify the test exemplars. The results showed that individuals who attempted whole responses on the <b>Rorschach</b> inkblot <b>test</b> gave more separable responses in the category generalization task than did individuals who attempted part responses. There was no relation between integral-separable perception in the category generalization task and reflection-impulsivity on the <b>Rorschach</b> inkblot <b>test...</b>|$|R
25|$|Projective tests assume {{personality}} is primarily unconscious and assess individuals by how {{they respond to}} an ambiguous stimulus, such as an ink blot. Projective tests have been in use for about 60 years {{and continue to be}} used today. Examples of such tests include the <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test</b> and the Thematic Apperception Test.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, the women recalled bouts of physical and mental abuse that they had experienced while working in military brothels. In the <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test,</b> the women showed distorted perceptions, difficulty in managing emotional reactions and internalized anger. A 2011 clinical study found that comfort women are more prone to showing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), even 60 {{years after the end of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test</b> is {{appropriate}} for subjects {{from the age of}} five to adulthood. The administrator and subject typically sit next to each other at a table, with the administrator slightly behind the subject. Side-by-side seating of the examiner and the subject is used to reduce any effects of inadvertent cues from the examiner to the subject. In other words, side-by-side seating mitigates the possibility that the examiner will accidentally influence the subject's responses.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to assess the homeless’ characteristics in Montevideo, pointing out in their capacity to link with the community. Given the capabilities and functioning framework developed by Amartya Sen, we analyze the multidimensionality poverty and the social exclusion. Even if these individuals share {{the fact that they have}} slept at least one night during the winter in a homeless’ shelter, there are many differences in their functionings. We carried out a survey in a representative day in the winter of 2005, with socio economic questions, and also we implement a <b>Rorschach’s</b> <b>test.</b> The main results are: even if their income is below to the poverty line, they do not present high levels of extreme poverty respect to their income. They have extremely weak primary affective links and many difficulties to have a job.

25|$|From a legal standpoint, the <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test</b> {{images have}} been in the public domain for many years in most countries, {{particularly}} those with a copyright term of up to 70 years post mortem auctoris. They {{have been in}} the public domain in Hermann Rorschach's native Switzerland since 1992 (70 years after the author's death, or 50 years after the cut-off date of 1942), according to Swiss copyright law. They are also in the public domain under United States copyright law where all works published before 1923 are considered to be in the public domain. This means that the Rorschach images may be used by anyone for any purpose. William Poundstone was, perhaps, first to make them public in his 1983 book Big Secrets, where he also described the method of administering the test.|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{has also}} been {{featured}} {{in the media and}} popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test,</b> an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, [...] "Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test</b> of the evolution of women in our society." [...] She {{has been the subject of}} many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers. Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her, including but not limited to [...] "The Hillary Shimmy Song", which went viral.|$|E
500|$|The {{museum is}} the subject of The Final Member, a film by Canadian documentarians Zach Math and Jonah Bekhor. It {{profiles}} Sigurður and his quest to obtain a human penis for the museum, telling the story of the American and Icelandic donors and examining the quasi-taboo nature of the museum's collection. Bekhor says: [...] "I wouldn't say it's a <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test,</b> but depending on how you react to it really says a lot about what your relationship is with that element of the human anatomy. It's a really interesting phenomenon and we're really curious to see how audiences respond." [...] The film premiered on 1 May 2012 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.|$|E
50|$|Exner's name {{is famous}} {{because of his}} work on the <b>Rorschach</b> inkblot <b>test.</b> He was {{executive}} director of Rorschach Workshops in Asheville, North Carolina. For more than three decades he focused on the Rorschach and developed a standardized system for its interpretation. His Exner system of scoring, formally known as the Comprehensive System, was first published in 1974 and is now the standard method in psychology for administering, scoring and interpreting the Rorschach inkblot test.Through his work, the <b>Rorschach</b> inkblot <b>test</b> became a more useful psychometric instrument.|$|R
2500|$|Some skeptics {{consider}} the <b>Rorschach</b> inkblot <b>test</b> pseudoscience, as several studies suggested that conclusions reached by test administrators since the 1950s were akin to cold reading. [...] In the 1959 edition of Mental Measurement Yearbook, Lee Cronbach (former President of the Psychometric Society and American Psychological Association) is quoted in a review: [...] "The test has repeatedly failed as a prediction of practical criteria. [...] There {{is nothing in}} the literature to encourage reliance on Rorschach interpretations." [...] In addition, major reviewer Raymond J. McCall writes (p.154): [...] "Though tens of thousands of <b>Rorschach</b> <b>tests</b> have been administered by hundreds of trained professionals since that time (of a previous review), and while many relationships to personality dynamics and behavior have been hypothesized, the vast majority of these relationships have never been validated empirically, despite the appearance of more than 2,000 publications about the test." [...] A moratorium on its use was called for in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Tony {{thinks that}} the {{painting}} in Melfi's waiting room is a Horshack <b>test,</b> confusing the <b>Rorschach</b> inkblot <b>test</b> with Arnold Horshack, a character from the TV series Welcome Back, Kotter.|$|R
500|$|For example, in June 1979, {{an unknown}} benefactor under the {{pseudonym}} [...] "R. C. Christian" [...] {{had a huge}} granite megalith built in the U.S. state of Georgia, which acts like a compass, calendar, and clock. A message comprising ten guides is inscribed on the occult structure in many languages to serve as instructions for survivors of a doomsday event to establish a more enlightened and sustainable civilization than the one which was destroyed. The [...] "Georgia Guidestones" [...] have subsequently become a spiritual and political <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test</b> onto which any number of ideas can be imposed. Some New Agers and neo-pagans revere it as a ley-line power nexus while a few conspiracy theorists are convinced that they are engraved with the New World Order's anti-Christian [...] "Ten Commandments." [...] Should the Guidestones survive for centuries as their creators intended, many more meanings could arise, equally unrelated to the designer’s original intention.|$|E
500|$|A masked vigilante who {{continues}} his extralegal activities {{after they are}} outlawed. He takes his name from the <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test,</b> as the shifting black-and-white patterns on his mask resemble its inkblots. Unlike the other principal actors, Haley had read the comic as a young adult and was keen to pursue the role when he heard {{he had become a}} favorite candidate among fans. Rorschach wears a mask with ink blots: motion capture markers were put on the contours of Haley's blank mask, for animators to create his ever-changing expressions. [...] Haley has a black belt in kenpō, but described Rorschach's attack patterns as sloppier and more aggressive due to the character's boxing background. Rorschach appears several times in the movie without his mask before he is apprehended, carrying a placard sign proclaiming, [...] "The End is Nigh," [...] but not until he is unmasked by the police is it made apparent that the sign bearer is Rorschach.|$|E

50|$|First, she {{contacted}} Bruno Klopfer, {{an expert}} on <b>Rorschach</b> <b>tests,</b> {{to see if he}} would be able to identify the sexual orientation of people through their results at those tests. His ability to differentiate between the two groups was no better than chance. Then Edwin Shneidman, creator of the MAPS test, also analyzed the 60 profiles. It took him six months and he, too, found that both groups were highly similar in their psychological make-up. The third expert was Dr Mortimer Mayer, who was so certain {{he would be able to}} tell the two groups apart that he went through the process twice.|$|R
50|$|His {{early work}} focused on {{psychological}} testing. Melvin Belli called upon {{him as an}} expert witness for Jack Ruby, Lee Harvey Oswald's killer, whom he diagnosed as suffering organic brain damage that most likely involved psychomotor epilepsy. His first publications were on diagnostic psychological testing and included the very influential Psychoanalytic Interpretation in <b>Rorschach</b> <b>Testing</b> (1954). He later wrote on psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in works including Aspects of Internalization (1968), A New Language for Psychoanalysis (1976), The Analytic Attitude (1983), Retelling a Life (1992), The Contemporary Kleinians of London (1997), Bad Feelings (2003), Insight and Interpretation (2003), and Tragic Knots in Psychoanalysis (2009).|$|R

2500|$|During World War II, United States Army Medical Corps chief {{psychiatrist}} Dr. Douglas Kelley and [...] psychologist Gustave Gilbert {{administered the}} <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test</b> to the 22 defendants in the Nazi leadership group {{prior to the}} first Nuremberg trials.|$|E
2500|$|On September 9, 2008, Hogrefe {{attempted}} to claim copyright over the Rorschach ink blots during filings of {{a complaint with}} the World Intellectual Property Organization against the Brazilian psychologist Ney Limonge. [...] These complaints were denied. [...] Further complaints were sent to two other websites that contained information similar to the <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test</b> in May 2009 by legal firm Schluep and Degen of Switzerland.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{examples}} included {{their ability}} to make digital clocks stop working properly (Edwards {{put it in a}} microwave oven for a few seconds), or make images appear on film just by staring at the camera (Shaw spat on the lens). In an example of a sort of <b>Rorschach</b> <b>test,</b> the experimenters later described the images as being various bits of the female anatomy, which, [...] "of course", young men (such as Shaw and Edwards) would be interested in.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{languages}} {{that we use}} {{in daily}} conversation inevitably omit or insert various words. Incomplete sentences such as these may be grammatically correct, but they prevent machine translation systems from correctly interpreting such sentences as they assume meanings only from sentence-to-sentence context. This {{is largely due to}} the fact that context is a social product defined by the participants of a party, while translation machines literally translate the information provided by the speakers. The authors of this paper confirmed the effectiveness of syntactic constraint-lead approaches to Collaborative Fusion Machine Translation (CFMT) based on group <b>Rorschach</b> <b>tests,</b> in addition to semantic constraint-lead and syntactic constraint-lead machine translation processes...|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, at Harvard Medical School a {{team led}} by Louis Lasagna lead the first known {{experiment}} to detect placebo responders. In this experiment approximately 162 postoperative patients were observed for significant pain relief from subcutaneous injections of placebo and morphine. Differences in response and attitude were exhibited between placebo responders and non-placebo responders. [...] "Using <b>Rorschach</b> <b>tests</b> and qualitative interviews, responders, compared to non-responders, were more anxious, self-centered, viewed the hospital care as 'wonderful', had more somatic symptoms, used more cathartics, were 'talkers and were regular church goers.". Overall, this initial study on placebo responders versus non-responders outlined the initial yet unstudied effects of the placebo within the placebo study.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976 Harrower {{published}} a notable article {{based on the}} examination of records of <b>Rorschach</b> <b>tests</b> administered to Nazi war criminals immediately after the Second World War. She found {{that they did not}} show any common personality type, and that some appeared to be psychologically normal. Based on this conclusion, she cautioned that [...] "well-integrated, productive and secure personalities are no protection against being sucked into a vortex of myth and deception, which may ultimately erupt into the commitment of horror on a grand scale". This research led to her collaboration on a book published in 1995 entitled The Quest for the Nazi Personality: A Psychological Investigation of Nazi War Criminals.|$|R
