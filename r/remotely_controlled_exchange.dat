50|$|Military {{usage of}} <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> {{military}} vehicles {{dates back to}} the first half of 20th century. John Hays Hammond, Jr., invented and patented methods for wireless control of ships starting in 1910. Soviet Red Army used <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> teletanks during the 1930s in the Winter War and early stage of World War II. There were also <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> cutters and experimental <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> planes in the Red Army.|$|R
40|$|Our {{thesis is}} that a {{networked}} public display/kiosk system, that provides information for a local community, functions best when it is decentralized and interactive. We deployed such a system at MIT that has two aspects, DomeView for distributed decentralized display and content distribution, and PhoneView for enhanced user consumption of that content. PhoneView is an implementation that we propose to solve {{a number of issues}} with current interactive public kiosk deployments, as well as enables scenarios of enhanced interactions. By using the Hands-Free Bluetooth profile {{as the basis for the}} communication between a mobile phone and a kiosk, we provide an enhanced personalized interaction for all passersby with Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones, without requiring the installation of custom software. Some examples include the ability to <b>remotely</b> <b>control</b> a kiosk, <b>exchange</b> calendar and contact data with the kiosk, and play games on a kiosk with other users via one's mobile phone. By removing the software installation barrier and providing new mechanisms of public interaction, this implementation is ripe for wide-spread and immediate adoption across multiple public kiosk platforms. by Harel M.

50|$|<b>Remotely</b> <b>Controlled</b> Eagle (Yao-Kong Lao-Ying, 遥控老鹰) is a Chinese UAV {{developed}} by Chinese Aviation Museum. The existence of <b>Remotely</b> <b>Controlled</b> Eagle was revealed in September 2011 when it won an innovation award in Beijing, where AVIC held a competition for UAVs. <b>Remotely</b> <b>Controlled</b> Eagle has conventional layout with a two-blade propeller {{driven by a}} tractor engine mounted in the nose, and the entire UAV shaped like a rapter, prompting some internet Chinese claims that {{it is designed to}} drive off birds near airport for airport safety. In contrast to most UAVs which has solid structure, <b>Remotely</b> <b>Controlled</b> Eagle utilizes fabric for wing and empennage.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Red Army used <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> teletanks {{during the}} 1930s in the Winter War against Finland and fielded {{at least two}} teletank battalions at the {{beginning}} of the Great Patriotic War. A teletank is controlled by radio from a control tank at a distance of 500-1,500 m, the two constituting a telemechanical group. There were also <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> cutters and experimental <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> planes in the Red Army. In the 1930s, the United Kingdom developed the radio-controlled Queen Bee, a <b>remotely</b> <b>controlled</b> unmanned Tiger Moth aircraft for a fleet's gunnery firing practice. The Queen Bee was superseded by the similarly named Queen Wasp, a purpose-built, target aircraft of higher performance.|$|R
