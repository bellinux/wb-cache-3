5|$|One of {{his most}} famous poems, Jubilate Agno, was not {{published}} until 1939, by William Force Stead. In 1943, lines from this poem were set to music by Benjamin Britten with the translated title <b>Rejoice</b> <b>in</b> the Lamb.|$|E
5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They <b>rejoice</b> <b>in</b> dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E
5|$|The credits appear over a {{flashback}} to a Christmas dinner {{where all the}} Scoobies are present, having a typical lighthearted conversation as Joyce and Buffy discuss a pie that drops on the floor. The scene snaps back to Buffy in the living room, shaking Joyce and screaming at her. She calls for an ambulance and attempts CPR, accidentally snapping a rib in the process, but to no avail. Buffy calls Giles. The paramedics arrive and work on Joyce and she revives, the paramedics declare it a miracle in the ambulance, and Joyce, Buffy, and Dawn <b>rejoice</b> <b>in</b> the hospital. The scene snaps back {{to the living room}} where the paramedics continue to work on Joyce until they stop and tell Buffy that Joyce is dead. They leave, and Buffy goes into the hall and vomits. Giles arrives and Buffy tells him not to move the body, shocking herself by using that word.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eighth}} season, it is {{revealed}} that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy test is negative, {{in order to achieve}} Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them <b>rejoice</b> <b>in</b> the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E

25|$|Eminent British hymnologist Erik Routley (born 31 October 1917; died 1982) so disliked {{both the}} hymn and its melody, {{he wrote a}} new text, “O Mighty God” and re-harmonised the Swedish tune in 1982. This {{was one of his}} last works before his death. His {{translation}} was included as hymn 466 in <b>Rejoice</b> <b>in</b> the Lord: A Hymn Companion to the Scriptures (1985).|$|E

25|$|The 1920s were {{a time of}} {{expansion}} for the developing university. The campus grew to include its first single-purpose academic building, Canevin Hall, {{as well as a}} gymnasium and a central heating plant. Institutionally, the school grew to include the School of Pharmacy in 1925, a School of Music in 1926, and a School of Education in 1929. In 1928 the university celebrated its fiftieth anniversary and was able to <b>rejoice</b> <b>in</b> {{the fact that it was}} now both financially solvent and enrollment had reached an all-time high. Hard times, however, came with the Wall Street Crash of 1929; plans for expansion had to be shelved.|$|E
25|$|A {{burial ground}} known as 'God's Acre', {{surrounded}} by quickset hedges, {{was established in}} front of the church beyond a row of gardens. The congregation provided small uniform gravestones which lay flat on the earth, bearing only the name and age of the departed as an expression of the equality of brothers and sisters. Initially, men and women were buried separately in a post mortem continuation of the choir system. The sundial in the graveyard bore the motto, 'I die today, I live tomorrow'. Mourning was not encouraged and corpses were led to the grave by a choir of brass instruments and the minister. At a sunrise service on Easter Sunday the congregation met in God's Acre to <b>rejoice</b> <b>in</b> the Resurrection. This remains the custom of the Moravian Church.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Heaven in Islam differs {{in many respects}} to the concept in Judaism and Christianity. Heaven is {{described}} primarily in physical terms {{as a place where}} every wish is immediately fulfilled when asked. Islamic texts describe immortal life in Heaven as happy, without negative emotions. Those who dwell in Heaven are said to wear costly apparel, partake in exquisite banquets, and recline on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones. Inhabitants will <b>rejoice</b> <b>in</b> the company of their parents, spouses, and children. In Islam if one's good deeds outweigh one's sins then one may gain entrance to Heaven. Conversely, if one's sins outweigh their good deeds they are sent to hell. The more good deeds one has performed the higher the level of Heaven one is directed to. It has been said that the lowest level of Heaven, the first one, is already over one-hundred times better than the greatest life on Earth. The highest level is the seventh Heaven. Houses are built by angels for the occupants using solid gold.|$|E

500|$|The organist Alan Harverson {{describes}} it as [...] "excellent" [...] and notes its [...] "orthodox layout and textures", {{in comparison to the}} organ writing of <b>Rejoice</b> <b>in</b> the Lamb and the Festival Te Deum (1944). He regards the Prelude as [...] "concise and majestic" [...] and describes the ending as [...] "touchingly serene" [...] with a [...] "charming canon". The musicologist and Britten expert Philip Brett describes the piece (without naming it) in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians as a [...] "slight organ work".|$|E
500|$|This {{reveals that}} there is a {{struggle}} between the acceptance of imaginative experience that exists only within {{a small part of the}} mind. This struggle, according to Walter Evert, has [...] "no relevance to the world of external action and perhaps no truth to offer even the visionary dreamer himself." [...] However Anthony Hecht looks at the problem in a different way and believes that there must be a connection between the external and internal worlds for the narrator to even face the problem. Regardless, the narrator never states that this worship of Psyche or embracing the imagination would aid mankind, but the poem does <b>rejoice</b> <b>in</b> exercising the imagination.|$|E

These are still in use through bell-ropes, which have been replaced {{several times in the}} intervening centuries and extend down to the floor next to the clock mechanism, which is dated 1898 and is wholly mechanical, powering a clock whose two faces can be seen on both the western and eastern sides of the bell tower.|$|E
500|$|Upon leaving asylum, Smart {{took the}} manuscripts of A Song to David, many {{translations}} of Psalms, and Jubilate Agno. A Song to David was published on 6 April 1763. Harsh reviews followed which mocked Smart's {{time in the}} asylum instead {{of dealing with the}} poems. Jubilate Agno stayed in manuscript form and passed {{into the hands of the}} friends of William Cowper, a poet also placed into asylum and Smart's contemporary, when they investigated the concept of [...] "madness". The work stayed in private holdings until it was rediscovered in the 20th century by William Stead.

Judge Colin Lamont ruled that Malema's singing of the song in a post-apartheid South Africa was [...] "derogatory, dehumanising and hurtful" [...] to the Afrikaner minority group. Lamont said [...] "People must develop new customs and <b>rejoice</b> <b>in</b> a developing society by giving up old practices which are hurtful to members who live in that society with them." ...|$|E
