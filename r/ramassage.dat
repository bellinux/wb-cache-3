25|$|This {{downward}} trend {{has been demonstrated}} by the conflicts between various agencies and levels of government. This has allowed wood traders to shop for export clearance among the authorities that regulate it. As {{a result of this}} bribery to open periodic trade windows, large-scale exports of illegal precious woods clear customs without much difficulty. Because of the incredibly lucrative nature of recent trades, reports have indicated that government officials have significantly increased the price of export certificates to make more money for themselves. This however has not stopped exporters from re-using single-use export certificates for two or three containers of rosewood. Furthermore, some of the certificates and authorizations from various government agencies bear titles found nowhere in any legal text, such as permis de <b>ramassage</b> and permis de carbonisation (collection permit and carbonization permit respectively). Such authorizations are not supported by and clearly conflict with Malagasy law.|$|E

5000|$|The {{son of a}} {{naval officer}} he studied at the [...] "Tour d'Auvergne" [...] school in Quimper. Mobilized during the 1914-1918 war he then studied {{painting}} under Théophile Deyrolle at Concarneau. He was also influenced by Lucien Simon. He had little love of abstract painting concentrating on figurative works many depicting scenes {{of life in the}} [...] "Pays Bigouden" [...] and the area around Cap Sizun (Baie de Douarnenez, la baie d'Audierne, la Pointe du Raz.etc.). He painted the Breton pardons, scenes at the port and people collecting seaweed ("Le <b>ramassage</b> du goémon"). From 1923 to 1948 he worked as the registrar of Pont-Croix but continued to paint and was a leading figure in the Quimper intellectual and artistic community during these years, his friends including Jean Moulin and Max Jacob. Floch was anti-militarist, anti-clerical and anti-Gaullist. He executed portraits of both Jacob and Moulin, who both died {{at the hands of the}} Germans. Moulin died on a train on the way to a concentration camp in Germany and Jacob died at the Drancy camp awaiting deportation. In 1927, Floch showed his works at the Saluden Gallery in Brest. He then exhibited there regularly, and at the Lécuyer Gallery in Quimper. He also exhibited regularly at the French Artists Salon and in the Autumn Salon. He was subsequently transferred as the registrar of Grasse and Chinon until finally retiring to Quimper in 1958 where he was to spend the rest of his life. In his final years he had a change of mind and became interested in abstract painting.|$|E
40|$|L'OBJECTIF FINAL DE CETTE ETUDE EST DE DETERMINER ET DE LOCALISER DES REGIONS CHROMOSOMIQUES IMPLIQUEES DANS LA DIRECTION ET/OU LE DEGRE DE LATERALITE MANUELLE CHEZ L'HUMAIN. DEUX PARTIES LA CONSTITUENT : LA PREMIERE CONSISTE A AFFINER LA DESCRIPTION ET LA MESURE DU PHENOTYPE DE LA LATERALITE, LA SECONDE EST UNE ETUDE GENETIQUE DE LA LATERALITE. DANS LA PREMIERE PARTIE, UNE ETUDE SUR LA MESURE DE LA LATERALITE EST MENEE AVEC 262 PARTICIPANTS (159 SE DECLARANT DROITIERS, 78 GAUCHERS ET 25 AMBIDEXTRES). QUATRE EPREUVES DE MESURE DE LA LATERALITE SONT UTILISEES : EPREUVE DE <b>RAMASSAGE</b> DE CARTES (D'APRES BISHOP ET AL., 1996), EPREUVE DE DEPLACEMENT DE CHEVILLES (ANNETT, 1985), EPREUVE DU PURDUE PEGBOARD (TIFFIN, 1948) ET UN QUESTIONNAIRE DE PREFERENCE MANUELLE D'ANNETT (1985). LES RESULTATS SONT LES SUIVANTS : 1) LES QUALITES METRIQUES DES OUTILS SONT SATISFAISANTES; 2) UNE ANALYSE LATTICIELLE DU QUESTIONNAIRE MET EN EVIDENCE UNE STRUCTURE DE LA PREFERENCE MANUELLE TRES DIFFERENTE CHEZ LES DROITIERS ET CHEZ LES GAUCHERS; 3) LES STRUCTURES DE PREFERENCE ET DE PERFORMANCE MANUELLE SONT INTERNES A LA POPULATION DANS LAQUELLE ELLES SONT ETABLIES; 4) PERFORMANCE ET PREFERENCE MANUELLES SONT DEUX COMPOSANTES DIFFERENTES, MAIS COMPLEMENTAIRES ET INDISPENSABLES A L'ETABLISSEMENT D'UN PROFIL DE LATERALITE. EN SECONDE PARTIE, UNE ETUDE GENETIQUE EST MENEE AVEC 94 FAMILLES INFORMATIVES DE GAUCHERS, SELECTIONNEES SUR LE CRITERE SUIVANT : IL EXISTE AU MOINS DEUX GAUCHERS OU AMBIDEXTRES DECLARES, POSSEDANT 50 % DE PATRIMOINE GENETIQUE EN COMMUN, SUR UNE OU SUR DEUX GENERATIONS. L'ETUDE FAMILIALE MONTRE L'EXISTENCE D'UNE GRANDE RESSEMBLANCE PERE / ENFANT POUR LE DEGRE DE LATERALITE. L'ETUDE GENETIQUE (ANALYSE DE L'ADN) INCLUT 53 FAMILLES. QUATRE STSS BALISANT LA REGION HOMOLOGUE DES CHROMOSOMES X ET Y ONT ETE UTILISES : UN LIEN AVEC LE DEGRE DE LATERALITE AU NIVEAU DU MARQUEUR DXS 1203 EST APPARU MAIS MERITE D'ETRE CONFIRME AVEC UN ECHANTILLON PLUS LARGE DE FAMILLES.
