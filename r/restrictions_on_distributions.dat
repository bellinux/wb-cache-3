40|$|We {{examine whether}} state laws impact {{the use of}} debt {{covenants}} by using a sample of U. S. public bond issues from 1987 to 2004. We consider variation in state laws {{with respect to the}} minimum asset-to-debt ratio necessary for a payout and with respect to antitakeover statutes. We find that firms incorporated in states with stricter <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>distributions</b> are less likely to include debt covenants that constrain payouts, limit additional debt, or restrict the sale of assets. Thus, state payout restrictions appear to be a substitute for the use of these debt covenants. On the other hand, firms incorporated in states with stronger antitakeover statutes are somewhat more likely to use debt covenants. This finding is consistent with the notion that firms with antitakeover protection are more likely to suffer from agency problems and, thus, are more likely to use debt covenants to minimize agency costs.

40|$|This paper derives the {{appropriate}} characterization of asset market equilibrium when asset prices follow jump-diffusion processes, and develops the general methodology for pricing options on such assets. Specific <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>distributions</b> and preferences are imposed, yielding a tractable option pricing model that is valid even when jump risk is systematic and non-diversifiable. The dynamic hedging strategies justifying the option pricing model are described. Comparisons are made throughout {{the paper to}} the analogous problem of pricing options under stochastic volatility. - 1 -It is a truism that asset pricing models in general require restrictions on preferences and on technologies or distributions in order to derive characterizations of equilibrium. The option pricing methodology developed by Black and Scholes (1973) is unique in that distributional assumptions alone suffice to generate well-specified option pricing formulas involving mostly observable variables and parameters. The key distributional assumption is {{that the price of}} the asset on which the option is written follows a diffusion, the instantaneous variance of which depends at most upon the asset price and time. An additional distributional assumption of perhaps secondary importance for the short option maturitie...|$|E
40|$|After {{more than}} eighty years of {{sustained}} attention, the master problem of U. S. corporate law—the separation of ownership and control—has mostly been brought under control. This resolution has occurred more through changes in market and corporate practices than through {{changes in the}} law. This Article explores how corporate law and practice are adapting to the new shareholder-centric reality that has emerged. Because solving the shareholder–manager agency cost problem aggravates shareholder–creditor agency costs, I focus on implications for creditors. After considering how debt contracts, compensation arrangements, and governance structures can work together to limit shareholder–creditor agency costs, I turn to available legal doctrines that can respond to opportunistic behavior that slips through the cracks: fraudulent conveyance law, <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>distributions</b> to shareholders, and fiduciary duties. To sharpen the analysis, I analyze two controversies that pit shareholders against creditors: a hypothetical failed LBO, and the attempts by shareholders of Dynegy Inc. to divert value from creditors through the manipulation of a complex group structure. I then consider some legal implications of a shareholder-centric system, including the importance of comparative corporate law, the challenges {{to the development of}} fiduciary duties posed by the awkward divided architecture of U. S. corporate law, the challenges for Delaware in adjudicating shareholder-creditor disputes, and the potential value of reinvigorating the traditional 2 ̆ 2 entity 2 ̆ 2 conception of the corporation in orienting managers and directors...|$|E

40|$|When {{one wants}} to {{estimate}} a model without specifying the functions and distributions parametrically, or when {{one wants to}} analyze the identification of a model independently of any particular parametric specification, {{it is useful to}} perform a nonparametric analysis of identification. This chapter presents some of the recent results on the identification of nonparametric econometric models. It considers identification in models that are additive in unobservable random terms and in models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms. Single equation models as well as models with a system of equations are studied. Among the latter, special attention is given to structural models whose reduced forms are triangular in the unobservable random terms, and to simultaneous equations, where the reduced forms are functions of all the unobservable variables in the system. The chapter first presents some general identification results for single-equation models that are additive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that possess and index structure, simultaneous equations nonadditive in unobservable random terms, and discrete choice models. Then, particular ways of achieving identification are considered. These include making use of conditional independence restrictions, marginal independence restrictions, shape restrictions on functions, shape <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>distributions,</b> and restrictions in both functions and distributions. The objective is to provide insight into some of the recent techniques that have been developed recently, rather than on presenting a complete survey of the literature. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{strive for}} tighter control of distribution, quality and price - has led an {{increasing}} number of producers to include <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> the use of online marketplaces in their selective distribution agreements.

While acknowledging the legitimacy of proportionate <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>distribution,</b> the article illustrates how an absolute ban on the use of online marketplaces may have a detrimental effect on market transparency, price competition, entry and expansion. The discussion illustrates how the legitimate interests of producers may be protected through less onerous means, without the increase in consumers’ search costs and the dampening of price competition. With that in mind, it is argued that these restrictions should be analysed on a case-by-case basis and should not benefit from the Vertical Block Exemption. Furthermore, the article considers whether absent proportionality and objective justification, the harmful effect of online marketplace bans, justifies their condemnation as anticompetitive by object...|$|R

To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that modified versions, as a whole, had to be distributed under the terms in GPLv1.

However, software distributed under GPLv1 could not be combined with software distributed under a more restrictive license, as this would conflict with the requirement that the whole be distributable under the terms of GPLv1.|$|R

These results are compared to the exact analytic results showing that reasonable accuracy is achieved through simulation. The complexity of the Rainbow Net does not increase as the number of processors increases, but remains constant, unlike a Markov model which expands exponentially. The constancy is achieved by using tokens with identity attributes (items) that can have additional attributes associated with them (features) which can exist in multiple states. The time to perform the simulation increases, but this is a polynomial increase rather than exponential.
