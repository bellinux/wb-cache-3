40|$|Ceramic-matrix {{composites}} (CMC's) {{consisting of}} a silicon carbide matrix reinforced with boron-nitride- (BN-) coated silicon carbide (SiC) fibers are strong contenders for commercial and aerospace applications (in particular, the hot sections of high-performance turbine engines in advanced aircraft and generators). They have very good mechanical properties below approximately 600 C and above approximately 1000 C. Between those temperatures, however, the BN coating oxidizes easily, and the oxidation of the SiC matrix is too sluggish to seal off the composite with a protective layer of silica. In that temperature interval, the preferential oxidation of the BN weakens and embrittles the composite. That phenomenon, referred to as "pest" degradation, {{is the focus of}} this work, which aims to identify the causes of and remedies for pesting. Previous work established that pesting in Hi-Nicalon (Nippon Carbon Co., Ltd., Japan) /SiC composites was caused by a layer of free carbon that undermined the oxidation resistance of the BN. New work suggests that composites containing a source of carbon are prone to severe pesting and that those that are free of elemental carbon are resistant pesting. Pest resistance was assessed by exposing machined samples for 100 to 150 hr in an atmospheric burner rig at 600 to 1100 C, followed by a tensile fracture test to measure residual mechanical properties and by characterization of the interphase microstructure. Whether the elemental carbon came from intrinsic or extrinsic sources, its presence induced the tensile strength to drop by over 50 percent in the burner rig, with an even more severe loss of fracture strain. A likely mechanism by which burnoff of the carbon layer exposes the BN to accelerated flank attack by ambient oxidants is shown. The BN is replaced with borosilicates that attack the fiber, and ultimately with silica that embrittles the composites by <b>rigidly</b> <b>bonding</b> components. Thus, the study has shown that pesting can be prevented in SiC/BN/SiC, or at least reduced, by simply excluding free carbon. These studies continue, and plans for future work include investigating the role that carbon may play elsewhere in the interphase region...|$|R

For strongly angled molecules, we find that steric repulsion alone provides the driving force for a smectic-C phase, even without intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new paradigm}} for modeling proteins in interactive computer graphics systems [...] continual maintenance of a physically valid representation, combined with direct user control and visualization. This is achieved by a fast algorithm for energy minimization, capable of real-time performance on all atoms of a small protein, plus graphically specified user tugs. The modeling system, called Sculpt, <b>rigidly</b> constrains <b>bond</b> lengths, bond angles, and planar groups (similar to existing interactive modeling programs), while it applies elastic restraints to minimize the potential energy due to torsions, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals and electrostatic interactions (similar to existing batch minimization programs), and user-specified springs. The graphical interface can show bad and/or favorable contacts, and individual energy terms can be turned on or off to determine their effects and interactions. Sculpt finds a local minimum of the total energy that satisfies all the constraints using an augmented Lagrange-multiplier method; calculation time increases only linearly {{with the number of}} atoms because the matrix of constraint gradients is sparse and banded. On a 100 -MHz MIPS R 4000 processor (Silicon Graphics Indigo), Sculpt achieves 11 updates per second on a 20 -residue fragment and 2 updates per second on an 80 -residue protein, using all atoms except non-H-bonding hydrogens, and without electrostatic interactions. Applications of Sculpt are described: to reverse the direction of bundle packing in a designed 4 -helix bundle protein, to fold up a 2 -stranded beta-ribbon into an approximate beta-barrel, and to design the sequence and conformation of a 30 -residue peptide that mimics one partner of a protein subunit interaction. Computer models that are both interactive and physically realistic (within the limitations of a given force field) have 2 significant advantages: (1) they make feasible the modeling of very large changes (such as needed for de novo design), and (2) they help the user understand how different energy terms interact to stabilize a given conformation. The Sculpt paradigm combines many of the best features of interactive graphical modeling, energy minimization, and actual physical models, and we propose it as an especially productive way to use current and future increases in computer speed...|$|R

40|$|In the {{development}} of solid oxide fuel cells, the components most in need ofimprovement are still the sealants. Over the last decade, several types of sealants havebeen investigated for use under high temperatures, such as compressive, compliant,and <b>rigidly</b> <b>bonded</b> seals. Of these three types, <b>rigidly</b> <b>bonded</b> glass-ceramic seals arethe most promising. Their properties can be tailored to match the requirements of SOFCsealants. These include the coefficient of thermal expansion, joining temperature,crystallization behavior, electrical insulation, and gas-tightness. Nevertheless, in thepast, the developed sealant compositions failed to demonstrate sufficient mechanicalstrength. This property is extremely important to avoid catastrophic failure of the rigidseals during SOFC operation. Additionally, {{there is a lack}} of standardized methods tocharacterize the mechanical strength of joined components in the research community. This makes it difficult to rely on the results of the state of art measurements, toreproduce them, and indeed to compare them. In order to improve the mechanical strength of glass-ceramic sealants, this workproposes reinforcing the glass-ceramic sealant with different metallic and ceramicparticles. A new concept of laminate sealant, known as a multilayer design, wasdeveloped in an attempt to combine the properties of two types of composites in onejoint. In addition, three possible methods for mechanical strength characterization weredeveloped. The reinforcement concept is mainly based on adding fillers to the glass matrixnamed “ 87 ”, which is a composition from the system BaO-CaO-SiO 2. The chosen fillerswere metallic particles including nickel (Ni), nickel-chromium (NiCr) (80 - 20), copper(Cu), and silver (Ag), as well as ceramic fillers such as gadolinium-doped ceria (CGO) particles and yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) particles or fibers. These materials weretested in different weight concentrations in the glass matrix to form the composites. Thisapproach showed that adding filler materials (metallic or ceramic) improved themechanical strength values. The multilayer design was also proven to be effective incombining the properties of two different composite layers in one joint.

The system is analyzed by employing a self-consistent field theory, which treats the short and long range interactions of the counterions within different approximations. We find that in the weak coupling limit, the interactions are only repulsive. In the intermediate coupling regime, the multivalent rod-like counterions can mediate attractive interactions between the surfaces. For sufficiently long rods, bridging contributes to the attractive interaction. In the strong coupling limit, the charge correlations {{can contribute to the}} attractive interactions at short separations between the charged surfaces.

We attribute the increase in tan(theta_c(nu_d)) to the enhanced stability of dimers on the surface, which reduces the density of monomers {{that need to be}} accomodated in the most stable surface traps.

At this minimum frequency the group velocity vanishes, whereas the phase velocity remains finite. The energy deposited by the laser pulse, generates a local vibration of the plate. This vibration is detected {{at the same point}} by an optical interferometer. The spatial resolution is limited by the laser source diameter, i. e. to approximately twice the plate thickness. First experiments show the ability to detect a 1. 5 -µm deep corroded area on the back side of a 0. 5 mm thick Duralumin plate.

A high power Nd:YAG laser was used to actuate the metal plate (non-contact), and the frequency content of the resulting displacement signal was analysed to identify the flexural modes. The non-axisymmetric modes, which are conventionally disregarded because of their unfavourable acoustic properties, were also taken into account. There was excellent agreement between the experimental results and the FE simulation data.

Conventional liquid depth gauges do not have the capability to operate under extreme high pressure (i. e., exceeding 300 psi). An ultrasonic depth gauge capable of withstanding high pressure according to the present invention is comprised of a transducer assembly and a supporting electronics unit. The former is mounted in to the bottom wall of a storage vessel with its resonating surface directly exposed to the highly pressurized liquid in the vessel. In operation, the ultrasonic pulse propagates upward through the liquid to the liquid-gas interface in the storage vessel. When the ultrasonic echo returns from the liquid-gas interface, it re-excites the composite resonator into vibration. The supporting electronics unit measures the round-trip transmit time for the ultrasonic pulse and its return echo to traverse the depth of the highly pressurized liquid.

40|$|AbstractA unified {{approach}} for approximating the adhesive stresses in a bond {{line of a}} tapered bonded joint or doubler is delineated {{within the framework of}} a geometrically nonlinear analysis. The approach follows the Goland–Reissner solution method for a single-lap joint and involves a two-step analysis procedure. The approach also allows for the analysis of a tapered bonded joint and doubler with non-identical adherends. In the first step of the procedure, the two adherends are assumed to be <b>rigidly</b> <b>bonded,</b> and the nonlinear moment distribution along the joint is determined. Since the bending moment solution in this step is simple, it will be derived in closed-form using elementary functions. In the second step analysis, only the overlapped area of the joint is considered with the nonlinear bending moments obtained from the first step {{at the end of the}} overlap prescribed as one of its boundary conditions. This latter problem is then solved by using the multi-segment method of integration [Kalnins, A., 1964. Analysis of shell of revolutions subjected to symmetrical and non-symmetrical loads.

As with linear chains, {{there are two different}} crossover regimes: (i) crossover from the Gaussian chain to the Kuhnian chain limit, where the penetration function Psi (f) increases monotonically with increasing polymer molecular weight,and (ii) crossover from the rigid-rod to the Kuhnian chain limit,where the penetration function decreases with increasing molecular weight. We propose a phenomenological approach for the extension of our previous crossover theory for linear polymers to star polymers. We show that the theoretical crossover function obtained earlier by Douglas and Freed [Macromolecules 16, 1854 (1984) ] fails to reproduce the simulation data for the penetration function with f {{greater than or equal to}} 6, while the phenomenological crossover model is in good agreement with the simulation data up to f less than or equal to 41.

The enantiomeric excess (ee) varied with template coverage, reaching a maximum of 31 %. Templating the surface using 2 -methylbutanoate, where the chiral center is identical {{to that in the}} 2 -butoxide species, but is now anchored to the surface by a carboxylate rather than an alkoxide linkage, shows no enantiospecificity. The enantioselectivity is restored when the methyl group is replaced by an amine group, where a maximum ee value of 27 % is found. DFT calculations and infrared measurements suggest that the structures of the butyl group on the surface are similar for both 2 -butoxide and 2 -methylbutanoate species, implying that gross conformational changes are not responsible for differences in chemisorptive enantioselectivity. There is no clear correlation between the location of the chiral center and enantioselectivity, suggesting that differences in the template adsorption site are also not responsible for the lack of enantioselectivity.
