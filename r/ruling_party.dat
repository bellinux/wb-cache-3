5|$|Approximately 27,000 Boer {{women and}} {{children}} died in British concentration camps, resulting in a long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners.

Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

Castillo Armas became affiliated with a party named the Movimiento de Liberación Nacional (MLN), which remained the <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> of Guatemala from 1954 to 1957. It was led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, and was a coalition of municipal politicians, bureaucrats, coffee planters, {{and members of the}} military, all of whom were opposed to the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution.

Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, in which the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was the <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> and the Communist Party of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater civil rights and the decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E
5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. The main reason was that the police was {{under the control of}} the governor and the government was looking for an opportunity to harass the executive. Another probable reason was that the striking workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|E

While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling communist parties around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with <b>ruling</b> <b>parties</b> of one-party states (whatever their ideology), dominant parties in democratic systems (whatever their ideology), and social democratic parties.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} lobbying activities across international borders, on determining each country 9 ̆ 2 s import tariff in a multi-principal, multi-agent, menu-auction model. Cross-border political donations could promote international policy cooperation because of two of their distinctive characteristics. First, special interest groups use cross-border donations as tools to wield their influence on <b>ruling</b> <b>parties</b> of other countries directly, which promotes efficiency of policy formation. Second, for <b>ruling</b> <b>parties</b> of countries, cross-border donations make them {{take into account the}} impact of their policy on other countries, which makes them more sensitive to other countries 9 ̆ 2 welfare and, therefore, more cooperative with others.

5|$|The {{three major}} Armenian {{political}} {{parties of the}} late 19th century and early 20th century — the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun), Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchak) and Armenakan Party (later Ramgavar) were present in America not too long after their foundation. They established their own newspapers: Hairenik and Asbarez by Dashnaks and Baikar by Ramgavars. After the Bolsheviks took over Armenia in 1920, Rmagavars and Hunchaks formed a coalition supporting Soviet Armenia, while the ARF, the <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> of the Republic of Armenia from 1918 to 1920, remained anti-Soviet in the diaspora. The 1988 Spitak earthquake and the Karabakh movement brought the separate groups of the Armenian community together.|$|E

5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's <b>ruling</b> <b>party)</b> to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> and socialist state.|$|E
5|$|As the {{economic}} situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues.

During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.|$|E
5|$|Results {{showed that}} Golkar, the former <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> of the New Order era led by People's Representative Council Speaker Akbar Tanjung, {{had won the}} largest number of seats, {{defeating}} President Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI–P). Golkar received more votes than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results occurred because of declining PDI–P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar's popularity. Golkar's support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due to the performance of medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI–P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah devastated the island province's economy.|$|E
