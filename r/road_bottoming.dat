50|$|Pennsylvania Route 465 (PA 465) is a 6.64 mi {{state highway}} located in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. The {{southern}} terminus is at PA 174 in Mooredale. The northern terminus is at PA 641 outside of Carlisle. PA 464 heads northeast from PA 174 along Walnut <b>Bottom</b> <b>Road,</b> passing through farmland. The route reaches developed {{areas on the}} western edge of Carlisle and turns north onto Allen Road, intersecting Interstate 81 (I-81) and U.S. Route 11 (US 11) before ending at PA 641. Walnut <b>Bottom</b> <b>Road</b> became part of US 11 and PA 13 in 1926, with the latter designation removed two years later.

50|$|The {{extension}} of the freeway portion of SR-255 to SR-53 cut in half two feeder <b>roads,</b> Blake <b>Bottom</b> <b>Road</b> and Dan Tibbs Road, which provide access to numerous subdivisions in northwestern Huntsville. This has created a traffic bottleneck in the afternoon, as traffic going from northbound SR-255 to these roads has to take the SR-53 ramp and then make a U-turn at the interchange {{to get to the}} frontage road intersections on the southbound side. Accordingly, a plan has been published for an overpass at Blake <b>Bottom</b> <b>Road</b> to provide access from the northbound side of SR-255. However, in 2012 the Alabama DOT informed the city of Huntsville that the state will not pay for this project. The city is studying whether it can build the interchange independently.|$|R
