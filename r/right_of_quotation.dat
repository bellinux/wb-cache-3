40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} {{quotation}} is not primarily a linguistic phenomenon. Linguistic productions are essentially symbolic (in Peirce’s sense), whereas quotations, in essence, are iconic. They are therefore best treated as ‘demonstrations’ (Clark & Gerrig 1990; Clark 1996; Recanati 2001). As a consequence, any purely semantic {{account of the}} meaning <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> {{is bound to be}} not only incomplete but flawed in key respects. Any sound theory <b>of</b> <b>quotation</b> must be a pragmatic one at heart, with semantics playing only an ancillary role. Since most existing accounts <b>of</b> <b>quotation</b> are fundamentally semantic, they are also necessarily deficient, and therefore unsuitable as general, comprehensive theories <b>of</b> <b>quotation.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{experimental}} study which targets prosodic correlates <b>of</b> subclausal <b>quotation</b> marks. We found that written sentences containing passages enclosed by quotation marks were read aloud in a manner that significantly differs in prosody from spoken realizations of corresponding disquoted counterparts. However, we also observed that such prosodic marking <b>of</b> subclausal <b>quotation</b> wasn’t strong enough to survive subsequent back-translation into written language: there was no correlation between the presence/absence <b>of</b> <b>quotation</b> marks in the original written examples, and the presence/absence <b>of</b> <b>quotation</b> marks in corresponding back-translations from oral renditions.

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the way the seven {{selected}} writings of the Apostolic Fathers quote the texts of the Bible. Beginning with discussion of the term "Apostolic Fathers", the thesis turns to explaining the key expressions used in the next chapters, namely Quotation, Composite Quotation, Allusion, Paraphrase, Scriptural Language, Exemplum. The second part, the principal part of the thesis, contains close analysis <b>of</b> the <b>quotations</b> within the selected writings. Attention is also paid to the question, which books of the Bible were quoted by the individual authors, whereas the investigation concentrates primarily on how the quotations are used. For the purpose of unbiased comparison of the single writings' citation technique, the total number <b>of</b> <b>quotations,</b> the length <b>of</b> all <b>quotations</b> in total and the length of each writing was enumerated, the length of the writing being expressed in the count of standard pages. In this way, two significant quantities were achieved, namely proportional bulk <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> in the writing and quotation frequency expressed in the number <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> per standard page. Besides these figures, attention was paid also to the role <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> in individual writings with regard to their genres.
