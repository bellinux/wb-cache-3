40|$|This study {{examined}} the attitudes of children with typical development towards an unfamiliar peer with complex communication needs using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. Specifically, the study aimed to compare attitudes when the peer used mobile technology (i. e., iPad 1 ©) with an AAC-specific application (Proloquo 2 Go 2 ™) versus a lowtechnology communication board. A within-group crossover design was utilized involving 78 children. Half of the participants (i. e., Group 1) viewed Video 1 of an unfamiliar peer with complex communication needs in a scripted communication interaction using an iPad with Proloquo 2 Go followed by Video 2 of the same interaction using a communication board. The {{other half of the}} participants (Group 2) viewed these videos in the reverse sequence. The Communication Aid/Device Attitudinal Questionnaire (CADAQ) was completed after watching each video. Results indicated that both groups attitudes were more positive towards Video 1 (iPad with Prologuo 2 Go) on certain dimensions of the CADAQ. The results are discussed and recommendations for future research provided.

We use the same instrument setup that {{is used for the}} determination of Ra- 223 and Ra- 224. In contrast to methods published earlier, the approach does not require a modification of the counting equipment, counting separately for Ra- 226, or waiting for radioactive equilibrium. We show that the calibration works from as low as 10 dpm (0. 166 Bq) per sample, up to more than 1000 dpm (16. 7 Bq). Although uncertainties are larger (typically around 10 %) than reported uncertainties for gamma counting, liquid scintillation, or mass spectrometry at comparable activities, the simple setup, low cost, and robustness of the method make it a useful approach for underway measurements, combinations with short-lived radium isotopes, or monitoring purposes when limited funding or infrastructure is available...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: tumours {{was linked}} to the {{inherited}} familial cancer syndrome von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease over six decades ago. Subsequently, other shared genetic causes of predisposition to renal tumours and to phaeochromocytoma (PC), paraganglioma (PGL) or head and neck paraganglioma (HNPGL) have been described but case series of non-VHL-related cases of renal tumour and phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma tumour association syndrome (RAPTAS), are rare. Objective: To determine the clinical and molecular features of non-VHL RAPTAS by literature review and characterisation of a novel case series. Design: A review of the literature was performed and a retrospective study of referrals for investigation of genetic causes of RAPTAS. Results: Literature review revealed evidence of an association, in addition to VHL disease, between germline mutations in SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, TMEM 127 and MAX genes and RAPTAS (herein defined as the co-occurrence of tumours from both classes (PC/PGL/HNPGL and renal tumours) in the same individual or in first degree relatives). In both the literature review and our case series of 22 probands with non-VHL RAPTAS SDHB mutations were the most frequent cause of non-VHL RAPTAS. A genetic cause was identified in (36. 3 %, 8 / 22) of kindreds Conclusion: Renal tumours and PC/PGL/HNPGL tumours share common molecular features and their co-occurrence in an individual or family should prompt genetic investigations. We report, to our knowledge, the first known case of MAX-associated RCC and confirm the role of TMEM 127 mutations with RCC predisposition.

40|$|In the {{changing}} higher education landscape, with higher fees {{and a very}} competitive market, there is increasing focus on student feedback {{as a means for}} driving institutional development and facilitating student choice. This is alongside growing interest on the student experience, and ways of meaningfully engaging with the student voice for the benefit of educational enhancement. In this presentation I will explore the potential of working with students in new ways to promote learning and teaching enrichment. I will argue that working in partnership with students provides exciting opportunities for educational innovation, and keeps the student experience at the heart of pedagogic activity. The University of Northampton has been running a scheme called URB@N (Undergraduate <b>Research</b> <b>Bursaries</b> @ Northampton) since 2008, where students are employed as researchers to work on a pedagogical research project alongside a member of staff. The scheme has grown in popularity and lead to an expansion of pedagogic research across the university.

Human-induced {{climate change is}} causing rapid melting of ice in many volcanically active regions. Over glacial-interglacial time scales changes in surface loading exerted by large variations in glacier size affect the rates of volcanic activity. Numerical models suggest that smaller changes in ice volume over shorter time scales may also influence rates of mantle melt generation. However, this effect has not been verified in the geological record. Furthermore, the time lag between climatic forcing and a resultant change {{in the frequency of}} volcanic eruptions is unknown. We present empirical evidence that the frequency of volcanic eruptions in Iceland was affected by glacial extent, modulated by climate, on multicentennial time scales during the Holocene. We examine the frequency of volcanic ash deposition over northern Europe and compare this with Icelandic eruptions. We identify a period of markedly reduced volcanic activity centered on 5. 5 - 4. 5 ka that was preceded by a major change in atmospheric circulation patterns, expressed in the North Atlantic as a deepening of the Icelandic Low, favoring glacial advance on Iceland. We calculate an apparent time lag of ~ 600 yr between the climate event and change in eruption frequency. Given the time lag identified here, increase in volcanic eruptions due to ongoing deglaciation {{since the end of the}} Little Ice Age may not become apparent for hundreds of years.

40|$|I {{attempt to}} {{identify}} a causal link between the outsourcing of parts of the production process and firm productivity for a large panel of Irish man-ufacturing firms. Outsourcing is taken to mean the procurement of inputs from outside {{the boundaries of the}} firm, with international outsourcing be-ing outsourcing from a foreign provider. Theory suggests that as firms out-source more ‘non-core ’ activities to specialized providers, productivity will increase along two channels: in the short-run, the firm will benefit from cheaper or higher-quality inputs, while in the medium term the firm will be able to reallocate resources towards higher value-added activities. The international outsourcing case adds another dimension, in that firms that oursource from abroad can experience further productivity gains from the higher quality and variety of inputs on offer and from exposure to new technologies, practices and knowledge. I test the above hypothesis using a ‘System GMM ’ estimator as developed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) to control for endogeneity in the panel and allow for a lagged dependent variable to be a regressor. I find that international outsourcing leads to productivity gains, but upon closer inspection that the international orietnation of firms matters. Domestic market-serving firms do not experience gains from outsourcing in any form. I also find that foreign firms in Ireland do not benefit from domestic outsourcing, which is a cause for concern and a legitimate policy target. ∗I acknowledge financial support of an SFI postgraduate scholarship and a Forfas productivity <b>research</b> <b>bursary</b> 2008 †I thank Ciara Whelan for supervision of this paper, and Vincent Hogan and Matthew Gobey for helpful comments ‡I thank the Central Statistics Office and their staff for access to, and help with, the data...|$|E

It {{was carried out in}} August/September 2005 before my final year (masters) at the University of York. The project was to implement a prototype motion tracking system in C++ and then compare this version with a Hume [4] implementation. This report describes the implementation of a mean-shift tracking algorithm (as described by D. Comaniciu, V. Ramesh and P. Meer [1]) in C++, three Hume implementations and comparisons between the four. The three Hume implementations that were developed are; a list-recursion based version, vector based without recursion and an entirely box-based approach. The methodologies to convert the algorithm between these approaches are also detailed, as is benchmark data illustrating the performance differences between the approaches. A mean-shift tracker was chosen, as it is a simple tracker to understand, yet shows good results {{on a wide variety of}} test data. It is also computationally inexpensive compared to other trackers, and does not require any time-consuming tuning of parameters, as there is no motion or sensor model. How does it Work? What does it do? All of the four versions of the code implement a mean-shift tracker. The input is an image sequence, and an initial position of a target to track, and the output is a track of the target over the image sequence.

40|$|The {{potential}} of dietary nitrate to reduce enteric methane, apart from {{it being a}} source of rumen-degradable nitrogen, has stimulated further research into its use. However, not much has been reported on its suitability in feed treatment. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of urea or nitrate and two methods of non-protein nitrogen (NPN) application (anaerobic pre-treatment versus direct supplementation) to Eragrostis curvula hay, on its in vitro fermentation. An iso-nitrogenous level of NPN (7 g nitrogen/kg feed dry matter (DM)) from either urea or calcium nitrate was used to pre-treat hay by subjecting it to 30 days’ anaerobic storage in airtight bottles, or by direct supplementation; each diet having three replicates. Hay samples were dried, milled, and evaluated for in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), and in vitro gas and methane production, while rumen fluid was analysed for pH, ammonia nitrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Compared with the untreated hay (control), under both methods of application NPN generally did not increase 48 -hour gas production, but did increase the IVOMD of E. curvula hay. However, pre-treatment of E. curvula hay improved IVOMD more than supplementation. Urea inclusion enhanced digestibility more than nitrate, and the urea pre-treatment was more effective than supplementation. In contrast, nitrate inclusion significantly reduced methane production compared with urea and the control, and supplementation of nitrate was more effective in reducing methane than pre-treatment with nitrate. Pre-treatment with nitrate as supplementation increased digestibility and reduced enteric methane emission, indicating the {{potential of}} using nitrate as a hydrolytic agent in feed treatment.

40|$|Secretions from tergal glands {{are part}} of a queen’s pheromonal control of worker {{reproduction}} in honey bees. However, in queenless honey bee colonies, workers compete to gain pheromonal, and hence reproductive dominance, over nestmates with ontogenetic changes in their glandular secretions that affect the behavioral or physiological responses of other individuals. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we investigated {{for the first time the}} age-dependent changes in tergal gland secretions of queenless workers of the clonal lineage of Apis mellifera capensis and workers of A. m. scutellata. The reproductive status of honey bee workers was determined by recording the presence of spermathecae and the level of ovarian activation. The tergal gland chemicals identified in both A. m. scutellata workers and A. m. capensis clone workers were oleic acid, n-tricosene, n-pentacosene, and n-heptacosene, with three additional compounds, palmitic acid, n-heneicosene, and n-nonacosene, in A. m. capensis clones. We report ethyl esters as new compounds from honey bee worker tergal gland profiles; these compounds increased in amount with age. All A. m. capensis clone workers dissected had spermathecae and showed ovarian activation from day 4, while ovarian activation only started on day 7 for A. m. scutellata workers that had no spermathecae. Tergal gland secretions were present in higher quantities in bees with activated, rather than inactive ovaries. This suggests that tergal gland secretions from reproductive workers could act as releaser and primer pheromones in synergy with other glandular compounds to achieve pheromonal and reproductive dominance.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that differences in the effectiveness of spatial frequencies for fast and slow skilled adult readers may be an important component of differences in reading ability in the skilled adult reading population (Jordan et al., 2016 a). But the precise nature of this influence on lexical processing during reading remains to be fully determined. Accordingly, to gain more insight into the use of spatial frequencies by skilled adult readers with fast and slow reading abilities, the present study looked at effects of spatial frequencies on the processing of specific target words in sentences. These target words were of either high or low lexical frequency and each sentence was displayed as normal or filtered to contain only very low, low, medium, high, or very high spatial frequencies. Eye movement behavior for target words was closest to normal for each reading ability when text was shown in medium or higher spatial frequency displays, although reading occurred for all spatial frequencies. Moreover, typical word frequency effects (the processing advantage for words with higher lexical frequencies) were observed for each reading ability across a broad range of spatial frequencies, indicating that many different spatial frequencies provide access to lexical representations during textual reading for both fast and slow skilled adult readers. Crucially, however, target word fixations were fewer and shorter for fast readers than for slow readers for all display types, and this advantage for fast readers appeared to be similar for normal, medium, high, and very high spatial frequencies but larger for low and very low spatial frequencies. Therefore, although fast and slow skilled adult readers can both use a broad range of spatial frequencies when reading, fast readers make more effective use of these spatial frequencies, and especially those that are lower, when processing the identities of words.

40|$|Adult non-formal {{education}} and training (NFET) in South Africa was adopted in 1990 {{to address the problem}} of unemployment of non-educated and unskilled adults. Public and private NFET centres aim to meet the training needs of adults who were deprived of formal education that would foster access to opportunities for employment. The paper reports on a study conducted to investigate what constitutes NFET enabling environments for employment. The paper focuses on the approach of training delivery fostering labour market entry of graduates. The findings show that individual trainees who participated in private centres had a higher probability of being employed because of the creation of internal enabling environments for skills acquisition and focus on income-generating activities. The authors conclude that an integration of technical skills with business skills and ‘learning by earning’ is a potential training delivery approach enabling graduates to participate in economic activities.

40|$|Improvement in {{the water}} {{stability}} and other related functional properties of thin (< 50 µm) karirin protein films was investigated. Thin conventional kafirin films and kafirin microparticle films were prepared by casting in acetic acid solution. Thin kafirin films cast from microparticles were more stable in water than conventional cast kafirin films. Treatment of kafirin microparticles with heat and transglutaminase resulted in slightly thicker films with reduced tensile strength. In contrast, glutaraldehyde treatment resulted in up to a 43 % increase in film tensile strength. The films prepared from microparticles treated with glutaraldehyde treatment were quite stable in ambient temperature water, despite the loss of plasticizer. This was {{probably due to the}} formation of convalent crosslinking between free amino groups if the kafirin polypeptides and carbonyl groups of the aldehyde. Thus, such thin glutaraldehyde-treated kafirin microparticle films appear to have good potential for use as biomaterials in aqueous applications. J. O.

40|$|McCulloch (2009) {{has argued}} for a reconceptualisation of the student role, where contested discourses of {{students}} as ‘customers’ are replaced by notions of students as ‘co-producers’. Positioning students as active co-producers of knowledge recognises the valuable contribution that both staff and students can make {{to the process of}} learning and knowledge construction. This promotes collaborative relationships between staff and students (Neary & Winn, 2009), and mirrors the increasing interest in partnerships, where staff and students can work together {{in a variety of ways}} to facilitate educational change (Little, 2011). Building on this principle, this paper presents a particular form of staff-student partnership coordinated by the University of Northampton, involving students collaborating with staff members on educational projects designed to impact on learning and teaching practice. Undergraduate <b>Research</b> <b>Bursaries</b> at Northampton (URB@N) involves undergraduate students working with staff as co-researchers on pedagogic research projects. Now in its fifth iteration, the scheme has grown and developed and is now an embedded part of learning and teaching innovation at the institution. Over 60 pedagogic research projects have taken place since URB@N began, with nearly 70 students working as paid researchers during this period. Annual feedback from staff and students provides growing evidence of the notable benefits afforded to those involved. However, there have also been challenges encountered along the way, which have informed the ongoing development of the scheme. This paper reports on my experience of participating in, and coordinating, the URB@N scheme. I will explain its origins; underpinning principles; and operational process. I will also draw on the annual feedback that has been collected from staff and students in order to explore the particular benefits afforded by URB@N, including enhanced employability skills; research skills; authentic access to the student voice; new staff-student relationships; and the promotion of pedagogic research at the institution. I will also consider some of the challenges that have been encountered, including quality assurance; levels of student skill and expertise; and barriers to real ‘partnership’ working between students and staff. My aim is to facilitate a short discussion – encouraging input from colleagues in the audience – in order to unpack some of these issues and consider possible ways forward. Through a collaborative discussion about URB@N, colleagues will have the opportunity to explore the potential of similar schemes in their own institution, and also contribute to ongoing discussions about staff-student partnerships, and how they can be effectively nurtured (Little, 2011). ...|$|R

BACKGROUND: Iron-sulfur (FeS) {{proteins}} are present in all living organisms and play important roles in electron transport and metalloenzyme catalysis. The maturation of FeS proteins in eukaryotes is an essential function of mitochondria, but little is known about this process in amitochondriate eukaryotes. Here we report on the identification and analysis of two genes encoding critical FeS cluster (Isc) biosynthetic proteins from the amitochondriate human pathogen Entamoeba histolytica. RESULTS: E. histolytica IscU and IscS were found to contain all features considered essential for their biological activity, including amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor binding. The IscU protein differs significantly from other eukaryotic homologs and resembles the long type isoforms encountered in some bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses of E. histolytica IscS and IscU showed a close relationship with homologs from Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, to the exclusion of mitochondrial isoforms. CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial-type FeS cluster assembly genes of E. histolytica suggest their lateral acquisition from epsilon proteobacteria. This is a clear example of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from eubacteria to unicellular eukaryotic organisms, a phenomenon known to contribute significantly to the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. We wish to thank Drs Salvador Carranza (University of Barcelona, Spain) and David S. Horner (University of Milan, Italy) for advice and help with the phylogenetic analyses and Dr. Hermie Harmsen (University of Groningen, The Netherlands) for compiling a list of gut bacteria currently being sequenced.

40|$|The authors set up {{parallel}} {{projects to}} evaluate student experiences of current Open Educational Resources (OERs) used for supporting undergraduate law students. One {{carried out the}} study at a large public university, while the other at a small private higher education institution. The former study received funding from HEFCE for an undergraduate <b>research</b> <b>bursary</b> and the undergraduate researcher facilitated focus groups with her peers. Using students as researchers in this way not only develops the student researcher but also advances research in learning and teaching because it “contributes to a growing community of pedagogic practice centred on the student voice. ” (Butcher and Maunder, 2014, 142). The latter study involved the tutor facilitating focus groups with his students and this research compares and contrasts these two methodologies to evaluate how effective practitioner research can be in capturing the student voice (Campbell and Groundwater-Smith, 2007). The data from these focus groups has been analysed (Williams, 2017; Cartwright, 2017) and there are substantial overlaps between the experiences of these two cohorts and similar strengths and areas for improvement were identified. Based {{on the findings of}} these two studies one author secured HEFCE funding for a project to develop new OERs to support and enhance face-to-face teaching. These resources are dynamic and combine video content with interactive activities and will be hosted on a streaming law TV channel. Reflecting student feedback (Williams, 2017) the resources will sit outside of specific modules at programme level and will be accessible throughout the programme of study. The OERs will be showcased during the session and attendees will be able to witness how we not only captured the student voice but involved students at every stage of the design and production of the resources. Existing research evidences how the use of student created content engages students in disciplines as varied as chemistry (Benedict and Pence, 2012) and marketing and accounting (Greene and Crespi, 2012) and this presentation will show attendees how to develop high quality OERs that are student centred...|$|E

The formation process of massive stars is not well understood, and advancement in our understanding benefits from high-resolution observations and modelling of the gas and dust surrounding individual high-mass (proto) stars. Here, we report subarcsecond (≲ 1550 au) resolution observations of the young massive star G 11. 92 − 0. 61 MM 1 with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Very Large Array (VLA). Our 1. 3 mm SMA observations reveal consistent velocity gradients in compact molecular line emission from species such as CH 3 CN, CH 3 OH, OCS, HNCO, H 2 CO, DCN and CH 3 CH 2 CN, oriented perpendicular to the previously reported bipolar molecular outflow from MM 1. Modelling of the compact gas kinematics suggests a structure undergoing rotation around the peak of the dust continuum emission. The rotational profile can be well fitted by a model of a Keplerian disc, including infall, surrounding an enclosed mass of ∼ 30 – 60 M⊙, of which 2 – 3 M⊙ is attributed to the disc. From modelling the CH 3 CN emission, we determine that two temperature components, of ∼ 150 K and 230 K, are required to adequately reproduce the spectra. Our 0. 9 and 3. 0 cm VLA continuum data exhibit an excess above the level expected from dust emission; the full centimetre–submillimetre wavelength spectral energy distribution of MM 1 is well reproduced by a model including dust emission, an unresolved hypercompact H II region, and a compact ionized jet. In combination, our results suggest that MM 1 is an example of a massive proto-O star forming via disc accretion, in a similar way to that of lower mass stars. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Stable {{viscoelastic}} masses {{have been}} formed from kafirin in a mainly aqueous system. Kafirin was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (GAA) and simple coacervation was performed by rapid addition of 15 °C water under low shear. Kafirin precipitated out as a network of hydrated fibrils which could be hand-kneaded into a viscoelastic mass. These could be formed from a very wide range of kafirins, including those where β- or γ-subclass expression was suppressed. Kafirin composition influenced {{the appearance of the}} masses but did not fundamentally affect stress-relaxation behaviour. Fresh kafirin masses exhibited similar elasticity and viscous flow balance to gluten. They maintained functionality when stored for several days at 10 °C but their elastic component increased. FTIR showed that when kafirin was dissolved in GAA its α-helical conformation increased substantially. Dissociation of the kafirin molecules in GAA, assuming a α-helical conformation may have enhanced water binding, enabling viscoelastic mass formation. The Howard G.

40|$|Novel biofortified sorghum {{lines have}} been {{developed}} with both waxy starch (high amylopectin) and high protein digestibility traits. Eight sorghum lines with different combinations of waxy, non-waxy, high- and normal-protein digestibility traits were studied in relation to flour properties. Lines with the high protein digestibility trait had loosely packed starch granules and floury endosperm, irrespective of whether they were waxy or non-waxy. In terms of thermal properties, combined waxy-high digestibility lines had the highest onset endothermic temperature as well as endothermic energy compared to non-waxy, normal protein digestibility lines. The waxy-high protein digestibility lines had higher paste viscosity and formed much softer and less sticky pastes than the non-waxy, normal protein digestibility lines. Flours of the combined waxy-high protein digestibility sorghum lines had much higher solubility than the non-waxy- normal protein digestibility lines. At 30 C flour solubility, waxy-high protein digestibility sorghum lines flour was similar to commercial wheat bread flours. The high flour solubility, high pasting viscosity and soft paste of sorghum lines with combined waxy and high protein digestibility traits indicate that their flours may have better properties for making dough-based food products than normal non-waxy, normal protein digestibility sorghums.

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} germline SDHA mutation analysis by (1) comprehensive literature review, (2) description of novel germline SDHA mutations and (3) in silico structural prediction analysis of missense substitutions in SDHA. Patients and methods A systematic literature review and a retrospective review of the molecular and clinical features of patients identified with putative germline variants in UK molecular genetic laboratories was performed. To {{evaluate the}} molecular consequences of SDHA missense variants, a novel model of the SDHA/B/C/D complex was generated and the structural effects of missense substitutions identified in the literature, our UK novel cohort and a further 32 “control missense variants” were predicted by the mCSM computational platform. These structural predictions were correlated {{with the results of}} tumor studies and other bioinformatic predictions. Results Literature review revealed reports of 17 different germline SDHA variants in 47 affected individuals from 45 kindreds. A further 10 different variants in 15 previously unreported cases (seven novel variants in eight patients) were added from our UK series. In silico structural prediction studies of 11 candidate missense germline mutations suggested that most (63. 7 %) would destabilize the SDHA protomer, and that most (78. 1 %) rare SDHA missense variants present in a control data set (ESP 6500) were also associated with impaired protein stability. Conclusion The clinical spectrum of SDHA-associated neoplasia differs from that of germline mutations in other SDH-subunits. The interpretation of the significance of novel SDHA missense substitutions is challenging. We recommend that multiple investigations (e. g. tumor studies, metabolomic profiling) should be performed to aid classification of rare missense variants before genetic testing results are used to influence clinical management.

40|$|BACKGROUND : The need {{to retain}} health {{personnel}} {{is a policy}} challenge undermining health system reform of the 21 st century. The need to resolve this global health workforce crisis resulted in the First Global Forum on Human Resources for Health in 2008 from which the Kampala Declaration and Agenda for Global Action was formulated. However, whilst {{there have been several}} studies exploring the retention of health personnel towards this end, available literature does not provide a detailed narrative on strategies used in peri-urban communities. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore retention strategies implemented in a Zimbabwean peri-urban community between 2009 and 2014 and implications for peri-urban communities towards the health system reform agenda. METHODS : The study was carried out in Epworth, a peri-urban community in Harare, Zimbabwe. The research design was a cross-sectional survey, in which qualitative methods were used in sampling, data collection, reporting and analysis. Qualitative tools were used to collect data through in-depth interviews with purposively selected health personnel managers at 10 local clinics and sample interviews with purposively selected healthcare workers who included registered general nurses, state-certified nurses, midwives, environmental health technicians, nurse aids and community health volunteers at each clinic. Two focus group discussions were carried out with community health volunteers. Qualitative data was subjected to thematic analysis, with coding being performed manually. RESULTS : A programme-specific strategic partnership between the government and donor community contributed towards the mobilisation of more health personnel, health facilities, worker development and remuneration. To complement this, the Ministry of Health intervened through the review and payment of salaries, support towards post-basic training and development, and protection. The local board, mission and donors contributed through the payment of top-up allowances and provision of non-monetary incentives. CONCLUSIONS : The review of salaries, engagement of international strategic partners, payment of top-up allowances, support towards post-basic training and development, mobilisation of more health personnel, non-monetary incentives and healthcare worker protection were critical towards the retention of health personnel in the Epworth peri-urban community between 2009 and 2014.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the impact of}} an {{innovative}} undergraduate researcher scheme developed by the University of Northampton in England. The URB@N scheme (Undergraduate Research Bursaries at Northampton) was initiated in 2009 to: - Involve students in pedagogic research by providing a <b>research</b> <b>bursary</b> - Facilitate collaborative enquiry between students and academic staff - Stimulate academic staff to conduct pedagogic research by providing resource to support specific projects - Energize the institutional commitment and understanding of pedagogic research URB@N is centrally coordinated and funded, providing a coherent synergy with institutional strategy. The scheme is aimed at academic staff with a pedagogic question to investigate, but without the current resource or support to explore it. URB@N enables a scholarly research project to be developed, conducted and reported on - providing beneficial insights into pedagogy, thus facilitating research-informed practice (Griffiths, 2004). The projects are broad in scope, {{and the majority of}} Schools in the university are represented. Student applicants at various stages of their undergraduate degrees are selected to work as paid researchers, often working outside their discipline and sometimes in complementary pairs – impacting positively on the research dynamic. As a teaching-focussed institution which received degree awarding powers in 2006, the University of Northampton is a widening participation university with strong community links, priding itself on fostering a transformational student experience and creating opportunity for diverse student groups. In the current UK HE context, institutions are not only driven to embed a range of indicators of the student learning experience (employability, career development, aspiration-raising), but academic staff are encouraged to develop their scholarship (McKinney, 2006), improve their supervisory skills and build effective working relationships with students. Such drivers reflect prioritised accountability measures such as the Research Assessment Exercise and National Student Survey, as well as imminent changes in HE funding structures. URB@N was developed in this context. Situating our study within the propositions of Healey and Jenkins’ (2009) model of undergraduate engagement in research and inquiry, we explored the impact of URB@N as research-based learning in a pedagogic framework. This paper is presented as a longitudinal mixed method study involving action learning cycles. Evidence from student and staff feedback, quantitative measures of engagement and reflective accounts enable us to report the collective impact of the scheme on staff and students’ knowledge, experience and understanding of scholarship, and offer evidence of institutional transformation. We present evidence showing the impact of: a creative dialogue between academics and students about research; new knowledge construction in ‘taken for granted’ areas; powerful reflections on learning; and the value of authentic data, with student researchers eliciting unique access to learners. As such, we report a credible expansion of scholarly activity by staff and students impacting on the institution as a whole. In exploring the potential of this scheme for institutional transferability, we argue that it presents one way of re-energizing scholarly interest in pedagogy and pedagogic matters and has the potential to facilitate cultural change within an institution, where scholarly impact is encouraged, supported and valued. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} various {{security issues}} in the existing home automation systems and proposes the use of logic-based security algorithms to improve home security. This paper classifies natural access points to a home as primary and secondary access points depending on their use. Logic-based sensing is implemented by identifying normal user behavior at these access points and requesting user verification when necessary. User position is also considered when various access points changed states. Moreover, the algorithm also verifies the legitimacy of a fire alarm by measuring the change in temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, thus defending against manipulative attackers. The experiment conducted in this paper used a combination of sensors, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and ZigBee communication to identify user behavior at various access points and implement the logical sensing algorithm. In the experiment, the proposed logical sensing algorithm was successfully implemented for a month in a studio apartment. During {{the course of the}} experiment, the algorithm was able to detect all the state changes of the primary and secondary access points and also successfully verified user identity 55 times generating 14 warnings and 5 alarms.

40|$|Non-formal adult {{education}} and training (NFET) in South Africa is instrumental in breaking {{the high level of}} poverty and decreasing the social inequality the country continues to face as a post-apartheid democracy. Public and private NFET centres in South Africa aim to meet the training needs of adults who have been deprived of formal education with courses which foster access to opportunities for skills acquisition and employment and bring about social and economic inclusion. However, many adults who were facing long-term unemployment {{due to a lack of}} marketable skills remain unemployed after completing NFET programmes. This paper reports on a study which investigated what constitutes favourable conditions (“internal enabling environments”) for skills acquisition inside NFET centres leading to employment and how they can be improved to contribute to coordinated efforts of increasing NFET graduates’ paid and/or self-employment capacities. The authors found that centres focusing on activities suitable for self-employment during training were more likely to create internal enabling environments for skills acquisition and income generation than centres offering courses designed for entering paid employment. The authors conclude that there appears to be a significant correlation between NFET centres’ training programme objectives, financial resources, trainee selection criteria, the process of training needs assessment, and skills acquisition for successful employment outcomes of NFET graduates. Without these internal enabling factors, adult trainees are likely to continue finding it difficult to integrate into the labour market or participate in economic activities and hence break the cycle of poverty and social exclusion. <b>Research</b> Support <b>Bursary</b> from the University of Pretoria.

40|$|Arising {{from work}} showing that {{conventionally}} bred high protein digestibility sorghum types have improved flour and dough functionality, {{the flour and}} dough properties of transgenic biofortified sorghum lines with increased protein digestibility and high lysine content (TG-HD) resulting from suppressed synthesis of several kafirin subclasses, especially the cysteine-rich γ-kafirin, were studied. TG-HD sorghums had higher flour water solubility at 30 °C (p < 0. 05) and much higher paste viscosity (41 % higher) than their null controls (NC). TG-HD doughs were twice as strong as their NC and dynamic rheological analysis indicated that the TG doughs were somewhat more elastic up to 90 °C. CLSM of doughs and pastes indicated that TG-HD had a less compact endosperm protein matrix surround the starch compared to their NC. The improved flour and dough functional properties of the TG-HD sorghums seem {{to be caused by}} reduced endosperm compactness resulting from suppression of synthesis of several kafirin subclasses which modifies protein body and protein matrix structure, and to improved protein-starch interaction through hydrogen bonding specifically caused by reduction in the level of the hydrophobic γ-kafirin. The improved flour functionality of these transgenic biofortified sorghums can increase their commercial utility by complementing their improved nutritional quality. The Howard G.
