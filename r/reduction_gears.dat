In nuclear ships and submarines, the steam is fed through a steam turbine {{connected to a}} set of speed <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> to a shaft used for propulsion.

District heating by the steam is used in some countries and direct heating is applied to internal plant applications.|$|E
25|$|The Jupiter {{was fairly}} {{standard}} in design, but featured four valves per cylinder, which was uncommon at the time. The cylinders were machined from steel forgings, and the cast cylinder heads were later replaced with aluminium alloy following {{studies by the}} RAE. In 1927, a change was made {{to move to a}} forged head design due to the rejection rate of the castings. The Jupiter VII introduced a mechanically driven supercharger to the design, and the Jupiter VIII was the first to be fitted with <b>reduction</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{significant}} difference was the incorporation of the camshaft and magneto drives into the propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> {{at the front of}} the engine, rather than using a separate system of gears driven from the back end of the crankshaft; this allowed the overall length of the engine to be reduced as well as making the drive train more reliable and efficient. The drive for the supercharger was also taken off the front of the engine, which required a long shaft to run to its location at the back of the engine.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} of the first sixteen vessels was all authorised under the NIRA Executive Order on 16 June 1933; the last two were authorised under the Vinson-Trammell Act on 27 March 1934 (as part of a batch of 95 destroyers authorised on that date - covering DD-380 to DD-436 and DD-445 to DD-482). Contracts {{for the first six}} Mahans were awarded to three shipbuilders, but none of the builders had what the US Navy judged as an acceptable in-house design structure. [...] On the strength of their reputation, the New York firm of Gibbs & Cox was named as the design agent. The firm had no experience in the design of warships, [...] but had successfully designed passenger-cargo liners with better propulsion systems than any available to the US Navy. The decision was made to design the Mahan class and future classes around a new generation of machinery, including a cheaper, faster and more efficient propulsion system that combined increases in steam pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight, fast-running turbine and double <b>reduction</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|E

The bridge's reinforced-concrete counterweights, measuring [...] high by [...] wide, was supported by pivots at the ends of the girders. The trunnions were supported by box-girder posts on the sides of the bascule leaves and each set of inside trunnion posts were braced by a girder ran both between them and to the operating mechanism. Earle Gear and Machine Company provided the operating mechanism for the bridge. The bascule leaves were raised by a motor that used <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> and engaged a pinion to move the rack quadrant to raise the bridge. A manual-operation shaft was originally present so that it could be operated from the surface of the roadway, but it was later paved over. The operator's house was located on the south side of the western approach, it originally housed the operator's house and public bathrooms, but it was removed in 1936. The plans originally dictated for a second station on the opposite end, but 1930s photos shows it was apparently never constructed.|$|E

2500|$|As {{time went}} on, {{competing}} Axial turbines became dramatically {{more efficient and}} powerful, a second stage of <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> was introduced in most cutting edge U.S. naval ships of the 1930s. The improvement in steam technology gave the U.S. Aircraft Carriers a clear advantage in speed over both Allied and enemy aircraft carriers, and so the proven axial steam turbines became the preferred form of propulsion until the 1973 oil embargo took place. The oil crisis drove the majority of new civilian vessels to turn to diesel engines. Axial steam turbines still had not exceeded 50% efficiency by that time, and so civilian ships chose to utilize diesel engines due to their superior efficiency. By this time, the comparably efficient Tesla turbine was over 60 years old.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1941 His Majesty's Government, {{seeking to}} take {{advantage}} of the US Lend-Lease program, asked the United States to design, build and supply an escort vessel that was suitable for anti-submarine warfare in deep open ocean situations. The requested particulars were a length of , a speed of , a dual purpose main armament and an open bridge. The United States Navy had been looking into the feasibility of such a vessel since 1939, and Captain E. L. Cochrane of the US Navy's [...] Bureau of Shipsâ€“ who, during his visit to the United Kingdom in 1940, had looked at Royal Navy corvettes and sâ€“ had come up with a design for such a vessel. This design anticipated a need for large numbers of this type of vessels, and had sought to remove the major production bottleneck for such vessels: reduction gearing required for the steam turbine machinery of destroyers. The production of <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> could not be easily increased, as the precision machinery required for their construction alone took over a year to produce. Therefore, a readily-available and proven layout of diesel-electric machinery, also used on submarines, was adopted. When the United Kingdom made its request, Admiral Stark of the US Navy decided to put these plans into motion and recommended that the British order be approved. Gibbs and Cox, the marine architects charged with creating working plans, had to make several alterations to the production methods and to Captain Cochrane's original design, most notably dropping another production bottleneckâ€“ the five inch/38 caliber gunâ€“ and replacing it with the three inch/50 caliber gun, which allowed adding a superfiring third gun (at the [...] "B" [...] position, forward); also, the original design specified eight engines for [...] but other priority programs forced the use of only four with a consequent shortening of the hull and reduction of the ship's maximum speed by an estimated [...] [...] The design had relatively light armour with for example the steel plate used on the Buckleys ranging from 1/2 inch to 7/16 inch with 1/4 inch plate being used for the majority of the hull and deck plating.|$|E
