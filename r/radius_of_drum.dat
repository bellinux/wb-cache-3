The {{distribution}} and dimension of contacting pressure and contacting area between friction linings and brake drum have important influence on braking performance. Entire contact theory in this article was found based on the conditions that the outside radius of linings was equal to the inside <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>drum.</b> The relation between the corresponding points on contact surface and the angle which lining rotated around support pin axis was calculated based on entire contact theory. The radial deformation, pressure distribution, contact area of linings and the brake performance were analyzed in the condition of entire contact theory...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{traces the}} {{development}} of a control strategy for an iron ore balling drum circuit. The first phase of the analysis concerns the formulation of a mathematical model of the balling process, this leads to a stability study aimed at overcoming certain oiaerativnal difficulties associated with drum circuits. Finally, a multivariable feedback con-troller is designed which allows ball production rate and ball quality to be iradependerztly controlled. The key practical contributions are the formulation of a simple stabilising technique and a special control system for reducing the sensitivity of the production rate to the addition of water into the drum.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} fine cohesive powders inside rotating drums. We show that these powders may be fluidized due to entrapment of ambient gas, and we determine the onset of fluidization. Experimental measurements on the bed expansion {{as a function of}} the rotation velocity have been performed. <b>Drums</b> <b>of</b> different diameters and fine powders of varying cohesiveness have been tested. We show that (i) fine powders transit directly from a rigid-plastic state to a gas-fluidized state in accordance with the flow regime boundaries predicted elsewhere [A. Castellanos et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1156 ~ 1999], (ii) the onset of fluidization in the rotating drum is determined by the ratio of the powder kinetic energy per unit volume to its tensile strength, and ~iii! once the powder is completely fluidized the average interstitial gas velocity increases proportionally to the rotation velocity. The last two results imply that the required velocity to fluidize a powder, vR (v angular velocity, R <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> the <b>drum),</b> must increase as the square root of its tensile strength, and this has been confirmed by independent measurements and estimations...|$|R

A friction band is wrapped around half the drum's circumference and each end attached to a separate spring balance. A substantial pre-load is then applied {{to the ends of}} the band, so that each spring balance has an initial and identical reading. When the engine is running, the frictional force between the drum and the band will increase the force reading on one balance and decrease it on the other. The difference between the two readings multiplied by the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> the driven <b>drum</b> is equal to the torque.

40|$|Abstract:- A curve with a {{monotone}} <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature {{distribution is}} {{considered as a}} fair curve {{in the area of}} Computer Aided Aesthetic Design (CAAD). But no official standards have been established. Therefore, a criterion for a fair curve is proposed. A quintic NURBS curve, the first derivative of a quintic NURBS curve, curvature vector, curvature, and <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature are expressed. The concept <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature specification to modify the shape of a NURBS curve is illustrated. The difference between the NURBS curve <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature and the specified <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature is minimized by introducing the least-squares method to modify the shape of the NURBS curve. Algebraic functions such as linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, and six degrees are applied to the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution of the designed curve as the specified <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature. The <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distributions given by these six algebraic functions are considered monotone, because the independent variable of these algebraic functions is monotone to the corresponding dependent variable of these functions. Similarity is evaluated using the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution according to six algebraic functions as references and the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution of the designed curves as matches by using correlation matching. Curve shape similarity evaluation is tried using an example. Considering that a curve with a monotone variation <b>of</b> <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution is fair, the similarity of the designed curve to a fair curve is evaluated. This measured similarity expresses fairness to the fair curve. Using this technique, the fairness of a curve is evaluated by using the similarity <b>of</b> the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature distribution.
