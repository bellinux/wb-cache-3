25|$|Glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G6PD) is {{an enzyme}} in the pentose phosphate pathway (see image, {{also known as}} the HMP shunt pathway). G6PD converts glucose-6-phosphate into 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone and is the <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzyme</b> of this metabolic pathway that supplies reducing energy to cells by maintaining the level of the reduced form of the co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The NADPH in turn maintains the supply of reduced glutathione in the cells that is used to mop up free radicals that cause oxidative damage.|$|E
25|$|The pathway is {{initiated}} by the synthesis of D-aminolevulinic acid (dALA or δALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzyme</b> responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is negatively regulated by glucose and heme concentration. Mechanism of inhibition of ALAs by heme or hemin is by decreasing stability of mRNA synthesis and by decreasing the intake of mRNA in the mitochondria. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate or hematin and glucose can abort attacks of acute intermittent porphyria in patients with an inborn error of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes,</b> {{because of}} their {{relatively}} low velocity, are believed to influence metabolic flux in pathways. To investigate their regulatory role in metabolic networks, {{we look at the}} global organization and interactions between <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes</b> and compounds such as branch point metabolites and enzyme inhibitors in human liver. Results Based on 96 <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes</b> and 132 branch point compounds from human liver, we found that <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes</b> surrounded 76. 5 % of branch points. In a compound conversion network from human liver, the 128 branch points involved showed a dramatically higher average degree, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality as a whole. Nearly half of the in vivo inhibitors were products of <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes,</b> and covered 75. 34 % of the inhibited targets in metabolic inhibitory networks. Conclusion From global topological organization, <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes</b> as a whole surround most of the branch points; so they can influence the flux through branch points. Since nearly half of the in vivo enzyme inhibitors are produced by <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes</b> in human liver, these enzymes can initiate inhibitory regulation and then influence metabolic flux through their natural products. </p...|$|R

25|$|Short-term {{regulation}} of HMG-CoA reductase {{is achieved by}} inhibition by phosphorylation (of Serine 872, in humans). Decades ago {{it was believed that}} a cascade of enzymes controls the activity of HMG-CoA reductase: an HMG-CoA reductase kinase was thought to inactivate the enzyme, and the kinase in turn was held to be activated via phosphorylation by HMG-CoA reductase kinase kinase. An excellent review on {{regulation of}} the mevalonate pathway by Nobel Laureates Joseph Goldstein and Michael Brown adds specifics: HMG-CoA reductase is phosphorylated and inactivated by an AMP-activated protein kinase, which also phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzyme</b> of fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, both pathways utilizing acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis are inactivated when energy charge is low in the cell, and concentrations of AMP rise. There has {{been a great deal of}} research on the identity of upstream kinases that phosphorylate and activate the AMP-activated protein kinase.|$|E

30|$|Although the {{limonene}} {{production was}} enhanced significantly in this study, more efforts are {{still needed to}} achieve a higher production {{and to make it}} more economic.

40|$|High-fat diets may promote growth, partly {{through their}} protein-sparing effects. However, high-fat diets {{often lead to}} {{excessive}} fat deposition, which may {{have a negative impact}} on fish such as poor growth and suppressive immune. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of a fat-rich diet on the mechanisms of fat deposition in the liver. Three-hundred blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) juveniles (initial mass 18. 00 ± 0. 05 g) were fed with one of two diets (5 % or 15 % fat) for 8 weeks. β-Oxidation capacity and regulation of <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes</b> were assessed. Large fat droplets were present in hepatocytes of fish fed the high-fat diet. This observation is thought to be largely owing to the reduced capacity for mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in the livers of fish fed the high-fat diet, as well as the decreased activities of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), which are enzymes involved in fatty-acid metabolism. Study of CPT I kinetics showed that CPT I had a low affinity for its substrates and a low catalytic efficiency in fish fed the high-fat diet. Expression of both CPT I and ACO was significantly down-regulated in fish fed the high-fat diet. Moreover, the fatty-acid composition of the mitochondrial membrane varied between the two groups. In conclusion, the attenuated β-oxidation capacity observed in fish fed a high-fat diet is proposed to be owing to decreased activity and/or catalytic efficiency of the <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes</b> CPT I and ACO, via both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of models describing the kinetic properties of a microorganism {{for a given}} substrate are unstructured and empirical. They are formulated in this manner so that the complex mechanism of cell growth is simplified. Herein, a novel approach for modelling microbial growth kinetics is proposed, linking biomass growth and substrate consumption rates to the gene regulatory programmes that control these processes. A dynamic model of the TOL (pWW 0) plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt- 2 has been developed, describing the molecular interactions {{that lead to the}} transcription of the upper and meta operons, known to produce the enzymes for the oxidative catabolism of m-xylene. The genetic circuit model was combined with a growth kinetic model decoupling biomass growth and substrate consumption rates, which are expressed as independent functions of the <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes</b> produced by the operons. Estimation of model parameters and validation of the model's predictive capability were successfully performed in batch cultures of mt- 2 fed with different concentrations of m-xylene, as confirmed by relative mRNA concentration measurements of the promoters encoded in TOL. The growth formation and substrate utilisation patterns could not be accurately described by traditional Monod-type models {{for a wide range of}} conditions, demonstrating the critical importance of gene regulation for the development of advanced models closely predicting complex bioprocesses. In contrast, the proposed strategy, which utilises quantitative information pertaining to upstream molecular events that control the production of <b>rate-limiting</b> <b>enzymes,</b> predicts the catabolism of a substrate and biomass formation and could be of central importance for the design of optimal bioprocesse...|$|R
