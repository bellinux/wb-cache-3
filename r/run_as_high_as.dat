5|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} among the most {{distinctive}} neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837. They are distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: The dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the dendrites of a Purkinje cell form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles. The dendrites are covered with dendritic spines, each of which receives synaptic input from a parallel fiber. Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in the brain—estimates of the number of spines on a single human Purkinje cell <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 200,000. The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar cortex, called the Purkinje layer. After emitting collaterals that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their targets.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features {{is complicated by}} the existence of surgical methods to alter these features. Estimates <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> one percent of live births exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity, and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary surgery to address their sexual ambiguity.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{quarters}} of Ayutthaya were home to about 1,500 Japanese inhabitants (some estimates <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 7,000). The community was called Ban Yipun in Thai, and was {{headed by a}} Japanese chief nominated by Thai authorities. It {{seems to have been}} a combination of traders, Christian converts ("Kirishitan") who had fled their home country to various Southeast Asian countries following the persecutions of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, and unemployed former samurai who had been on the losing side at the battle of Sekigahara.|$|E

50|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of excess surplus {{airplanes}} <b>ran</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 150,000. By the summer of 1945, at least 30 sales-storage depots and 23 sales centers were in operation. In November 1945, it was estimated that a total of 117,210 aircraft would be transferred as surplus.|$|R
500|$|Bundy {{confessed to}} 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown. Published {{estimates}} have <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 100 or more, and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage that speculation. He told Hugh Aynesworth in 1980 {{that for every}} murder [...] "publicized", there [...] "could be one that was not." [...] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, [...] "Add one digit to that, and you'll have it." [...] Years later he told attorney Polly Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, but Robert Keppel wrote that [...] " [...] and I both knew [...] was much higher." [...] "I don't think even he knew ... how many he killed, or why he killed them", said Rev. Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered Bundy's last rites. [...] "That was my impression, my strong impression." ...|$|E
500|$|At least 85 {{people died}} during the purge, {{although}} the final death toll {{may have been in}} the hundreds, and some estimates <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 700 to 1,000. More than a thousand perceived opponents were arrested. Most of the killings were carried out by the [...] (SS) and the Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei), the regime's secret police. The purge strengthened and consolidated the support of the Reichswehr for Hitler. It also provided a legal grounding for the Nazi regime, as the German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against extrajudicial killings to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime. The Night of the Long Knives was a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as [...] "the supreme justiciar of the German people", as he put it in his July 13, 1934 speech to the Reichstag, the rubber-stamp ceremonial Parliament of the Third Reich from 1933 to 1945.|$|E
500|$|Casualty {{figures for}} {{the second day of}} Gettysburg are {{difficult}} to assess because both armies reported by unit after the full battle, not by day. One estimate is that the Confederates lost approximately 6,000 killed, missing, or wounded from Hood's, McLaws's, and Anderson's divisions, amounting to 3040% casualties. Union casualties in these actions probably exceeded 9,000. An estimate for the day's total (including the Culp's and Cemetery Hill actions) by historian Noah Trudeau is 10,000 Union, 6,800 Confederate. This is in comparison to approximately 9,000 Union and 6,000 Confederate casualties on the first day, although there were much larger percentages of the armies engaged the second. Some estimates of total casualties for the day <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 20,000 and declare it the bloodiest day of the Battle of Gettysburg. [...] It {{is a testament to the}} ferocity of the day's battle that such high casualties figures resulted even with much of the fighting not occurring until late in the afternoon and thereafter lasting about six hours. By comparison, the Battle of Antietamknown famously as the bloodiest single day in American military history with nearly 23,000 casualtieswas an engagement that lasted twelve hours, or about twice as long.|$|E

50|$|When {{actively}} mined, {{the silver}} vein of argentiferous galena (silver-bearing lead) {{was large and}} well defined. The silver and lead was easily milled and smelted. The lead content sometimes was as much as 50 per cent of the ore, and assays proved the silver content <b>ran</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> $105.00 per ton in 1881 dollars.|$|R
2500|$|Prosecutors {{said that}} Alcala [...] "toyed" [...] with his victims, {{strangling}} {{them until they}} lost consciousness, then waiting until they revived, sometimes repeating this process several times before finally killing them. [...] One police detective described Alcala as [...] "a killing machine", and others have compared him with Ted Bundy. A homicide investigator familiar with the evidence speculates {{that he could have}} murdered as many as 50 women, while other estimates have <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 130.|$|E
2500|$|His {{father died}} on 3 August 1562, shortly after making his will. Because he held lands from the Crown by knight service, his son became a royal {{ward of the}} Queen and {{was placed in the}} {{household}} of Sir William Cecil, her secretary of state and chief advisor. At 12, De Vere had become the 17th Earl of Oxford, Lord Great Chamberlain of England, and heir to an estate whose annual income, though assessed at approximately £2,500, may have <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> £3,500 (£ as of [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|As of January 2010, the NIF could <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 1.8 megajoules. Glenzer {{said that}} {{experiments}} with slightly larger hohlraums containing fusion-ready fuel pellets would begin before May 2010, slowly ramping up to 1.2 megajoules [...] enough for ignition according to calculations. But first the target chamber {{needed to be}} equipped with shields to block neutrons that a fusion reaction would produce. On June 5, 2010 the NIF team fired lasers at the target chamber {{for the first time}} in six months; realignment of the beams took place later in June in preparation for further high-energy operation.|$|E

Stewart <b>ran</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> fifth before retiring with brake problems, while Spence drove steadily and finished three laps down in eighth place.|$|R
50|$|Management {{concluded}} that the company needed additional financial resources. Retail sales remained relatively steady, and the company sold some ports to other platforms that generated significant OEM revenue (some ports <b>ran</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> $500,000). But at retail, the company {{was never able to}} make a significant dent in the 1-2-3 juggernaut.|$|R

2500|$|In 1994, Gary Eitel filed a qui tam {{civil lawsuit}} {{on behalf of}} the Federal {{government}} against Reagan, the six airtanker operators, {{and a number of other}} defendants, which alleged fraud and the unjust gain of enrichment through the exchange program. Due to federal law, Fuchs is immune from being named in such a civil suit. Initially, the U.S. government declined to join the suit. In a qui tam suit, a private citizen may file suit on behalf of and as an agent for the U.S. Government against entities accused of defrauding the government. While the plaintiff must pay for the legal expenses out of his own pocket (in 1998 Eitel estimated that the suit had cost him $3 million), he is entitled to receive 15% to 30% of the money which the government recovers should he prevail in court. Potential penalties were estimated to <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> US$500 million. Among the issues raised in court by the suit are [...] "whether some aerial firefighters were unjustly enriched, if the U.S. Justice Department and Forest Service covered up CIA and drug cartel links to some of the planes, whether the planes should remain in private hands, if the list of defendants should grow or dwindle, and who is telling the truth." ...|$|E

60|$|Gibbon {{tells us}} how a swarm of emigrants, {{escaping}} from the public ruin, was attracted by the vicinity, the manners, and the language of Lausanne. 'They are entitled to our pity,' he reflected, 'and they may claim our esteem, but they cannot in their present state of mind and fortune contribute much to our amusement. Instead of looking down as calm and idle spectators on the theatre of Europe, our domestic harmony is somewhat embittered by the infusion of party spirit.' Gibbon died in London almost {{at the very moment}} that De Maistre arrived at Lausanne, but his account of things remained true, and political feuds continued to <b>run</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> ever. Among the people with whom De Maistre was thrown was Madame de Staël. 'As we had not been to the same school,' he says, 'either in theology or in politics, we had some scenes enough to make one die of laughter; still without quarrelling. Her father, who was then alive, was the friend and relative of people that I love with all my heart, and that I would not vex for all the world. So I allowed the émigrés who surrounded us to cry out as they would, without ever drawing the sword.' De Maistre thought he never came across a head so completely turned wrong as Madame de Staël's, the infallible consequence, as he took it to be, of modern philosophy operating upon a woman's nature. He once said of her: 'Ah! if Madame de Staël had been Catholic, she would have been adorable, instead of famous.' We can believe that his position among the French émigrés was not particularly congenial. For though they hated the Revolution, they had all drunk of the waters of the eighteenth century philosophy, and De Maistre hated this philosophy worse than he hated the Revolution itself. Then again, they would naturally vapour about the necessities of strong government. 'Yes,' said the Savoyard exile, 'but be quite sure that, to make the monarchy strong, you must rest it on the laws, avoiding everything arbitrary, too frequent commissions, and all ministerial jobberies.' We may well believe how unsavoury this rational and just talk was to people who meant by strong government a system that should restore to them their old prerogatives of anti-social oppression and selfish corruption. The order that De Maistre vindicated was a very different thing from the deadly and poisonous order which was the object of the prayers of the incorrigible royalists around him.|$|E
