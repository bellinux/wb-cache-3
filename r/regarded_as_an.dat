5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought that the game still had many of the negative aspects of other expansion packs, although it was still <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> exceptional add-on.|$|E
5|$|Ramarayaningar was <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{advocate}} {{of democracy and}} a staunch supporter of empowerment of the depressed classes.

5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> animal {{surveillance}} device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E

It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E

Brown, who gave him a high $24,000 rookie contract, just $1,000 shy of the top earning veteran Bob Cousy.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2011 season, NFF and NTF {{stated that}} Superfinalen would be discontinued, {{stating that the}} {{championship}} was interesting neither from a sports nor from a commercial aspect.

5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who they <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield {{resigned}} his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten {{played a crucial role in}} ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E
