40|$|What is a pipeline? For the {{purposes}} of this paper, a pipeline is a metaphor for a series of tasks or operations that run in sequence. In their most abstract form, pipelines are made up of pipes. These pipes can be tasks, processes, actions, etc. Each pipe has an input, a middle, and an output. The middle definition really depends on {{the context in which the}} pipeline exists. Figure 1. What is a pipe and what is a pipeline? For the moment, pretend the pipe is a real water pipe. This pipe might simply let water flow from one side to the other. Alternatively, the pipe could have a large funnel system at the input that actually collects fallen rain water, and on the output side there could be a bucket. Rain water would roll down the pipe and drip out of the other end into the bucket for collection. We would then define this pipe with a name and possibly a description; the name could be <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and our description a pipe that collects rainwater and drops it in a bucket. This is the most basic pipe [...] something with an input and an output that has something flowing through it. The middle always exists, but may not have a function. 1 Figure 2. <b>Rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> We could add a heated middle section to this <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>pipe,</b> so as the rainwater rolls down the pipe it is gently heated. The addition of this feature makes it a different pipe, so we should rename it and change its description. With multiple pipes, it is possible to put them together in a preferred sequence to create new combinations. A series or sequence of pipes should also be named and described. Small pipes are made into small pipelines, which in turn can become part of larger and more complex pipelines. There are a few rules that make pipelines work: • Pipes must have an input and an output • Pipes can not loop on to themselves • Pipes should always be as simple as possible • The middle of a pipe can have multiple parts if necessary • Pipes can have conditions • The input, middle and output of a pipe can have parameters So what has all this got to do with the future of the web? If we change the context of our pipeline to a virtual pipeline (bearing in mind a pipeline is simply a sequence of tasks) we end up with a easily definable tasks that work like building blocks.

We characterized the As contamination and assessed health risk related to As contaminated water in Duy Tien district, Hanam province using the Australian Environmental Health Risk Assessment Framework. Exposure assessment was conducted by measuring As concentrations in 300 tube-well water samples before and after filtration, estimating water volume consumed for drinking purpose in 150 interviewed households, which gave the daily consumption dose from oral route. Health risk was characterized by comparing the As levels in water with the National technical regulations on drinking water quality, and by comparing the daily consumption dose with the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) value set by WHO. Finally, cancer risk of people using As contaminated water source for eating and drinking was estimated using Cancer Slope Factor index and lifetime average daily dose. Results showed that water was heavily contaminated with As. The concentrations in drinking water before filtration were from 8 – 579 ppb (mean 301 ppb). The majority of households designed their sand filters themselves, but filters did not meet the standard for As removal. As daily consumptions of 60 % adults were lower than the level of the TDI (1 µg/kg/day). The average cancer risk in adults due to consuming filtered tube-well water for drinking purpose was 23. 5 x 10 - 5. This cancer risk would be 1. 2 and 1. 5 times higher after five and 10 years drinking filtered water, respectively. Our study showed the high contamination levels of As in tube-well water in Hanam.

Although many perceive <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking to be relatively safe, clinical experimental studies indicate significant exposures to tobacco smoke carcinogens following <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use. We investigated biomarkers of nicotine intake and carcinogen exposure from <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in the naturalistic setting of hookah bars. Methods: Fifty-five experienced <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> users were studied before and after smoking <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> in their customary way in a hookah bar. Urine samples were analyzed for nicotine, cotinine, the tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanol (NNAL), and mercapturic acid metabolites of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Results: We found an average 73 -fold increase in nicotine, 4 -fold increase in cotinine, 2 -fold increase in NNAL, and 14 % to 91 % increase in VOC mercapturic acid metabolites immediately following <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. We saw moderate to high correlations between changes in tobacco-specific biomarkers (nicotine, cotinine, and NNAL) and several mercapturic acid metabolites of VOCs.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking {{appears to}} be an {{increasing}} public health concern, with anecdotal reports of higher prevalence than cigarette smoking among young people in some high-income countries. We examined the prevalence and predictors of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smoking among students attending secondary schools in a deprived, ethnically diverse part of inner London. METHODS: We conducted a 96 -item, validated smoking habits questionnaire with 2, 399 students from Years 8, 10, and 12 / 13 from 15 secondary schools in Brent, northwest London. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of current and ever cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. RESULTS: Current <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking prevalence was more than double that of cigarette smoking prevalence (7. 6 % vs. 3. 4 %, p <. 001). One in 4 students had tried <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> compared with 1 in 6 who had tried cigarette smoking (24. 0 % vs. 15. 8 %, p <. 001). Significant predictors of ever <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use include being in a higher age group, South Asian or Middle Eastern ethnicity, and personal, family, or friends tobacco use. Significant predictors of ever cigarette use include being in a higher age group, White ethnicity, and personal, family, or friends tobacco use.

40|$|Background: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> is a {{traditional}} method of tobacco use, which is epidemically spreading throughout Europe. There are scarce data {{about the use of}} <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and its relation to other addictive behaviors among young adults in Western countries. Objectives: It was our aim to identify the sociodemographic characteristics of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> users in Switzerland and to describe concurrent cigarette and cannabis smoking habits. Methods: Young adults aged 16 - 30 years were evaluated based on a 16 -item standardized questionnaire on tobacco consumption and exhaled carbon monoxide. Current <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was defined as <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use at least once within the last 4 weeks; regular <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was defined as <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use {{at least once a week}} during the last 52 weeks. Results: Out of 353 volunteers, a total of 204 subjects (mean age 21 ± 3. 5 years, 113 males) met the inclusion criteria for the study. A total of 78 % (n = 160), 30. 0 % (n = 55) and 3. 9 % (n = 8) reported ever, current and regular <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking, respectively. Males smoked more often than females: 2. 8 sessions/year (interquartile range 1. 1 - 8) versus 2 sessions/year (interquartile range 0 - 4; p = 0. 022). The major risk factor for ever smoking <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> was cigarette smoking (odds ratio 6. 22, 95 % confidence interval 2. 33 - 16. 62), followed by cannabis consumption (odds ratio 1. 44, 95 % confidence interval 1. 29 - 1. 62). Ever <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was more common among current cannabis users (100 vs. 0 %; p > 0. 0001) and related to higher exhaled carbon monoxide values (6. 0 ± 9. 0 vs. 2. 1 ± 4. 6 ppm; p > 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Smoking tobacco {{preparations}} in a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (hookah) {{is widespread}} {{in many places}} of the world, including the United States, where it is especially popular among young people. Many perceive <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking to be less hazardous than cigarette smoking. We studied systemic absorption of nicotine, carbon monoxide, and carcinogens from one <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking session. Methods: Sixteen subjects smoked a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> on a clinical research ward. Expired carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin were measured, plasma samples were analyzed for nicotine concentrations, and urine samples were analyzed for the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 - butanol (NNAL) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolite biomarker concentrations. Results:We found substantial increases in plasmanicotine concentrations, comparable to cigarette smoking, and increases in carbon monoxide levels that are much higher than those typically observed from cigarette smoking, as previously published.

40|$|Background & Aim: Tobacco smoking exerts a {{harmful effect}} on the {{periodontal}} tissues manifested by periodontal pockets, attachment loss and periodontal bone loss. Current evidences {{on the effects of}} tobacco on periodontal health mainly concern cigarette smoking. In view of the increasing popularity of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in Arabian countries and reports confirming that <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking has health effects similar to those of cigarette smoking, {{there is a need for}} a better understanding of the potential harm of this smoking habit. The present thesis was carried out in order to explore whether <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking is associated with periodontal health in a manner similar to cigarette smoking. Material & Methods: Residents in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia, were invited to participate in the study by means of announcements in two daily newspapers. 355 individuals, 100 women and 255 men (17 - 60 years) responded to a standardized questionnaire and digital panoramic dental radiographs were taken. The questionnaire included information about oral hygiene practices, dental care and smoking habits. Of these subjects, 262 (73 %) also volunteered for clinical examination, including assessments of oral hygiene, gingival inflammation and probing depth. Subgingival microbial test was carried out in 198 individuals for the detection of 12 different bacterial species most commonly associated with periodontal disease using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Participants were stratified into <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers 33 %, cigarette smokers 20 %, smokers of both <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarettes (mixed smokers 19 %) and non-smokers 28 %. Results: Tobacco smoking is associated with a suppression of the gingival bleeding response to plaque accumulation. A suppressive effect was observed in both cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers compared to non-smokers (Study I). Both cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking were associated with the presence of more than 10 pockets of ¡Ý 5 mm probing depth. The relative risk for periodontal disease was 5. 1 -fold and 3. 8 -fold increased in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smokers, respectively, compared to non-smokers (p < 0. 01). The relative risk associated with heavy smoking was about 8 -fold elevated in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and 5 -fold elevated in cigarette smokers, suggesting an exposure-response effect (Study II). Tobacco smoking was associated with a reduction of the periodontal bone height. The reduction was of similar magnitude in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and cigarette smokers. The relative risk of periodontal bone loss of more than 30 % of the root length was 3. 5 -fold and 4. 3 -fold elevated in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smokers, respectively, compared to non-smokers (p < 0. 01). The relative risk associated with heavy smoking was 7. 5 -fold elevated in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and 6. 3 -fold elevated cigarette smokers (Study III). Further more, cigarette smokers, <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and non-smokers exhibited similar periodontal microflora (Study IV). Conclusion: Tobacco smoking is associated with inferior periodontal health. The impact of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking is of largely the same magnitude as that of cigarette smoking. The association between tobacco smoking and an inferior periodontal health seems to be independent of the subgingival microflora. <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking habit should be considered in periodontal health...|$|R
40|$|Robotic {{systems for}} <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> {{inspection}} do not generally include navigation components for mapping the pipe network and locating damage. Such navigation systems {{would be highly}} advantageous for water companies because it {{would allow them to}} more effectively target maintenance and reduce costs. In <b>water</b> <b>pipes,</b> a major challenge for robot navigation is feature sparsity. In order to address this problem, a novel approach for robot navigation in <b>water</b> <b>pipes</b> is developed here, which uses a new type of landmark feature - voids outside the pipe wall, sensed by ultrasonic scanning. The method was successfully demonstrated in a laboratory environment and showed {{for the first time the}} potential of using voids for robot navigation in <b>water</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 49 - 51) Besides {{the use of}} cigarettes, {{there is}} an alternative form of smoking tobacco that has in the last decade become popular in American culture: <b>water</b> <b>pipes.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>pipes</b> (Maziak, et. al., 2004) may be expanding the extent of tobacco use in younger populations. Little is known about the effects of <b>water</b> <b>pipes</b> and there is currently research being conducted to understand the new epidemic of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. Very few studies have been conducted in regards to the national and international studies on the beliefs and attitudes regarding smoking <b>water</b> <b>pipes.</b> A few reports suggest that smokers perceive <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> usage as healthier then smoking regular cigarettes (Georgetown University Medical Center, 2007). Since this is a new trend in America, little research has been conducted as to how many people engage in the ???activity, their gender, ethnicity, or other demographic factors. The purpose ofthis study is to discover factors related to hookah smoking in a college population. This is an exploratory study in which the relationship between hookah smoking, age, ethnicity, marijuana and cigarette use, gender and family attitudes and beliefs, are being observed...|$|R
