5|$|By that time, Reinitzer had {{discovered}} and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): {{the existence of}} two melting points, the reflection of circularly polarized light, {{and the ability to}} <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> polarization direction of light.|$|E
5|$|An {{operator}} {{inside the}} machine also had tools {{to assist in}} communicating with the presenter outside.

5|$|And Yet It Moves {{focuses on}} moving the player {{character}} {{through a series}} of hazardous environments. The player possesses the ability to freely <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> entire game world, transforming walls into floors and vice versa. The game's levels and puzzles are designed around this concept. The game features paper collage styled visuals designed by Jan Hackl and a beatboxing soundtrack performed by Christoph Binder.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> collimator forward for storage.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E

5|$|Ganteaume did {{not play}} in the next Test match—he was {{replaced}} by John Goddard {{who came into the}} team as part of a pre-arranged scheme to <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> captaincy. He was chosen in a preliminary 24-man squad to tour India and Pakistan in 1948–49, but did not make the final selection of 16 players, and was overlooked for the 1950 tour of England. He continued to play irregularly for Trinidad in the following years, but played no further representative cricket until 1957.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 turret was very tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; {{and it was hard to}} <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> turret manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E

5|$|Rotary fan, {{manual and}} water-powered: For {{purposes}} of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan {{became even more}} common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E

The top left corner of the screen interface shows the status of Logan's armour, a 'danger-meter' which rises as the player engages enemies through combat, and a target lock. A radar is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen which shows the location of various objects including friendly units, enemies, weapon pick ups or mission objectives. The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the bottom right corner, with the ammunition count. Depending on the weapon used, the camera will shift to first-person mode to assist in aiming.|$|E

5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{has moved}} into direct {{sunlight}} and Mission Control is unable to rotate it into a safe position, putting the astronauts' lives in danger. Generoo believes that the uplink is being sabotaged. Belt orders the uplink to be cut, allowing the astronauts to <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> craft manually. Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to the press about its progress. Belt tells Mulder that the shuttle program may be cancelled if the mission is not completed successfully.|$|E
5|$|Each gun rested {{within an}} armored turret, {{but only the}} top of the turret {{protruded}} above the main deck. The turret extended either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> turret and to elevate the guns attached to each turret. At the bottom of the turret were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. All of the compartments within the turrets were separated by flameproof bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the turret. Each turret required a crew of 7794 men to operate. The turrets were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were to capsize the turrets would fall out. Each turret cost US $1.4 million, but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a terahertz-wave parametric oscillator (TPO) with a corner-cube resonator {{consisting of a}} corner-cube prism (CCP) and a flat mirror. By using the cavity configuration proposed in this Letter, the generation of tunable monochromatic terahertz (THz) waves can be achieved just by <b>rotating</b> <b>the</b> flat mirror instead of <b>rotating</b> <b>the</b> TPO cavity relative to the pump beam. The THz-wave output intensity and pulse width can be controlled periodically by <b>rotating</b> <b>the</b> CCP around the cavity axis. The TPO stability against cavity misalignment is significantly improved by at least 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared with the conventional plane–parallel resonator configuration...|$|R

The top left corner of the screen shows the collected power-ups; the top right corner contains the radar showing the locations of objects including enemies, power-ups, jet pods and enemy projectiles. The bottom shows a health meter on the sides {{and the number of}} remaining lives in the centre. The player starts the game with three lives; a new life is granted once one million points are earned.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November 1939, Hanbury Brown wrote a memo on Suggestions for Fighter Control by RDF {{calling for}} {{a new type of}} radar that would {{directly}} display both the target aircraft and the intercepting fighter, allowing ground controllers to directly control the fighter without need for interpretation. The solution was to mount a radar on a motorized platform so it rotated continually, sweeping the entire sky. A motor in the CRT display would <b>rotate</b> <b>the</b> beam deflection plates in synchronicity, so blips seen when the antenna was at a particular angle would be displayed at the same angle on the scope display. Using a phosphor that lasted at least one rotation, blips for all targets within range would be drawn on the display at their correct relative angles, producing a map-like image known as a PPI. With both the bombers and fighters now appearing on the same display, the radar operator could now direct an intercept directly, eliminating all of the delays.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the starboard side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the starboard wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to <b>rotate.</b> <b>The</b> aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the starboard wing. Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its nacelle and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, the starboard wing caught on fire.|$|E
