40|$|The {{empowerment}} paradigm {{with roots}} {{in the literature of}} education and management (both applied and theoretical) can guidefaculty to help prepare students to make the transition from the classroom to the boardroom. While numerous faculty leaders have joined corporate leaders in espousing the virtues of empowerment, most classes in business schools are run in a bureaucratic, teacher focused, lecture oriented fashion which creates feelings of powerlessness and fosters dysfunctions. The values and practices ofthe empowerment paradigm are designed to facilitate student learning, self-efficacy, commitment, and motivation. Empowering faculty strive to identify and <b>remove</b> <b>factors</b> that promote feelings of powerlessnessin their students. Practical reasons for creating empowered students include: (1) most students do not find bureaucratic pedagogical practices to be moiivating; (2) traditional bureaucratic pedagogies create powerlessness; and (3) traditional pedagogies are not aligned with the practices and needs of industry. The key is to fashion an open, creative, team environment in which both faculty and student...|$|E

40|$|The {{mobile phone}} allowed people to {{communicate}} {{when and where}} they wanted, dramatically changing how audio telephony was integrated into daily life. With video telephony services now available on everyday mobile phones, comparable arguments are being made that this will change how people relate to and use video telephony. The mobile and personal natures of mobile phones <b>remove</b> <b>factors</b> that previously hindered use of video telephony. Mobility also brings new challenges and concerns that may hinder use of video telephony in particular contexts. With this in mind, the paper revisits the notion of video telephony but {{within the context of}} mobile phones. A study is presented of people’s everyday use of mobile video telephony using diary techniques and ethnographic interviews. The study uses real episodes to highlight key motivations and circumstances under which mobile video telephony was and wasn’t used. Implications for adoption of design of mobile video phones are discussed. Author Keywords Mobile phone, video telephony, diary study, interviews...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{international}} education {{assessment is}} important for educational improvement when it is used appropriately by participating countries to identify weaknesses of educational systems. However, its usefulness is dependent on {{validity of the test}} itself. One aspect of validity issues worth being investigated is the fairness which assesses whether or not assessment items/test is fair to all subgroups of examinees. Differential item functioning (DIF) and test functioning (DTF) methods are usually used to assess fairness. Test items that are not fair will be flagged as DIF. Similarly, tests that are not fair will be flagged as DTF. The objects of this research were to apply differential item functioning and test functioning methods to analyze the extent of differential item functioning and test functioning in science assessment data. The data that were explored in this research was the secondary data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2009 and was analyzed using Differential item functioning analysis system (DIFAS) version 5. 0. It was found that mixed format tests used by PISA favored some groups of examinees over other groups which indicate the degree of unfairness across groups of students with different backgrounds. The recommendation for the assessment of student performance is that DIF items be removed before the score reporting is calculated and that the value added model be used to <b>remove</b> <b>factors</b> that are unfair to different groups of test takers...|$|E

40|$|International audienceExtending recent {{investigations}} into the malleability of implicit ingroup favoritism, three experiments examined the role of indirect activation of equality and loyalty. Results showed that priming equality decreased implicit favoritism, measured through the Implicit Association Test and Go/No-Go Association Task, whereas priming loyalty enhanced it; spontaneous behavior (seating distance) was similarly influenced. A boundary condition was observed, namely change of intergroup setting: the effects of priming equality and loyalty ceased when these were primed after an irrelevant ingroup identity was made salient. In general, implicit favoritism can be reduced or increased after the activation of equality and loyalty respectively, and this underlines the importance of tackling discrimination by both lessening its expression, and <b>removing</b> <b>factors</b> that exacerbate it...|$|R

40|$|Many policy {{reforms in}} {{developing}} countries aim to <b>remove</b> <b>factor</b> market distortions. Whether such reforms reduce unemployment depends partly on the substitution possibilities between labour and other factors of production. This paper examines labour demand in seven branches of Sri Lankan manufacturing industry, using data on 4 -digit industrial categories over the 1990 to 1997 period. The Box-Cox transformation is used to allow for flexible, and data-dependent, elasticities. The elasticity of capital-labour substitution varies widely across the branches of industry and is usually variable rather than constant. The average, long-run own-wage elasticity of labour demand for the manufacturing sector is estimated as - 0. 80, so factor price policy should have an important effect on labour demand in this setting. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{real-time}} and embedded systems, it {{is often}} necessary to place conservative upper bounds on the memory required by a program or subprogram. This can be difficult and error-prone process. In this thesis, I have designed and implemented two (related) compile-time analyses to addresses this problem. The first analysis computes a symbolic upper bound on {{the maximum number of}} allocations of each object, showing undetermined facts about the program as symbols. The second analysis determines objects in the program that may be allocated statically, without changing the semantics of the program. The symbolic expression is then simplified by <b>removing</b> <b>factors</b> for statically allocated objects. The overall result is a simplified procedure for computing conservative upper bounds on memory. Results on a number of benchmarks are provided...|$|R

50|$|A {{structural}} (permanent) deficit {{differs from}} a cyclical deficit {{in that it}} exists regardless of {{the point in the}} business cycle due to an underlying imbalance in government revenues and expenditures. Thus, even at the high point of the business cycle when revenues are high the country's economy may still be in deficit. The structural component of the budget is used by some economists as an indication of a government's financial management, as it indicates the underlying balance between long-term government revenues and expenditure, while <b>removing</b> <b>factors</b> that are mainly attributable to the business cycle. Other economists see the structural deficit as simply a reflection of the implied discretionary fiscal stance of the government, that is, a structural deficit would be an expansionary fiscal stance that promotes at least nominal economic growth.|$|R
40|$|Sixty-two {{strains of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae were studied for their {{abilities}} to consume selected components of classical and alternative complement pathways in human sera.

The alternative pathway was blocked by <b>removing</b> <b>factor</b> B. Each strain's activation of the two pathways was compared with its nonimmune reactivity with the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Activation of the classical complement pathway appeared to be independent of such Fc reactivity. Highly Fc-reactive strains, however, were shown to activate the alternative pathway more effectively than did less Fc-reactive strains. Since pneumococcal activation of the alternative pathway requires non-immunospecific IgG, {{these findings suggest that}} nonimmune binding of IgG on the pneumococcal surface endows it with complement-activating properties...|$|R

In fluid phase assays antifactor VIII sera inhibited factor VIII activity only partly. Non inhibitory antibodies may be responsible for this. Prolonged immunization of a rabbit with factor VIII resulted in an antiserum, which inhibited factor VIII activity very potently.
