No bones or remains were found in these hut circles, only a few flaked flints gave clues to its occupation. The Fernacre settlement covered 164 acres, of which 84 show signs of having been farmed. The dating of the sites is uncertain although it has been suggested to have been constructed either in the Neolithic or Bronze Age.

40|$|Employee {{retention}} {{of an organization}} 2 ̆ 7 s most talented and skilled employees is vital to success. A lack of managerial strategies for motivating teams {{and a lack of}} understanding employees 2 ̆ 7 needs adds to an increased rate of employee turnover in banking organizations. Some bank managers do not possess the abilities and strategies required to reduce employee turnover. Grounded by the motivation-hygiene theory; the purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore successful strategies some bank managers used to reduce employee turnover. The population consisted of 5 banking managers in 3 banking organizations located in Toronto GTA, Ontario Canada in which successful retention strategies have been implemented in the last 5 years. Data were collected from semistructured face-to-face interviews and employee handbooks. Member checking aided to assure the credibility of the analysis and interpretations. Data were analyzed by using coding techniques to identify keywords, phrases, and concepts. The process led to the following 4 themes: (a) the motivational effect to <b>retain</b> <b>bank</b> employees, (b) management traits to <b>retain</b> <b>bank</b> employees, (c) effective strategies to <b>retain</b> <b>bank</b> employees, and (d) trends shaping future {{retention of}} bank employees. The implications for social change include the potential to reduce turnover by improving the employee work experience and retaining talent by building a positive work environment and a positive customer experience...|$|R

In this paper I develop the hypothesis that the derivative premium' is higher in firms with centralised FX exposure management, compared to a decentralised approach in which subsidiaries <b>retain</b> <b>bank</b> contacts and/or decision-making authority. This study benefits from unique survey data on the FX management practices and derivative usage of Swedish listed firms. The data supports the centralisation-hypothesis.

40|$|Academic {{attention}} to the central <b>bank's</b> <b>retained</b> profits has been scarce, although their magnitudes are nontrivial. This paper confirms that the profits retained as a reserve fund, if combined with unconstrained bureaucratic discretion, can engender inflationary bias. This result is intriguing because the previous literature emphasizes a similar distortion in monetary policy for the opposite case where those profits are {{turned over to the}} Treasury. We therefore propose that some external changes in central-banking institutions alone may not warrant their desired 'outcome' without reining in excessive discretion. This proposition can provide a beneficial implication for establishing the meaningful independence of central <b>banks.</b> <b>retained</b> profits, central <b>banking,</b> transparency, bureaucratic discretion, inflationary bias...|$|R
