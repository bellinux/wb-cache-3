Since that rocket has a single nozzle, the dual axis gimbal can not <b>control</b> rocket <b>roll.</b> Thus, {{this version of the}} engine {{deviates}} a bit of the preburner hot gas to two opposite <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{on the side of the}} launch vehicle.

The cutting {{performance}} in abrasive waterjet (AWJ) multipass cutting {{with and without}} <b>controlled</b> <b>nozzle</b> oscillation is presented based on an experimental investigation cutting an 87 % alumina ceramic. The cutting capacity {{in terms of the}} depth of cut and the kerf geometrical features is analyzed with respect to the process variables. It is found that multipass cutting is a viable means to increase the cutting performance and application domain of this technology, while a further increase in the cutting performance can be made by using a <b>controlled</b> <b>nozzle</b> oscillation technique...|$|R

50|$|In {{aeronautics}} spoilerons, {{also known}} as spoiler ailerons, are flight control surfaces, specifically spoilers {{that can be used}} asymmetrically to provide adequate <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> if aileron action would produce excessive wing twist on a very flexible wing or if wide-span flaps prevent adequate aileron <b>roll</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R

40|$|A flight {{dynamics}} evaluation {{was performed in}} order to analyse {{the ability to use}} the outer flap for <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> as well. Based on the A 350 flap system architecture, where the outer flap can be deployed independently from the inner flap by using an active differential gear box, two different concepts were identified as potentially benefitial for the desired purpose. In both concepts the inner ailerons were removed in order to save weight and system complexity and the outer flap performs (all speed) <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> together with the outer (low speed) aileron. Concept 1 comprises the usual flap geometry and the outer aileron, whereas concept 2 comprises an outer flap, which is extended in spanwise direction by the length of the inner aileron. The flight dynamic evaluation revealed that {{for the use of the}} outer flaps for regular <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> flap dynamics are necessary of at least 16 °/s flap deflection rate in order to fulfill requirements from certification specification CS- 25 and handling quality criteria. A system analysis showed that the existing active differential gear box from A 350 is unfortunately only able to deflect the flap with a maximum rate of 0. 43 °/s, or with slight modifications of the existing active differential gear box a maximum deflection rate of 1. 4 °/s could be feasible. These values showed to be insufficient for regular <b>roll</b> <b>control.</b> Nevertheless, in case of dual loss of hydraulic power the only available <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> could be performed by one remaining pair of ailerons, which are driven by an electrical back-up hydraulic actuator at the A 350. In order to still enable <b>roll</b> <b>control,</b> if these electrical back-up hydraulic actuators fail additionally, it was analysed whether the outer flap could be used as emergency <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> with the aforementioned feasible flap dynamics. The results showed that the handling qualities with this flap system ensuring <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> are barely controllable. However, it appears feasible to reach degraded but acceptable handling qualities if the system dynamics could be slightly increased...|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the whole flight control {{strategy}} should be reconsidered taking account of characteristics of plasma actuators. One preliminary <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> system with DBD plasma actuators {{is shown in}} the figure.It can be seen that plasma actuators deployed on the both sides of an airfoil. The <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> can be controlled by activating plasma actuators according to the roll angle feedback.After studying various feedback control methodologies, the bang-bang control method was chosen to design the <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> system based on plasma actuators. The reason is that bang-bang control is time optimal and insensitive to plasma actuations, which quickly vary in difference atmospheric and electric conditions.|$|R

50|$|The Wrights solved {{both the}} control and power {{problems}} that confronted aeronautical pioneers. They invented <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> using wing warping and combined roll with simultaneous yaw control using a steerable rear rudder. Although wing-warping {{as a means of}} <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> was used only briefly during the early history of aviation, the innovation of combining <b>roll</b> and yaw <b>control</b> was a fundamental advance in flight control. For pitch control, the Wrights used a forward elevator (canard), another design element that later became outmoded.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the real-time flow and control characteristics of a flying wing with articulated winglets is described in this paper.

Results {{presented in this paper}} do provide good evidence of the concept's ability to adequately perform both tasks, although for the current chosen wing/winglet configuration, <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> authority was unable to achieve, per unit of control surface deflection, the same level of performance set by modern aileron-based <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> methodologies...|$|R

40|$|When {{a rocket}} is launched, {{there is a}} short initial period of {{acceleration}} during which the rocket is unstable. As the flight velocity increases, the aerodynamic forces acting on the fins and stabilizers become large enough to give stability. Various methods have been employed to stabilize the rocket during this launching period. Guide rails, "zero length" launchers, booster rockets which produce high initial acceleration, and auto-pilot <b>controlled</b> <b>nozzles</b> are typical devices that have been used. This is {{an investigation of the}} requirements of a <b>nozzle</b> <b>control</b> which would stabilize the rocket during the launching period. The configuration investigated is unique in that the nozzle of the rocket is mounted as a compound pendulum, and the movement of the pendulum is utilized to furnish the signal for the <b>nozzle</b> <b>control</b> servo-mechanism, thereby eliminating the need for gyroscopic elements in the control system. The pendulum motion of the nozzle caused by a change in flight attitude of the rocket is introduced into a computer which produces an output signal proportional to the attitude of the rocket. This attitude signal is fed back to the <b>nozzle</b> <b>control,</b> which positions the nozzle. The results of the analysis showed that the rocket was unstable during the take-off period when the <b>nozzle</b> <b>control</b> acted on the rocket attitude signal alone. Stability over a narrow range of feedback gains was indicated for the system using a simple lead circuit as a <b>nozzle</b> <b>control,</b> or in other words, when the <b>nozzle</b> <b>control</b> acted on both the attitude signal and the rate of change of attitude of the rocket. The damping characteristics of this system were poor. By changing the <b>nozzle</b> <b>control</b> function to include a response to the acceleration of the rocket attitude, the damping characteristics were improved and the range of feedback gains was widened...|$|R
