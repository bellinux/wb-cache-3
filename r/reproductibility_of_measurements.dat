40|$|Purpose: Revolutionary {{endovascular}} {{treatments are}} on the verge of being available for management of ascending aortic diseases. Morphometric measurements of the ascending aorta have already been done with ECG-gated MDCT to help such therapeutic development. However the reliability of these measurements remains unknown. The objective of this work was to compare the intraobserver and interobserver variability of CAD (computer aided diagnosis) versus manual measurements in the ascending aorta. Methods and materials: Twenty-six consecutive patients referred for ECG-gated CT thoracic angiography (64 -row CT scanner) were evaluated. Measurements of the maximum and minimum ascending aorta diameters at mid-distance between the brachiocephalic artery and the aortic valve were obtained automatically with a commercially available CAD and manually by two observers separately. Both observers repeated the measurements during a different session at least one month after the first measurements. Intraclass coefficients as well the Bland and Altman method were used for comparison between measurements. Two-paired t-test was used to determine the significance of intraobserver and interobserver differences (alpha = 0. 05). Results: There is a significant difference between CAD and manual measurements in the maximum diameter (p = 0. 004) for the first observer, whereas the difference was significant for minimum diameter between the second observer and the CAD (p < 0. 001). Interobserver variability showed a weak agreement when measurements were done manually. Intraobserver variability was lower with the CAD compared to the manual measurements (limits of variability: from - 0. 7 to 0. 9 mm for the former and from - 1. 2 to 1. 3 mm for the latter). Conclusion: In order to improve <b>reproductibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> whenever needed, pre- and post-therapeutic management of the ascending aorta may benefit from follow-up done by a unique observer with the help of CAD...|$|E

40|$|For {{accurate}} {{analysis of}} serial coronary angiograms {{in a given}} patient over time, {{it is important to}} acquire paired angiograms recorded in exactly the same condition. Using the automatic gantry setting, we evaluated the geometric reproducibility of coronary angiograms and the reproducibility <b>of</b> vessel <b>measurements</b> in serial quantitative coronary angiography. Coronary angiograms of 40 patitents who underwent PTCA were analyzed before PTCA, after PTCA (medium-term) and at follow-up (long-term). The geometric reproducibility of coronary angiograms was assessed by comparing 120 angles between the major coronary branches. Reproducibility on vessel analysis was evaluated by measuring the minimal lumen diameter (MLD) of 120 non-dilated segments. Differences in the angles of the X-ray gantry were small and the standard deviation of the differences was not more than 0. 5 degrees. The differences in the <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> the angles between the major coronary branches were 0. 1 ± 1. 2 degrees in the same frame pre-PTCA, 0. 1 ± 3. 4 degrees between pre- and post-PTCA, and 0. 8 ± 4. 7 degrees between pre-PTCA and at follow-up.

The colorimetric micro-method of Mendelsohn was also satisfactory in the analyses of pure fatty acids, fatty acids added to a serum, and a fatty acid as a component of standard lipid mixtures. In the analyses of palmitic, stearic, and oleic acid solutions, the mean values ranged from 97 to 118 percent of actual values. The recoveries of palmitic and oleic acids added to a serum ranged from 81 to 111 percent in four different experiments. In the determination of oleic acid from mixtures of several lipids, the recovery ranged from 95 to 107 percent. The <b>reproductibility</b> <b>of</b> the method was also fair in replicate analyses of a standard serum on 11 different days. The individual determinations ranged from 768 to 1046 μEq per liter of serum with a mean of 917. The mean values of 11 different experiments ranged from 830 to 1013 μEq per liter of serum. A comparison of methods was made by analyzing four standard sera in replicate by both methods. The values of the non-esterified fatty acids by the method of Mendelsohn were approximately twice those by the method of Trout et al. The difference was attributed to the degrees of extraction of non-esterified fatty acids and/or other acids from the serum by the two methods. The concentrations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the sera and the erythrocytes of 16 subjects of both sexes, ranging in age from 23 to 66 years, were determined by an adaptation of the colorimetric method of Mendelsohn.

Methods: The NHP was administered on two occasions four weeks apart to a group of hospital hemodialysis program patients who were clinically stable according to their physicians. Correlations of scores and agreement of first and second administrations were assessed together with internal consistency. Afterwards, analyses were repeated taking into account the time (before, during or after the dialysis) and the method of administration (self vs interviewer), and the interviewer. Results: Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) between responses to the first and to the second administration were > 0. 6 for all of the six dimensions of the NHP (range= 0. 69 - 0. 85) and in every sub-group analyzed (P 0. 4 (0. 48 - 0. 65). Internal consistency was 0. 91 for the whole profile and > 0. 5 (0. 58 - 0. 86) when analyzed by individual dimensions. Reliability did not vary significantly with the time nor the method of administration (self or interviewer). Conclusions: Overall, results suggest that the Spanish version of NHP is sufficiently reliable to be used in ESRD patients. While a higher reliability would have been achieved by a shorter retest period, the study provides a realistic approximation to the reliability of the questionnaire in actual research and clinical applications. reliability health status quality of life evaluation questionnaires Nottingham Health Profile cross-cultural research follow-up studies...|$|R
40|$|For many years, {{accounting}} discourse {{has been}} concerned with the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> attributes of accounting events. The concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> forms one <b>of</b> the central pillars on which the preparation of financial statements is based. For example, financial statements can only be prepared if economic events meet the definition of {{an element of the}} financial statements and have a cost or value that can be measured with reliability. This has created the belief that accounting practices are practices <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The principles <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> require that every process <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> be based on an appropriate theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> Given the belief in the accounting discipline that accounting practices are synonymous with practices <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> it is to be assumed that acceptable theories <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> exist in the discipline. However, over the decades, researchers in this field have been unsuccessful in creating an acceptable theory <b>of</b> accounting <b>measurement.</b> This suggests that there is a gap between the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and the scientific principles <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The main goals of this thesis are to determine whether the concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in accounting is in harmony with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and to develop a conceptual model <b>of</b> the accounting <b>measurement</b> problem. Representational theory establishes measurement in the social sciences. Accounting is regarded as a social science. This study applies the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> to determine the nature of the gap between the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and the principles of this theory. The very fact of referring to accounting as a measurement discipline implies the presence of an established and well-known theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in that discipline: a discipline cannot be referred to as a measurement discipline without the existence of such a theory. Therefore, the lack of success of researchers in creating a theory <b>of</b> accounting <b>measurement</b> suggests that accounting is not a measurement discipline and that accountants are currently unaware of this. To test this hypothesis: 1. A critical literature analysis was conducted, investigating whether the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is in harmony with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The results <b>of</b> this analysis indicated that the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is not in harmony with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> 2. A questionnaire was sent to accountants, testing whether they were familiar with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and their application to the accounting discipline. The results of the survey indicated that accountants are not familiar with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> or their application to the accounting discipline. The main contributions of this study lie in the fact that it reveals that current accounting practices are not in harmony with the principles <b>of</b> representational <b>measurement.</b> Accountants should be educated in the purpose of the principles <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in the social sciences in order to ensure their proper application during accounting measurement.
