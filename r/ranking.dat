5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to <b>ranking</b> member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another <b>ranking</b> membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one <b>ranking</b> membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his <b>ranking</b> membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as <b>ranking</b> member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as <b>ranking</b> member.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} a {{respective}} nation's jury was required to rank every song, except that of their own country. The voting results from each {{member of a}} particular nation's jury were combined to produce an overall <b>ranking</b> from first to last place. Likewise, the televoting results were also interpreted as a full <b>ranking,</b> {{taking into account the}} full televoting result rather than just the top ten. The combination of the jury's full <b>ranking</b> and the televote's full <b>ranking</b> produced an overall <b>ranking</b> of all competing entries. The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. In the event of a televoting(insufficient amount of votes/technical issues) or jury failure(technical issue/breach of rules), only a jury/televoting was used by each country.|$|E
