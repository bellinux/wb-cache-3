25|$|The first afghani (ISO 4217 code: AFA) was {{introduced}} in 1925. In addition to being subdivided into 100 pul, 20 afghani were equal to one amani. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> from the rupee is sometimes quoted as 1 afghani = 1 rupee 6 paisa, based on the silver contents of the last rupee coins and the first Afghani coins. The Afghani initially contained 9 grams of silver.|$|E
25|$|Gonadal steroidgenesis {{in girls}} starts with {{production}} of testosterone which is typically quickly converted to estradiol inside the ovaries. However the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> from testosterone to estradiol (driven by FSH/LH balance) during early puberty is highly individual, resulting in very diverse development patterns of secondary sexual characteristics. Production of progesterone in the ovaries {{begins with the}} development of ovulatory cycles in girls (during the lutheal phase of the cycle), before puberty low levels of progesterone are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls.|$|E

50|$|Cretan Muslims were of mainly Greek origin, with {{in certain}} cases some Turkish ancestry through {{intermarriage}} with {{the small number of}} Turks who settled on Ottoman Crete. Many Cretan Greeks had converted to Islam {{in the wake of the}} Ottoman conquest of Crete.

25|$|Lactate {{dehydrogenase}} catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD+. It converts pyruvate, {{the final}} product of glycolysis, to lactate when oxygen is absent or in short supply, and it performs the reverse reaction during the Cori cycle in the liver. At high concentrations of lactate, the enzyme exhibits feedback inhibition, and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> of pyruvate to lactate is decreased. It also catalyzes the dehydrogenation of 2-Hydroxybutyrate, {{but it is a}} much poorer substrate than lactate.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the main RAFT equilibrium (Figure 5) {{is affected by the}} relative stabilities of the RAFT adduct radical (Pn-S-C•(Z)-S-Pm) and its fragmentation products, namely S=C(Z)S-Pn and polymeric radical (Pm•). If formation of the RAFT adduct radical is sufficiently thermodynamically favorable, the concentration of active species, Pm•, will be reduced to the extent that a reduction in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> of monomer into polymer is also observed, as compared to an equivalent polymerization without RAFT agent. Such a polymerization, is referred to as a rate-retarded RAFT polymerization.|$|E
25|$|The rate of a RAFT polymerization, that is, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> of monomer into polymer, mainly {{depends on}} {{the rate of the}} Propagation {{reaction}} (Figure 5) because the rate of initiation and termination are much higher than the rate of propagation. The rate of propagation is proportional to the concentration, , of the active species P•, whereas the rate of the termination reaction, being second order, is proportional to the square 2. This means that during rate-retarded RAFT polymerizations, the rate of formation of termination products is suppressed {{to a greater extent than}} the rate of chain growth.|$|E

30|$|Whilst {{prospective}} and retrospective {{studies have}} similar <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> into published manuscripts, our {{results suggest that}} high-impact-factor journals consider prospective studies more favourably.

25|$|Bisulfite {{sequencing}} {{relies on}} the conversion of every single unmethylated cytosine residue to uracil. If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in false positive results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulfite, therefore denaturation of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical. It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in agarose gel {{has been reported to}} improve the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> by keeping strands of DNA physically separate.|$|E
25|$|The Australian pound, {{introduced}} in 1910 and officially distinct in value from the pound sterling since devaluation in 1931, {{was replaced by}} the dollar on 14 February 1966. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> for the new decimal currency was two dollars per Australian pound, or ten Australian shillings per dollar. The exchange rate was pegged to the pound sterling at a rate of $1 = 8 shillings ($2.50 = UK £1). In 1967, Australia effectively left the sterling area, when the pound sterling was devalued against the US dollar and the Australian dollar did not follow. It maintained its peg to the US dollar at the rate of A$1 = US$1.12.|$|E
25|$|Navalar {{established}} the world's first Hindu school {{adapted to the}} modern needs that succeeded and flourished. While the school he established in Chidamharam in 1865 has survived to this day, similar schools seem to have spread only to two nearby towns. In Sri Lanka, eventually {{more than one hundred}} and fifty primary and secondary schools emerged from his work. Many of the students of these schools were successful in defending the Hindu Saiva culture not only against Christian missionary activities but also against neo-Hindu sects. His reforms and contributions were added to by scholars such as V. Kalyanasundaram (1883—1953), and Maraimalai Adigal (1876–1950), who developed their own schools of theology within the Hindu Saiva heritage. Although it is difficult to quantify as to how many Hindus may have converted to Protestant Christianity without his intervention but according to Bishop Sabapathy Kulendran, the low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> compared to the initial promise was due to Navalar's activities.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{willingness}} of al-Ma'mun and his successors to embrace the non-Arab populations of the Caliphate, especially in the Iranian East, {{as well as to}} entrust the governance of these provinces to local dynasties with considerable autonomy, helped to end a long series of religious rebellions and reconciled these populations to Islam: the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> during al-Ma'mun's reign increased markedly, and that was the time when most of the local princely families of the Iranian lands finally became Muslims.

2500|$|Glycogen {{depletion}} can be forestalled {{in three}} possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates {{with the highest}} possible <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> to blood glucose (high glycemic index) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel, [...] sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores {{as a result of}} exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores. This process is known as carbohydrate loading. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion.|$|E
