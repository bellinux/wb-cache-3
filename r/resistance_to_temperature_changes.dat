40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} a {{verification}} of coating quality {{in the area of}} construction joints of a window frame and a casement. Individual samples of eight windows were long term exposed to laboratory conditions that simulate extreme weather conditions during all climatic periods. The main aim of the partial examinations is to obtain information on the quality of different coatings, especially on their adhesion, elasticity, and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>changes.</b> The practical part of the thesis is dealing with assessing and documentation of sample states, especially their corner joints, {{at the beginning of the}} experiment, as well as during and after the testing. All changes are thoroughly recorded as evidenced by the detailed visual documentation. In the final part, the tests are evaluated with emphasis on frequent defects that occur in practice. The issue of window surface finishes is still an ongoing topic, many problems often occurring in few months after placing windows into the building must be dealt with...|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{dependent}} in-plane impedance spectroscopy {{measurements were}} carried out in order to analyze the charge transport properties of functional oxide NiMn_(2) O_(4) {{negative temperature coefficient thermistor}} films deposited via aerosol deposition techniques onto glass and Al_(2) O_(3) substrates. The in-plane resistivity (ρ) versus temperature (T) curves of all films were uniform over a large temperature range (180 K to 500 K) and showed the typical exponential power-law behavior associated with variable-range hopping. The ρ-T dependences of annealed and as-deposited films exhibited power-law exponents ρ of about 0. 6 and thermistor constants B in the range of 3500 K to 5000 K. As-deposited films showed higher ρ values as compared to annealed films. As-deposited films exhibited also increased B values, leading to increased sensitivity of the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>changes,</b> whereas annealed films deposited on Al_(2) O_(3) showed the lowest scatter in differentiated ρ-T data and might display superior reliability for temperature sensing applications...|$|E
30|$|Mn 2 + {{has shown}} to be a very active {{catalyst}} for oxidation of SO 2 in aqueous solution [6]. Copper slag has high mechanical strength and high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>changes.</b> It seems to be a suitable material to support Mn ions. In the metallurgical industry, copper slag is produced as a byproduct of the smelting process [7]. Mechanical stability and acidic solution resistance, suitable surface for supporting catalyst on it, non-coagulation and geometric shape and high temperature resistance are the most important properties of copper slag [8]. Optimizing processes reduce costs and increase productivity. Recently, response surface method (RSM) is a mathematical and statistical technique used for modeling and optimization of various processes such as removal of organic and many dyes from different wastewater by different process [9, 10, 11, 12]. The Box-Behnken design (BBD) in RSM is an important design, implement used for optimization of processes. BBD prepares comprehensive results and detailed information even for a smaller number of experiments and positive influences of operating parameters on all responses [13]. The main goal {{of this study is to}} optimize the efficiency of SO 2 catalytic oxidation in aqueous solution. In current research, a novel Mn/copper slags nanocatalyst prepared by impregnation method and characterized by XRD, FESEM, EDX and FTIR analysis. The conductometry method is a powerful tool for monitoring SO 2 oxidation and used for determination of catalyst performance. A Box-Behnken design was selected to study the effects of operational parameter such as temperature, reaction time, and amount of nanocatalyst on the efficiency of the SO 2 oxidation process.|$|E

A critical factor is the degree of dependence of the electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>change.</b> CNT-dispersant coating and CNT-silicone-compound are compared as possible solutions. Results: CNT-dispersant-coatings and CNT-silicone-coatings, made of multi-walled {{carbon nanotube}}s and singlewalled carbon nanotubes were tested for variations in resistivity to changes of environmental conditions of humidity and temperature. The resistance of coatings consisting of "Baytubes C 150 P" and gum arabic is highly influenced by humidity while the silicone-compound using the SZ nanotubes is hardly affected.

30|$|In this study, an ASIC {{preamplifier}} for {{magnetic field}} observations by an MSEE sensor probe was designed, developed, and assessed. This ASIC preamplifier included low-noise differential amplifiers, gain adjustment amplifiers, and temperature-compensated BGR circuits for a 3 -axis loop antenna in a 5 × 5  mm bare chip. The NEMI for the ASIC preamplifier {{combined with a}} 0.01 -m^ 2 loop was adequate {{for the detection of}} whistler-mode waves excited by an electron beam from the Space Shuttle (Fig.  7) and an LF standard electromagnetic wave for a virtual sounding rocket experiment (Fig.  12). The ASIC preamplifier showed a high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> (Fig.  8) and TID radiation (Fig.  9). Fundamental temperature and radiation issues on the miniaturization of MSEE sensor probe were solved by using our developed ASIC preamplifier. A distributed MSEE sensor network motivates separating spatial and temporal variations of plasma phenomena. One remaining issue is the evaluation of the threshold for latch-up caused by MeV-level particles and to embed a latch-up protection circuit in the chip. Furthermore, a chopper stabilization technique (e.g., Yan et al. 2014) will be considered to markedly improve the flicker noise characteristics of the ASIC preamplifier in a future ASIC design. Finally, a major goal of the MSEE sensor probes is to reveal the plasma wave turbulence caused by space missions.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was the {{development}} of a high performance aerostatic guide which combines the advantages of the aerostatic lubrication with the properties of ceramics. It will be shown the possibility to create a precision guide by using advanced techniques of manufacture, for example joining with ceramic foils and glass solders, ultrasonic machining and laserdrill. On account of the clean lubricant air, the stable ceramics and the exact aerostatic guide the ceramic guide can be applied in the chemical and food industry, in measuring stages, ultraprecision machines, cryogenics and high temperature engineering. In the following, the soldering by glass solders and joining by a ceramic foil are presented as alternative to two further joining methods. Using these joining techniques enable the production of ceramics/ceramics-, glass ceramics/glass ceramics- and metal/ceramnics bonds. Basis on this joining techniques it will be shown the possibility to creat a precision aerostatic guide of high performance which units the advantages of the aerostatic guide with the properties of ceramics. The use of the ceramic guide leads to an increased performance because the range of operation tends to higher temperatures. Furthermore ceramics are superior materials for protection against wear and corrosion. Accordingly, the most important requirements for a ceramic guide material to meet are high hardness, good resistance to deformation, high corrosion resistance with sufficient <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> and chemical stability. From the precision mechanical view, the lower weight combined with a lower density and a lower thermal expansion are favourable properties in comparison with metal guide materials.

Levels of temperatures were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 ºC and osmotic potential with four levels of (0, - 5, - 10 and - 15 bars). Results indicated {{that the effects of}} species, temperature and osmotic potential and also interactions of species and temperature with stress were significant. Germination rate and percentage and also length of radicle and plumule were decreased as stress intensity increased. Optimum temperature for germination percentage was 15 ºC and for germination rate, length of radicle and plumule was 20 ºC. Ajowan and dill seeds showed the highest and lowest <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> and osmotic potential. Water deficit had more inhibitory effects on germination rate and percentage and - 15 bar caused complete failure in germination. Effect of salinity was more pronounced on length of radicle and plumule compared with the effects of water deficit. In both drought and salinity percentage reduction for plumule length was higher which indicate the higher sensitivity of this trait to stress in comparison with radicle length...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{radiation}} and corrosion damage in nuclear materials {{has become increasingly}} important in reactor design considerations. However, running irradiation damage studies in nuclear reactors is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, accurate, quick simulations have become more attractive to researchers studying alternative materials in nuclear reactors. This thesis investigates the possibility of automating irradiation damage studies using ion stopping range simulations coupled with heat generation simulations to find the <b>change</b> in <b>temperature</b> across a sample. The range simulations generate 1 D slabs with different thicknesses and bombards them with high-energy proton beams. The slabs are automatically sorted, a meshed geometry is created, and the recoil energy information is entered into a multiphysics Finite- Element solver. Ultimately, the optimal beam current for which the temperature gradient across a coolant-sample geometry is less than 5 K is predicted. This thesis examines the possibility of automating the entire simulation process so that many materials and slab thicknesses can be tested for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> (and thus implying specifics of radiation damage effects). by Gabrielle J.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the project was}} the development of an electrochromic thin layer cell, as a prototype, based on sol-gel technology. The processability of sol-gel materials as layer systems was considered for two different applications (anti-glare rearview mirrors and Smart Windows). The reproducible preparation of coating sols was scaled-up from a laboratory scale to the technical scale of 3 l. The pot-lives of the sols was at least 6 weeks stored in cool conditions. The reverse dip-coating technique for the deposition of coatings on one side only was realised on a pilot-scale for substrates up to 50 cm x 50 cm. The swinging-in behaviour and the longterm behaviour of the electrochromic layers was optimised via statistical experimental methods. An organic-inorganic ion-conducting solid-state electrolyte was developed, which simultaneously provides for the laminate construction of the cells. Demonstrator cells in laminate construction were produced in two formats: ITO/WO_ 3 /electrolyte/CeO_ 2 -TiO_ 2 /ITO. The transmission of the cells changed between 70 % and 30 % in switching times of under 50 s for the smaller format and of around 5 min for the larger format over more than 10 " 4 cycles, without loss of quality. Through the employment of butyl rubber as a sealant, a <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> in the range - 20 C to + 80 C was achieved. The incorporation of an organic UV-absorber in the electrolyte or the application of an UV-protective film ensured a high UV-stability of the devices (240 h Suntest without loss of quality). For these reasons, the developed EC-system offers a very high potential for the inexpensive fabrication of electrochromic architectural glazing. (orig.)

40|$|Orbital thermal {{infrared}} (TIR) remote sensing {{is an important}} tool for characterizing geologic surfaces on Earth and Mars. However, deposition of material from volcanic or eolian activity results in bedrock surfaces becoming significantly mantled over time, hindering the accuracy of TIR compositional analysis. Moreover, interplay between particle size, albedo, composition and surface roughness add complexity to these interpretations. Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) is {{the measure of the}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> and has been used to determine parameters such as grain/block size, density/mantling, and the presence of subsurface soil moisture/ice. Our objective is to document the quantitative relationship between ATI derived from orbital visible/near infrared (VNIR) and {{thermal infrared}} (TIR) data and tephra fall mantling of the Mono Craters and Domes (MCD) in California, which were chosen as an analog for partially mantled flows observed at Arsia Mons volcano on Mars. The ATI data were created from two images collected ~ 12 h apart by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument. The results were validated with a quantitative framework developed using fieldwork that was conducted at 13 pre-chosen sites. These sites ranged in grain size from ash-sized to meter-scale blocks and were all rhyolitic in composition. Block size and mantling were directly correlated with ATI. Areas with ATI under 2. 3 × 10 − 2 were well-mantled with average grain size below 4 cm; whereas values greater than 3. 0 × 10 − 2 corresponded to mantle-free surfaces. Correlation was less accurate where checkerboard-style mixing between mantled and non-mantled surfaces occurred below the pixel scale as well as in locations where strong shadowing occurred. However, the results validate that the approach is viable for a large majority of mantled surfaces on Earth and Mars. This is relevant for determining the volcanic history of Mars, for example. Accurate identification of non-mantled lava surfaces within an apparently well-mantled flow field on either planet provides locations to extract important mineralogical constraints on the individual flows using TIR data...|$|R

40|$|A novel beam-supported {{membrane}} (BSM) {{structure for}} the fiber optic extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI) sensors showing an enhanced performance and an improved <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> was proposed for detecting partial discharges (PDs). The fundamental frequency, sensitivity, linear range, and flatness of the BSM structure were investigated by employing the finite element simulations. Compared with the intact membrane (IM) structure commonly used by EFPI sensors, BSM structure provides extra geometrical parameters to define the fundamental frequency when {{the diameter of the}} whole membrane and its thickness is determined, resulting in an enhanced design flexibility of the sensor structure. According to the simulation results, it is noted that BSM structure not only shows a much higher sensitivity (increased by almost four times for some cases), and a wider working range of fundamental frequency to choose, but also an improved linear range, making the system development much easier. In addition, BSM structure presents a better flatness than its IM counterpart, providing an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A further improvement of performance is thought to be possible with a step-forward structural optimization. The BSM structure shows a great potential to design the EFPI sensors, as well as others for detecting the acoustic signals...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} Cochlear Implants (CI’s) with {{improved}} functionality and quality requires new techniques {{to be used}} to manufacture the electrode array. Titanium nitride (TiN) is one of the contenders for use as metal in the future CI’s, but its characteristics need to be verified, measured and tested. A metal should comply to certain requirements like the ability to deliver enough charge to the nerve ending in the saline environment of the cochlea. TiN is able to withstand a high current density (2. 8 mAµm 2), while aluminium failed due to electromigration; even when coated with TiN. The resistance of a 10 mm long and 5 µm wide track decreases from 1. 08 · 104 Ω to 6. 9 · 102 Ω when a combination of Al and TiN is made. This solves the reasonably high resistance of TiN. The self-heating and the <b>change</b> in <b>resistance</b> due <b>to</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> (TCR) are measured, because the amount of dissipated heat should stay as low as possible. TiN has a low TCR, 5. 9 · 10 − 4. Furthermore, the metal must not dissolve in the environment, which can be checked by a (cyclic) voltammetry and by endurance tests. TiN was able to withstand the harsh tests. The improved functionality and quality asks for the addition of transistors to the electrode array.
