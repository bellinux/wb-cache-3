40|$|Abstract – Deployment {{of passive}} RFID systems or RFID-enhanced sensor {{networks}} requires {{good understanding of}} the energy scavenging principles. This paper focuses on the energy scavenging design considerations of inductively coupled passive RFID systems. The theoretical estimation of the power by an RF antenna is derived, {{and the effect of}} the design parameters on the harvested power is investigated. It is shown that the power delivery performance is largely affected by the tag load at the reader. An adaptive matching circuit at the reader is proposed for achieving optimum power delivery performance when the reader has a variable load. Experimental studies confirm analytical derivations. interrogation periods, and this energy is used to power tag IC. For the maximum reading range, one has to ensure the maximum power transfer efficiency from the reader to the tag. What makes the problem challenging is {{that in the case of}} inductively coupled reader-tag, the reader must deal with a changing effective load due to (a) the location-dependent mutual coupling effect between the reader and tag and (b) unpredictable number of tags in the <b>read</b> <b>zone</b> of the reader...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} make control decisions, Smart Buildings need to collect data from {{multiple}} sources {{and bring it to}} a central location, such as the Building Management System (BMS). This {{needs to be done in}} a timely and automated fashion. Besides data being gathered from different energy using elements, information of occupant behaviour is also important for a building’s requirement analysis. In this paper, the parameter of Occupant Density was considered to help find behaviour of occupants towards a building space. Through this parameter, support for building energy consumption and requirements based on occupant need and demands was provided. The demonstrator presented provides information on the number of people present in a particular building space at any time, giving the space density. Such collections of density data made over a certain period of time represents occupant behaviour towards the building space, giving its usage patterns. Similarly, inventory items were tracked and monitored for moving out or being brought into a particular <b>read</b> <b>zone.</b> For both, people and inventory items, this was achieved using small, low-cost, passive Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. Occupants were given the tags in a form factor of a credit card to be possessed at all times.

40|$|Ultra high {{frequency}} (UHF) {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) systems suffer from issues that limit their widespread deployment and {{limit the number of}} applications where they can be used. These limitations are: lack of a well defined <b>read</b> <b>zone,</b> interference, and environment sensitivity. To overcome these limitations a novel receiver device is introduced into the system. The use of such device or devices mitigates the issues by enabling more "anchor points" in the system. Two such devices exist in industry and academia: the Astraion Sensatag and the Gen 2 Listener. The drawbacks of the Sensatag is that it offers poor performance in capturing tag signals. The Gen 2 Listener is based on the expensive software defined radio hardware. The purpose of the thesis was to develop a receiver that will enable several new RFID applications that are not available with current RFID systems. The receiver, named ARR (Augmented RFID Receiver), receives tag and reader signals, which are decoded by an FPGA and the results are reported through Ethernet. This device is central to the augmented RFID system. To show the suitability of such an approach, the performance of the implementation was compared to the other two outlined solutions. A comparison of the read rate and range of the implementations were the defining factors. The analysis showed that the ARR is capable of receiving tag signals with a read rate of 50 % for passive and 66 % for semi-passive tags at a one meter distance and is capable of receiving tag signals at a maximum of 3. 25 meters for passive and 5. 5 meters for semi- passive tags, with the reader being within 8 meters of the ARR. Two applications were implemented to showcase the ARR: an RFID portal and protocol analyzer...|$|E

40|$|RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a {{wireless}} communication {{technology that is}} used in physical markers (RFID tags) to mark products. RFID is being increasingly applied in everyday life and thus is competing with widely used bar codes. RFID technology {{can be used to}} build systems aimed at automatic identification of tagged objects.

The best thing about RFID technology is that it is functional, with no need to 'see' the tag by the interrogator. When a tagged object enters the <b>reading</b> <b>zone</b> of an interrogator, the interrogator signals the tag to transmit its stored data to the controller via radio waves. Unlike bar codes technology, RFID can be much more effective in the process of production and storage of certain objects.

To address this problem, we first compute virtual displacements of the target RFID tag and then adopt Support Vector Machines to recognize absence or presence of human motion near the tag. Next, we divide the surveillance region into mm level grids to construct similarity matrixes of the tracked tag before and after human motion, which can accurately distinguish absence or presence of tag motion. Indeed, the optimization method based on phase-ambiguity is introduced to reduce computations. The results show that our method can achieve the average scenario classification accuracy of 96. 3 % and the average slight tag motion perception accuracy of 100 % with the hypersensitivity of 1 mm...|$|R

30|$|Schedulers {{in radio}} {{frequency}} identification dense environments aim at distributing optimally a set of t slots between a group of m readers. In single-channel environments, the readers within mutual interference range must transmit at different times; otherwise, interferences prevent identification of the tags. The goal is to maximize the expected number of tags successfully identified within the t slots. This problem may be formulated as a mixed integer non-linear mathematical program, which may effectively exploit available knowledge {{about the number of}} competing tags in the <b>reading</b> <b>zone</b> of each reader. In this paper, we present this optimization problem and analyze the impact of tag estimation in the performance achieved by the scheduler. The results demonstrate that optimal solutions outperform a reference scheduler based on dividing the available slots proportionally to the number of tags in each reader. In addition, depending on the scenario load, the results reveal that there exist an optimum number of readers for the topology considered, since the total average number of identifications depend non-linearly on the load. Finally, we study the effect of imperfect tag population knowledge on the performance achieved by the readers.|$|R

This study evaluated accuracy, reproducibility, and precision of automated inhibition <b>zone</b> <b>reading</b> using the "Sirscan automatic" zone reader (i 2 a, Perols Cedex, France). RESULTS: In a first step we compared Sirscan results with manual calliper measurements for comparability and accuracy. Sirscan readings were checked and adjusted on-screen as recommended by the manufacturer. One hundred clinical bacterial isolates representing {{a broad spectrum of}} organisms routinely isolated in a clinical laboratory were tested, and zone diameter values and interpretation according to EUCAST guidelines were compared. In a second step we analysed, whether fully automated <b>zone</b> <b>reading</b> can decrease standard deviation of diameter measurements and, thus, improve reproducibility and precision of the disk diffusion method. Standard deviations of manual measurements, on-screen adjusted Sirscan measurements, and fully automated Sirscan readings were compared for 19 repeat independent measurements of inhibition zones of S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. coli ATCC 25922, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (EUCAST quality control strains). On-screen adjusted Sirscan and calliper measurements displayed high comparability. No significant differences were detected comparing the results of both reading methods. Standard deviations of inhibition zone diameters were significantly lower for fully automated Sirscan measurements compared with both adjusted Sirscan readings and the manual method, resulting in better reproducibility and precision of the automated readings.

40|$|The {{availability}} of systems for automatic and simultaneous identification of several items {{belonging to a}} logistics unit during production, warehousing and delivering can improve supply chain management and speed traceability controls. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a powerful technique that potentially permits to reach this goal, but some aspects as, for instance, food product composition (e. g. moisture content, salt or sugar content) and some peculiarities of the production environment (high moisture, high/low temperatures, metallic structures) have prevented, so far, its application in food sector. In the food industry, composition and shape of items are much less regular than in other commodities sectors. In addition, {{a wide variety of}} packaging, composed by different materials, is employed. As material, size and shape of items to which the tag should be attached strongly influence the minimum power requested for tag functioning, performance improvements can be achieved only selecting suitable RF identifier for the specific combination of food product and packaging.
