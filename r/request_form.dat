The North American DVD and Blu-ray releases included previews, and the interviews with Hosoda, Kamiki, Sakuraba, Fuji, Tanimura and Saitō. The first press copies included art cards.

40|$|Aim: To {{document}} {{the frequencies of}} wrongly filled laboratory <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> {{with a view to}} improving process efficiency. Background: Available data have shown that 70 % of laboratory errors are preanalytical. Most hospitals in developing countries do not have standardized laboratory <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> and often, laboratory users do not provide all the required information needed for smooth laboratory operations; however, the frequency of these issues are often not documented. This study was aimed to {{document the}} frequencies of wrongly filled laboratory <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> with a view to improving process efficiency. Materials and Methods: This was a laboratory-based cross-sectional study. A total of 5000 laboratory <b>request</b> <b>forms,</b> collected from five different laboratory units in the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria were retrospectively reviewed for the completeness of information supplied in the <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> after obtaining appropriate ethical approval. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data collected. Results: Findings showed that laboratory <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> across hospital laboratories were not standardized following international best practice. Required information needed for efficient laboratory operations were either incomplete or not provided in the <b>request</b> <b>forms.</b> Conclusion: The need to standardize all <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> using global recommended template with a view to supplying all the necessary information required for smooth laboratory operation and generation of credible data is highlighted in this study...|$|R

METHOD: Assessment, in two health institutions, of 647 <b>forms</b> <b>requesting</b> skin biopsies {{in order to determine}} the completeness on the forms of the clinical details/items considered necessary for undertaking skin biopsies. RESULTS: Of the total 18 items on the forms, 7 were found to relay complete information in under 10 % of the forms and only 9 items were correctly completed in over 80 % of the requests. CONCLUSION: We concluded that information on many of the essential items required for a correct interpretation of the anatomopathologic examination was missing from the <b>request</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Radiology <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> are {{essential}} communication tools used by doctors referring patients for radiological investigations. Their importance, however, is highly underestimated. We {{set out to}} perform a process audit of the adequacy of completion of such <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> in St. Luke's Hospital, Malta. Methods: A representative sample of 200 randomly selected <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> received by the radiology department in early September 2004 was reviewed. These included requests {{for a variety of}} examinations from different departments within St. Luke's Hospital. A database of the collected forms was created, noting which of the various fields were adequately completed. Results: Only 4 % of the 200 <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> reviewed were completed in full. The percentages of the various fields completed were: patient's name and surname - 100 %; patient's full address - 77 %; patient's age - 29 %; referring ward - 95 %; referring doctor's signature - 100 %; referring doctor's name and surname - 34 %; name of responsible consultant - 91 %; question to be answered - 25 %. The patient's clinical background field was filled in 93 %. However, these were more often than not incomplete and unable to fulfil their purpose. Conclusions: There is ample room for change in current local practice...|$|R

40|$|Background: Research has {{demonstrated}} that most laboratory errors occur in the preanalytical phase of testing. In view of the paucity of studies examining preanalytical errors, we evaluated our laboratory <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> for the frequency and impact of incomplete data. Methods: This study examined all <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> received at our laboratory during a five-day period. The forms were scrutinized {{for the presence of}} specific parameters. The impact of abbreviated diagnoses was analysed, as well as how lack of ward or telephone details affects the communication of critical results to clinicians. Results: A total of 2550 <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> were analysed. Medication(s) used by the patient (89. 6 %) and doctor’s contact number (61. 2 %) were the most incomplete parameters. No diagnosis was provided on 19. 1 % of forms, and when a diagnosis was present it was an abbreviated form in 37. 3 %. This resulted in 35. 5 % of diagnoses not being recorded by reception staff. Incomplete ward information was found on 4. 9 % of forms. In a separate search, the impact of 151 <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> (collected over a period of eight months), with incomplete ward location information and corresponding to critical results was assessed. Critical results were not communicated by telephone to clinicians in 19. 9 % of cases. Conclusion: As laboratory data influences 70 % of medical diagnoses, incorrect or incomplete data provided to the laboratory could significantly impact the success and cost of overall treatment...|$|R

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Various publications have highlighted the significance of laboratory errors in the pre- and post-analytical phases {{and their impact on}} results. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a first-line thyroid function test and, if abnormal, reflex thyroxine (T 4) or tri-iodothyronine (T 3) testing is requested, depending on clinical and medication data provided. Interpretative comments are added to all TFT results. Objectives. In view of the paucity of articles describing such errors, we audited laboratory <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> <b>requesting</b> thyroid function tests (TFT), received from primary care clinics and regional hospitals at our laboratory. Design. We assessed 482 laboratory <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> for TFT from primary health care clinics for specific parameters. Results. A total of 482 forms were analysed. Medication/s used by the patient (74. 5 %) and doctor's contact number (65. 1 %) were the most commonly incomplete parameters. Of the 123 patients with medication details, 62 (50. 4 %) were on thyroxine. Conclusions. There are few studies examining the frequency and impact of incomplete laboratory forms on laboratory errors, and even fewer studies examining interpretative comments accompanying clinical biochemistry results. We studied how pre-analytical errors in completing <b>request</b> <b>forms</b> may lead to incorrect interpretative comments and inappropriate reflex testing, and so influence the quality of the post-analytical phase...|$|R
