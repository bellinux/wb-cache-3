50|$|The Kirby 23 {{sailboat}} {{was designed}} by Bruce Kirby and saw limited production circa 1985-1986. The hull from the very successful Sonar was modified to produce the Kirby 23 to enable it to complete in PHRF and Midget Ocean Racing Club (MORC) regattas. Basic modifications include the following; a galley, head, larger cabin, life lines, increased sail <b>area,</b> and increased <b>rudder</b> surface <b>area.</b> The boat has a PHRF rating around 178 which makes it competitive with other boats of the era such as the J/22, J/24, and S2 7.9 models.|$|R
25|$|The Sprat, {{though a}} smaller aircraft, had strong family resemblances {{to the earlier}} Velos torpedo bomber. The Sprat was a staggered, single-bay biplane with equal-span wings that could be folded for carrier stowage. The {{fuselage}} centre section was built around a tubular-steel structure which linked the engine mounting and the wooded-framed rear fuselage. The two dual-control open cockpits were both behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing for optimum visibility. Unusually, the instruments were placed on the rear spar of the upper wing centre section, where they could be read from both cockpits. The <b>rudder</b> <b>area</b> was large compared to that of the fin and a braced tailplane was placed on top of the rear fuselage.|$|E
500|$|Offshore, several ships came {{in contact}} with Bertha, many {{reported}} sustained winds of 35-58mph (56–93km/h) and a Canadian ship reported a barometric pressure of [...] The only reported shipwreck caused by Bertha was when the Corazon, a Greek freighter capsized and sank during the storm. The ship, which was off the coast of Cape Cod {{at the time of its}} sinking, was experiencing strong winds up to 78mph (126km/h) and 30feet (9.1m) waves. The rough seas caused the ship's keel to break, causing the crewmen to send a distress signal and evacuate the sinking vessel. During the evacuation, one crewman drowned when trying to board a lifeboat, his body was later found by a Soviet merchant ship. Another merchant ship, the Vyapel, spotted twelve of the 27sailors in their liferaft and the crew of the Vyapel tried to rescue the sailors but to no avail as the rough seas caused the liferaft to drift near the ships propeller and <b>rudder</b> <b>area.</b> The turbulence caused by the ships propeller knocked seven sailors into the water, five of them drowned and a search for their bodies continued until the following day. The remaining 21sailors were later rescued by crews of other freighters and merchant ships. An investigation by the United States Coast Guard revealed that the Corazon's lifeboats were in too poor of a condition to use in case of an emergency.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{flight testing}} [...] {{was made by}} Bert Hinkler, who asked Shorts to enlarge the aircraft's <b>rudder</b> <b>area</b> before he {{attempted}} to fly it. On 4 May Hinkler flew the aircraft for the first time, making a flight during which he achieved an average speed of [...] over a measured mile. [...] On landing Hinkler touched down first with the left- hand float, causing the aircraft to slew round, resulting in severe buckling of the float struts. Hinkler reported that the aircraft suffered from severe hunting at full throttle, admitting {{that he had been}} wrong about the <b>rudder</b> <b>area.</b> The main problem encountered was intake surging, which caused the engine to cut out intermittently.|$|E
50|$|In 1977 an {{increased}} <b>area</b> <b>rudder</b> with 2 in more {{added to the}} leading edge for better helm balance was introduced and this new rudder design could be retrofitted to older boats.

[...] A further development, the 901S1, had a more angular rudder and a fin without a fuselage fillet.|$|R
2500|$|The first Mk I {{production}} {{machines were}} ready fairly quickly, with deliveries starting in December 1937. These early aircraft featured fabric-covered wings, and a wooden, two-bladed, fixed-pitch propeller. Initially the tailwheel {{was designed to}} be retractable; early on it was discovered that the Hurricane needed a larger <b>rudder</b> <b>area</b> to improve the control characteristics during a spin. To this end {{the lower part of the}} rudder was extended and a distinctive ventral [...] "keel" [...] was added to the rear fuselage. The tailwheel was now fixed.|$|E
2500|$|Preliminary {{preflight}} runs {{had resulted}} {{in an increase in}} <b>rudder</b> <b>area</b> before the Possum's maiden flight on 19 June 1923. [...] It was piloted by Norman Macmillan, accompanied by the Possum's designer, Harold Bolas. On 15 April 1924 the Possum went to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and appeared at the RAF Hendon Air Pageant in June that year. [...] After some delay a second Possum was built, flying in April 1925 and transferred to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath in August 1925. [...] They were both active at Martlesham some time thereafter.|$|E

2500|$|A {{headrest}} fairing {{was added}} retrospectively to the NimrodIs, to ease pilot strain during catapult launches. [...] Aircraft from the later production batch were fitted with arrestor hooks. [...] Experiments {{with the first}} of this batch, refitted with swept upper and lower wings, lead to the NimrodII. [...] As well as the swept wings, this had at first an uprated KestrelII engine. [...] Later, these were replaced with KestrelVs. [...] Later NimrodIIs had {{a slight increase in}} <b>rudder</b> <b>area</b> to improve spin recovery of inverted, float-equipped aircraft. Originally it was intended that the NimrodII should have corrosion-resistant stainless steel, but only three of these were built. The first of 27/33 NimrodIIs was delivered in March 1933.|$|E

5000|$|Flight {{testing of}} the Tagak began in October 1954. By 1956 some small {{modifications}} had been made: <b>rudder</b> <b>area</b> was increased and a shimmy-damper added to the nosewheel leg. [...] Only one was built.|$|E
50|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} had a tapering, rectangular section. There were two open cockpits in tandem, fitted with dual controls. Both {{were under the}} wing, {{though there was a}} small cut-out in the trailing edge over the rear position.

Because the longer nose and the increased slipstream of the big five-bladed propeller a new tail unit with a taller, broader fin and a <b>rudder</b> of increased <b>area</b> was adopted.|$|R
50|$|The Sant' Ambrogio had a {{hexagonal}} cross section, plywood skinned fuselage. At {{the nose}} the two upper panels were curved rather than flat; in elevation the nose was rounded and the fuselage tapered aft. The cockpit was centred over the spar and enclosed by a long, teardrop shaped canopy. All the tail surfaces were only slightly tapered, with straight leading edges and blunt tips. The tailplane {{was attached to}} the upper fuselage with three bolts and was far enough forward that the rudder hinge was aft of the elevators. Its fin was much smaller than the <b>rudder</b> in <b>area</b> and the whole vertical tail was about as broad as high, though the rudder extended below the keel protected by a short skid or tail bumper. The main undercarriage was a simple ash skid running from just aft of the nose almost to the trailing edge of the wing, attached {{to the bottom of the}} fuselage with rubber shock absorbers.|$|R

40|$|About 70 - 85 % of {{commercial}} aircraft Life Cycle Cost (LCC) is determined during the design {{stage of the}} aircraft. Aircraft maintenance is a vital process within aircraft operation and it takes around 15 % of LCC. The present day aviation market drives the airlines to reduce the maintenance {{cost as much as}} possible. The current maintenance cost estimation methods used by the airlines mainly emphasize the cost contribution due to operation parameters. However, in order to analyze the maintenance cost of an aircraft and its components, influences from both the aircraft operation parameters and aircraft design parameters should be investigated and incorporated in the maintenance cost estimation model. Therefore, the research question of the project is: How to develop a maintenance cost estimation model by emphasizing essential operation and design parameters? To answer the research question, a methodology is developed to estimate the maintenance cost of an aircraft and its components as a function of operation and design parameters. Two maintenance cost estimation methods are developed: Aging Involved Method (AIM) and Interval-Based Method (IBM). The AIM method estimates the Scheduled and Unscheduled Maintenance Labor Cost (SMLC and UNMLC), Scheduled and Unscheduled Maintenance Material Cost (SMMC and UNMMC) and maintenance overhead cost by taking the aging factor into the account. On the other hand, the Interval-Based Method (IBM) conducts detailed inspection of average maintenance labor cost by categorization. The categorization can be made in terms of materials, aircraft part items (spar, skin, rib, and etc.) and maintenance tasks. Afterwards, a bottom-to-top maintenance labor cost estimation is performed, based on the maintenance intervals and man-hours, which are extracted from the Maintenance Planning Document (MPD). In order to obtain a direct link between design and operation parameters, and maintenance intervals, a method starting from component load conditions, stress analysis, damage types, till maintenance interval determination has been developed. The developed methods are applied on the composite rudder of an A 330 - 200 aircraft as a case study to obtain cost outputs. During the AIM analysis, the SMC is approximated as a constant while the UNMC increases as a function of increasing aircraft age. From the sensitivity analysis on the AIM method, the main cost drivers for operation and design parameters are obtained: vertical tail surface area, flight cycles, flight hours and <b>rudder</b> surface <b>area.</b> From the IBM analyses follows that, maintenance labor cost of composite rudder components are less than non-composites materials.
