40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates {{impact of}} {{transportation}} on environmental {{elements such as}} noise and air pollution. Field surveys were administered to measure traffic volume, noise and air pollution level near a residential area at Taman Melati, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Noise level meters were used to measure noise level at 74 selected points including one fixed point. Measurement on noise levels such as LAeq, LAmax, L 5, L 10, L 50, L 90 and L 95 was undertaken for about 12 hours at every 15 minutes time interval at fixed point and for 10 hours at movable points at the study area. NO 2 concentration (µg) was measured by using a simple polystyrol capsule. About 238 measurement points were selected fixing three capsules at each measurement point at streetlight poles and other relevant <b>road</b> <b>furnitures</b> {{at a distance of}} 1. 5 m from the ground level. The capsules were left for about 24 hours. A 12 -hour traffic volume count at selected traffic count stations was also conducted...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of the highway network in Malaysia is growing rapidly along with the toll plazas facilities and safety constructions such as toll plaza barriers. However, the issue of accidents involving crash barriers at toll plazas turns into horrific nightmare for road users. It have been investigated that accidents at the toll plaza gates due to impacts of the vehicles with concrete crash barriers with results in damage and fatalities. Therefore, the following study is to conduct a simulation test for crash barrier Tensile Wire Fracture toughness (TWFT) system. TWFT system that used hot rolled galvanized steel materials with small displacement rate of 4. 0 x 10 - 4 m which was considered suitable {{as a replacement for}} the existing concrete crash barrier. The data analysis were generated by the software Elfen. The graph of displacement, direct shear and effective stress were generated as for the hot-galvanizes steel material model. Elastic energy, kinetic energy and inelastic dissipated energy were compared between these two materials. The results shows that the hot-rolled galvanized steel have the energy to return the material to its original form and the level of damage shows that the concrete material failure are greater than the hot rolled galvanized steel materials. In conclusion, the material for a new alternative crash barrier is likely to reduce the rate of death due to accident and damage with regards to <b>road</b> <b>furnitures</b> and vehicle...|$|R

40|$|The {{author of}} this note takes it as self evident that {{prosperity}} {{and the provision of}} "things" (buildings, <b>roads,</b> <b>furniture,</b> furnishings, clothes, machines and equipment of all sorts) go together. The way people generally speak and act is in line with this view. If this is so, domestic manufacturing must continually keep pace with gross domestic product, provided that the necessary "things" are not imported from elsewhere. However, many people are persuaded that domestic manufacturing is in terminal decline, and that the lost output is being replaced by imports from the developing world. Almost daily, one may read of manufacturing jobs being "exported" to the Far East. However, it is simply impossible to import goods without a more or less balancing volume of exports, and there is in reality limited scope for exporting a sufficient volume of services. Imports of goods must more or less be balanced by the export of domestically produced goods. How can a widespread perception of decline be reconciled with a reality of growth? The answer is that the "decline" which is perceived is a decline in employment in the industrial sector, but this decline is more than counterbalanced by the rise of productivity, so that the domestic output of goods by and large keeps pace with the growth of GDP. This note summarises the statistical evidence for the accuracy of this view. A substantial footnote discusses the role of journalists and academics in sustaining the perception of the decline of manufacturing. growth; technology; services; industry; deindustrialization; output; production; productivity; jobs; decline; journalists; academics; value added; press; media; Financial Times; exports; imports; employment...|$|R

40|$|Change {{detection}} is {{an important}} issue in city monitoring to analyse street <b>furniture,</b> <b>road</b> works, car parking, etc. For example, parking surveys are needed but are currently a laborious task involving sending operators in the streets to identify the changes in car locations. In this paper, we propose a method that performs a fast and robust segmentation and classification of urban point clouds, {{that can be used for}} change detection. We apply this method to detect the cars, as a particular object class, in order to perform parking surveys automatically. A recently proposed method already addresses the need for fast segmentation and classification of urban point clouds, using elevation images. The interest to work on images is that processing is much faster, proven and robust. However there may be a loss of information in complex 3 D cases: for example when objects are one above the other, typically a car under a tree or a pedestrian under a balcony. In this paper we propose a method that retain the three-dimensional information while preserving fast computation times and improving segmentation and classification accuracy. It is based on fast region-growing using an octree, for the segmentation, and specific descriptors with Random-Forest for the classification. Experiments have been performed on large urban point clouds acquired by Mobile Laser Scanning. They show that the method is as fast as the state of the art, and that it gives more robust results in the complex 3 D cases...|$|R
