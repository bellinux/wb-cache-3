5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not <b>responsible</b> <b>to</b> the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E

5|$|J.E.B. Stuart {{deprived}} Lee of cavalry intelligence {{during a}} good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the meeting engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were <b>responsible</b> <b>to</b> some extent for the failure of the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Norsk Vinterturistforening {{was founded}} in 1899 to work towards {{encouraging}} English tourists to visit Oslo, specifically by building tobogganing tracks. A committee was established in 1904 to look into building a new tobogganing track in the Holmenkollen area. It proposed that two new tracks be built, one from Voksenkollveien to Peisestuen, and one from Peisestuen to Midtstuen, and that Korketrekkeren be upgraded to allow for safer tobogganing. The investments cost 7,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) and the annual operating costs estimated at NOK2,000. The investments were financed with NOK2,000 by Christiania Brænnevinssamlag and NOK5,000 by Akeforeningen. The latter was established in 1905 and was also <b>responsible</b> <b>to</b> operating the track.|$|E
