25|$|However, the {{reliability}} of these metrics has been drawn into question, partly due to widely divergent estimates. For example, between May and June 2010, ComScore updated its scoring methodology and its estimates for Hulu dropped from 43.5 million unique viewers to 24 million in a single month. In a comScore digital trends report in 2010, comScore's Digital Year in <b>Review</b> <b>report</b> found that Hulu was watched {{twice as much as}} viewers who watched on the websites of the five major TV networks combined.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 ONS {{commissioned}} a review led by Professor Chris Skinner of LSE {{to assess the}} robustness of the methodology and statistical research; identify where evidence could be significantly improved; and what the main risks were with the likely approach and how these riskes could be mitigated. Aside {{from a number of}} recommendations of further work to be undertaken the <b>Review</b> <b>report,</b> published in November 2013 concluded that of the two leading options, online census and administrative data, the online census approach would provide a robust methodology to succeed the 2011 census, whereas the administrative data approach whilst potentially offering some advantages did not as yet have a sufficiently developed methodology to replace the present questionnaire surveying approach.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} other {{necessary}} reforms, the new president, Allan McEvey, {{set up a}} new review committee of two, Dom Serventy and himself. Serventy, a scientist with the CSIRO, was the principal writer of the <b>review</b> <b>report</b> and he addressed both the need for a sense of what the RAOU should be doing, and the structure that would allow it to do so. Although there was considerable vocal opposition to the reform proposals (including cutting the number of people on Council from an unwieldy forty to just nine) the report was ratified by Council in April 1969 and adopted at an Extraordinary General Meeting in June 1969, with the vote being over 80% in favour. Later that year came the first issue of the RAOU Newsletter, a publication that would evolve to become the magazine Wingspan.|$|E

In 1999, The Australian reported {{that many of}} Cullacabardee's residents were unemployed, had no public transport despite 20 years of State Government management and no access to jobs, shops, education or health services. The article noted that [...] "residents have to walk up to [...] along a dangerously busy road or through a bush track to reach a shop or bus stop", and that the nearest primary school is [...] away. Nine derelict homes in the community were being refurbished under a training scheme to assist young community members to gain skills, although the community claimed that funding was only available for 12-month periods, making apprenticeships (which run for several years) impossible to offer. A <b>review</b> <b>report</b> into the community in 2000 identified these and other {{issues such as the}} land being zoned General Rural, effectively prohibiting residential development, and the illegal dumping of concrete demolition rubble and other refuse near the community.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the growing}} threat of {{regional}} conflicts, Aspin {{wanted to have a}} strong capability to carry out limited military operations, including peacekeeping, and to maintain [...] "a strong peacetime presence of U.S. forces around the world". The bottom-up <b>review</b> <b>report,</b> which Aspin released in September 1993, took into account strategy formulation, force structure, weapon systems modernization, and Defense infrastructure. The report projected a reduced force structure still capable of fighting and winning two simultaneous major regional conflicts. Forces would include 10 active Army divisions; 11 carrier battle groups, 45 to 55 attack submarines, and about 345 ships; 5 active Marine brigades; and 13 active and 7 reserve Air Force fighter wings. The report also called for additional prepositioned equipment and airlift/sealift capacity, improved anti-armor and precision-guided munitions, and enhanced Army National Guard combat brigade readiness.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1997, {{studies of}} the {{vulnerability}} of the non-stealthy MC-130 force reflected concerns about its viability in modern high-threat environments, including the prevalence of man-portable air-defense systems in asymmetric conflicts. At least two studies were conducted or proposed to explore the prospect of a replacement aircraft (known variously as [...] "MC-X" [...] or [...] "M-X"), with USAF at that time hoping for an Initial Operating Capability date of 2018. One analyst questioned the survivability of slow non-stealthy platforms such as the MC-130 in future threat environments in a 2007 presentation to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and stated his opinion that development of a stealthy replacement for the MC-130 is a [...] "strategic priority". The U.S. Department of Defense's 2006 Quadrennial Defense <b>Review</b> <b>Report</b> also recognized the concern, asserting DoD's intention to [...] "enhance capabilities to support SOF insertion and extraction into denied areas from strategic distances." ...|$|E

There he announced the DPRK's readiness to hold a “human rights dialogue with countries not hostile to it.” Also following the publication of the COI report, in May 2014, on the eve of the second Universal Periodic <b>Review</b> <b>report</b> on human rights in North Korea, the DPRK published (three years behind the UN scheduled deadline) a detailed response to the 167 first cycle recommendations. The government changed its previous stance of complete rejection of external critique on its human rights, accepting a large part of the recommendations and claiming they were being implemented. Shortly after, during the second cycle of the UPR, 268 recommendations were issued to advance the DPRK's human rights. The DPRK again accepted some of them. However, in both instances it excluded from consideration or redress the most serious violations, including those deemed by the COI to have crossed “the high threshold of crimes against humanity.” ...|$|E
