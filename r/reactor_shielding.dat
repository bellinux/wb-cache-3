40|$|Description of {{the nuclear}} <b>reactor</b> <b>shield</b> {{analysis}} procedures employed at NASA-Lewis Research Center. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} generation, use, and testing of multigroup cross-section data. Although coupled neutron and gamma ray cross-section sets are useful in two-dimensional Sn transport calculations, much insight has been gained from examination of uncoupled calculations. These have led to experimental and analytic studies of areas deemed to be of first-order importance to <b>reactor</b> <b>shield</b> calculations. A discussion is given of problems encountered in using multigroup cross sections in the resolved resonance energy range. The addition to ENDF files of calculated and/or measured neutron-energy-dependent capture gamma ray spectra for shielding calculations is questioned for the resonance region. Anomalies inherent in two-dimensional Sn transport calculations which may overwhelm any cross-section discrepancies are illustrated...|$|R

50|$|About a dozen {{fire hoses}} were hauled {{to the charge}} face of the reactor; their nozzles were cut off and the lines {{themselves}} connected to scaffolding poles and fed into fuel channels about a metre (roughly 3 feet) above {{the heart of the}} fire. Tuohy once again hauled himself onto the <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding</b> and ordered the water to be turned on, listening carefully at the inspection holes for any sign of a hydrogen reaction as the pressure was increased. The water was unsuccessful in extinguishing the fire, requiring further measures to be taken.|$|E
50|$|Serpentinite has a {{significant}} amount of bound water, hence it contains abundant hydrogen atoms able to slow down neutrons by elastic collision (neutron thermalization process). Because of this serpentinite can be used as dry filler inside steel jackets in some designs of nuclear reactors. For example, in RBMK series it was used for top radiation shielding to protect operators from escaping neutrons. Serpentine can also be added as aggregate to special concrete used in nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding</b> to increase the concrete density (2.6 g/cm3) and its neutron capture cross section.|$|E

50|$|Everitt Blizard {{was born}} September 30, 1916 in Ottawa, Canada. A {{few years after}} his birth, Everitt Blizard moved with his family from Canada to Pittsburgh and then to Garden City, New York. He earned a bachelor's degree in {{chemistry}} from Wesleyan University in 1938 and a master's degree in physics from Columbia University in 1941. While working for his PhD at Columbia, he was recruited by the U.S. Navy for work as a physicist. After spending the war years working for the Navy and working on Operation Crossroads in 1946, he was recruited by Admiral Hyman Rickover to work at ORNL for the Navy's nuclear reactor program. Blizard was appointed the group leader of shielding research in the Physics Division of ORNL and then was promoted to associate division director in 1954. In 1955 he became director of the Neutron Physics Division, continuing in this position until his death from leukemia in 1966. He {{was the most important}} physicist and engineer for nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding</b> for the submarines Nautilus and Seawolf and the ship Savannah. At ORNL he directed the development of four major test facilities for research in nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding.</b> His pioneering team developed experiments, models, and nuclear data essential for shielding and introduced the concept of neutron removal cross-section. Blizard won the 1966 Elliott Cresson Medal.|$|E
50|$|As {{the crew}} brought the reactor up to 1.4% of {{capacity}} at 5pm on 1 September 1974, {{there was a}} minor leak of neutrons and gamma rays from the <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding.</b> Westinghouse had reviewed the design and warned of this possibility, but no changes {{were made to the}} design. There was no significant radiation exposure, but it became a political issue, with local fisherman blocking her return to port for more than 50 days. The government finally came to an agreement with the local government and fishermen; the Mutsu was allowed back to port on condition that it was to find a new home port, and the ship returned to ÅŒminato on 15 October.|$|E
50|$|In reality, in {{the early}} Sixties Soviet Union did test a {{technology}} demonstrator for a nuclear-powered strategic bomber, Tupolev Tu-95LAL, similar to the somewhat earlier American Convair NB-36H project, but, being based on the turboprop Tu-95, it was never supersonic, it never flew under nuclear power (its main goal was to test the nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding</b> efficiency), and, moreover, it {{was developed by the}} Tupolev Design Bureau, as Myasischev company had lost the competition to develop the prototype. It was deemed successful, but further development dragged because of environmental concerns. When the functional ICBMs appeared, the majority of funding and development effort was shifted into that field, and in the late Sixties the project was scrapped for good.|$|E
50|$|In Sasebo, between 1978 and 1982, various {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the <b>reactor</b> <b>shield</b> of the Mutsu, and its home port was moved to Sekinehama in 1983. Following an overhaul, the Mutsu was completed in February 1991. She then completed her original design objective of travelling 82000 km in testing, and was decommissioned in 1992. Over 25 years the programme had cost more than 120 billion yen (about US$ 1.2 billion).|$|R

5000|$|The Omega West Reactor (OWR) was an {{experimental}} nuclear reactor located at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos NM. OMR {{was completed in}} 1956 and primarily used for scientific scale nuclear research until it was fully decommissioned in 1994. It operated 24 hours a day, {{five days a week}} until 1972, when it went to eight hours a day, five days a week operation. The original purpose of the reactor was to collect nuclear material properties in support of the United States nuclear weapons program. Other uses included production of useful medical isotopes. [...] The reactor was capable of producing an external beam of neutrons via beam tubes which extended through the <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding.</b> These were provided for external neutron beam experiments including: neutron radiography, neutron capture studies, gamma ray studies, neutron cross section measurements and neutron activation studies.|$|E
5000|$|HFIR is a beryllium-reflected, light-water-cooled and -moderated, flux-trap type reactor {{that uses}} highly enriched {{uranium-235}} as the fuel. The preliminary conceptual {{design of the}} reactor {{was based on the}} [...] "flux trap" [...] principle, in which the reactor core consists of an annular region of fuel surrounding an unfueled moderating region or [...] "island." [...] Such a configuration permits fast neutrons leaking from the fuel to be moderated in the island and thus produces a region of very high thermal-neutron flux {{at the center of the}} island. This reservoir of thermalized neutrons is [...] "trapped" [...] within the reactor, making it available for isotope production. The large flux of neutrons in the reflector outside the fuel of such a reactor may be tapped by extending empty [...] "beam" [...] tubes into the reflector, thus allowing neutrons to be beamed into experiments outside the <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding.</b> Finally, a variety of holes in the reflector may be provided in which to irradiate materials for experiments or isotope production.|$|E
5000|$|The Skate {{class were}} {{designed}} as economical production nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs), and thus were {{smaller and more}} austere than their ground-breaking predecessor , whose high cost had raised concerns. They were designed before Nautilus demonstrated the advantages of sustained high underwater speed, thus their designed speed was about the maximum speed of the conventional Tang class, which the Skates resembled in almost every aspect except propulsion. Their S3W reactor was a scaled-down version of Nautilus S2W reactor with about half the power output; it was known as SFR (Submarine Fleet Reactor) during development. A slightly modified version known as S4W powered the second pair of Skate-class boats. Unfortunately, scaling down the reactor did not reduce the weight of <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding</b> proportionally, and it was eventually realized that further downsizing was impractical. In the late 1950s {{it was hoped that}} the nuclear-powered aircraft program would develop reactors suitable for very small SSNs, but the program was unsuccessful. Their armament was the same as the Tangs, six bow and two stern 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Like the Tangs, the stern tubes had no ejection pump, and could only be used for swim-out weapons such as the Mark 37 ASW homing torpedo. The quest for a high submerged speed and improved sonar led to the subsequent [...] and es becoming the model for further development.|$|E

25|$|The huge {{size of the}} Sun {{and stars}} means that the x-rays {{produced}} in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They {{are said to be}} opaque to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be optically thin for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a <b>reactor's</b> <b>shield).</b> This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{completing}} his doctorate work, he was {{employed by the}} Navy in 1941. As {{a result of his}} contributions in such programs as the [...] "CROSSROADS" [...] atom bomb tests at Bikini, he was selected by Captain Hyman Rickover to participate in the nuclear submarine program and was sent to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to attend the charter session of a nuclear training school. Although intended to be temporary, his stay in Oak Ridge continued until his death from leukemia in 1966."Bliz," [...] as he was better known, began {{with a small group of}} pioneers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and developed a significant division of researchers addressing all aspects of radiation shielding, including experiments, analytical models, and nuclear data. Four major test facilities were constructed under his leadership, beginning with the [...] "Core Hole" [...] facility - a 2-ft-square hole in the shield of the original X-10 Graphite Reactor. Although immediately successful, the facility had significant limitations, and the group went on to develop more powerful and more flexible test facilities, including the Lid Tank Shielding Facility, the Bulk Shielding Facility, and the Tower Shielding Facility. This latter facility provided the international shielding community with abundant benchmark data over a span of nearly four decades. Blizard also recognized the importance of analytic methods and was instrumental in bringing theoretical physicists together to develop and apply new methods. His exploitation of the concept of a neutron removal cross section had, perhaps, the widest impact on early methods development.Beyond Bliz's technical leadership, his humanistic interest and sensitivity toward others often led him into a role as international ambassador for <b>reactor</b> <b>shielding.</b> He was one of the scientific members of the U.S. Atoms for Peace Mission to the Far East in 1957 and participated in numerous other outreach missions. He also contributed substantially to many handbooks and encyclopedias, including the shielding portion of the Reactor Handbook and the Engineering Compendium on Radiation Shielding.Because of this vision, his technical alertness, and his warm and inspiring personality, Blizard is rightly recognized as the [...] "father of reactor shielding" [...] and is credited with bringing the field of reactor radiation shielding from an empirical rule-of-thumb craft to a distinct discipline in nuclear science and technology.As with many scientists of his day, he was a warm human being who inspired many young people to attain goals they never thought were possible. He had a knack for selecting the right individual for the job and giving them the guidance and trust they needed to succeed.|$|E
