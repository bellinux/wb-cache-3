40|$|This thesis {{examines}} practices {{derived from}} socio-anthropological methodology and performative strategies within Live Art, practices {{that rely on}} ethnographic fieldwork methods and participant observation positioning. Through the examination of practices in which both practitioners and participants commit to open-ended and unpredictable processes, the thesis explores forms of artistic practice that are ethical and democratic in terms of authority, participation and authorship. Key projects are: Jeremy Deller's Social Parade (2004), Gillian Wearing's Drunk (1997 - 99) and Sophie Calle's Gotham Handbook (1998). This examination forms part of a wider discussion of the discursive proposition, made notably in Hal Foster's 'The Artist as Ethnographer' (1996), as to whether a paradigmatic shift has occurred within artistic practice and with what consequences. The thesis consists of eight chapters. Chapter one introduces {{the aims of the}} research project and presents the nature, structure and discursive context of the project, focusing in particular on Clare Bishop's essay 'The Social Turn: Collaboration and its Discontents' (2006). Chapter two investigates the mutual interest that exists between art and anthropology and introduces critical terminology with regards to the specific context of this research project. Chapter three presents the understanding of Live Art as contextualising the examined practices, and introduces liveness as a method. Chapter four argues that the practices examined can be understood as ethnographic practice of fieldwork. The practitioners are defined as <b>Radicants</b> or nomad cultural agents whose actions set identities in motion. Chapter five discusses in detail Hal Foster's 'The Return of the Real' (1996) and Mark Hutchinson's 'Four Stages of Public Art' (2002), proposing a shift in the paradigm of the ethnographic turn. Chapter SIX negotiates ideas of authority, authorship, fieldwork practice and representation through the analysis of James Clifford's 'On Ethnographic Authority' (1988). Lastly, chapter seven discusses the modes of representation used by a specific set of practitioners, proposing that their work could be understood as following an archival method. This thesis advances a theoretically informed, process-based participatory and interdisciplinary artistic practice. It presents an analysis of such practices, including my own, seeking to demonstrate that this exploration could be relevant to artists, anthropologists and ethnographers alike. The thesis also contributes to the shift in understanding of contemporary art practice proposed by Nicolas Bourriaud and others that emphasises flexible modes of collaboration and various forms of social engagement. This thesis is presented in two volumes. The first volume contains the discussion of the theory and methodologies that underpin my research, relevant practitioners and my own practice. The second volume presents my own practice and how it contributed to this research. This format also seeks to demonstrate that data gathering is integral to the physical manifestation of my work. Both volumes can be read independently but are designed to be complementary. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|In Postproduction (2001), Bourriaud relates deejaying to {{contemporary}} art. He lists the operations discjockeys apply {{to music and}} relates them {{to contemporary}} art practice. <b>Radicant</b> (2009) aims to define {{the emergence of the}} first global modernity, based on translation and nomadic forms, against the postmodern aesthetics based on identities. In The Exform (2016), Bourriaud examines the dynamics of ideology, specifically as it was developed in the work of Louis Althusser, to account for distinctions between the productive and unproductive, product and waste, and the included and excluded in their relation to society and art production.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} renderings into {{poetry of the}} life and works of the American Modernist painter, Georgia O’Keeffe. This study intends to show how these poems have interpreted, de-codified and translated O’Keeffe’s subjects into words by making room for new meaningful images, thereby expanding what O’Keeffe meant {{to do with her}} art, and thus nourishing her artistic legacy. It borrows the term <b>radicant</b> from Nicolas Bourriaud to capture the essence of O’Keeffe, as an artist who set her roots in motion in order to approach art in heterogeneous contexts and formats, transplanting and thus sharing new creative behaviors. The introduction presents the development of ekphrastic writing, a summary of the principal aesthetic and critical theories I have adopted, a reflection on the reasons why O’Keeffe often showed a certain reticence to the world of words, and the explanation of the materials and methodology that support this study. A section of four chapters analyzes the extent to which poetry prompted by O’Keeffe’s paintings provides not only accurate and eulogistic descriptions of her art but also an encounter between what W. J. T. Mitchell called two “paragonal” media that expand the interpretation of her art on the one hand, and the scope of ekphrastic poetry on the other. The first chapter explores the poems related to the places where O’Keeffe lived and from which she drew inspiration, and aims at confirming her idea that her legacy depends on what she made of these spaces. The second chapter examines the poems that refer to O’Keeffe’s living and still natures whose close-up study echoes her idea of realizing the Great American Painting as the celebration of the vastness and miracle {{of the world in which}} we live. The third chapter concentrates on the poems inspired by O’Keeffe’s painted human artifacts that emphasize the importance of a poetry of common things, an attitude that O’Keeffe shared with poet William Carlos Williams. The fourth chapter presents poems inspired by photographs that portray O’Keeffe, and intends to assert photography as the tertium quid in the complementary relationship between painting and poetry, thus reaffirming the connecting and <b>radicant</b> power of the arts. I conclude this study by arguing that in visual art as well as in poetry the shared process of selecting and emphasizing helps the artists to get at the essence of things, and thus to disentangle the complicated facets of existence. The analysis of the resistance of meanings in the dialogue between the artist’s artwork and the poet’s composition appears to define the intangible that artist, poet and viewer/reader have tried to articulate. May Swenson’s “O’Keeffe Retrospective” functions as a final poetic gallery through which the poet conducts the reader/viewer in a <b>radicant</b> lyrical portrait of the painter, where the thingness of O’Keeffe’s things is fully celebrated, and the readers can clearly see what they have merely looked at. The two appendices include the reproductions of the visual references analyzed in this study, and a selection of three poems with my Italian translation. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{sets out}} {{the notion of}} a Field Broadcast from the dual {{perspective}} of Rebecca Birch, one of the developers of a bespoke version of Flash Media Live Encoder and Bram Thomas Arnold, an artist who uses a case study from Sideways Festival, Belgium, 2012. Field Broadcast enables an artist to be in a field, suitably equipped, and stream live footage to an audience. It is an experiment in place, site and {{the notion of a}} field. It is a new method of making work in the space between site-specific performance and the digital realm: a way of working that enables artists to generate new artworks within the non-place of the Internet. Birch introduces the technology from a number of perspectives before it is fleshed out with evidence and experience from a live project that took place in Belgium in 2012. Sideways was a festival that traversed Belgium over four weeks and 400 km, with artists walking and generating work en route. The possibilities offered by Field Broadcast are explored in relation to the expanded field of ecology amidst Bourriaud's The <b>Radicant</b> (2009), Guatarri's The Three Ecologies (2005) and Morton's Ecology Without Natur...|$|E
40|$|The fern Blechnum sprucei {{grows in}} Mesoamerica (Costa Rica) and South America, from Colombia to Bolivia, SE and centre of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. It is a distinctive, {{somewhat}} vulnerable, mostly orophilous species. Fresh and dry herbarium material {{was used for}} this study. Herbarium material for anatomical studies comes from CTES, BA, LP, MA, SI and UC (Holmgren et al. 1990). Selected representative specimens are additionally cited after taxonomic treatment of the species. Dry material was restored with aqueous 4 : 1 butil cellosolve. Pinnae were cleared with aqueous 6 % NaOH, then coloured with aqueous 1 % TBO (Gurr 1966). 							Hand made transverse sections of young and adult stipes, and costae were done in fresh and restored herbarium material. Venation and epidermal patterns were analyzed in basal, apical and medium pinnae, but only the latter were illustrated. The size and density of stomata were measured in medium pinnae from all studied samples, values shown are the average of 25 measures per sample; sizes are expressed as minimum, media and maximum length x width, in μm, and density as minimum, media and maximum number of stomata / mm 2. Spores were studied with SEM, mounted on metal stubs with double sided tape, covered with gold under vacuum and photographed with a Jeol /EO JSM 6360 (15 KV) SEM. Spores were also studied with light microscope, mounted in DePeX (DePeX mounting medium, Gurr, BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole BH 15 1 TD, UK) and measured using an ocular micrometer. Measurements {{are based on a}} minimum sample of 100 spores taken from different specimens. Sizes are expressed as the longest equatorial diameter/ polar diameter, in μm. Gametophytes were studied from material collected in the subtropical forest of Tucumán Province, Argentina. Spore samples for cultures were taken from single sporophytes kept dry at room temperature since the date plants were collected. 							Gametophytes were grown under fluorescent light. Multispore cultures were established on mineral agar. 							Percentage of germination was recorded for a random sample of 50 spores from each of the two plates, every three days until there was no further increasing. Gametophytes were stained with chloral hydrate acetocarmine. 							The species has large sporophytes, suberect, scaly rhizomes, and dimorphic fronds with short, scaly stipes and lanceolate to elliptic sterile laminae. The rachises can grow indefinitely as <b>radicant</b> axis that vegetatively multiplicate the plants. Pinnae are lanceolate, herbaceous, with crenate and papillose margins, superficially scaly and hairy, peciolulate, with free, visible veins regularly once furcated near the costa, ending in large, active hydathodes. 							The broadly elliptic fertile laminae bear distant pinnae, with vegetative tissue reduced to the portion that supports the indusium and the continuous coenosorus; terminal indefinite rachis, not proliferous, may be present.

40|$|En l’actualitat un dels espais urbans més utilitzats de la ciutat de Barcelona és el Metro. Les dades de 2011 així ho mostren. Diàriament més d’un milió de persones usen aquest mitjà de transport. Aquest dada posa de {{manifest}} l’elevada mobilitat ciutadana i, alhora, evidencia la importància dels trànsits, les trajectòries, els moviments [...] . en la nostra quotidianitat. Partint d’aquesta consideració, i prenent com a posicionament el construccionisme social, hem realitzat una investigació urbana des d’un posicionament crític. Des d’allò que hem definit com a metodologia mòbil hem realitzat una etnografia urbana en el Metro de la ciutat usant l’observació participant i la deriva com a tècniques d’investigació. En consonància amb el plantejament teòric i la metodologia emprada hem realitzat un anàlisi crític del discurs del diari de camp amb la intenció de posar de manifest els processos socials implicats en la construcció social d’aquest espai urbà. Així doncs, l’objectiu del procés de recerca, és oferir una “lectura” de les pràctiques socials que es posen en joc en el Metro de Barcelona. Aquestes pràctiques ens permeten saber com és i com es construeix aquest espai urbà contemporani i, alhora, ens donen la possibilitat d’analitzar quins processos socials es posen en joc en el subsòl de la urbs, i com aquests incideixen en la forma que pren la societat actual. La tesi es presenta en format de compendi de publicacions. En total s’exposen tres articles que posen de manifest les següents argumentacions: 1) la importància del Metro, i dels Espais de trànsit, en el context social i urbà actual, mostrant que els Espais de Trànsit són un excel·lent aparador de la societat actual; 2) la necessitat d’estudiar els fenòmens socials actuals, de naturalesa mòbil, adoptant metodologies mòbils i una lògica que estigui en consonància amb el caràcter efímer i canviant de les noves formes d’entendre el món. La lògica <b>radicant</b> es presenta com una alternativa a la lògica de les estabilitats, de la reificació i la cristal·lització de l’allò social; 3) les possibilitats de la deriva, transformada en tècnica de investigació psicosocial, com a eina que ens permet aproximar-nos a l’allò urbà des del seu “interior” i formant part de les trajectòries, dels moviments [...] . de la urbs. Aquest trilogia d’arguments posa de manifest quin ha estat el camí de recerca recorregut amb l’objectiu d’integrar i de desenvolupar una investigació urbana en el context de la Psicologia social. Allò què mostren els resultats de la investigació és, per una banda, que el Metro de Barcelona és un paisatge del moviment, un Espai de Trànsit, que explica una societat mòbil en constant transformació. Per altra banda, en el Metro de la ciutat es posen en joc diversos mecanismes i estratègies de poder que gestionen, controlen i acoten la “potencia” social dels usuaris i, alhora, emergeix un diàleg molt interessant entre les relacions de poder i de resistència. Així doncs, parlem del Metro de Barcelona com un espai urbà on es produeixen diferents tipus de control, un espai disciplinari, un espai col·lectiu, un espai global i un espai de interconnexió. D’aquesta lectura del Metro de Barcelona es desprèn una interpretació de la societat concreta: la sociabilitat actual es fonamenta en la interconnexió i la ubiqüitat permanent, en la infinitat de moviments i de desplaçaments que la travessen i que fan que la societat de principis de segle XXI adopti les característiques del <b>radicant.</b> Currently, one of {{the most}} used urban spaces in the city of Barcelona is the Metro (the Barcelona Underground). It is demonstrated by the data from 2011. Every day {{more than a million people}} use this means of transport. This figure shows the high mobility of citizens, and also demonstrates the importance of transits, trajectories and movements in our daily lives. Based on this consideration, and taking the social constructionist approach, we made an urban research from a critical position. From a mobile methodology, we have made an urban ethnography in the Metro of Barcelona, using participant observation and drift as research techniques. In line with the theoretical basis and the methodology, we have made a Critical Discourse Analysis of our field diary, in order to highlight the social processes involved in the social construction of this urban space. Thus, the aim of the research project is to offer a "reading" of the social practices that come into play in the Barcelona’s Metro. These practices allow us to know how this contemporary urban space is and how it is constructed, and also they give us the possibility of analyzing which social processes come into play in the basement of the city, and how they can explain the way that makes the society. The thesis is presented as a compendium of publications. Three articles are exposed, and they revealed the following arguments: 1) the importance of the Metro and the Transit Spaces in the social and urban context, showing that Transit Spaces are an excellent showcase of the society nowadays, 2) the need to study the current social phenomena, of mobile nature, using mobile methodologies and adopting a logic that is in line with the changing and ephemeral nature of new ways of understanding the world. The radicand logic is presented as an alternative to the logic of stabilities, the reification and the crystallization of the social matters, 3) the possibilities of the drift, transformed into psychosocial research technique that allows us to reach the “urban” from its "inside" and taking part of the trajectories and the movements of the city. This trilogy of arguments highlights which has been the search path route in order to integrate and develop an urban research in the context of social psychology. The results of the investigation show that the Barcelona’s Metro is a landscape of movement, a Transit Space, which explains a mobile society constantly changing. Furthermore, various mechanisms and power strategies, that manage, control and measure the social "power" of the users, come into play in the Metro, and also a very interesting dialogue emerges between power and resistance relations. Thus, we talk about the Barcelona’s Metro as an urban area where there are different types of control, a disciplinary space, a public space, a global space and an interconnection space. From this reading of the Barcelona’s Metro, an interpretation about this society can be said: the current sociability is based on the interconnection and permanent ubiquity, in many movements and shifts that cross it, and that makes that the society from the early century XXI adopts the characteristics of the radicand...|$|E
