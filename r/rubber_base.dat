500|$|After test-sculpting in Plasticine, {{the puppet}} heads were moulded on a {{silicone}} <b>rubber</b> <b>base</b> and made using fibreglass. At heights ranging from 20 to 24inches (approximately one-third life-size) the next-generation puppets were no shorter than their predecessors. For previous series, puppet eyes had been sized {{out of proportion}} to the heads, but as part of the realistic look introduced in Captain Scarlet, the eyes of production personnel were photographed and the images scaled down for attachment to the eye sockets. As had been the case for earlier series, a number of alternative heads displaying a range of expressions were created for main character puppets, including [...] "smilers", [...] "frowners" [...] and [...] "blinkers". Since episodes of Captain Scarlet were filmed in pairs, one on each of the puppet stages available at the Century 21 Studios, duplicates were made of the [...] "expressionless" [...] template of each main character. For the pilot episode, an [...] "agony" [...] head was specially sculpted for the Captain Scarlet puppet for a brief reaction shot of Scarlet's Mysteron double being shot by Captain Blue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{liquid limit}} test of Atterberg's involved mixing a pat of clay in a round-bottomed porcelain bowl of 10–12cm diameter. A groove was {{cut through the}} pat of clay with a spatula, and the bowl was then struck many times against the palm of one hand. Casagrande subsequently standardized the apparatus and the procedures to make the measurement more repeatable. Soil is placed into the metal cup portion of the device and a groove is made down its center with a standardized tool of [...] width. The cup is repeatedly dropped 10mm onto a hard <b>rubber</b> <b>base</b> {{at a rate of}} 120 blows per minute, during which the groove closes up gradually {{as a result of the}} impact. The number of blows for the groove to close is recorded. The moisture content at which it takes 25 drops of the cup to cause the groove to close over a distance of [...] is defined as the liquid limit. The test is normally run at several moisture contents, and the moisture content which requires 25 blows to close the groove is interpolated from the test results. The Liquid Limit test is defined by ASTM standard test method D4318. [...] The test method also allows running the test at one moisture content where 20 to 30 blows are required to close the groove; then a correction factor is applied to obtain the liquid limit from the moisture content.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the final}} {{dramatic}} scene involving Harcourt's demise, the rigged effects were handled in two stages. The first stage involved a dissolving head and body, {{while the second}} stage incorporated a flesh-less arm thrusting out of seawater. Rosengrant noted, [...] "While the dissolving makeup had to look extreme, it also had to appear realistic {{within the limits of}} the alien anatomy Winston's crew had designed. We wanted to avoid the amorphous 'blob-of-blood' look you see in so many of these slasher and monster pictures. We {{wanted to be able to}} see Harcourt's bone structure rather than just the glob hanging off of it." [...] For the visual appearance he added, [...] "Of course, we did use methocel slime to make it wet and nasty-looking, but the basic understructure was rooted in anatomy." [...] For Harcourt's facial disintegration, the coordinators came up with a foam <b>rubber</b> <b>base</b> makeup superimposed with a layer of gelatin appliances. Elek explained, the crew [...] "dug out chunks from the foam rubber pieces, filled the holes with Bromo Seltzer, then laid the gelatin appliances over the whole thing and colored them so you could not see the holes below. Once the stuntman, the camera and everyone else was in position, we took a large syringe filled with hot water and injected it into each of the Bromo Seltzer pockets as the camera started rolling. As the Bromo Seltzer started to fizzle, the hot water began eating its way through the gelatin skin and his face appeared to bubble and melt." [...] In the end, Mahan remarked, [...] "We figured that going from something like the alien queen in Aliens to these straight prosthetic makeups would be simple, but it was really a lot of work." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{methods used}} for small parts and {{jewellery}} vary somewhat from those used for sculpture. A wax model is obtained either from injection into a rubber mould or by being custom-made by carving.

Then a metal flask, which resembles a short length of steel pipe that ranges roughly from 1.5 to six {{inches tall and}} wide, is put over the sprue base and the waxes. Most sprue bases have a circular rim which grips the standard-sized flask, holding it in place. Investment (refractory plaster) is mixed and poured into the flask, filling it. It hardens, then is burned out as outlined above. Casting is usually done straight from the kiln either by centrifugal casting or vacuum casting.|$|E
