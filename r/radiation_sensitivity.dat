25|$|One {{fractionation}} {{schedule that}} is increasingly being used {{and continues to be}} studied is hypofractionation. This is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses. Typical doses vary significantly by cancer type, from 2.2Gy/fraction to 20Gy/fraction. The logic behind hypofractionation is to lessen the possibility of the cancer returning by not giving the cells enough time to reproduce and also to exploit the unique biological <b>radiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of some tumors.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{factors of}} {{potential}} importance are genetic factors, prior radiation exposure, and previous head injury, such as concussion. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{has been shown}} to be an important and common factor in CNS responses. ApoE controls the redistribution of lipids among cells and is expressed at high levels in the brain. New studies are considering the effects of space radiation for the major isoforms of ApoE, which are encoded by distinct alleles (ε2, ε3, and ε4). The isoform ApoE ε4 {{has been shown to}} increase the risk of cognitive impairments and to lower the age for Alzheimer’s disease. It is not known whether the interaction of <b>radiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> or other individual risks factors is the same for high- and low-LET radiation. Other isoforms of ApoE confer a higher risk for other diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the ApoE ε4 allele are at increased risk for atherosclerosis, which is also suspected to be a risk increased by radiation. People who carry two copies of the ApoE ε2 allele are at risk for a condition that is known as hyperlipoproteinemia type III. It will therefore be extremely challenging to consider genetic factors in a multipleradiation-risk paradigm.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of health {{experts agree that}} {{the risk of breast cancer}} for asymptomatic women under 35 is not high enough to warrant the risk of radiation exposure. For this reason, and because the <b>radiation</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the breast in women under 35 is possibly greater than in older women, most radiologists will not perform screening mammography in women under 40.

Often, the radiologist will try to avoid mammography by using ultrasound or MRI imaging.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The cdk 1 /cyclin B 1 {{complex is}} a {{universal}} regulator known {{to be responsible for}} driving the cell-cycle from the G 2 -to the M-phase. To investigate the effects of irradiation on the activity of this complex in preimplantation embryos, we irradiated one- and two-cell mouse embryos with X-rays, and measured the fluctuations of histone H 1 and cdk 1 kinase activity. Four mouse strains with different <b>radiation</b> <b>sensitivities</b> were chosen: the BALB/c and the Heiligenberger (radiation-sensitive) and the C 57 BL and the CF 1 (radiation-resistant) strains. Embryos irradiated in the first cell-cycle arrested in the G 2 -phase. However, the dynamics of this radiation-induced G 2 -block were different between the mouse strains tested. Indeed, in the C 57 BL and the CF 1 strains, X-irradiation with 2. 5 Gy induced a very short G 2 block before the one-cell embryos could then proceed to mitosis. On the contrary...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{model for}} the {{radiation}} treatment of cancer which includes the effects of the cell cycle is derived from first principles. A malignant cell population is divided into two compartments based on <b>radiation</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> The active compartment includes the four phases of the cell cycle, while the quiescent compartment consists of the G 0 state. Analysis of this active-quiescent radiation model confirms the classical interpretation of the linear quadratic (LQ) model, which is that a larger α/β ratio corresponds to a fast cell cycle, while a smaller ratio corresponds to a slow cell cycle. Additionally, we find that a large α/β ratio indicates the existence of a significant quiescent phase. The active-quiescent model is extended as a nonlinear birth–death process in order to derive an explicit time dependent expression for the tumour control probability (TCP). This work extends the TCP formula from Zaider and Minerbo and it enables the TCP to be calculated for general time dependent treatment schedules...|$|R
40|$|Two EDFs with {{different}} <b>radiation</b> <b>sensitivities</b> {{were used in}} the photo-annealing tests. We compared photo-annealing efficiencies obtained by using 532 nm and 976 nm lasers. The 532 nm laser with 10 mW showed better efficiency than 976 nm laser with 290 mW in a ~ 30 cm EDF. The recovery rate was 5. 6 seconds of the half-height recovery time. The 532 nm laser possibly excited the defects and provided some thermal energy so that the defects could be recovered. The annealing efficiency from using the 976 nm laser was close to the one purely from thermal annealing at ~ 330 к. For practical tests, we also built two SPB SFSs and a bidirectional SFS and measured the output power loss dependence on pump power. Under the dose rate of 129. 2 krad/hr, the recovery rate of output power loss was 0. 009 dB/min when a 2. 8 m EDF# 1 co-pumped by both the 532 nm and the 976 nm lasers...|$|R
