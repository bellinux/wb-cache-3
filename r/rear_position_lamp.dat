25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by rear position lamps (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. Rear position lamps may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> <b>lamp</b> function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying rear position lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|Vehicles are {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} lights and reflectors to mark their presence, position, width, length, and direction of travel as well as to convey the driver's intent and actions to other drivers. These include the vehicle's headlamps, front and <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> <b>lamps,</b> side marker lights and reflectors, turn signals, stop (brake) lamps, and reversing lamps. School buses and Semi-trailer trucks in North America are required to bear retroreflective strips outlining their side and rear perimeters for greater conspicuity at night.|$|R

5000|$|... ====Stop lamps (brake lights)==== Red steady-burning rear lights, {{brighter}} than the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> <b>lamps,</b> are activated when the driver applies the vehicle's brakes. These are called stop lamps in some countries and brake lights in others, and stop light in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. They are required to be fitted in multiples of two, symmetrically at {{the left and right}} edges of the rear of every vehicle. International UN regulations specify a range of acceptable intensity for a stop lamp of 60 to 185 candela. In North America where the UN regulations are not recognised, the acceptable range for a single-compartment stop lamp is 80 to 300 candela.|$|R
2500|$|In Europe {{and other}} {{countries}} adhering to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be equipped {{with one or two}} bright red [...] "rear fog lamps", which serve as high-intensity <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> <b>lamps</b> to be turned on by the driver in conditions of poor visibility to make the vehicle more visible from the rear. The allowable range of intensity for a rear fog lamp is 150 to 300 candela, which is within the range of a U.S. stop lamp (brake light). Rear fog lamps are not required equipment in the U.S., but they are permitted, and are found almost exclusively on European-brand vehicles in North America. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, MINI, Land Rover, Porsche, Saab and Volvo provide functional rear fog lights on their North American models. Some vehicles from non-European brands which are adaptions of European-market offerings, such as the first generation Ford Transit Connect, come standard with rear fog lights, or vehicles with European market counterparts, such as the second generation Chrysler 300, have an option for them. The final generation Oldsmobile Aurora also had dual rear fog lights installed in the rear bumper as standard equipment.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this system (Rear Lighting System) is to provide {{illumination}} for the driver to operate the commercial vehicle safely after dark in highway, to increase the conspicuity of the vehicle, and especially be suggesting the finest observable improvement method, depending on color and pattern of rear lighting system of truck for midnight highway traffic. METHODS: Rear lightning system as an improving way for forward commercial vehicles lighting the securing sight from human factors and the surrounding environment in midnight driving. For this one, basic materials were collected from the data analysis about many types of problems, and filed investigation for establishing Driving Simulator. also taking statistic test to human volunteers after finding recognizable distance of them. RESULTS: As a result, color with the highest visuality is amber followed by green-red-blue as in order for all road types. Especially almost no difference is found between red and green, also when the light is turn off, recognizable distances is wide difference compared {{to turn on the}} light. One more thing about study per pattern, upper and entire lighting have similar recognizable distances, but under lighting shows short distance with difficulty securing sight from medians. And straight section shows similar recognizable distances. By finding visuality improvement method depending on color and pattern of supplement taillight, it is expected to suggest quantitative judgement standard for introducing regulation and improvement of supplement taillight.

40|$|Abstract. The {{ability for}} {{motorcycle}} to be detected {{is an important}} aspect in preventing crash involving motorcycle {{which is the most}} dominant vehicle in emerging countries. Widely referred as conspicuity, the crash factor is appropriately addressed by the introduction of mandatory daytime running light (DRL) law and is usually a success story {{in many parts of the}} world. In 2011, there was a motion introduced in the 64 thsession of the United Nations Working Party on Lighting and Light-Signalling (GRE) for amber <b>position</b> <b>lamp</b> (APL) to be made mandatory on motorcycle as additional measure to improve motorcycle conspicuity. An experiment was designed to evaluate conspicuity level of motorcycle headlamp and tail lamp equipped with APL over motorcycle with present DRL setting (baseline). 15 participants simultaneously rated both motorcycles which are placed in parallel, at different distances and times of day. Motorcycle with APL was noticeably better detected from rear than front at 50 meter and 100 meter distance, as well as during night time and twilight. Median conspicuity level between night time and daytime and between night time and twilight was also distinctly different for rear lamp. These findings suggest that APL introduction could enhance motorcycle conspicuity especially for <b>rear</b> <b>lamp</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R

Colloquial city light terminology for front <b>position</b> <b>lamps</b> derives from the practice, formerly adhered to in cities like Moscow, London and Paris, of driving at night in built-up areas using these low-intensity lights rather than headlamps.|$|R

40|$|One {{of major}} sources of air {{pollution}} {{is the result of}} combustion exhaust gases of automotive engines. As it is known that the process of fuel combustion from motor fuel produces exhaust gases which theoretically contain elements of CO, NO x, HC, CO 2, H 2 O and N 2, where many of which are polluting the surrounding environment in the form of air pollution.  The use of LPG fuel for gasoline engine can be done by adding a piece of equipment called a conversion kit.  In this study the fuel in the LPG gas injected in the intake manifold with some variation of spin injection with 3000  rpm, 4500 rpm and 6000 rpm for each transmision rate (Neutral s / d Gear 4).  The result showed that the injection of fuel gas LPG in the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> (P 3) in getting a decrease in fuel Consumtion (FC) is optimal compared to other injection position (P 1, P 2).
