500|$|The next morning, flight day five, Young and Duke ate {{breakfast and}} began {{preparations}} for the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA), or moonwalk. After the pair donned and pressurized their space suits and depressurized the Lunar Module cabin, Young climbed out onto the [...] "porch" [...] of the LM, a small platform above the ladder. Duke handed Young a jettison bag full of trash to dispose of on the surface. Young then lowered the equipment transfer bag (ETB), containing equipment for use during the EVA, to the surface. Young descended the ladder and, upon setting foot on the lunar surface, became the ninth human {{to walk on the}} Moon. Upon stepping onto the surface, Young expressed his sentiments about being there: [...] "There you are: Mysterious and Unknown Descartes. Highland plains. Apollo 16 is gonna change your image. I'm sure glad they got ol' Brer Rabbit, here, back in the briar patch where he belongs." [...] Duke soon descended the ladder and joined Young on the surface, becoming the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon, at age 36. After setting foot on the lunar surface, Duke expressed his excitement, commenting: [...] "Fantastic! Oh, that first foot on the lunar surface is super, Tony!" [...] The pair's first task of the moonwalk was to unload the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph (UVC), and other equipment, from the Lunar Module. This was done without problems. On first driving the lunar rover, Young discovered that the <b>rear</b> <b>steering</b> was not working. He alerted Mission Control to the problem before setting up the television camera and planting the flag of the United States with Duke. The day's next task was to deploy the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP); while they were parking the lunar rover, on which the TV camera was mounted, to observe the deployment, the <b>rear</b> <b>steering</b> began functioning without explanation. While deploying a heat-flow experiment (that had burned up with the Lunar Module Aquarius on Apollo 13 and had been attempted with limited success on Apollo 15), a cable was inadvertently snapped after getting caught around Young's foot. After ALSEP deployment, they collected samples in the vicinity. About four hours after the beginning of EVA-1, they mounted the lunar rover and drove to the first geologic stop, Plum Crater, a [...] crater on the rim of Flag crater, about [...] across. There, at a distance of [...] from the LM, they sampled material from the vicinity of Flag Crater, which scientists believed penetrated through the upper regolith layer to the underlying Cayley Formation. It was there that Duke retrieved, at the request of Mission Control, the largest rock returned by an Apollo mission, a breccia nicknamed Big Muley after mission geology principal investigator William R. Muehlberger. The next stop of the day was Buster Crater, about [...] from the LM. There, Duke took pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater while Young deployed a magnetic field experiment. At that point, scientists began to reconsider their pre-mission hypothesis that Descartes had been the setting of ancient volcanic activity, as the two astronauts had yet to find any volcanic material. Following their stop at Buster, Young did a demonstration drive of the lunar rover while Duke filmed with a 16 mm movie camera. After completing more tasks at the ALSEP, they returned to the LM to close out the moonwalk. They reentered the LM 7 hours, 6 minutes, and 56 seconds after the start of the EVA. Once inside, they pressurized the LM cabin, went through a half-hour briefing with scientists in Mission Control, and configured the cabin for the sleep period.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper discuses sensor {{steering}} mechanism (SSM) for a laterally guided vehicle with a <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> mechanism. The authors {{have demonstrated the}} geometry of SSMs for front wheel steering type and reverse phase four-wheel steering type vehicles. SSMs allow stable lateral guiding performance for automated vehicles following a path with straight and curved portions created by a guideway. On other hand, no SSM has been established for a <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> type vehicle. <b>Rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> vehicles include forklifts and backward moving conventional motor vehicles which are front wheel vehicles. A SSM for <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> vehicles would enable a forklift to move into any spaces using automation. This paper proposes a SSM relation for a <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> vehicle and describes the construction of experimental robotic vehicle with the proposed SSM. Simulated and an experimental data show {{the advantages of the}} proposed SSM...|$|R

2500|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with {{rack and pinion steering}} replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive <b>rear</b> <b>steering</b> under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 Gs or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. [...] Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. [...] The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> is a {{well-known}} technology that has been researched for many years but have only had limited market acceptance in niche applications. Increased urbanization {{and the advent of}} autonomous drive could change the impact of <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> in favor of greater market acceptance but in what way needs to be better understood. Low-speed maneuverability and highway lateral comfort are two attributes believed to be affected by the introduction of <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering.</b> Lateral comfort includes comfort in the general sense with vibrations and high-frequency oscillations, but also low-frequency oscillations which may lead to motion sickness. A literature study was conducted in order to better understand the nature of motion which causes discomfort in automobiles, and means of evaluating comfort. A frequency weighting according to ISO-standard was used for comfort and a weighting found in literature was used for motion sickness in the lateral direction as this is still an unexplored area. Maneuverability was assessed using two analytical cases; curvature and swept path width, and two driving scenarios; rear-end parking and driving through a T-crossing. Two control laws were used; one feedforward and one feedback. The feedforward control law was designed to keep the body side slip angle zero at steady state cornering, and the feedback control was taken from literature with the aim of dampening yaw rate. This control law is mainly designed for stability, and was thus not used in low-speed maneuvers and only used for comparison in highway maneuvers. The angle on the rear wheels was limited to +/- 5 °. <b>Rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> performed well at low speeds, improving the maneuverability by increasing the maximum curvature for a given steering wheel angle by 12 % and decreasing the swept path width up to 14 %. The vehicle with <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> also performed better in the driving scenarios by occupying less space during the maneuver. Overtaking and a sinus steer were the two maneuvers used to assess comfort and motion sickness. <b>Rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> at high speeds decreased the measures of discomfort by 8. 17 % in the sinus steer maneuver and with 18. 16 % for a passenger in the rear seat, and MSDV is decreased by 7. 32 % in the sinus steer and by 4. 04 % in the overtaking maneuver for a passenger in the rear seat, implying that a vehicle equipped with <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> is more comfortable. Yaw stability was assessed as a final objective where it was shown that <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering,</b> both the feedforward and feedback control, improved stability leading to a safer vehicle. To conclude, {{the results of this study}} implies that <b>rear</b> wheel <b>steering</b> can lead to improved maneuverability in low-speeds, improved comfort during highway driving, and improved safety in terms of stability...|$|R
