It is assumed that the overburden height {{is much greater than}} the layer thickness. Estimates of the amplitude of the water-level fluctuation in the well are made when the oscillation is caused by a small periodic gravity perturbation describing an Earth tide. It is shown that the maximum possible amplitude is inversely proportional to the layer porosity, and is attained only when the length (<b>radius)</b> <b>of</b> layer <b>influencing</b> the well exceeds a critical length. This critical length is much smaller for axi-symmetric flow than for plane flow.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} acoustic tagging of 8 yellowfin tunas (#Thunnus albacares$, Bonnaterre, 1788) undertaken around Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in La Reunion island (Indian Ocean). Emphasis is laid on {{the horizontal}} movements and thus complete previous studies on vertical movements around the same FADs. The first result {{of the present study}} deals with the relative dwelling time of yellowfin over the distance to FAD where tagged, in 0. 9 km intervals. Distributions of dwelling time are different between day and night. During daytime, the fishes remain in the close vicinity of the FAD (mostly within a 1. 8 km radius), whilst a drastic disassociation to the FAD occurs at night. During the day, the attractive <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the FAD disappears 9. 3 km away; this finding leads to the suggestion that a minimum distance of 18 km between neighbouring FADs should be applied in La Reunion to avoid overlapping <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> The second group of results points out the potential use of the vertical and total swimming speeds as indicators of the foraging activity of the fish and of the type of movements (behaviour of tight association to FAD, transit among FADs or offshore migration, away from the area of FADs). The day/night change affects the vertical activity, with large magnitude of vertical movements exhibited at night. The total speed during the offshore movements is estimated about 1. 2 m/s : the shift from a phase of tight association to FAD toward a phase of transit movement is characterised by an increase of the total speed. A typology of the relationships between swimming speed and feeding activity is proposed and discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
