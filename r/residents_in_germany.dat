The number of asylum seekers from the Western Balkans area has dramatically increased during the last year. A possible reason can be the increased time for application processes.

On the basis of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) data, we find that for native Germans, intra-ethnic friendships shorten the duration of spells of unemployment, whereas inter-ethnic friendships do not. For the Turkish migrants, inter-ethnic friendships reduce the duration of unemployment, whereas intra-ethnic friendships do not. In other words, only friendships with German natives facilitate the transition to employment, but in particular for Turkish migrants. This effect is largest for migrants with a low level of education. status: publishe...|$|E

The {{results showed that the}} participants had medium or medium-high scores on all the psychosocial variables and that there were significant correlations between them. Regarding the sociodemographic factors, although no significant association was found between life satisfaction and having a job, significant associations were found between life satisfaction and the other factors. Of these factors, perceived social class had the biggest effect. The results also showed that intrinsic job satisfaction, perceived social class, attachment to the place of residence, and self-esteem predicted life satisfaction (explaining 55. 5...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{describe}} hospitalisations {{of nursing}} home (NH) <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Germany</b> during their last months of life. Methods Retrospective cohort study on 792 NH residents in the Rhine-Neckar region in South-West Germany, newly institutionalized in the year 2000, who died until the study end (December 2001). Baseline variables were derived from a standardized medical examination routinely conducted by the medical service {{of the health care}} insurance plans in Germany. Information on hospitalisations and deaths was extracted form records of the pertinent health insurance plans. Results NH residents who died after NH stay of more than 1 year spent 5. 8 % of their last year of life in hospitals. Relative time spent in hospitals increased from 5. 2 % twelve months before death (N = 139 persons) to 24. 1 % in their last week of life (N = 769 persons). No major differences could be observed concerning age, gender or duration of stay in NH. Overall, 229 persons (28. 9 %) died in hospital. Among these, the last hospital stay lasted less than 3 days for 76 persons (31. 9 %). Another 25 persons (3. 2 %) died within three days after hospital discharge. Conclusion Our study indicates that proximity of death is the most important driver of health care utilization among NH residents. The relation of age or gender to health care expenditures seem to be weak once time to death is controlled for. Duration of NH stay does not markedly change rates of hospitalisation during the last months of life. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In {{different}} German regions, seminar {{programs have}} been conducted for General practice residents. In each region, selection and teaching of learning content is conducted in a different manner. So far, no structured, standardized curriculum has been implemented nationwide. We have investigated, if {{the development of a}} common 5 -year program of learning topics is conceivable between the different university departments of General practice in Germany. Method: The seminar program working group of the DEGAM (German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians) has conducted an online survey based on information gathered via preliminary telephone conference (n= 7; physicians with postgraduate teaching experience) among all German university departments of General Practice and two non-university teaching institutions, identified via the internet. 884 topics were extracted from 14 Seminar programs. The topics were entered in a database, discussed and categorized: Practice management/practice work flow/standardized documentation forms/quality management (n= 33 topics), common acute and chronic diseases, including disease management programs (n= 29 topics), communication, neurological, psychological and psychiatric consultations (n= 24 topics), common medical problems, including eye, ear, nose, throat, skin and pediatric problems (n= 99 Topics) family physicians general approach, including epidemiology, shared decision making, test of time (n= 42 Topics). These topics have been rated for priority and desirable number of teaching-units. Results: A catalogue of 111 topics was designed, encompassing 160 teaching units. There is a suggestion of wide topics collections plus an add-on catalogue. Conclusion: A proposal for a 5 -year-thematic catalogue for postgraduate training of general practice <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Germany</b> has been developed. This newly developed curriculum has the potential to improve knowledge and skills that have not been covered during in-house and ambulatory general practice residencies...|$|E
