The mat serves as {{the base of the}} building, from which its spine rises. Those involved with the construction referred to the day as the [...] "Big Pour". James McHugh Construction Co. was contracted for the concrete work on this job. They obtained the concrete from the Chicago Avenue and Halsted Street distribution site of Prairie Material Sales Inc of Bridgeview, Illinois, the former largest privately owned <b>ready-mix</b> <b>concrete</b> company in the United States. Prairie used a formula of concrete that had never been used in the construction business to meet a [...] specification, which exceeded the standard [...] for conventional concrete.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The use of <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> primarily involves two parties, the supplier and the customer (who is usually a construction contractor), although others may be involved. <b>Ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> {{is not only a}} product, it is also a service. This implies that the supply of <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> should satisfy the customers' needs in relation to both quality and supply. To satisfy quality requirements, <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> must contain suitable materials, and be produced under conditions of quality control by experienced staff using reliable equipment To meet the supply requirement, it must be delivered at the time and rate required. Based on the findings in several surveys and studies, the UK <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> industry appears to meet the quality requirement quite well. However, the service provided to the customers could be improved. In addition, the industry's efficiency is not satisfactory when compared to its counterparts in other European countries such as Germany. Due to the peculiar characteristics of the product, which has a "shelf life" of only a few hours, and the unpredictable nature of the operating environment, the planning and scheduling problems of the production and delivery activities are usually unstructured and complex. In practice, UK <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> companies rely on their shippers' personal experience or intuition to make their planning and scheduling decisions. This research explored the feasibility of using a knowledge-based decision support system for planning' and scheduling the production and delivery of <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete.</b> A prototype called ISRMC has been successfully developed {{as a result of a}} study of the operations of concrete production and construction as well as the <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> production and delivery process and detailed collection of knowledge from various sources...|$|R

The commercial production of <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> can speed up the construction progress, reduce environment pollution, improve the quality of engineering and save material costs, and is characterized by batch mixing and social supply of commodities, {{which is one of the}} important means to realize Architecture industrialization.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is the {{examination}} of the properties of waste water obtained from a <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> plant and its utilization potential as mixing water for concrete production. Design/methodology/approach: Samples of waste water from several points of a water recycling process from a <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> plant were examined for their chemical properties (Cl-,SO 2 - 4 alkalies, total solids, pH) and compared with the specifications applied for concrete mixing water. Also samples of dry sludge powder from the water-recycling process tank were taken and tested for their chemical composition, particle size distribution, mineralogical composition and thermogravimetrical results. The water samples were examined for their behavior in concrete specimens with and without admixtures and also for their effect in water demand and setting times in cement pastes. Findings: All tests showed that waste water is suitable for concrete mixing water and that it can be used without any treatment or dilution, thus contributing to water saving. Practical implications: Waste water from <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> plants is classified as waste hazardous for disposal due to its high pH value (over 11. 5). Very few <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> plants that recycle waste water follow a complicated process through multiple overflows and a stage of neutralization, with HClaq addition. Originality/value: It is obvious that the results of this investigation contribute to the protection of the environment from hazardous waste water disposal and the <b>ready-mixed</b> <b>concrete</b> industry from fresh water costs and any additional cost for buying and conserving an unnecessarily complicated water-recycling system. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
