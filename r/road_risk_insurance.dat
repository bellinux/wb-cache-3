This paper argues that political <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> may in fact be a source of political risk. Looking at cases in the Asia-Pacific region, we argue that investing firms should exercise caution when considering political <b>risk</b> <b>insurance.</b> We conclude with several recommendations for reform of the political <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> industry. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>insurance</b> {{can provide}} an {{effective}} means of catastrophic risk reduction and climate change adaptation in the developing countries. The ongoing discussions by the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are putting substantial efforts to promote climate change adaptation through international cooperation in the form of providing additional finances and technologies including proposals to promote a global or regional climate <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> facility. Case studies from within and outside the Asia-Pacific region provide valuable lessons which could be used for promoting <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> by the future climate regime (post-Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012). The analysis of these <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> proposals to the Convention and comparison of what they intend to achieve with that of the existing issues within the <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> sector in the developing Asia-Pacific indicate that these proposals address some of the major issues that are limiting the spread of <b>risk</b> <b>insurance.</b> However, no single proposal is comprehensive enough to address all the issues and all the proposals lack details in terms of how they can achieve what they intend to achieve. There is a need for the proposals to the Convention to give more thought on how they address the issues such as high base risks, lack of historical data required for designing <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> systems, limited awareness in the utility of insurance instruments, keeping the premium prices within affordable levels, encouraging the role of private sector, enabling greater access to reinsurers, and instituting enabling policies t...|$|R

40|$|China {{has been}} {{announced}} {{to be the}} world’s largest shipbuilder in 2010. However, I understood that, the research on builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance,</b> which aims to protect the shipbuilding industry, is unfortunately quite limited. The countries, which having such important shipping interests as China, should have a well developed body of law dealing with builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> issues. The Institute Builder’s Risk Clauses (ILU clauses), the People’s Insurance Company of China Builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> clauses (PICC clauses) and the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan of 1996 (NMIP clauses) are the main regulations governing builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> in UK, China and Norway. In this thesis, {{we will look at}} builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> under the three legal systems and make a comparison base on these clauses to find out the similarities and differences between them. This thesis is composed by six parts. An introduction of reasons and aims of this paper is showed in chapter 1. A general outlook of builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> on the concept, character, risks and insured interest is presented in chapter 2. The legal sources governing the builder’s <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> in the three countries can be found in chapter 3. A comparison in chapter 4 between these three systems is generally illustrated base on the topics about the insurance period, subject-matter insured, place of insurance and insurable value. The topic “peril covered” is specifically discussed in chapter 5 as well as the two interesting issues on the “all risks and named risks principle” and “latent defects” are addressed.

40|$|Globally {{as well as}} in the Asia-Pacific region, {{disasters}} and related insured and uninsured losses are on the rise. <b>Risk</b> <b>insurance</b> has been argued to provide effective means of catastrophic risk reduction and climate change adaptation in the developing countries. Both life and other types of insurances play an important role in disaster risk reduction. However, in terms of the volume of insurance premiums life insurances are more prevailing than the non-life insurances and hence, there is a need to bridge the gap between both to achieve the maximum possible coverage. Though there are several policy and institutional initiatives to promote <b>risk</b> <b>insurance</b> in the Asia-Pacific region, the region has not been able to utilize the full potential of <b>risk</b> <b>insurance.</b> In order to promote <b>risk</b> <b>insurance,</b> this chapter encourages that the proposals by the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) need to address some obvious but most relevan...|$|R
