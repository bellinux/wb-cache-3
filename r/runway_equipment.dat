The weather rules characterize {{certain aspects of the}} environment related to the launching or landing site, the time of the day or night, the pad or runway conditions, the mission durations, the <b>runway</b> <b>equipment</b> and landing type. Expert system rules are derived from weather contingency rules, which were developed over several years by NASA. Backward chaining, a goal-directed inference method is adopted, because a particular consequence or goal clause is evaluated first, and then chained backward through the rules. Once a rule is satisfied or true, then that particular rule is fired and the decision is expressed. The expert system is continuously verifying the rules against the past one-hour weather conditions and the decisions are made. The normal procedure of operations requires a formal pre-launch weather briefing held on Launch minus 1 day, which is a specific weather briefing for all areas of Space Shuttle launch operations. In this paper, the Web-based Weather Expert System of the Intelligent Launch and range Operations program is presented...|$|E

50|$|Cleaning {{the runway}} using {{chemicals}} involves {{the application of}} proprietary cleaners that are brushed into {{the surface of the}} runway and then washed off using low pressure water. There is a time between applying the chemicals and washing the runway when the chemicals are allowed to react with and break down the rubber. During this time the runway is unusable for landing operations and therefore could not be used safely in an emergency situation. The chemicals used can be expensive and require special handling. There are currently a newer generation of non-caustic rubber removal chemicals that are also environmentally superior, non-corrosive, non-toxic and relatively inexpensive to use. Some runway maintenance crews like the ability to do their rubber removal in-house using existing or lower cost machinery with a more regular, preventive maintenance program. Chemicals for rubber removal have proven to have no long-term effect on either asphalt or concrete <b>runways.</b> Using <b>equipment</b> to recover waste water/chemical/rubber allows control and safety of disposal with no runoff.|$|R

The restrictive requirement for <b>runways</b> and special <b>equipment</b> to take off and land was partially solved by the vertical {{take off and landing}} Airborne Remotely Operated Device, AROD. Work done at the Naval Postgraduate School has modified the AROD to not only land and launch vertically, but to fly horizontally {{for the majority of the}} mission. To realize these capabilities, as well as that of autonomous flight, an accurate computer model was required of both the AROD and the avionics test bed aircraft, Bluebird, in order to design the control and navigation systems. High fidelity, non-linear equations of motion were derived in matrix form that represented any six degree of freedom aircraft model, and were then tailored for use on specific aircraft. Computer modeling of the resulting equations of motion, as well as the sensors used on the aircraft, was done using SIMULINK and MATLAB software. The resulting computer model provides a non-linear system of equations, which are easily linearized at any desired flight condition, as required by the proposed control and navigation system design[URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R
40|$|Days of {{operations}} in the National Airspace System {{can be described in}} term of traffic demand, <b>runway</b> conditions, <b>equipment</b> outages, and surface and enroute weather conditions. These causes manifest themselves in terms of departure delays, arrival delays, enroute delays and traffic flow management delays, Traffic flow management initiatives such as, ground stops, ground delay programs, miles-in-trail restrictions, rerouting and airborne holding are imposed to balance the air traffic demand with respect to the available capacity, In order to maintain operational efficiency of the National Airspace System, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) maintains delay sad other statistics in the Air Traffic Operations Network (OPSNET) and the Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) databases. OPSNET data includes reportable delays of fifteen minutes ox more experienced by Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) flights. Numbers of aircraft affected by departure delays, enroute delays, arrival delays and traffic flow delays are recorded in the OPSNET data. ASPM data consist of number of actual departures, number of canceled departures, percentage of on time departures, percentage of on time gate arrivals, taxi-out delays. taxi-in delays, gate delays, arrival delays and block delays. Surface conditions at the major U. S. airports are classified in terms of Instrument Meteorological Condition (IMC) and Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC) {{as a function of the}} time of the day in the ASPM data. The main objective of this paper is to use OPSNET and ASPM data to classify the days in the datasets into few distinct groups, where each group is separated from the other groups in terms of a distance metric. The motivations for classifying the days are two-fold, 1) to enable selection of days of traffic with particular operational characteristics for concept evaluation using system-wide simulation systems such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Airspace Concepts Evaluation Tool (ACES) and 2) to enable evaluation of a given day with respect to the characteristics of the classified groups. The first part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of major trends seen in the OPSNET and ASPM data. The second part of the paper is devoted to describing features or measures derived from the OPSNET and ASPM data that are suitable for characterizing days, and the classification algorithm used for grouping the days. Finally, the method for evaluating the characteristics of a given day with respect to the properties of the groups is described...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for the usage of {{composite}} sandwich structures in the aircraft industry. Aircraft may suffer damage {{from a variety of}} impact sources such as ground service <b>equipment,</b> <b>runway</b> debris, bird strike, or hail ice. The damage response of hail ice impacts on composite sandwich structures is not well understood and they can often result in core damage without visually detectable surface damage. This seed damage may grow and lead to large-scale failure of the structure through repetitive operational loading, such as ground-air-ground cycles of aircraft (causes core internal pressurization). Therefore, it is necessary to understand the types of damage that can occur as a result of impacts. This study explores the effect of high velocity hail ice impact on damage formation in lightweight composite sandwich panels, particularly at a level that produces barely visible external damage. Panels consisting of two different facesheet thicknesses (1. 19 and 1. 87 mm) were impacted at angles of 25, 40, and 90 degrees at speeds of 25 and 50 m/ s. The tests revealed three different core damage modes. Any level of measurable surface damage was an indicator of the presence of internal core damage, but internal damage could also be present without measurable surface damage. Thus, visual inspection alone was not a reliable method of damage detection. No clear relationship was found between impact energy levels and internal damage state since, for example, both 83 and 20. 5 J tests produced core fracture, while a 16 J test did not produce any core damage. All core damage occurred at a depth of 3 - 5 mm from the impact- side faceshee...|$|R
40|$|På Robotförsöksplats Norrland, RFN, i Vidsel, har flygplan och robotar utprovats sedan 1958. Provplatsen har Västeuropas största provområde över land, med en area på över 1600 kvadratkilometer. Radar, Kinoteodoliter, Telemetri och Kameror används för att övervaka provobjektens rörelser. Att kunna följa robotbanan och lagra positionsdata är en väsentlig del av provningsverksamheten. All positionsdata samlas in av ledningsprogramvaran, BAPS, och används för att i realtid presentera positionsdata på en karta till stöd för provledaren. Samma data kan sedan bearbetas för att generera mera exakta positionsuppgifter i efterhand. 2001 infördes ett nytt geodetiskt referenssystem i Sverige, SWEREF 99. Till skillnad från det föregående systemet, RT 90, är det nya ett verkligt tredimensionellt globalt system. Eftersom all positionering görs i {{relation}} till ett referenssystem, och positioner utgör kärnan i RFN:s aktiviteter, är det av stor vikt att undersöka hur RFN skulle påverkas av att införa det nya referenssystemet. Det är syftet med denna rapport att undersöka detta. Att RFN skall införa SWEREF 99 är klart. Det finns många skäl för detta. Sedan några år tillbaka införs detta system över hela landet, hos kommuner, myndigheter och företag. Samverkan med dessa underlättas om RFN har samma referenssystem som de har. Än viktigare är att RFN har många utländska kunder, vilka oftast använder det till SWEREF 99 närbesläktade WGS 84. Vidare underlättas användningen av GNSS-teknologi av att SWEREF 99 och WGS 84 ligger så nära varandra. Idag använder RFN en kombination av de gamla nationella systmen, RT 90 och RH 70, och en föregångare till SWEREF 99, det preliminära systemet SWEREF 93, som skiljer sig från SWEREF 99 med mindre än en decimeter. SWEREF 93 används i tredimensionell kartesisk form i BAPS, vars algoritmer transformerar data till och från provsystemens format. Sammantaget har SWEREF 99 i och med denna rapports fastställande införts på RFN. Ett transformationssamband har etablerats mellan det gamla referenssystemet, en dialekt av RT 90, och SWEREF 99. Med hjälp av detta har befintliga stom- och brukspunkter transformerats till det nya systemet och en uppdaterad koordinatförteckning upprättats. Prov- och ledningssystem har analyserats med avseende på användning av positionsdata och ett antal förändringar i den kod som utgör dessa systems programvara har utförts. En algoritm för transformation mellan å ena sidan SWEREF 99 och å andra sidan SWEREF 93 och RR 92, har tagits fram och ett antal funktionsanrop i olika subrutiner har pekats om till att använda dessa nya algoritmer. Två nya koordinatlistor för sensorer har ersatts äldre i ledningssystemet, dels för BUS, dels för realtidskommunikationen med ett antal provsystem, såsom TM, KTS och RIR. Därmed är prov- och ledningssystem i allt väsentligt redo att börja använda det nya systemet. Robotförsöksplats Norrland (RFN = Vidsel Test Range), {{has been}} the main site for missile testing in Sweden since 1958. It has Europe’s largest test range over land, with an area of more than 1600 square kilometres. Radars, kinotheodolites, telemetry and cameras are used to monitor the test object during flight. Following the missile trajectory and registering position data {{is central to the}} testing. All position data is collected by the command and control software, BAPS, and used to present real time position information on a map to support the personnel responsible for the test. The data can also be processed after the test to generate more exact evaluation of the flight. In 2001 a new geodetic reference system, SWEREF 99, was introduced in Sweden. Unlike the old system it replaced, RT 90, this new system is a truly global three dimensional system. Since all positioning is done in relation to a geodetic reference system, and since positioning {{is at the core of}} the activities at RFN, it is of great importance to investigate how the introduction of this new reference system would affect RFN. That is the aim of this report. There is really no question about if SWEREF 99 should be introduced at RFN. For several reasons it should be. In the last five years most authorities, companies and municipalities in Sweden have adopted this new system, replacing RT 90 or local systems, and others will follow. Coordination with these entities would be much simplified if RFN used the same reference system. Further, SWEREF 99 is a global system, closely following the GPS-system, WGS 84. Using this new system allows RFN to fully utilise GPS technology. Finally, since many test range customers come from other countries, a global system simplifies coordination with them as well. Today RFN uses a combination of the old national system, RT 90, and a precursor to SWEREF 99, the preliminary reference system SWEREF 93. This later system differs from SWEREF 99 by less then a decimetre, and is used in three dimensional Cartesian form in BAPS, whose algorithms transforms data to and from the test systems to that system. The first step of the project was to establish transformation parameters between the new system and the old ones. This was done using methods developed by the Swedish Land Survey Office to help municipalities introduce the new system in a project called RIX- 95. Using these parameters it was possible to transform all coordinates for reference points, sensors, <b>runways</b> and other <b>equipment</b> stored in the RFN geo database. Next step was an analysis of the command and control software, BAPS, in order to understand what changes would be necessary when introducing SWEREF 99. In most cases it turned out that changing the software sensor position list was enough to ensure that the system would retain its functionality, but using the new reference system instead. In some cases, though, it became necessary to alter the source code to the software, adding subroutines to transform coordinates between SWEREF 99 and the old systems SWEREF 93 and RT 90. These changes have been made, and the resulting code added to this report as appendixes together with various documents related to the transformation of coordinates. Most of the calculations and resulting tables, formulas and parameters are presented in the main body of the report only. Implementing the changes recommended in this report will introduce SWEREF 99 at RFN, maintaining all present functions in the test and command and control systems. There are also some recommendations for changes that would be beneficial to carry out in a longer perspective. Apart from further changes in the software recommendations include reconnaissance of existing reference points around the Vidsel airport, and the introduction of a geodetic survey manual for personnel involved in surveying at the test range...|$|R
