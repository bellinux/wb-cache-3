40|$|SUMMARY-The {{capacities}} of transplanted rat bone marrow to <b>repopulate</b> granulocytic and erythroid tissue were assayed separately {{and the effects}} of treatment with dimethylmyleran, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin D and of incubation in vitro with high concentrations of tritiated thymidine were compared. From these results and other repopula-tion experiments, it is probable that erythroid and granulocytic <b>repopulating</b> cells are distinct, and that the 2 <b>repopulating</b> ability techniques do not measure a common stem-cell pool. The granulocytic <b>repopulating</b> cells proliferate more slowly than their erythroid counterparts as judged by the response to cycle-time-dependent drugs.

40|$|SummaryThe {{generation}} of in vivo <b>repopulating</b> hematopoietic cells from in vitro differentiating {{embryonic stem cells}} has remained a long-standing challenge. To date, hematopoietic engraftment has mostly been achieved through the enforced expression of ectopic transcription factors. Here, we describe serum-free culture conditions that allow the {{generation of}} in vivo <b>repopulating</b> hematopoietic cells {{in the absence of}} ectopically expressed factors. We show that <b>repopulating</b> activity arises immediately upon the commitment of mesodermal precursors to the blood program, within the first wave of hematopoietic specification. We establish that the formation of these progenitors is extremely transient and exquisitely sensitive to the cytokine milieu. Our findings define the precise differentiating stage at which hematopoietic <b>repopulating</b> activity first appears in vitro, and suggest that during embryonic stem cell differentiation, all hematopoietic programs are unraveled simultaneously from the mesoderm in the absence of cues that restrict the coordinated emergence of each lineage as is normally observed during embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Diminished stem-cell {{functions}} {{with age}} {{may be a}} major cause of anemias and other defects. Unfortunately, treatments that increase stem-cell function can also increase the incidence of cancers. Lifelong dietary restriction (DR) is known to decrease spontaneous cancers and lengthen lifespan. This study examines the effect of DR on the ability of bone marrow cells to <b>repopulate</b> irradiated recipients and produce erythrocytes and lymphocytes. In BALB/cByJ (BALB) mice, <b>repopulating</b> abilities decline with age; DR ameliorates this trend. In C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) and (BALB × B 6) F 1 hybrid (F 1) mice, <b>repopulating</b> abilities increase with age; DR maintains this increase. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers are highly variable in aged BALB mice; however, the observed loss of marrow function results from a major loss in <b>repopulating</b> ability per HSC. DR greatly ameliorates this loss of function with age. In contrast, function per HSC in B 6 mice is affected neither by age nor by DR. Thus, DR increases or maintains increased marrow <b>repopulating</b> ability with age in the 3 different genotypes tested, but effects on function per HSC depend on genotype. That DR increases or maintains stem-cell function with age, while decreasing cancer, has far-reaching health implications...|$|R

While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons.

Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age.

By 2004, sea otters had <b>repopulated</b> all of their former habitat in these areas, with an estimated total population of about 27,000.

Gaza fell to the Israelites in about 1000 BCE but became part of the Assyrian Empire around 730 BCE. Alexander the Great besieged and captured the city in 332 BCE. Most of the inhabitants were killed during the assault, and the city, which became a center for Hellenistic learning and philosophy, was resettled by nearby Bedouins. The area changed hands regularly between two Greek successor-kingdoms, the Seleucids of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt, until it was besieged and taken by the Hasmoneans in 96 BCE.|$|E

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} a disease with high {{incidence}} and mortality rates. A recent research {{focus has been on}} identifying cells of origin which initiate tumourigenesis and cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells responsible for tumour growth and resistance to therapies, as they are an important novel therapeutic target. Our ability to identify these cells in the prostate has been hampered by a lack of human models to study disease progression. Whilst the use of primary human prostate cancer specimens is preferable over commonly used cell and xenograft lines, they display low survival and growth in in vivo assays. It is well established that the stroma {{plays an important role in}} prostate biology, however is rarely considered in the use of cancer cell focused approaches. As such this thesis aimed to create models of prostate cancer that are biologically accurate, in order to identify cells of origin and cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells, by providing an enriching stromal environment to primary tissues. Chapter 3 aimed to define potential cells of origin in prostate cancer. Stem cells and transient-amplifying/progenitors from the basal compartment were subjected to in vivo tumour initiation models where the stroma drives malignant transformation. The results confirmed that basal cells were able to initiate tumours, however the tumourigenic potential resided within the transient-amplifying cells, rather than the stem cells. Chapter 4 then examined prostate cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells. Due to observations that the stroma plays an important role in prostate biology, a bioassay was developed where primary localised prostate cancer tissues and cells were combined with inductive mouse mesenchyme to enhance survival and growth in vivo. Mouse mesenchyme did confer a survival and growth advantage of prostate cancer tissues and was essential for the survival and growth of subfractionated cancer cells, thus creating the first assay to study cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells in vivo using primary tissue. Chapter 5 utlised this chimeric xenografting approach to examine cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells in the context of systemic and paracrine androgen signalling, in attempt to identify the cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells which are resistant to current therapies. While androgen deprivation therapy is usually the treatment modality for advanced disease, this model demonstrated castrate-resistant cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells are also present in localised tumours. Furthermore, this study also showed that low stromal androgen receptor levels dampened the response to castration, demonstrating the complex relationship between cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Overall, this thesis reports the development of models which can be utilised to study cells of origin and cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells in prostate malignancy, using human clinical specimens. This body of work demonstrates the important role that the stroma plays in prostate cancer and maintaining a supportive microenvironment in in vivo models. Future efforts can use these models to further dissect the biology of prostate cancer progression, in particular determine how cancer <b>repopulating</b> cells can be therapeutically targeted to provide better outcomes for patients...|$|R

The Orthodox Chiprovtsi Monastery had been reestablished in 1703 by a certain Zhivko who took the ecclesiastical name of Zoticus. As the interrupted mining was apparently not continued after the uprising and the international trade links had been severed, the locals switched to cattle breeding, agriculture, fur trade and later carpet weaving as their main occupation.|$|E

5|$|In 1129, Emperor Gaozong {{designated}} the site at Hangzhou (known then as Lin'an) {{to be the}} temporary settlement of the court, {{but it was not}} until 1132 that it was declared the new Song capital.

Hangzhou was chosen not only for its natural scenic beauty, but for the surrounding topographic barriers of lakes and muddy rice-fields that gave it defensive potential against northern armies comprising mostly cavalry. Yet it was viewed by the court as only a temporary capital while the Song emperors planned to retake Kaifeng. However, the rapid growth of the city from the 12th century to the 13th necessitated long-term goals of residency. In 1133 the modest palatial residence of the imperial family was improved upon from a simple provincial lodging to one that at least accommodated strolls with new covered alleyways to deflect the rain. In 1148 the walls of the small palace compound were finally extended to the southeast, yet this was another marginal improvement.|$|E

5|$|Much circumstantial {{evidence}} points to the participation of Germanic people from Polish lands in the events {{that took place in}} the first half of the 1st century BC and found their culmination in Gaul in 58 BC, as related in Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico. At the time of the Suebi tribal confederation led by Ariovistus arrival in Gaul, a rapid decrease of settlement density can be observed in the areas of the upper and middle Oder River basin. In fact the Gubin group of the Jastorf culture disappeared then entirely, which may indicate this group's identity with one of the Suebi tribes. The western regions of the Przeworsk culture were also vacated (Lower Silesia, Lubusz Land and western Greater Poland), which is where the tribes accompanying the Suebi tribes must have come from. Burial sites and artifacts characteristic of the Przeworsk culture have been found in Saxony, Thuringia and Hesse, on the route of the Suebi offensive.

5|$|First {{inhabited}} for a {{short period}} {{in the second half of}} the fourth millennium BC, it was <b>repopulated</b> around 2800 BC and continued to grow.

The kingdom enjoyed good relations with Mari, but was engaged in constant warfare against Yamhad. By the 15th century BC, Qatna lost its hegemony and came under the authority of Mitanni. It later changed hands between the former and Egypt, until it was conquered and sacked by the Hittites in the late 14th century BC. Following its destruction, the city was reduced in size before being abandoned by the 13th century BC. It was re-inhabited in the 10th century BC, becoming a center of the kingdoms of Palistin then Hamath until it was destroyed by the Assyrians in 720 BC, which reduced it to a small village that eventually disappeared in the 6th century BC.

40|$|Long-term {{functional}} {{capacities of}} marrow cell lines were defined by competitive repopulation, a technique capable of detecting a small decline in <b>repopulating</b> abilities. There was {{little or no}} difference between cells from old and young donors, but a single serial transplantation caused a large decline in <b>repopulating</b> ability. Varying the numbers of marrow cells transplanted into the initial carrier from 10 (5) to 10 (7) did not alter {{the ability of the}} carrier's marrow cells to <b>repopulate</b> in competition with previously untransplanted cells. This ability was improved only in carriers that had received 10 (8) marrow cells, although deleterious effects of transplantation were still present. These effects were not solely caused by cell damage from the transplantation procedure, because transplantation by parabiosis, or recovery from sublethal irradiation without transplantation, reduced <b>repopulating</b> abilities as much as transplanting 10 (5) to 10 (7) marrow cells. The transplantation effect also was not caused solely by irradiation, because the same effect appeared in unirradiated W/Wv carriers. The transplantation effect was more pronounced when donors were identified by hemoglobin type than by chromosome markers, implying that nonerythroid cell lines may be less affected by transplantation than erythroid precursor cells. When the effects of a lifetime of normal function and a single transplantation were compared, the latter caused 3 - 7 times more decline in <b>repopulating</b> abilities of phytohemagglutinin-responsive cell precursors, and at least 10 - 20 times more decline in erythroid cell precursors. Stem cell lines can be serially transplanted at least five times before losing their ability to <b>repopulate</b> and save lethally irradiated recipients or to cure genetically anemic mice. Therefore, if transplantation causes an acceleration of the normal aging process, these figures suggest that stem cells should be able to function normally through at least 15 - 50 life spans...|$|R
