25|$|Mutagenesis experiment: The {{direct method}} to {{investigate}} the DFE is to induce mutations and then measure the mutational fitness effects, which {{has already been done}} in viruses, bacteria, yeast, and Drosophila. For example, most studies of the DFE in viruses used site-directed mutagenesis to create point mutations and measure relative fitness of each mutant. In Escherichia coli, one study used transposon mutagenesis to directly measure the fitness of a <b>random</b> <b>insertion</b> of a derivative of Tn10. In yeast, a combined mutagenesis and deep sequencing approach has been developed to generate high-quality systematic mutant libraries and measure fitness in high throughput. However, given that many mutations have effects too small to be detected and that mutagenesis experiments can detect only mutations of moderately large effect; DNA sequence data analysis can provide valuable information about these mutations.|$|E
25|$|Wild-type AAV has {{attracted}} considerable interest from gene therapy researchers {{due to a}} number of features. Chief amongst these is the virus's apparent lack of pathogenicity. It can also infect non-dividing cells and has the ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome at a specific site (designated AAVS1) in the human chromosome 19. This feature makes it somewhat more predictable than retroviruses, which present the threat of a <b>random</b> <b>insertion</b> and of mutagenesis, which is sometimes followed by development of a cancer. The AAV genome integrates most frequently into the site mentioned, while random incorporations into the genome take place with a negligible frequency. Development of AAVs as gene therapy vectors, however, has eliminated this integrative capacity by removal of the rep and cap from the DNA of the vector. The desired gene together with a promoter to drive transcription of the gene is inserted between the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) that aid in concatemer formation in the nucleus after the single-stranded vector DNA is converted by host cell DNA polymerase complexes into double-stranded DNA. AAV-based gene therapy vectors form episomal concatemers in the host cell nucleus. In non-dividing cells, these concatemers remain intact {{for the life of the}} host cell. In dividing cells, AAV DNA is lost through cell division, since the episomal DNA is not replicated along with the host cell DNA. Random integration of AAV DNA into the host genome is detectable but occurs at very low frequency. AAVs also present very low immunogenicity, seemingly restricted to generation of neutralizing antibodies, while they induce no clearly defined cytotoxic response. This feature, along with the ability to infect quiescent cells present their dominance over adenoviruses as vectors for human gene therapy.|$|E

This language is interpreted over finite datatypes and has a decidable equivalence problem. We have implemented an automated equivalence checker, which we call apex, for this language, based on game semantics. We illustrate our approach with three non-trivial case studies: (i) Herman’s self-stabilisation algorithm; (ii) an analysis of the average shape of binary search trees obtained by certain sequences of <b>random</b> <b>insertions</b> and deletions; and (iii) the problem of anonymity in the Dining Cryptographers protocol.

2500|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} concerning transgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. [...] This organism has been a helpful genetic model for over 100 years, due to its well-understood developmental pattern. [...] The transfer of transgenes into the Drosophila genome has been performed using various techniques, including P element, Cre-loxP, and ΦC31 insertion. [...] The most practiced method used thus far to insert transgenes into the Drosophila genome utilizes P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are translocated into the genome, without the presence of a complementary sequence in the host’s genome. [...] P elements are administered in pairs of two, which flank the DNA insertion region of interest. [...] Additionally, P elements often consist of two plasmid components, one known as the P element transposase and the other, the P transposon backbone. [...] The transposase plasmid portion drives the transposition of the P transposon backbone, containing the transgene of interest and often a marker, between the two terminal sites of the transposon. Success of this insertion results in the nonreversible addition of the transgene of interest into the genome. While this method has been proven effective, the insertion sites of the P elements are often uncontrollable, resulting in an unfavorable, <b>random</b> <b>insertion</b> of the transgene into the Drosophila genome.|$|E

Even when the data structure never contains more than three items at a time, it is shown that the performance of the standard tree search/insertion/deletion algorithm involves Bessel functions and the solution of bivariate integral equations. A step-by-step expository analysis of this problem is given, and it is shown how the difficulties arise and can be surmounted...|$|R

Analyses of auxotrophs obtained suggested simple <b>random</b> <b>insertions</b> of Tn 5. Syringotoxin-negative mutants arose at a frequency of about 0. 28 %. In a Southern blot analysis, the loss of toxin production was associated with Tn 5 insertions into chromosomal EcoRI fragments of about 10. 5, 17. 8, and 19. 3 kilobases. Data from a Southern blot analysis of SstI-digested DNA from these mutants suggest that the 10. 5 - and 17. 8 -kilobase EcoRI fragments may be adjacent to or near each other.

However, in practice, many XML-based applications are dynamic and involve frequent updates to the data.

Specifically, we propose algorithms that handle both the addition of new documents as well as <b>random</b> <b>insertions</b> in the existing document trees. We also show, through a detailed performance evaluation, that our incremental techniques are significantly faster than the naive recomputation approach; and that estimation accuracy can be maintained even with a fixed memory budget. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the capacity of}} binary deletion channels, where bits are deleted independently with probability d. It improves significantly upon the best previous framework used to obtain provable lower bounds on this capacity by utilizing a stronger definition of a typical output from the channel. The new results give the best known provable bounds on the capacity for all values of d. Moreover, the techniques presented here extend to yield lower bounds for channels with certain types of <b>random</b> <b>insertions,</b> namely, duplications, or combinations of duplications and deletions. To demonstrate these techniques in this context, two binary channels are analyzed: a channel where each transmitted bit is copied with probability v and a channel where each transmitted bit is copied a geometrically distributed number of times...|$|R

Some bacterial mobile element fusions are in evolutionarily conserved protein and RNA genes. Others might represent or lead to creation of new protein genes.

40|$|Transposon Tn 5 {{was used}} to produce <b>random</b> <b>insertions</b> in two hybrid cloning vectors for the {{unicellular}} cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans. The transposon-containing plasmids were used to localize essential replication functions and to characterize the stability of large inserts in these vectors.

A region of approximately 4 kilobases was essential for successful plasmid transformation and replication. This region {{has also been shown}} to be involved in plasmid replication by deletion analysis. High rates of excision of Tn 5 inserts within this region and restoration of normal replication function were observed when transformants were selected by using a resistance marker outside the replication region in the absence of selection for the transposon-coded kanamycin resistance. Transposon inserts outside this region were not deleted...|$|R
