5|$|During {{the decade}} of the 530s, it seemed to many that God had {{abandoned}} the Christian Roman Empire. There were noxious fumes in the air; and the Sun, while still providing day, <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> much heat. This caused famine unlike anything those of the time had seen before, weakening the people of Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{women were}} also given a more {{official}} standing.

5|$|As Buchenwald was {{a forced}} labor camp, the German {{authorities}} {{had intended to}} put the 168 airmen to work as slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could not and would not participate in war production. After a tense stand-off, during which time Lamason {{thought he would be}} shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.|$|E

In 2011 Dhani was reportedly in a relationship with Mulan and had a child with her, and Dhani gave Estianty visitation rights in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm {{signed off}} on the financial statements in the same year when other members of its global network apparently <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E

However, he also <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up General Hans Speidel, {{his chief of staff}} at Army Group B who was heavily implicated in the plot, to the Gestapo. Model was well aware of Speidel's political leanings, as were his predecessors at Army Group B, Erwin Rommel and Günther von Kluge. Like them, he shielded Speidel for as long as possible, while ignoring such treasonous talk as might take place.|$|E
5|$|Following the film's completion, Cagney {{went back}} to the USO and toured US {{military}} bases in the UK. He <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> interviews to the British press, preferring to concentrate on rehearsals and performances.

5|$|Meanwhile, Hadl {{learned that}} Tiger Electronics had {{licensed}} King Kong for a handheld game. He decided that Universal's earnings from it were too low {{and that the}} license's granting of exclusive rights to Tiger would impede the agreement with Coleco. On May 4, Sheinberg sent Tiger a mailgram demanding that they send their game in for further approval. Universal reviewed it and decided that King Kong was too similar to Donkey Kong. On May 8, Steinberg revoked Tiger's license, but Tiger president O. R. Rissman <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> in and challenged Universal's claim that it owned the King Kong name.|$|E
5|$|The main feud on the Raw brand {{was between}} John Cena and Randy Orton for the WWE Championship. Cena had {{retained}} the title against Orton at SummerSlam. The following night on Raw, Orton demanded a rematch for the title, but his request was declined by General Manager William Regal. Orton proceeded his demands to Mr. McMahon, who also <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him a rematch unless he proved himself. That night, Orton interfered in Cena's match by assaulting Cena and kicking Cena's father, {{who was at}} ringside, in the head. The following week, Orton was granted a title rematch against Cena at Unforgiven.|$|E
5|$|A {{fighter pilot}} based at Andrews Air Force Base, Billy Hutchison, claims that {{while in the}} air he spotted Flight 93 on his scope and planned to first fire his {{training}} rounds into the engine and cockpit, and then ram the airplane with his own jet. His account was published in Lynn Spencer's book Touching History. John Farmer, Senior Counsel to the 9/11 commission, pointed out that this account would have been impossible, as Hutchison's Air Andrews Squadron {{was not in the}} air until 10:38, almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 had crashed. When the 9/11 commission asked Hutchison why he gave this false claim he stormed {{out of the room and}} <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> an answer.|$|E
