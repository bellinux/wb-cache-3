After a stint in China he moved to Metro Manila, Philippines, establishing the country's first <b>reputation</b> <b>management</b> consultancy {{and two years later}} establishing the country's first digital public relations agency. Ahn taught a graduate-level course on digital public relations at De La Salle University, speaks on the subject of digital public relations at a wide variety of industry conferences, and writes on the subject.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to utilise both legitimacy theory and <b>reputation</b> risk <b>management</b> theory to examine the impact of the Beijing Olympic Sponsorship Program on annual report social disclosures by local sponsors. Specially, this study attempts to test whether local sponsors increase annual report social disclosure in responses to their sponsorship participation and whether the increases can be explained by other companies operating in the same industry group. This study also compares and contrasts legitimacy theory with <b>reputation</b> risk <b>management</b> theory, and discusses the applicable power of legitimacy theory and <b>reputation</b> risk <b>management</b> theory in positive events/issues. The annual report disclosures are reviewed for both sponsors and non-sponsors in order to make before and after comparisons. Comparisons are also made between sponsors and non-sponsors in terms of their social disclosure and event-related disclosure. The results indicate that first, sponsors disclosed more social and event-related information in their annual reports after they participated in the sponsorship program, while this was not the case for non-sponsors; second, sponsors disclosed more event-related disclosure than non-sponsors but not for the overall social disclosure. This study also found that the event-related disclosure was significantly correlated with levels of sponsorship while the total amount of social disclosure was correlated with firm size. These results suggest that the annual report could be used as a self-presentational device for managers to protect and enhance corporate <b>reputation.</b> <b>Reputation</b> risk <b>management</b> theory does have the power in explaining certain amounts of social disclosure particularly in these positive issues, but only limited with these firms which gained reputation from the issue. These results do not challenge the dominance of legitimacy theory in corporate social disclosure area, but argues that <b>reputation</b> risk <b>management</b> theory could provide several useful insights and be used as a supplement of legitimacy theory...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis of Europe has realigned {{the notion of}} a nation's reputation (or its branding) in a prominent way. Using the case of Greece as an example, we interpret the Greek crisis from the fresh perspective of <b>reputation</b> risk <b>management.</b> From this perspective, we show that the Greek crisis, on one hand is deeper and more holistic than the pre-crisis dim macroeconomic outlook would suggest. From the other hand, we suggest that the crisis could have been avoided had <b>reputation</b> risk <b>management</b> been encapsulated as a mechanism for guiding Greece's decision-makers. We infer that, the lack of the equivalent of national-level <b>reputation</b> risk <b>management</b> techniques at the governance echelons is one of the root causes of the crisis and the key catalyst for the rapid escalation of what at first instance appeared to be bad nationwide public financial practices and policy making into a European and nearly global financial event. reputation risk; Greece; Europe; economic crises; nation branding; holistic crises; macroeconomics; decision-makers; EU; European Union; national-level reputations; governance echelons; root causes; key catalysts; nationwide practices; public practices; financial practices; policy making; decision sciences; risk management...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} are conducted in which MBA students make judgments about a company's future performance and <b>management's</b> <b>reputation</b> {{after the company}} reports poor financial results. Information about the CEO's pre-existing reputation is manipulated at three levels (favorable, unfavorable, or none) and the plausibility of management's explanation is manipulated at two levels (plausible or implausible). Generally, {{the results indicate that}} management's explanations influence investors' judgments of the company's future performance and that judgments about management were jointly influenced by both manipulated factors. Specifically, our results indicate that a pre-existing favorable <b>management</b> <b>reputation</b> is an enduring trait that is not damaged even when management offers an implausible explanation. Our results are consistent with Mercer (2004) but inconsistent with other research ([Janoff-Bulman, 1992] and [Meyerson et al., 1996]) suggesting that a good reputation is easily lost. Our results also indicate that offering a plausible explanation improves the reputation of managers with an unfavorable reputation. We also find that judgments about management's intentions for explaining poor performance represent a partial mediator for judgments about <b>management's</b> <b>reputation.</b> Finally, we provide evidence that judgments about the company's future performance and <b>management's</b> <b>reputation</b> are consequential in that they are associated with investors' equity judgments. ...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to review {{research}} on corporate <b>reputation</b> within <b>management</b> and business studies and to advance the scholarly understanding of the concept. The mere extent of research on <b>reputation</b> in <b>management</b> and business studies suggests that this concept has much resonance in the scholarly community. While available reviews take qualitative approaches with narrative methods, we applied bibliometric methods to arrive at a systematic review. This approach is especially useful when extensive bodies of literature challenge researchers to keep pace with an ever-increasing amount of publications. This is clearly the case with corporate reputation. With a focus on both past traditions and current trends, and supported by network visualizations, we extracted the several maps of research that offer orientation for both experienced scholars in and newcomers to the field. However, despite the higher objectivity and replicability as compared to qualitative reviews, bibliometric methods do not substitute for careful interpretations and evaluations of the findings.|$|R
