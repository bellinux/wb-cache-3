Most <b>red</b> <b>bananas</b> are much esteemed for good tasting fruit, {{and this one}} is no exception. This cultivar also has red pseudostems.

This <b>red</b> <b>banana's</b> skin turns sunset colors through the ripening process from yellow-green to orange then to red. The skin should be almost very dark red before it is ripe enough to eat.|$|R

40|$|Earthquake occurrences {{are often}} {{described}} using {{a class of}} branching models called Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) models. The name derives {{from the fact that}} the model allows earthquakes to cause aftershocks, and then those aftershocks may induce subsequent aftershocks, and so on. Despite their value in seismology, such models have not previously been used in studying the incidence of invasive plant and animal species. Here, we apply a modified version of the space-time ETAS model to study the spread of an invasive species <b>red</b> <b>banana</b> trees (Musa velutina) in a Costa Rican rainforest. One challenge in this ecological application is that fitting the model requires the originations of the plants, which are not observed but may be estimated using filed data on the heights of the plants on a given date and their empirical growth rates. The formulation of the triggering density function, which describes the way events cause future occurrences of events is based on plots of inter-event times and distances for the <b>red</b> <b>banana</b> plants. We characterize the estimated spatial-temporal rate of spread of <b>red</b> <b>banana</b> plants using a space-time ETAS model. We then assess the triggering density more carefully using a non-parametric stochastic declustering method based on Marsan and Lengline (2008). When the algorithm is applied to the <b>red</b> <b>banana</b> data, the results indicate similar temporal and spatial structure, compared to previous estimates, as well as triggering of offspring running primarily to the northwest and the southeast from each parent. Non-parametric results are also used to obtain estimates of the most likely targets where immigration of <b>red</b> <b>banana</b> plants may be occurring...|$|E

40|$|Background: Banana (Musa spp.) is an {{important}} staple food, economic crop, and nutritional fruit worldwide. Conventional breeding has been seriously hampered by their long generation time, polyploidy, and sterility of most cultivated varieties. Establishment of an efficient regeneration and transformation system for banana is critical to its genetic improvement and functional genomics. Results: In this study, a vigorous and repeatable transformation system for banana using direct organogenesis was developed. The greatest number of shoots per explant for all five Musa varieties was obtained using Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 8. 9  μM benzylaminopurine and 9. 1  μM thidiazuron. One immature male flower could regenerate 380 – 456, 310 – 372, 200 – 240, 130 – 156, and 100 – 130 well-developed shoots in only 240 – 270  d for Gongjiao, <b>Red</b> <b>banana,</b> Rose banana, Baxi, and Xinglongnaijiao, respectively. Longitudinal sections of buds were transformed through particle bombardment combined with Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using a promoterless β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene; the highest transformation efficiency was 9. 81 % in regenerated Gongjiao plantlets in an optimized selection medium. Transgenic plants were confirmed by a histochemical assay of GUS, polymerase chain reaction, and Southern blot. Conclusions: Our robust transformation platform successfully generated hundreds of transgenic plants. Such a platform will facilitate molecular breeding and functional genomics of banana...|$|E

40|$|In {{developmental}} neuropsychology, attentional {{and executive}} impairments are commonly reported following acquired neurological/developmental {{disorders such as}} Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), epilepsy, ADHD… Unfortunately, most of attentional tests used in child neuropsychology were originally developed for adults and are of limited interest for children (notably because of their lack of attractiveness or because they require some non-developed skills). From a cognitive perspective, it is therefore often difficult {{to interpret the results}} obtained with such tools in children. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop assessment tasks of attentional/executive functioning which are more attractive (by using colored/familiar stimuli) and more theoretically relevant for young children. The tasks are based on Posner’s attentional model, which includes selective and sustained attention, attentional shifting and cognitive inhibition. Eighty children aged from 5 to 11 with no developmental/neurological deficits were administered tasks assessing visual selective attention (selecting a specific character among distractors), sustained attention (crossing dinosaurs in 5 minutes), flexibility (shifting between name and colour of stimuli), and inhibition (naming the real colour of a <b>red</b> <b>banana</b> or a yellow strawberry). Results confirmed the interest of these tasks in the assessment of attentional functioning in children, thanks to both their limited duration of administration and the stimuli’s attractiveness. Furthermore, results showed that tasks are sensitive to attentional development from 5 to 11 years old (p <. 05). Finally, a preliminary study showed that some tasks can be particularly sensitive to attentional disorders in a clinical population of TBI children. Peer reviewe...|$|E
