50|$|The {{original}} Lady Washington, or more commonly, Washington, was a 90-ton brig. Her {{early history}} {{is still in}} question. As part of the Columbia Expedition, she left Boston Harbor on October 1, 1787. She sailed around Cape Horn and participated in the maritime fur trade with the coastal Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest and in tea and porcelain across the Pacific in China. She was the first American-flagged vessel to round Cape Horn. She was the first <b>recorded</b> <b>vessel</b> to make landfall on the Oregon coast near Tillamook, Oregon. John Meares claimed {{that she was the}} first non-native vessel to circumnavigate Vancouver Island.|$|E
50|$|The 1871 Census shows {{only half}} the number {{employed}} compared with 1861, by 1881 this had halved again. Six of Nicholl's ships sailed regularly between Holy Island and Dundee in the 1860s: Agnes, Belford, Isabella, Lancaster, Margaret Reid and Maria. They did not hold a monopoly, other vessels involved in the lime trade included Curlew, Mersey, Robert Hood and Superior. Curlew, William and Mersey all separately suffered an occupational hazard of carrying quicklime at sea - water {{came into contact with}} the cargo. The resulting reaction generated enough heat to set the vessels on fire. In the 1870s the number of ships plying the route declined and the work became seasonal. Agnes became the last <b>recorded</b> <b>vessel</b> carrying lime when she sailed for Dundee on 17 September 1883. Nicholl's vessels called in the following years, but none carried lime or coal.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{navigate}} safely and efficiently through a given landscape is relevant for any intelligent moving object. Examples range from robotic science and traffic analysis {{to the behavior}} within an ecosystem. Through this thesis, methods for finding traffic patterns and predicting future motion, have been constructed based on theory of optimal paths. The algorithms are applied to maritime traffic, in terms of <b>recorded</b> <b>vessel</b> coordinates. By considering {{the structure of a}} given traffic situation as a disordered energy landscape, one can define optimal routes within the area. An algorithm for finding hierarchies of optimal paths in a disordered energy landscape is implemented. The algorithms are used in two settings, one for detecting patterns of motion within a given area, and a method for estimating single vessel trajectories. The results found in the thesis, show that the methods have great potential for analyzing traffic patterns and predict future motion. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesRestenosis {{following}} remote superficial {{femoral artery}} endarterectomy (RSFAE) remains a challenging problem. The determinants predicting failure are lacking. This study investigated patient characteristics with predictive value for restenosis {{during the first}} year after RSFAE. DesignA prospective cohort study. Materials and methodsA total of 90 patients post-RSFAE were studied for the occurrence of restenosis (peak systolic velocity ratio ≥ 2. 5) in the first 12 months postoperatively. At baseline, clinical parameters were <b>recorded.</b> <b>Vessel</b> size was measured on the basis of plaque perimeter in the culprit lesion and lumen diameter on perioperative digital subtraction angiography. ResultsIn 57 patients (63 %), a restenotic lesion was diagnosed within 12 months following surgery. Patients with longer time interval between start of ischaemic walking complaints and RSFAE revealed a significantly higher incidence of restenosis (hazard ratio (HR)  =  1. 3 (1. 05 – 1. 52) per 4 years). Small plaque perimeter and small superficial femoral artery (SFA) diameter on angiography were significantly associated with restenosis (HR =  0. 54 (0. 34 – 0. 88) per 10  mm and HR =  0. 46 (0. 27 – 0. 78) per 1. 5  mm, respectively). In multivariate analysis, age, duration of ischaemic walking complaints and lumen diameter were independently associated with increased risk of restenosis after RSFAE. ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that age, vessel size and duration of ischaemic walking complaints before RSFAE are predictive values for restenosis after RSFAE...|$|E
40|$|Background Our {{goal was}} to provide {{measurements}} of the posterior cerebral circulation using non-invasive imaging and advanced software analysis tools. Methods 100 consecutive patients aged ≥ 40 years (50 men and 50 women) who had undergone CT angiography (CTA) but had no vascular abnormality were analyzed. Specific software was used to make vessel measurements along the center line. The length of the intracranial vertebral artery (VA), the basilar artery (BA) and {{the distance from the}} mid-basilar artery to the posterior cerebral artery (mBA-PCA) was <b>recorded.</b> <b>Vessel</b> diameter was measured at the proximal and distal ends of these vessel lengths. Vessel taper was calculated as the change in diameter in millimeters per centimeter of length. Results The mean lengths of the intracranial VA, the BA and the mBA-PCA were 40 ± 10. 6 mm, 27. 3 ± 5. 7 mm and 25. 6 ± 4. 3 mm, respectively. The proximal and distal diameters were 3. 9 ± 0. 8 mm and 2. 8 ± 0. 6 mm for the VA and 3. 6 ± 0. 6 mm and 3. 1 ± 0. 5 mm for the BA, respectively. The mean mid-BA diameter and the proximal PCA diameter were 3. 2 ± 0. 5 mm and 2. 2 ± 0. 4 mm, respectively. There was a significant increase in arterial caliber in patients aged ≥ 60 years compared with those aged 40 – 59 years. Men also tended to have longer vessels with a larger diameter than women. Conclusions Advanced software and non-invasive imaging can be used to perform accurate vessel analysis. The posterior circulation measurements showed an increase in arterial caliber with age. This baseline information may be useful in planning neurovascular procedures and endovascular device development...|$|E

40|$|Many {{fisheries}} worldwide {{have adopted}} vessel monitoring systems (VMS) for compliance purposes. An {{added benefit of}} these systems is that they collect {{a large amount of}} data on vessel locations at very fine spatial and temporal scales. This data can provide a wealth of information for stock assessment, research, and management. However, since most VMS implementations <b>record</b> <b>vessel</b> location at set time intervals with no regard to vessel activity, some methodology is required to determine which data records correspond to fishing activity. This paper describes a probabilistic approach, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), to determine vessel activity. A HMM provides a natural framework for the problem and, by definition, models the intrinsic temporal correlation of the data. The paper describes the general approach that was developed and presents an example of this approach applied to the Queensland trawl fishery off the coast of eastern Australia. Finally, a simulation experiment is presented that compares the misallocation rates of the HMM approach with other approaches...|$|R

40|$|Reduction of {{underwater}} noise emitted from ships is considered important for preserving and protecting marine mammals and {{for increasing the}} precision of ultrasonic instruments. However quantitative reports on {{underwater noise}} emitted by ships are scarce. In the present study, the characteristics of underwater noise emitted from the Nagasaki Maru were surveyed. The effects of ship speed and propagation distance on the pressure and frequency of the detected noise were assessed. Ship noise was recorded by a small stationary vessel equipped with digital hydrophone. The Nagasaki Maru sailed at 3 kt, 7 kt and 10 kt in a circle, at a constant distance from the <b>recording</b> <b>vessel.</b> The measured sound pressure level generated by the Nagasaki Maru was slightly higher than the desirable level, but {{similar to that of}} other newly built research ships. Sound pressure increased logarithmically with decreasing distance from the ship. Peak sound pressure was detected at approximately 300 Hz at 3 kt, 7 kt and 10 kt; however, the 500 – 600 Hz band also showed stronger sound pressure at 7 kt and 10 kt...|$|R
