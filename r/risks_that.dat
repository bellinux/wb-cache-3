5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> {{can have a}} global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. <b>Risks</b> <b>that</b> humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There {{may also be the}} possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, UBS {{expanded}} its global compliance database to include information on {{environmental and social}} issues provided by RepRisk, a global research firm specialized in environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) risk analytics and metrics. This was done {{in an effort to}} mitigate environmental and social <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> could impact the bank's reputation or financial performance and to simultaneously help globally standardize and systematically implement the firm's due diligence processes. RepRisk data is used in the on-boarding process to screen potential new clients and sourcing partners, alongside periodic client reviews and, also, to evaluate the risks related to transactions in investment banking and institutional lending.|$|E

The loss of United Airlines Flight 736part of a series of 1950s mid-air collisions in American skies, including the well publicized 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collisionhelped usher in widespread improvements in air traffic control within the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, Hammond {{increased}} his first-class wicket total to 47, and scored 1,781 runs {{at an average}} of 42.40. Although he remained a key batsman for Gloucestershire, both his aggregate and average fell, at least partly due to wet weather that often led to difficult batting conditions. In the three Tests against New Zealand, their first in England, he made an attacking century in the second Test, England's only victory. He did not pass fifty {{in the rest of the}} series, ending the victorious campaign with 169 runs {{at an average of}} 56.33. In 1932, Hammond was appointed vice-captain of Gloucestershire, but it was noted in Wisden that he sometimes failed to inspire his team. Hammond himself felt unable, as a new captain, to take the same <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> Lyon had done. He scored 2,528 runs (average 56.17), including his then highest score of 264, and his first hundred for the Players against the Gentlemen. He also took 53 wickets.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the use of anticoagulation to suppress blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, {{there had been a}} concern that small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further as a result of treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. Clinical practice guidelines now recommend heparin or low molecular weight heparin in the initial treatment, followed by warfarin, provided there are no other bleeding <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> would make these treatments unsuitable. Some experts discourage the use of anticoagulation if there is extensive hemorrhage; in that case, they recommend repeating the imaging after 7–10days. If the hemorrhage has decreased in size, anticoagulants are started, while no anticoagulants are given if there is no reduction.|$|E

5000|$|A risk {{limiting}} post-election audit is one {{of several}} types of election audits. It is based on statistical principles, and is designed to limit the <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> election results are incorrect.

25|$|A later study {{questioned}} {{the attitudes of}} adolescents. When asked about abstinence, many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation with trying to maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, the <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> may come from having sex were {{not as bad as}} the social <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> could come from remaining abstinent.|$|E

30|$|The {{collaboration}} agreement contract shows partners’ congruence for actions (if required) {{for dealing with}} pre-identified collaboration risks, which may be categorized as belonging to the four types of capital. These risks are: (1) financial capital risks, including the <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> no major customers will use the results, the market environment or the end-user views may change and make the results obsolete, and a competing solution will emerge and make the results less valuable; (2) human capital risks, including the <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> a key person with {{a specific type of}} expertise leaves the project; (3) social capital risks, including the <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> a partner is underperforming, a key partner is leaving the project, or the partners cannot agree due to conflicting interests; and (4) innovative capital risks, including the <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> key technologies or components are not available at the expected time and that key milestones or critical deliverables are delayed.|$|R
50|$|From another perspective, {{the farmer}} and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the futures contract: the farmer reduces the <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> {{the price of}} wheat will fall below the price {{specified}} in the contract and acquires the <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract (thereby losing additional income {{that he could have}} earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires the <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces the <b>risk</b> <b>that</b> the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is the insurer (risk taker) for one type of risk, and the counter-party is the insurer (risk taker) for another type of risk.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to assessing the market-related <b>risks</b> <b>that</b> {{may arise from}} an investment, investors commonly employ operational due diligence to assess the risk that error or fraud at a hedge fund might result in loss to the investor.
