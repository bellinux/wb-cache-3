We use survey data collected from 71 software development groups to empirically develop a set of six dimensions that describe the practices employed in <b>reuse</b> programs. The study investigates the patterns in which these practices co-occur in the real world, demonstrating that the dimensions cluster into five distinct <b>reuse</b> strategies, each with a different potential for <b>reuse</b> success. The findings provide a means to classify <b>reuse</b> settings and assess their potential for success.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the performance limits of data value <b>reuse.</b> Two types of data value <b>reuse</b> are considered: instruction-level <b>reuse</b> and trace-level <b>reuse.</b> The former <b>reuses</b> instances of single instructions whereas the latter <b>reuses</b> sequences of instructions as an atomic unit. Two different scenarios are considered: an infinite resource machine and a machine with a limited instruction window. The results show that <b>reuse</b> is abundant in the SPEC applications. Instructionlevel <b>reuse</b> may provide a significant speedup but it drops dramatically when the <b>reuse</b> latency is considered. Trace-level <b>reuse</b> has in general less potential for the unlimited window scenario but it is much more effective for the limited window configuration. This is because trace-level <b>reuse,</b> in addition to reduce the execution latency, increases the effective instruction window size, by avoiding the fetch and execution of sequences of instructions.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of assembly, a unit of reusable software.

40|$|Abstract. Software <b>reuse</b> {{has gained}} {{increasing}} attention by academic organizations and software development agencies. Existing researches on software pattern concentrate on constructing and representing patterns in unstructured way, so {{it is difficult to}} maintain and <b>reuse</b> them. This article puts forward pattern-oriented software development process that integrates modeling method based on architecture with software process for software <b>reuse.</b> Through the research on pattern oriented software development process, the reusability of software is enhanced. Instruction During the development of software, it is required to enhance the reusability of software, for reducing the cost of development and maintenance, shortening development time and improving software quality. However, from code <b>reuse</b> and function library <b>reuse</b> in "Copy-Paste " way to current object <b>reuse</b> and component <b>reuse,</b> all these <b>reuse</b> strategies have not lived up to expectations in development practice, where we find that bottom-to-top <b>reuse</b> method can not be used in component <b>reuse.</b> As for component integration, design <b>reuse</b> should be prior to component <b>reuse</b> and top-to-bottom method is suitable for component <b>reuse.</b> Software <b>reuse</b> includes not only software component itself but also the relationship between the components...|$|R

Findings suggest that social scientists' data <b>reuse</b> intentions are directly influenced by the subjective norm of data <b>reuse,</b> attitudes toward data <b>reuse,</b> and perceived effort involved in data <b>reuse.</b> Attitude toward data <b>reuse</b> mediated social scientists' intentions to <b>reuse</b> data, leading to the indirect influence of the perceived usefulness and perceived concern of data <b>reuse,</b> as well as the indirect influence of the subjective norm of data <b>reuse.</b> Finally, the availability of a data repository indirectly influenced social scientists' intentions to <b>reuse</b> data by reducing the perceived effort involved...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} {{potential of}} a value <b>reuse</b> mechanism depends on its <b>reuse</b> detection time, the number of <b>reuse</b> opportunities, {{and the amount of}} work saved by skipping each <b>reuse</b> unit.
