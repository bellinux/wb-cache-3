40|$|Tractor roll-overs are {{the leading}} cause of fatal farm accidents, {{accounting}} for more than one-fourth of all agriculturally related deaths. Most of these deaths could be prevented if the tractors were equipped with <b>roll-over</b> <b>protective</b> structures (ROPS). This study estimates the number of tractors in New York without ROPS, projects their retirement, and then estimates the number of lives which would be saved if ROPS were retrofitted on old tractors. The basic costs associated with mandating ROPS are calculated from these estimates. The minimum economic cost of mandating ROPS is $ 511, 136 per life saved for the retrofits, and an additional $ 253, 254 per life saved for every $ 1 million spent annually on enforcement.

There were a total of 50 CROPS. demonstrators (25 in New York and 25 in Virginia), with 45 observers attending the New York CROPS demonstrations and 36 observers attending the Virginia CROPS demonstrations, for a total of 70 participants in New York and 61 in Virginia. The oldest retrofitted tractors were 77 to 62 years old, while the newest retrofitted tractors were 40 to 37 years old. The most frequently retrofitted tractor in the CROPS demonstration project was a Ford 3000 series tractor (n = 19; 38 %), followed by Ford 4000 (n = 11; 22 %), Massey Ferguson 135 (n = 11; 22 %), and Ford 8 N (n = 9; 18 %). A major issue of CROPS retrofitting was the rear wheel fenders. The effort involved in disassembling the fenders (removing the old bolts was often faster by cutting them with a torch), modifying the fender mounting brackets, and then reinstalling the fenders with the CROPS generally required the most time. In addition, various other semi-permanent equipment attachments, such as front-end loaders, required additional time and effort to fit with the CROPS. Demonstrators were asked to rank the reasons why they had not retrofitted their tractors with ROPS until they had enrolled in the CROPS demonstration program. ROPS "cost too much" was ranked as the primary reason for participants in both states (80 % for New York and 88 % for Virginia). The second highest ranked reasons were "ROPS wasn't available" for Virginia (80 %) and "hassle to find ROPS" for New York (69 %). The third highest ranked reasons were "not enough time to find ROPS" for New York (67 %) and "hassle to find ROPS" for Virginia (79 %). All demonstrators and observers indicated that they were glad to have participated in the CROPS project.

A spatial statistical analysis using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic was performed to identify county clusters at greatest risk for tractor overturns. A regression analysis was then performed to identify factors associated with tractor overturns. The spatial analysis revealed a cluster of higher than expected tractor overturns in four counties in northern Kentucky (RR =  2. 55) and 10 counties in eastern Kentucky (RR =  1. 97). Higher rates of tractor overturns were associated with steeper average percent slope of pasture land by county (p =  0. 0002) and a greater percent of total tractors with less than 40 horsepower by county (p< 0. 0001).

BackgroundWhile {{the significance}} of anthropometric information for product design is well recognized, designers continue to face challenges in selecting efficient anthropometric data processing methods and translating the acquired information into effective product designs. MethodsFor this study, 100 farm tractor operators, 3, 718 respirator users, 951 firefighters, and 816 civilian workers participated in four studies {{on the design of}} tractor <b>roll-over</b> <b>protective</b> structures (ROPS), respirator test panels, fire truck cabs, and fall-arrest harnesses, respectively. Their anthropometry and participant-equipment interfaces were evaluated. ResultsStudy 1 showed a need to extend the 90 -cm vertical clearance for tractor ROPS in the current industrial standards to 98. 3 to 101. 3 cm. Study 2 indicated that current respirator test panel would have excluded 10 % of the male firefighter population; a systematic adjustment to the boundaries of test panel cells was suggested. Study 3 provided 24 principal component analysis-based firefighter body models to facilitate fire truck cab design. Study 4 developed an improved gender-based fall-arrest harness sizing scheme to supplant the current unisex system. ConclusionsThis article presented four anthropometric approaches and a six-step design paradigm for ROPS, respirator test panel, fire truck cab, and fall-arrest harness applications, which demonstrated anthropometric theories and practices for defining protective equipment fit and sizing schemes. ApplicationsThe study provided a basis for equipment designers, standards writers, and industry manufacturers to advance anthropometric applications for product design and improve product efficacy.
