5|$|The Second Treaty of Paris in 1783 {{ended the}} American Revolution and {{established}} the United States of America. The treaty extended the new country's western boundary to the Mississippi River {{and within the}} first year after it was signed 50,000American settlers crossed the Appalachian Mountains. As it was difficult to return east across the mountains, the settlers began looking toward the Spanish colonies of Louisiana and Texas to find places to sell their crops. Spain closed the mouth of the Mississippi to foreigners from 1784 until 1795 despite Thomas Jefferson's 1790 threat to begin an Anglo-Spanish war over the matter. Americans risked arrest to come to Texas, many of them desiring to capture wild mustangs in West Texas and trade with the Indians. In 1791, Philip Nolan became the first Anglo-American known to pursue horse-trading in Texas, and he was arrested several times for being within Spain's borders. The Spanish feared that Nolan was a spy, and in 1801 they sent 150troops to capture Nolan and his party of 6men; Nolan was killed during the ensuing battle. By 1810, many Americans were trading guns and ammunition to the Texas Indians, especially the Comanche, in return for livestock. Although some chiefs refused to trade with them and reported their movements to Spanish authorities, other bands welcomed the newcomers. A drought made <b>rangeland</b> scarce and stopped the Comanche's herds from increasing. To meet the American demand for livestock, the Comanche turned to raiding the area around San Antonio.|$|E

Droughts in 1983–85, 1991–92, 1998–99 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.

40|$|Wooded <b>rangelands</b> are a vast {{grazing land}} {{resource}} globally, including shrublands, savannas and forested ranges. They generally provide forage year-round for small ruminants {{and they are}} vitally important for livestock production, especially goats. While the productivity of wooded <b>rangelands</b> is low to moderate, their importance to small ruminant production is considerable. In this paper, we begin by discussing some anti-quality characteristics (mechanical and chemical defences) of woody vegetation that reduce their forage value, deter foraging, and reduce performance and productivity of small ruminants. We then present examples of grazing studies that illustrate how small ruminants select their diets on wooded <b>rangelands.</b> We conclude by discussing why small ruminants select the diets they do within the evolutionary processes of plant–herbivore interactions. Finally, we discuss how this knowledge can be integrated into approaches for sustainable management of wooded <b>rangelands</b> for small ruminant production. Plant defences are abundant in wooded <b>rangelands</b> {{but they are not}} a complete barrier to small ruminants as they often use woody plants as part of their diets. Indeed plants with such defences may represent a significant forage resource enabling small ruminants to survive on wooded <b>rangelands</b> with a prolonged dry period when more preferred defenceless species are absent. Future research in plant–herbivore interactions should include investigating how plant biochemical diversity influences herbivore preference for various plant communities, and integrating this information to develop recommendations for managing wooded <b>rangelands...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{symposium}} held at Fort Hare University in July 1998.

Uncontrolled access to resources and the lack of services were identified as the main constraints on socio-economic development in the communal <b>rangelands,</b> and inadequate forage during the dry season was recognised as a general constraint on livestock production, irrespective of mean annual rainfall. Government policies must recognise these issues and the social and ecological heterogeneity of communal <b>rangelands</b> in South Africa. The conclusion with the most far-reaching implications, however, was that degradation has occurred in some, but not all, communal <b>rangelands</b> and is most likely to occur in arid areas.

25|$|The idea of {{holistic}} planned grazing {{began in}} the 1960s when Allan Savory, a wildlife biologist in his native Southern Rhodesia, set out to understand desertification. This {{can be seen in}} the context of the larger environmental movement. Heavily influenced by the work of André Voisin and the ineffectiveness of mainstream <b>rangeland</b> science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human impoverishment that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural herds of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds. Livestock could be substituted to provide important ecosystem services like nutrient cycling when mimicking those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers. But managers had found that while rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of the experiential with the experimental, as well as the social with the biophysical, to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of <b>rangeland</b> systems. None of these sources of knowledge could be understood except in the context of the whole. Holistic management was developed to meet that need.|$|E
25|$|While the BLM rates horses by {{animal unit}} (AUM) {{to eat the}} same amount of forage as a cow-calf pair, 1.0, {{multiple}} studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM. Modern <b>rangeland</b> management also recommends removing all livestock during the growing season to maximize recovery of the forage. Allowing livestock to graze year-round is not good for the range, and so mismanagement of feral herds can also degrade the range for the wildlife that shares the same area.|$|E
40|$|Defining <b>rangelands</b> as anthromes enabled Ellis and Ramankutty (2008) to {{conclude}} that {{more than three-quarters of}} Earth’s land is anthropogenic; without <b>rangelands,</b> this figure would have been less than half. They classified all lands grazed by domestic livestock as <b>rangelands,</b> provided that human population densities were low; similar areas without livestock were excluded and classified instead as ‘wildlands’. This paper examines the empirical basis and conceptual assumptions of defining and categorizing <b>rangelands</b> in this fashion. Empirically, we conclude that a large proportion of <b>rangelands,</b> although used to varying degrees by domesticated livestock, are not altered significantly by this use, especially in arid, highly variable environments and in settings with long evolutionary histories of herbivory by wild animals. Even where changes have occurred, the dynamics and components of many <b>rangelands</b> remain structurally and functionally equivalent to those that preceded domestic livestock grazing or would be found in its absence. In much of Africa and Asia, grazing is so longstanding as to be inextricable from ‘natural’ or reference conditions for those sites. Thus, the extent of anthropogenic biomes is significantly overstated. Conceptually, <b>rangelands</b> reveal the dependence of the anthromes thesis on outdated assumptions of ecological climax and equilibrium. Coming to terms with rangelands—how they can be classified, understood, and managed sustainably—thus offers important lessons for understanding anthromes and the Anthropocene as a whole. At the root of these lessons, we argue, is not the question of human impacts on ecosystems but property relations among humans...|$|R
