25|$|A <b>ruled</b> <b>surface</b> is {{a family}} of lines that is not {{necessarily}} linear. It corresponds to a curve on the Klein quadric. For example, a hyperboloid of one sheet is a quadric surface in P3 ruled by two different families of lines, one line of each passing through each point of the surface; each family corresponds under the Plücker map to a conic section within the Klein quadric in P5.|$|E

Out of this work came another of Wren's important mathematical results, namely that the hyperboloid of revolution is a <b>ruled</b> <b>surface.</b> These results were published in 1669. In subsequent years, Wren continued with his work with the Royal Society, although after the 1680s his scientific interests seem to have waned: no doubt his architectural and official duties absorbed more time.|$|E
