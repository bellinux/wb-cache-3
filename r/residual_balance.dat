The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the risk of falling associated with commonly accepted and stroke-specific factors in a home-dwelling stroke population. METHODS: This study included an analysis of prospective fall reports in 124 women with confirmed stroke over 1 year. Variables relating to physical and mental health, history of falls, stroke symptoms, self-reported difficulties in activities of daily living, and physical performance tests were collected during home assessments. RESULTS: Risk factors for falling commonly reported in the general population, including performance tests of balance, incontinence, previous falls, and sedative/hypnotic medications, did not predict falls in multivariate analyses. Frequent balance problems while dressing were the strongest risk factor for falls (odds ratio, 7. 0). <b>Residual</b> <b>balance,</b> dizziness, or spinning stroke symptoms were also a strong risk factor for falling (odds ratio, 5. 2). Residual motor symptoms were not associated with an increased risk of falling. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce the frequency of balance problems during complex tasks may play a significant role in reducing falls in stroke. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of falling in women with <b>residual</b> <b>balance,</b> dizziness, or spinning stroke symptoms and recognize that risk assessments developed for use in the general population may not be appropriate for stroke patients...|$|E

Linear stationary models that are {{equivalent to the}} nonlinear time-dependent model are used to analyze these responses. A model linearized around the climatological zonal state of the time dependent model and forced by anomalous surface temperatures {{does not provide a}} reasonable estimate for the anomalous reponses, which are considerably underestimated. Better responses are obtained when the anomalous stationary nonlinear eddy fluxes are included in a model linearized around the full climatology. However, this latter model is overly sensitive, and anomalous responses are a small <b>residual</b> <b>balance</b> to the forcing by the surface temperature anomalies and the anomalous transient eddy fluxes. To better understand these linear responses, an eigenanalysis of the climatological state is performed.

The plan foresaw the newer aircraft assuming {{the majority of the}} utility mission with the <b>residual</b> <b>balance</b> of UH- 1 helicopters assuming a supplementary role. Because of subsequent budgetary considerations, the decision was reached to stop purchasing replacement aircraft after the close of Fiscal Year 91.

Army planners now face the difficult task of reconfiguring the utility fleet with available assets to satisfy future service needs. Threat analysis now suggests that the most likely use of US military force resides in the low intensity conflict (LIC) theater. Recognizing that the UH- 60 was designed to prosecute mechanized war, the question of its application to LIC rests largely on speculation. Now, before irrevocable decisions are made to retire the majority of the UH- 1 fleet, the Army must determine which of the two aircraft will better serve our future needs.

40|$|Understanding salt {{dynamics}} {{is important}} to adequately model salt intrusion, baroclinic forcing, and sediment transport. In this paper, {{the importance of the}} residual salt transport due to tidal advection in well-mixed tidal estuaries is studied. The water motion is resolved in a consistent way with a width-averaged analytical model, coupled to an advectionâ€“diffusion equation describing the salt dynamics. The <b>residual</b> salt <b>balance</b> obtained from the coupled model shows that the seaward salt transport driven by river discharge is balanced by the landward salt transport due to tidal advection and horizontal diffusion. It is found that the tidal advection behaves as a diffusion process, and this contribution is named tidal advective diffusion. The horizontal diffusion parameterizes processes not explicitly resolved in the model and is called the prescribed diffusion. The tidal advective diffusion results from the correlation between the tidal velocity and salinity and can be explicitly calculated with the dominant semidiurnal water motion. The sensitivity analysis shows that tidal advective diffusivity increases with increasing bed roughness and decreasing vertical eddy viscosity. Furthermore, tidal advective diffusivity reaches its maximum for moderate water depth and moderate convergence length. The relative importance of tidal advective diffusion is investigated using the <b>residual</b> salt <b>balance,</b> with the prescribed diffusion coefficient obtained from the measured salinity field. The tidal advective diffusion dominates the residual salt transport in the Scheldt estuary, and other processes significantly contribute to the residual salt transport in the Delaware estuary and the Columbia estuary...|$|R
40|$|The inverse-square {{law is a}} {{hallmark}} of theories of gravity, impressively demonstrated from astronomical scales to sub-millimeter scales, yet {{we do not have}} a complete quantized theory of gravity applicable at the shortest distance scale. Problems within modern physics such as the hierarchy problem, the cosmological constant problem, and the strong CP problem in the Standard Model motivate a search for new physics. Theories such as large extra dimensions, â€˜fat gravitons,â€™ and the axion, proposed to solve these problems, can result in a deviation from the gravitational inverse-square law below 100 Î¼m and are thus testable in the laboratory. We have conducted a sub-millimeter test of the inverse-square law at 4. 2 K. To minimize Newtonian errors, the experiment employed a near-null source, a disk of large diameter-to-thickness ratio. Two test masses, also disk-shaped, were positioned on the two sides of the source mass at a nominal distance of 280 Î¼m. As the source was driven sinusoidally, the response of the test masses was sensed through a superconducting differential accelerometer. Any deviations from the inverse-square law would appear as a violation signal at the second harmonic of the source frequency, due to symmetry. We improved the design of the experiment significantly over an earlier version, by separating the source mass suspension from the detector housing and making the detector a true differential accelerometer. We identified the residual gas pressure as an error source, and developed ways to overcome the problem. During the experiment we further identified the two dominant sources of error - magnetic cross-talk and electrostatic coupling. Using cross-talk cancellation and <b>residual</b> <b>balance,</b> these were reduced to the level of the limiting random noise.

By <b>balancing</b> the <b>residual,</b> {{the accuracy of the}} local truncation error of the time-stepping method becomes independent from the accuracy by which the implicit equation is solved. In this way, the requirement of a small enough residual in an iterative solver is relieved in favor of overall computational efficiency.

For this to work, the traditional IMEX time-stepping algorithm needs to be changed. We call this new method the shortcut-IMEX (SIMEX).

Furthermore {{the quality and quantity of}} some crops products, such as grape, is improved under a controlled amount of water stress. The latter is related, on a side to actual evapotranspiration (ET) through water demand, on the other side to plant water content through leaf water potential. <b>Residual</b> energy <b>balance</b> approaches based on remote sensing allow to estimate the spatial distribution of daily actual ET at plant scale, representing an useful tool to detect its spatial variability across different cultivars and even within each parcel. Moreover, the connection between actual ET and leaf water potential is still not well assessed, especially under water stress conditions, even if farmers use leaf water potential to plan irrigation. However <b>residual</b> energy <b>balance</b> methods are based on the hypothesis that storage terms are negligible, at least during the remote sensor overpass. Indeed, energy balance approaches estimate daily actual ET from the instantaneous value at the overpass time using a daily integration method. The paper first verifies this latter assumption using field data acquired by a flux tower on a whole phenological period. Then, the actual ET values measured by eddy covariance tower were analyzed together with water potential measured using a Scholander chamber; the analysis highlights that, under water stress conditions, daily actual ET is inversely linearly related with water potential.

The separation of gas trading from transportation activities required new market rules and gas balancing. Thereby, the TSO's responsibilities are to maintain network pressures within acceptable bounds and to assure <b>residual</b> <b>balancing</b> whereas shippers must ensure adequate gas supplies. Each party involved in natural gas transport can contribute to maintaining the network in balance. If the pressure in the network grid fluctuates beyond certain bounds, each party is responsible for injecting/extracting gas into/out of the network to restore the pressure and keep the balance. The shippers' role is to balance the system if necessary and to ensure enough capacity booked for the natural gas transport. The booking capacity and the uncertainty in gas demand/supply due to alternative fuels, {{make it difficult for}} the shippers to deal with capacity booking management.

40|$|Urban water {{balances}} {{are generally}} unknown, {{yet they are}} necessary for assessing water availability in an urbanizing world and for understanding the effects of urbanization on the hydrologic cycle. We assess the spatial and temporal variability of water balances of 65 watersheds in the Baltimore, MD, metropolitan area during Water Years 2001 â€“ 2009. Each water balance term is quantified independently and includes both natural (precipitation, evapotranspiration, streamflow) and piped (sewer infiltration and inflow [I&I], lawn irrigation, water supply pipe leakage) watershed inflows and outflows. The analysis also compares Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment storage data with changes in storage calculated using the residual between watershed inflows and outflows. We find that when considering only natural water balance terms, the water <b>balance</b> <b>residual</b> (inflows minus outflows) in-creases with urbanization, {{largely as a result}} of the decrease in evapotranspiration as modeled by the land surface model Global Land Data Assimilation System/ Noah. During wet years, the difference between urban and rural natural water <b>balance</b> <b>residuals</b> narrows because of increased urban streamflow. Excess water of the natural water balance in urban areas is largely exported by I&I into wastewater collection pipes; for some urban watersheds this excess is greater than gauged annual streamflow. I&I also outweighs piped inputs from lawn irrigation and water supply pipe leakage in the Baltimore area analysis. The net effect of piped flows on the urban water balance is a watershed export ranging between 300 and 465 mm/ yr, underscoring the importance of interactions between engineered water and wastewater infrastructure and natural water balance components...|$|R
