40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to treat the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> {{manpower}} resources as a multiphase process occuring within a more general process <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> social productive forces. The <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> manpower resources consists of three phases: 1) production of manpower resources being composed of: a) bioäogical <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> able-bodied population and b) its social preparation for work; 2) distaibution and redistribution of these resources among different sectors of human activity; 3) their utilization in production of goods and services as well as in process of forming the manpower. The structure of and factors acting in each phase are analysed in following parts of the paper in order to indicate the crucial problems <b>of</b> planning the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> manpower resources. Potential structural imbalances between manpower needs and supply which can emerge on the stage of national plan elaboration and ways to overcome them are considered. Special attention is paid to interdependencies between the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> manpower resources and the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> means of production.

40|$|Purpose: Digital kymography {{and vocal}} fold curve fitting are blended with {{detailed}} symmetry analysis <b>of</b> <b>kymograms</b> {{to provide a}} comprehensive characterization of the vibratory properties of injured vocal folds. Method: Vocal fold vibration of 12 excised canine larynges was recorded under uninjured, unilaterally injured, and bilaterally injured conditions. Kymograms were created at 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of the vocal fold length, and vibratory parameters were compared quantitatively among conditions and were studied with respect to right-left and anterior-posterior symmetries. Results: Anterior-posterior amplitude asymmetry {{was found in the}} bilateral condition. The unilateral condition showed significant right-left amplitude asymmetry, and it showed the lowest right-left phase symmetry among the conditions. In condition comparisons, vertical phase difference did not show significant differences among conditions, whereas amplitudes were significantly different among conditions at all line scan positions and most vocal fold lips. Significant differences in frequency were found among the conditions at all 4 vocal fold lips, with the bilateral condition exhibiting the greatest frequency. Conclusion: Digital kymography and curve fitting provide detailed information about the vibratory behavior of injured vocal folds. Awareness of vibratory properties associated with vocal fold injury may aid in diagnosis, and the quantitative abilities of digital kymography may allow for objective treatment selection...|$|R
