In order {{to cope with}} these various threats these organisations need to monitor, evaluate, select, adapt and implement new technologies, training methods and means of organisation. To {{be able to do}} this, an effective innovation management strategy is of major importance. The INNOSEC project (INNOvation Management Models for <b>SECurity</b> <b>Organisations)</b> supports this effort by developing and helping to deploy an innovation management system adapted to European <b>security</b> <b>organisations.</b> This article describes the methodology, results and first version of the InnoSec model of innovation management.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the lead <b>security</b> <b>organisations</b> (NATO, EU, OSCE and UN) react to {{specific}} types of security threat, contribute to a range of security governance functions, coordinate their activities within the system of European security governance, and collectively contribute to purposive security governance. It seeks to explore the strengths and weaknesses of these four <b>security</b> <b>organisations</b> in carrying out security functions, such as conflict prevention, peace-enforcement, peace-keeping and peace building. A further aim will be to examine the areas where coordination between <b>security</b> <b>organisations</b> has either failed or taken place, and investigate the factors which either promote or inhibit cooperation among the <b>security</b> <b>organisations.</b> The article suggests that the concept of security governance, although complex in its application, offers certain advantages for the study of security that are not evident in other international relations approaches; significantly the ability to identify security threats more clearly, and to assess more effectively how security threats are managed in a multi-level and multi-actor setting...|$|R

50|$|Sovereign nations {{eager to}} {{maintain}} the status quo, willingly cooperate, accepting a degree of vulnerability and in some cases of minor nations, also accede to the interests of the chief contributing nations organising the collective security. Collective Security is achieved by setting up an international cooperative organisation, under the auspices of international law and this gives rise to a form of international collective governance, albeit limited in scope and effectiveness. The collective <b>security</b> <b>organisation</b> then becomes an arena for diplomacy, balance of power and exercise of soft power. The use of hard power by states, unless legitimised by the Collective <b>Security</b> <b>organisation,</b> is considered illegitimate, reprehensible and needing remediation of some kind. The collective <b>security</b> <b>organisation</b> not only gives cheaper security, but also may be the only practicable means of security for smaller nations against more powerful threatening neighbours without the need of joining the camp of the nations balancing their neighbours.|$|R
