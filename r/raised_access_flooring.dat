40|$|<b>Raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panels {{currently}} have a chipboard core and are encapsulated within {{thin layer of}} galvanised steel. Two key problems with these <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panels are that they are heavy because of the chipboard and expensive, {{as the cost of}} steel has increased significantly over the past few years. The consequence of the <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panel’s mass is that they are difficult to handle, they are expensive to transport and they add considerably to the load on a structures foundation. Glass fibre filled epoxy of floor panels were designed and optimised to achieve lighter weights without compromising their strength using Altair Hypermesh software. A material weight reduction of the glass fibre filled epoxy floor panel was achieved by optimised design of the panes using an evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method and the introduction of panel ribs. The lighter weight of new raised floors panel would {{have a significant impact on}} the loadings of buildings foundation and allow architects to reduce the carbon footprint of a building resulting in reduced construction costs.

40|$|There is {{a current}} trend towards ever more slender {{concrete}} floor structures, which is resulting in more frequent {{problems with their}} vibration serviceability. Predictive methods for vibration serviceability must consider not only the structures themselves, but also the non-structural elements which are attached to them, as these may {{have a significant effect}} on the dynamic characteristics of the floor structural system. As there has been very little past research in this area, this thesis describes an investigation into the effects of <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> on the vibration serviceability of long-span concrete floors. The development of a new modal testing facility based on electrodynamic shaker excitation, which was capable of producing high quality estimates of the modal properties of full-scale floor structures, is described. This was subsequently utilised to determine the modal properties of three full-scale floor structures, before and after the installation of various configurations of <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> The response of these structures to controlled pedestrian excitation was also measured. Realistic finite element models of all structures were developed and updated using the results from the experimental work. These were subsequently utilised for investigation of the experimentally measured effects of the <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> It was found that <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> had only minor effects on the modal properties of the long-span concrete floors. Reductions in natural frequencies due to the increased mass were, to some extent, offset by the slight increases in stiffness following the installation of the <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> Modal damping ratios increased for some modes of vibration, but these changes were rather unpredictable and hence they were too unreliable to be used in design. The response of the structures under controlled pedestrian excitation reduced following the installation of various configurations of <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> The reduction appeared to be greater for relatively deep <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (500 - 600 mm) than for relatively shallow <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (150 - 200 mm). Therefore, it is recommended that the effects of <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> may be included in vibration serviceability analyses by applying a reduction factor to predicted responses calculated by assuming a bare floor. The proposed reduction factors are 0. 9 for <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> where the finished floor height is less than 500 mm and 0. 8 for <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> where the finished floor height is 500 mm or greater...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} paper presents HVAC system commissioning activities, {{highlighting the}} most critical techniques and features to consider when commissioning the underfloor air distribution (UFAD) system. UFAD systems are non-standard and unique and therefore a special attention is needed to some issues and situations specific only for UFAD installations, e. g. coordination of the <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floor,</b> carpet and furnishings, temperature stratification etc. Some {{of the most important}} tests to be performed during commissioning of UFAD systems, are the air leakage, air stratification and thermal decay testing. In order to achieve successful operation of UFAD, the active participation of all involved parties, e. g. architects, interior designers, HVAC designers, contractors etc. is needed since {{the very beginning of the}} project. Commissioning of UFAD just requires a discipline, structured approach and commitment from all participants involved. The practical study involved assessment of expected UFAD performance at the Sparebank kvartalet office building complex in Trondheim, Norway. The underfloor plenum was not properly sealed, creating a significant risk of future energy waste. The openings in the <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> construction also lead to the dust and dirt accumulation in the plenum. This in its turn would not only impair indoor air quality, but could also lead to the malfunction of mechanical equipment installed in the plenum. Trying to seal the plenum after laying down the carpet was found to be difficult, costly and time consuming. Even though relatively good air distribution in the entire floor was achieved, some diffusers (automatically controlled) are located too close to the workstations and it will be probably needed to rearrange their layout in order to avoid draught complaints by occupants. The easier commissioning and better performance of UFAD in Sparebank Kvartalet could actually be achieved in a less time consuming and costly way if the commissioning would start early in the pre-design phase, with a well established commissioning plan. </p...|$|R

50|$|Unlike masking {{speakers}} above {{a suspended}} ceiling or under a <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floor,</b> the masking sound from face-down speakers travels directly {{down to a}} listener {{without the benefit of}} any intervening sound attenuating materials. Face-down speakers have been, for many years, typical for paging and music systems, but is now used more recently in some sound masking applications. Initially, the intention was to minimize the visibility of the speaker by having a ceiling-like tile act as a masking speaker. It was first introduced by Bertagni and later commercialized by the Armstrong Company. The picture on the upper right shows a plenum view of this masker. The lower side appears to be a standard fiberglass mineral tile. Because so many devices penetrate ceilings, this speaker's invisibility is appealing to architects. The technical difficulty in developing this product was in broadening the spread of the masking to overcome the lack of intervening material, but the masking spectrum can be adjusted to those typical of those recommended by consultants.. A more recent development was the introduction of a face-down masking speaker much smaller than those used for paging systems. The lower picture shows this masker. Because of small size this masker has a masking spectrum that is not in the range of spectra recommended by consultants. See the recommendations section below. These speakers are often called direct field speakers to distinguish them from the other arrays that radiate sound indirectly through intervening materials. Although the speaker locations in the previous sections are often preferred to increase sound diffusion and acceptability, there are situations where use of direct field speakers is advantageous. An alternative location for the small speakers is mounting on a wall.|$|R
40|$|During {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} {{amount of attention}} has been paid to air distribution systems that individually condition the immediate environments of office workers within their workstations. As with task/ambient lighting systems, the controls for the “task” components of these systems are partially or entirely decentralized and under the control of the occupants. Typically, the occupant has control over the speed and direction, and in some cases the temperature, of the incoming air supply. Variously called “task/ambient conditioning,” “localized thermal distribution,” and “personalized air conditioning” systems, these systems have been most commonly installed in open-plan office buildings in which they provide supply air and (in some cases) radiant heating directly into workstations. A large majority of these systems have included a <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> system through which underfloor air distribution is used to deliver conditioned air to the space through floor grills, or in conjunction with the workstation furniture and partitions. The purpose of this document is to present and discuss engineering and application guidelines and recommendations that encourage the intelligent design, installation, and operation of task/ambient conditioning (TAC) systems in commercial buildings. A well designed TAC system should take maximum advantage of the potential improvements in thermal comfort, ventilation performance, indoor air quality, and occupant satisfaction and productivity, while minimizing energy use and costs. The development of these guidelines is based on a compilation of available information, including (1) TAC system design experience described in the literature, (2) laboratory experiments on several TAC systems, (3) field studies of TAC systems installed and operated in buildings, (4) computer simulations of whole-building energy use with and without TAC systems, (5) a survey of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) engineers and manufacturers about TAC systems, and (6) the results of the Workshop on Task/Ambient Conditioning Systems in Commercial Buildings, May 4 - 5, 1995, held in San Francisco, California [Bauman 1995]. Since experience with TAC systems is still rather limited, the recommendations and guidelines contained in this guide represent our best estimates at this time of sound engineering judgment. As more information and experience becomes available, we expect to periodically revise and improve this document. The guide is intended for use by design engineers, architects, building owners, facility managers, equipment manufacturers and installers, utility engineers, researchers, and other users of TAC technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{growing demand}} to {{construct}} long, slender floors with minimum supports for aesthetic and economic reasons especially in modern building developments {{has resulted in}} increased floor slenderness leading to vibration problems. As a result, vibration serviceability has become the governing design criterion {{for many of these}} new civil engineering structures. It is known that long span, slender floors possess lower natural frequencies and reduced damping leading to vibration serviceability problems. As vibration serviceability becomes a major concern in the design of concrete floors, investigations of the beneficial effects of non-structural elements to the vibration serviceability of floors are becoming increasingly important. The vibration serviceability of long span, slender concrete floors may be improved through the installation of non-structural elements such as partition walls and <b>raised</b> <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> Little research exists into the quantification of the effects of various types of partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors that support them. There are no guidelines available to designers which take into account the effects of partitions in the design of concrete floors for vibration serviceability besides the different damping ratios that are recommended in different codes for bare floors as well as floors with half- or full-height partitions. Therefore a research project was initiated with the objectives of investigating the effects of non-structural partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors as well as proposing guidelines on how to account for partitions in the design of concrete floors for vibration serviceability. The research project consisted of modal testing on a prestressed pre-tensioned concrete floor slab. The excitation of the floor was generated by an electrodynamic shaker and instrumented impulse hammer. The electrodynamic shaker excitation was used mainly to extract the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the test floor. The instrumented impulse hammer excitation was used mainly for damping studies. Force-balanced QA 700 accelerometers with a sensitivity of 8 V/g mounted to base plates were used to measure the responses of the test floor. The Data Physics Signal Calc Mobilyser was used to acquire the data from the accelerometers. A personal computer was used to store, analyse and present the data. The curve fitting method in Vibrant Technologies ME'Scope was used to estimate the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the test floor. Modal 1. 20 by Brownjohn (2009) was used to estimate the damping ratios of the test floor. Modal 1. 20 uses the logarithmic decrement method to estimate damping. The tests investigated the effects of partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors...|$|R

40|$|The European {{standard}} EN ISO 140 - 12 : 2000 gives {{a methodology}} {{to measure the}} acoustic performance of <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> {{in terms of both}} airborne and impact sound insulation. <b>Access</b> <b>floors</b> are often used in office buildings and working environments as they create a hollow space below the floor surface for network cabling and electrical wiring: in this way they are useful from the functional (ease of inspection, repair and changing of system elements), the aesthetic (no exposed wires and elements) and acoustic point of view.

50|$|Many office {{buildings}} now use <b>access</b> <b>flooring</b> {{to create more}} flexible and sustainable spaces. When underfloor air is designed into a building {{from the start of}} the project, the building can be less expensive to build and less expensive to operate over the life of the building. Underfloor air requires less space per floor, thereby reducing the overall height of the building, which in turn reduces the cost of the building facade. The blowers and air handlers required for underfloor air are much smaller and require less energy, since hot air rises naturally through the space as it comes in contact with people and equipment that warm the air and it rises to the ceiling. Additionally, when buildings are designed to combine modular electrical, modular walls, and <b>access</b> <b>floor,</b> the space within the building can be reconfigured in a few hours, as compared to historical means of demolishing walls and drilling holes in the floor to route electrical and other services.

To understand why more businesses, need this type of flooring, it is essential that we take the time to first understand what is low profile flooring actually is. What Is Low Profile <b>Access</b> <b>Flooring</b> A low profile <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> is a floor that is designed to sit above the original concrete slab flooring installed in any home, business, or public building. The higher floor height creates a space between the floor people walk on and the concrete base. The extra space the flooring provides is used to house additional, but essential, construction and design elements. For example, businesses design and install a data cables and other wiring in this space to keep wires safely {{out of the way and}} organized. Additional electrical outlets can also be installed and <b>access</b> through this <b>flooring</b> and extension cords and additional power bars can be stowed below and kept out of the way, and out of sight, as well. Low profile <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> do just what the name says because it gives people complete access to an entire data wiring system without having to undergo any major construction while keeping everything safely hidden and out of view. The flooring is made up of panels that are raised by brackets. Bracket heights of the panels can be customized to suit the needs of a business, office, or home space. Different businesses prefer to use this type of flooring to suit different needs. For example, some businesses or public buildings such as schools and libraries only require this type of flooring for their data and server rooms. The flooring can be simply customized to suit this type of use. Why More Businesses Need Low Profile Floors Since low profile data floors allow people to hide clutter-creating elements such as wires, cables, pipes, and HVAC systems, installing this flooring will help businesses avoid accidents and save money on any possible repairs to the system being hidden. Wires and cables will no longer be strewn across staff walk way areas and unsightly air systems can be installed in the flooring rather than overhead, eliminating bulky HVAC systems and any wires hanging from the ceiling...|$|R
