50|$|Medetomidine {{can be used}} as an {{antifouling}} {{substance in}} marine paint. It is mainly effective against barnacles, but has also shown effect on other hard fouling like tube worms. When the barnacle cyprid larva encounters a surface containing medetomidine the molecule interacts with the octopamine receptor in the larva. This makes the larva legs start kicking and it cannot settle to the painted surface. When the larva swims away from the surface, the effect disappears (<b>reversible</b> <b>effect).</b> The larva regain its function and can settle somewhere else.|$|E
50|$|The crucial step {{in making}} in vitro storage of kidneys possible, was the {{demonstration}} by Fuhrman in 1943, of a <b>reversible</b> <b>effect</b> of hypothermia on the metabolic processes of isolated tissues. Prior to this, kidneys had been stored at normal body temperatures using blood or diluted blood perfusates, but no successful reimplantations had been made. Fuhrman showed that slices of rat kidney cortex and brain withstood cooling to 0.2 °C {{for one hour}} at which temperature their oxygen consumption was minimal. When the slices were rewarmed to 37 °C their oxygen consumption recovered to normal.|$|E

This may be a <b>reversible</b> <b>effect,</b> and some new treatment modalities may re-sensitize the tumor to standard therapy. For patients with relapsed disease, bortezomib is a recent addition to the therapeutic arsenal, especially as second line therapy, since 2005. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. Also, lenalidomide (Revlimid), a less toxic thalidomide analog, is showing promise for treating myeloma.

50|$|In {{one test}} {{involving}} Drosophila, a temperature-sensitive allele of shibire is overexpressed in neuronal subsets using the GAL4/UAS system. The shi gene {{is used for}} synaptic vesicle recycling, and {{a change in the}} temperature would cause an accelerated and <b>reversible</b> <b>effect</b> on the synaptic transmission of shi expressing neurons. When shi was tested to cholinergic neurons, the flies showed a quick response to the temperature and were paralyzed within two minutes at 30 degrees, which was reversible. When shi was expressed in photoreceptor cell, fly larva showed temporary temperature-dependent blindness. This experiment shows that shi can be expressed in specific neurons to cause temperature-dependent alterations in behaviours. This research will further be helpful in studying the neuronal subsets in the behaviour of intact animals due to the reversible and controlled manner it is performed in.|$|E
50|$|The Peltier {{effect is}} the {{presence}} of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors (1834). His great experimental discovery was the heating or cooling of the junctions in a heterogeneous circuit of metals according to the direction in which an electric current is made to pass round the circuit. This <b>reversible</b> <b>effect</b> is proportional directly to the strength of the current, not to its square, as is the irreversible generation of heat due to resistance {{in all parts of the}} circuit. It is found that, if a current pass from an external source through a circuit of two metals, it cools one junction and heats the other. It cools the junction if it be in the same direction as the thermoelectric current which would be caused by directly heating that junction. In other words, the passage of a current from an external source produces in the junctions of the circuit a distribution of temperature which leads to the weakening of the current by the superposition of a thermo-electric current running in the opposite direction.|$|E

40|$|To {{clarify the}} effects of {{humidity}} during heating on the physical properties of hydrothermally treated wood, Sitka spruce wood was heated in an autoclave at 120 °C and different heating humidity (HRH), and their equilibrium moisture content (EMC), specific dynamic Young’s modulus (E′/ρ), and mechanical loss tangent (tanδ) were measured at 25 °C and 60 % RH prior to and after the hydrothermal treatment. Higher values of HRH resulted in greater loss in weight (WL) because of the acceleration of thermal degradation {{in the presence of}} moisture. The time–humidity superposition was applicable to the changes in WL. The EMC was minimized by heating at intermediate HRH (60 %), but it recovered significantly after the wood was moistened at 100 % RH. This fact suggested that the reduction in hygroscopicity due to hydrothermal treatment included both reversible and irreversible effects. The <b>reversible</b> <b>effect</b> was not observed when the wood was heated at 92 % HRH or above. After the moistening, the EMC value of hydrothermally treated wood decreased monotonically with increasing HRH and WL. An irreversible chemical change such as decomposition of hemicelluloses was responsible for the irreversible effect, whereas the <b>reversible</b> <b>effect</b> may have resulted from the annealing of amorphous wood polymers. After hydrothermal treatment at 80 % HRH or lower, E′/ρ increased and tanδ decreased mainly because of the reduction in EMC. On the other hand, high-humidity heating (92 % HRH) resulted in significant decrease in E′/ρ and remarkable increase in tanδ probably because of the depolymerization of hemicelluloses. The color of wood was darkened by the hydrothermal treatment, and the CIELAB color parameters of hydrothermally treated wood were closely connected to the WL...|$|E
