5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, {{researchers found that}} mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. <b>Researchers</b> <b>had</b> one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E
5|$|In the 70s, AI {{was subject}} to critiques and {{financial}} setbacks. AI <b>researchers</b> <b>had</b> failed to appreciate {{the difficulty of the}} problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.|$|E

40|$|This <b>{{research}}er</b> <b>has</b> {{chosen to}} conduct research that followed the positivist paradigm with researching effects of attachment and interventions in regards to foster parent and foster child relationships. This <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> observed issues with attachment relationships in foster children from a foster parent’s perspective. The <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> observed the methods of interventions used by the foster family agency in order {{to assist with the}} foster parent and foster child relationship. This <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> followed a positivist paradigm and has tested the dependent variables of the foster child’s attachment and the interventions used within the agency to assist the foster parents. The independent variable measured is the foster parent in the foster family agency...|$|R
5|$|In 1998, a {{rotavirus}} vaccine was licensed {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and <b>researchers</b> <b>had</b> detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while <b>researchers</b> <b>had</b> previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the <b>researchers</b> <b>had</b> predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E

25|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>have</b> also {{reported}} abnormalities in the renal tract of affected patients. Hydronephrosis {{is a relatively}} common condition, and <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> theorized that this may lead to urinary tract infections. In addition, a number of patients have suffered from cystic dysplasia of the kidney.|$|R
50|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>have</b> {{attempted}} to eliminate excimer formation {{and enhance the}} efficiency of polyfluorenes by copolymerizing polyfluorene with anthracene and end-capping polyfluorenes with bulky groups which could sterically hinder excimer formation. Additionally, <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> tried adding large substituents at the nine position of the fluorene in order to inhibit excimer and aggregate formation. Furthermore, <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> tried to improve LEDs by synthesizing fluorene-triarylamine copolymers and other multilayer devices {{that are based on}} polyfluorenes that can be cross-linked. These have been found to have brighter fluorescence and reasonable efficiencies.|$|R
5|$|The Maudsley–Bethlem {{study also}} {{hypothesized}} that schizophrenia {{was caused by}} a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis. Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment and chance elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. Molecular-biological studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of psychopathology. The researchers also examined how schizoids, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics. The <b>researchers</b> <b>had</b> hypothesized that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene, one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The twin study did not confirm this.|$|E
5|$|The hull is {{constructed}} from a high-tensile micro-alloy steel, developed by Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB, and improved by BHP of Australia, which was lighter {{and easier to}} weld than the HY-80 or HY-100 nickel-alloy steel used in contemporary submarine construction projects, while providing better results in explosion bulge testing. The submarines are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar: Collins was retrofitted with the tiles after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction. These tiles were developed by the Australian DSTO: as the United States and United Kingdom would not share their information on the tiles used on their nuclear submarines, Australian <b>researchers</b> <b>had</b> to develop the tiles from scratch. The tiles were moulded {{in the shape of}} the hull, and are secured by a commercial adhesive normally used to fix cat's eyes to road surfaces: although British and American submarines are often seen with missing tiles, as of March 2007, none have been lost from a Collins-class boat.|$|E
5|$|Word that Lewis was {{developing}} his own {{solutions to the}} minimum range problem reached the AI team at St Athan some time in early 1940. Bowen was extremely upset. He had become used {{to the way the}} <b>researchers</b> <b>had</b> been put into an ill-advised attempt at production but now Rowe was directly removing them from the research effort as well. Tizard heard of the complaints and visited Dundee in an attempt to smooth them over, which evidently failed. On 29 March 1940 a memo from Watt's DCD office announced a reorganization of the Airborne Group. Gerald Touch would move to the RAE to help develop production, installation and maintenance procedures for the Mk. IV, several other members would disperse to RAF airfields to help train the ground and air crews directly on the units, {{while the rest of the}} team, including Lovell and Hodgkin, would re-join the main radar research teams in Dundee. Bowen was notably left out of the reorganization; his involvement in AI ended. In late July, Bowen was invited to join the Tizard Mission, which left for the US in August 1940.|$|E

25|$|The {{race for}} the commercially viable {{production}} of aluminium was won in 1886 by Paul Héroult and Charles M. Hall.

30|$|Perceived quality can {{be defined}} as consumers’ {{evaluation}} of products and services, which affects their attitudes toward product/brand and purchase intention (Pappu et al. 2005). <b>Researchers</b> <b>have</b> reported that higher perceived quality leads directly to higher brand attitude (Johnson et al. 2006; Monirul and Han 2012). Moreover, using the HOE model, <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> also highlighted the relationship between perceived quality (cognitive stage) and purchase intention (conative stage) mediated through consumers’ attitude and satisfaction (affective stage) (Bou-Llusar et al. 2001; Everard and Galletta 2006; Yuan and Jang 2008). Some <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> found indirect or direct effects of perceived quality on behavioral intention (Boulding et al. 1993; Sweeney et al. 1999; Zeithaml et al. 1996).
