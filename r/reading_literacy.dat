5|$|Japan {{is one of}} the top-performing OECD {{countries}} in <b>reading</b> <b>literacy,</b> maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. The Japanese populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's competitive high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy. Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.7%. In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.|$|E

In contrast, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand ranked in the bottom third countries participating in PISA 2012. The mean scores of mathematics, science, and <b>reading</b> <b>literacies</b> in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are relatively lower than the corresponding OECD average in PISA 2012. This revealed the challenges faced by these three countries to enhance students’ performance in mathematics, science, and <b>reading</b> <b>literacies.</b>|$|R

However, a couple of weeks later, the Portuguese Ministry of Education announced a 2010 report published by its office for educational evaluation GAVE (Gabinete de Avaliação do Ministério da Educação) which criticized the results of PISA 2009 report and claimed that the average Portuguese teenage student had profound handicaps in terms of expression, communication and logic, as well as a low performance when asked to solve problems.|$|E

25|$|Taiwan is {{well known}} for {{adhering}} to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education as a means to improve one's socioeconomic position in Taiwanese society. Heavy investment and a cultural value for education has catapulted the resource poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. Taiwan is one of the top-performing countries in <b>reading</b> <b>literacy,</b> maths and sciences. In 2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world's best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance. The strong scholastic and educational performance of Taiwanese students has prompted the nation to build a highly educated labour force that possesses a strong background in mathematics and science to cope with the current labor market demands of the 21st century.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of standardized testing is that {{the results can be}} empirically documented; therefore, the test scores can be shown to have a relative degree of validity and reliability, as well as results which are generalizable and replicable. This is often contrasted with grades on a school transcript, which are assigned by individual teachers. [...] It may be difficult to account for differences in educational culture across schools, difficulty of a given teacher's curriculum, differences in teaching style, and techniques and biases that affect grading. [...] This makes standardized tests useful for admissions purposes in higher education, where a school is trying to compare students from across the nation or across the world. Examples of such international benchmark tests include the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) and the Progress in International <b>Reading</b> <b>Literacy</b> Study (PIRLS). Performance on these exams have been speculated to change based on the way standards like the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) line up with top countries across the world.|$|E

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of literacy transforms the human brain. By reviewing studies of illiterate subjects, we propose specific hypotheses concerning the core brain systems whose previous function is partially reoriented or “recycled” when learning to <b>read.</b> <b>Literacy</b> acquisition improves early visual processing and reorganizes the ventral occipito-temporal pathway: a left region increases its response to written characters, while responses to faces shift towards the right hemisphere. Literacy also modifies phonological coding and strengthens the functional and anatomic link between phonemic and graphemic representations. Literacy acquisition therefore provides a remarkable {{example of how}} the brain reorganizes to accommodate a novel cultural skill. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
