25|$|Measles is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} infection caused by the measles virus. Initial signs and symptoms typically include fever, often greater than , cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Two or {{three days after the}} start of symptoms, small white spots may form inside the mouth, known as Koplik's spots. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads {{to the rest of the}} body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. Complications occur in about 30% and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia among others. Rubella (German measles) and <b>roseola</b> are different diseases.|$|E

Infections commonly associated with hyperpyrexia include <b>roseola,</b> measles and enteroviral infections. [...] Immediate aggressive cooling to less than [...] has been found to improve survival. Hyperpyrexia differs from hyperthermia in that in hyperpyrexia the body's temperature regulation mechanism sets the body temperature above the normal temperature, then generates heat to achieve this temperature, while in hyperthermia the body temperature rises above its set point due to an outside source.|$|E

50|$|Roseolovirus is a genus {{of viruses}} {{in the order}} Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the {{subfamily}} Betaherpesvirinae. Humans serve as natural hosts. There are currently three species in this genus including the type species Human herpesvirus 6A.

The base of the lip has a white color on the margins.|$|E
50|$|Betaherpesvirinae is a {{subfamily}} {{of viruses}} {{in the order}} Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae. Mammals serve as natural hosts. There are currently 18 species in this subfamily, divided among 4 genera.

5000|$|Gallo {{was awarded}} his second Lasker Award in 1986 for [...] "determining that the {{retrovirus}} {{now known as}} HIV-1 {{is the cause of}} Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)." [...] He is the only recipient of two Lasker Awards. In 1986, Gallo, Dharam Ablashi, and Syed Zaki Salahuddin discovered human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), later found to cause <b>Roseola</b> infantum, an infantile disease.|$|E
5000|$|Bdelloid rotifers are {{extraordinarily}} {{resistant to}} damage from ionizing radiation {{due to the}} same DNA-preserving adaptations used to survive dormancy. [...] These adaptations include an extremely efficient mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. [...] This repair mechanism was studied in two Bdelloidea species, Adineta vaga, and Philodina <b>roseola.</b> and appears to involve mitotic recombination between homologous DNA regions within each species.|$|E
50|$|Human {{herpesvirus}} 6 (HHV-6) {{is a set}} of two {{closely related}} herpes viruses known as HHV-6A and HHV-6B that infect nearly all human beings, typically before the age of two. The acquisition of HHV-6 in infancy is often symptomatic, resulting in childhood fever, diarrhea, and exanthem subitum rash (commonly known as <b>roseola).</b> Although rare, this initial infection can also cause febrile seizures, encephalitis or intractable seizures.|$|E
50|$|Studying pink-pored boletes from China, mycologists Yan Chun Li, Bang Feng, and Zhu L. Yang showed using {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{analysis that}} several species-some still undescribed-were {{part of a}} unique genetic lineage distinct from other Boletaceae genera. Two species were transferred from other genera—Zangia chlorinosma from Tylopilus, and the type species, Zangia <b>roseola,</b> previously considered Boletus or Tylopilus. Four species were described as new. The sister taxon to the genus is the truffle-like Royoungia.|$|E
5000|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV, HHV-5) [...] "seems {{to have a}} large {{impact on}} immune parameters in later life and may contribute to increased morbidity and eventual mortality." [...] Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) {{has been described as}} more neurovirulent, and as such is more frequently found in patients with neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Both human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), as well as other viruses, can cause a skin condition in infants known as exanthema subitum, <b>roseola</b> infantum (rose rash of infants) or the sixth disease.|$|E

5000|$|While rare, skin lesions {{may occur}} in the {{acquired}} form of the disease, including <b>roseola</b> and erythema multiforme-like eruptions, prurigo-like nodules, urticaria, and maculopapular lesions. Newborns may have punctate macules, ecchymoses, or [...] "blueberry muffin" [...] lesions.Diagnosis of cutaneous toxoplasmosis {{is based on the}} tachyzoite form of T. gondii being found in the epidermis. It is found in all levels of the epidermis, is about 6 μm by 2 μm and bow-shaped, with the nucleus being one-third of its size. It can be identified by electron microscopy or by Giemsa staining tissue where the cytoplasm shows blue, the nucleus red.|$|E
50|$|Measles is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} infection caused by the measles virus. Initial signs and symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 C, cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes.

Zaki Salahuddin and Gallo together discovered HHV-6; later found to cause <b>Roseola,</b> an infantile disease. He retired from NCI in 1992, but continued serving as an Adjunct Professor of Microbiology at Georgetown University School of Medicine. He co-edited three books on Human Herpesvirus 6 [...] and served as a consultant to various biomedical companies; as well as NASA, W.H.O. and the United Nations. In 1994 he became Senior Scientist and then Director of Herpesvirus Programs at Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc. and Coordinator of DNA virus studies in the laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Virology at the National Cancer Institute.|$|E
