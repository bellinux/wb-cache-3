The need to carry out structural analysis with non-destructive methods gave structural monitoring a widespread fame {{in the world of}} diagnosis and control of historical buildings. The aim {{of this study is to}} introduce a standardized approach for the analysis of the data acquired from a monitoring system of an historical building, through the definition of specific <b>reference</b> <b>quantities</b> (extrapolated from the recorded time series) able to characterize the main features of the structural response and the preliminary identification of the order of magnitudes of these quantities. It is assumed that the recorded time series may be decomposed into two fundamental components: the first one related with the natural actions and characterized, in absence of extreme events, by a substantial periodic behavior, the second one related to the other factors such as the evolution of the state of the structure due to material degradation, soil settlements and others. Exploiting the properties of periodic functions, one may identify these <b>reference</b> <b>quantities,</b> which are based on the year and the day variability and allow to monitor the evolution of the phenomena under observation.

This budget contraction effect stems from a reduction in variety under the contracting budget, not from variety expansion under the expanding budget.

The volumetric water {{content of the}} soil, Θ, {{was used as the}} <b>reference</b> <b>quantity</b> to parameterize the dependency of MT emissions on {{soil moisture}} and to characterize the severity of the drought. When Θ dropped from 0. 4 m 3 × m − 3 to ~ 0. 2 m 3 × m − 3 slight increases of de novo MT emissions were observed but with further progressing drought the emissions decreased to almost zero. In most cases the increases of MT emissions observed under conditions of mild drought were explainable by increases of leaf temperature due to lowered transpirational cooling. When Θ fell below certain thresholds, MT emissions decreased simultaneously with Θ and the relationship between Θ and MT emissions was approximately linear. The thresholds of Θ (0. 044 – 0. 19 m 3 × m − 3) were determined, as well as other parameters required to describe the soil moisture dependence of de novo MT emissions for application in the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature, MEGAN.

Temperature and Θ influenced the emissions largely independently from each other, and, in a similar manner, light intensity and Θ acted independently on de novo MT emissions.

40|$|The recent {{reform of}} the {{agricultural}} policy in the EU provides totally new frame conditions for farmers. Main components of the reform are the decoupling of direct payments and particular for dairy farmers the reduction of intervention prices for milk products such as butter and SMP. The objective of this analysis is to develop strategies for dairy farmers considering the initial situation of four typical farm sizes at different productivity levels, debt-to-equity ratios and risk attitudes. The uncertainty of the price development for milk itself {{as well as for}} milk quotas will be covered using Monte Carlo simulations. Due to decreasing intervention prices profitability of milk production is endangered in most dairy farms and the values of assets will decrease. For most low to medium efficient dairy farms it was found, that selling the cow herd and the <b>reference</b> <b>quantity</b> immediately would yield highest values for net worth. If the current favourable situation for selling the <b>reference</b> <b>quantity</b> is missed, continual production would be better. For the remaining dairy farms it is most important to uncover all resources to improve efficiency by reducing production costs and increasing milk yields. These farmers can wait with further investments until milk quota prices have settled on the expected lower level. Only high efficient dairy farmers, normally with higher milk yields and the advantage of econo-mies of scale can get profit from further milk production.

The comparison with thermal index paint experiments shows that with respect to regions with high thermal load a qualitatively good agreement of the conjugate results and the measurements can be found although the numerical models contain several simplifications for the internal cooling. In particu-lar, the tip region of the trailing edge is exposed to a high thermal load, which requires further improvement of the cooling arrange-ment. Altogether the achieved results demonstrate that the conjugate calculation technique is applicable for reasonable prediction of three-dimensional thermal load of complex cooling configurations for blades. Furthermore, the conjugate approach permits the calculation of the specific heat transfer rate distribu-tion on the blade surface without prescribing heat transfer boundary conditions.
