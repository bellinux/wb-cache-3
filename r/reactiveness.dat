Organic and often toxic materials (such as phenol) could remain in the underground chamber after gasification if the chamber is not decommissioned. Site decommissioning and rehabilitation are standard requirements in resources development approvals whether that be UCG, oil and gas, or mining, and decommissioning of UCG chambers is relatively straightforward. Phenol leachate {{is the most significant}} environmental hazard due to its high water solubility and high <b>reactiveness</b> to gasification. The US Dept of Energy's Lawrence Livermore Institute conducted an early UCG experiment at very shallow depth and without hydrostatic pressure at Hoe Creek, Wyoming. They did not decommission that site and testing showed contaminants (including the carcinogen benzene) in the chamber. The chamber was later flushed and the site successfully rehabilitated. Some research has shown that the persistence of minor quantities of these contaminants in groundwater is short-lived and that ground water recovers within two years. Even so, proper practice, supported by regulatory requirements, should be to flush and decommission each chamber and to rehabilitate UCG sites.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} component of maximizing height in a vertical jump is attributed {{to the use of}} counter-movements of the legs and arm swings prior to take off, as both of these actions have been shown to significantly increase the body’s center of mass rise. The counter-movement of the legs, a quick bend of the knees which lowers the center of mass prior to springing upwards, has been shown to improve jump height by 12% compared to jumping without the counter-movement. This is attributed to the stretch shortening cycle of the leg muscles enabling the muscles to create more contractile energy. Furthermore, jump height can be increased another 10% by executing arm swings during the take off phase of the jump compared to if no arm swings are utilized. This involves lowering the arms distally and posteriorly during the leg counter-movements, and powerfully thrusting the arms up and over the head as the leg extension phase begins. As the arms complete the swinging movement they pull up on the lower body causing the lower musculature to contract more rapidly, hence aiding in greater jump height.In order to maximize vertical jump height an athlete must be willing apply and develop the specific jump training principles of strength, power and <b>reactiveness.</b> Correctly prescribed and programmed vertical jump training protocols will optimize both the force producing and elastic properties of the musculotendinous system within the lower limbs.|$|E

40|$|Limiting energy {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the primary aims for most real-world deployments of wireless sensor networks. Unfortunately, attempts to optimize energy efficiency are often in conflict with the demand for network <b>reactiveness</b> to transmit urgent messages. In this article, we propose SWIFTNET: a reactive data acquisition scheme. It is built on the synergies arising from a combination of the data reduction methods and energy-efficient data compression schemes. Particularly, it combines compressed sensing, data prediction and adaptive sampling strategies. We show how this approach dramatically reduces the amount of unnecessary data transmission in the deployment for environmental monitoring and surveillance networks. SWIFTNET targets any monitoring applications that require high <b>reactiveness</b> with aggressive data collection and transmission. To test the performance of this method, we present a real-world testbed for a wildfire monitoring as a use-case. The results from our in-house deployment testbed of 15 nodes have proven to be favorable. On average, over 50 % communication reduction when compared with a default adaptive prediction method is achieved without any loss in accuracy. In addition, SWIFTNET is able to guarantee <b>reactiveness</b> by adjusting the sampling interval from 5 min up to 15 s in our application domain...|$|E

The increased vascular <b>reactiveness</b> has {{an important role in}} the development of cerebral vasospasm. This study analyzed the roles of the receptor-mediated signaling and the myofilament Ca 2 + sensitivity in the increased vascular <b>reactiveness</b> in SAH, using the basilar artery of a rabbit SAH model. Endothelin- 1, thrombin, and phenylephrine induced transient increases in [Ca 2 +]i, myosin light chain phosphorylation, and contraction in the controls. All these responses were not only enhanced but also became sustained in SAH. In the sequential stimulation of thrombin receptor or α 1 -adrenoceptor, the second response was substantially attenuated in the controls, whereas it was maintained in SAH. The thrombin-induced contraction in SAH irreversibly persisted even after terminating the thrombin stimulation. This contraction was completely reversed by trypsin and a Gαq inhibitor YM 254890, thus suggesting the sustained receptor activity during the sustained contraction. YM 254890 also inhibited the endothelin- 1 - and phenylephrine-induced sustained contraction. Furthermore, the GTPγS-induced transient contraction in the control α-toxin-permeabilized strips was converted to a sustained contraction in SAH. The results provide the first evidence that the feedback inactivation of the receptor activity and the myofilament Ca 2 + sensitivity was impaired in SAH, thus contributing to the increased vascular <b>reactiveness...</b>|$|E

Answering in a timely fashion, i. e., <b>reactiveness,</b> {{is one of the}} most important performance indicators for those applications. The Semantic Web community showed that RDF Stream Processing (RSP) is an adequate framework to develop this type of applications. However, RSP engines may lose their <b>reactiveness</b> due to the time necessary to access the background data when it is distributed over the Web. State-of-the-art RSP engines remain reactive using a local replica of the background data, but it progressively becomes stale if not updated to reflect the changes in the remote background data. For this reason, recently, the RSP community has investigated maintenance policies of the local replica that guarantee <b>reactiveness</b> while maximizing the freshness of the replica. Previous works simplified the problem with several assumptions. In this paper, we investigate how to remove some of those simplification assumptions. In particular, we target a class of queries for which multiple policies may be used simultaneously and we show that rank aggregation can be effectively used to fairly consider their alternative suggestions. We provide extensive empirical evidence that rank aggregation is key to move a step forward to the practical solution of this problem in the RSP context...|$|E

We then quantify the performance of the system by analyzing the effect of different demand signals on order and inventory variations. We find that firms with low <b>reactiveness</b> perform well in the presence of stationary demands but perform poorly when encountering finite demand shocks. Furthermore, we find that the ratio of the <b>reactiveness</b> of inventories and pipeline affects both the performance, and robustness of the system. When the inventory is more reactive than the pipeline the system can achieve increased performance at the cost of being sensitive to the parameters. When the pipeline is more reactive than inventories, on the other hand, the system is robust, but at the cost of sub-optimal performance...|$|E

In better words it is a spectrum being manifested through the reactive and proactive responses to real-life stimuli. Here the researchers wanted {{to draw attention to}} the idea that even in a reactive response of an identical autonomous learner, there exist some sort of proactive ingredients prevalent in the nature of the tasks at hand. No single task is purely performed in a reactive or purely proactive fashion in the domain of autonomy. In a nutshell, there is a reciprocal fashion in the series of actions moving between two ends of proactiveness and <b>reactiveness</b> along the autonomous tasks being fulfilled by the practitioners. Here {{the notion of}} learner autonomy is no more a unidirectional phenomenon, rather it is seen as a multidirectional forces acting upon individuals. This is in line with the justification explained by Dörnyei (2009) that language learning takes place beyond the motivations originated from internal or external generated selves, instead it is generated and reinforced by the successful engagement with the language learning process. In better words the proportion of <b>reactiveness</b> and proactiveness varies from two perspectives of “time” and “place”. What counts is the successful engagement with learning process.
