5000|$|A radio {{transmitter}} is an electronic circuit which transforms electric power from a battery or electrical mains into a radio frequency alternating current, which reverses direction millions to billions of times per second. The energy {{in such a}} rapidly <b>reversing</b> <b>current</b> can radiate off a conductor (the antenna) as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). The transmitter also impresses information such as an audio or video signal onto the radio frequency current to be carried by the radio waves. When they strike the antenna of a radio receiver, the waves excite similar (but less powerful) radio frequency currents in it. The radio receiver extracts {{the information from the}} received waves.

It {{has been shown that}} a sufficiently dense {{surface structure}} which permits free flow will be obtained if apparent density is higher than 2. 2 – 2. 3 g/cm 3. Such a surface structure can be obtained by <b>reversing</b> <b>current</b> electrodeposition of powder at considerably lower apparent densities of powder due to selective dissolution of subparticles during anodic time of <b>reversing</b> <b>current</b> wave.

40|$|The <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> {{tends to}} occur in the {{transition}} region of the guiding magnetic field in a magnetically insulated coaxial diode (MICD). Influence of the guiding magnetic field on characteristics of the MICD especially on the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is studied by the particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation in this paper. The <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is confirmed to be irrelevant with the guiding magnetic field strength. However, the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is clarified quantitatively to depend on the electric and magnetic field distribution in the upstream of the cathode tip. As the MICD has been widely employed in microwave tubes, a simple approach to suppress the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> on the premise of little change of the original diode is valuable and thus proposed.

40|$|An {{idealized}} {{steady state}} {{model of a}} stream of energetic electrons neutralized by a <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> in the pre-flare solar plasma was developed. These calculations indicate that, in some cases, a significant fraction of the beam energy may be dissipated by the <b>reverse</b> <b>current.</b> Joule heating by the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> is a more effective mechanism for heating the plasma than collisional losses from the energetic electrons because the Ohmic losses are caused by thermal electrons in the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> which have much shorter mean free paths than the energetic electrons. The heating due to <b>reverse</b> <b>currents</b> is calculated for two injected energetic electron fluxes. For the smaller injected flux, {{the temperature of the}} coronal plasma is raised by about a factor of two. The larger flux causes the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> drift velocity to exceed the critical velocity for the onset of ion cyclotron turbulence, producing anomalous resistivity and an order of magnitude increase in the temperature.

To {{determine}} the energy levels of intrinsic defects in high-purity semi-insulating 4 H-SiC, we apply discharge current transient spectroscopy (DCTS), a graphical peak analysis method {{based on the}} transient <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> of a Schottky barrier diode, because transient capacitance methods such as deep level transient spectroscopy and isothermal capacitance transient spectroscopy are feasible only in low-resistivity semiconductors. The <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> consists of the <b>reverse</b> <b>current</b> through the balk and the surface leakage current of the diode. It is elucidated that the sacrificial oxidation could dramatically reduce the surface currents of diodes {{in the case of}} high-purity semi-insulating 4 H-SiC, suggesting that the densities and emission rates of traps in the bulk of the SiC can be determined from the transient <b>reverse</b> <b>current...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{electrodeposition}} of chromium in programmed <b>reversing</b> <b>current</b> (RC), {{was investigated}} in the regime of high cathodic current density (77 A dm- 2) and anodic current density (55 A dm- 2). The ratio of the cathodic and anodic time (60 : 1) was used. Chromium was deposed on a steel substrate from a chromic-sulphuric acid solution, during one hour. Anode and cathode were suited {{in a system of}} parallel plates. Basic properties of deposits, like thickness, morphology, microhardness, brightness were examined. Surface distribution of the deposits was obtained from the measurements of the thicknesses of the deposits (between 32 and 67 µm). A ferromagnetic non-destructive method was used in the measurements. Based on the results, graphic models of deposit surface distribution were made. Two ranges of the thickness could be seen on the model (range 1 - average thickness 35. 1 µm and range 2 - average thickness 57. 81 µm). These results were statisticaly analysed by colums, rows and by the whole surface. For the whole specimens, the average thickness was 45. 39 µm with a coefficient of variation of 0. 2582. The basic properties of the deposits did not change with a variation of the thickness. Because of this, the coatings deposited with the <b>reversing</b> <b>current</b> could be much more considered reliable in wear and corrosion protection systems than ones deposited by direct current...|$|E

In this model, the undoped PCD is treated as a slightly doped p-type semiconductor due to the existence of the deep level defects of acceptor-states.

We use two complementary extensive bird surveys undertaken at the same localities in summer and winter and show that the area of stubble in winter attracts increased numbers of several bird species of conservation concern. Moreover, for several farmland specialists, the availability of stubble fields in winter positively influenced the 10 year breeding population trend (1994 – 2003) whereas hedgerow bird species were less affected.

Recent literature analyzes the costs of adjustment processes via treatment regressions and assesses the determinants of reversals via probit models. With larger data sets becoming available, steps to control for unobserved heterogeneity within the data are necessary. This paper contributes a Bayesian analysis, which allows a flexible and efficient handling of heterogeneity and serial correlation and compares the results to those obtained by (simulated) maximum like-lihood estimation. While consideration of serial correlation enables {{to account for the}} time series character of the data, random coefficients allow an efficient modeling of unobserved heterogene-ity across countries. The findings suggest that an efficient consideration of serial correlation and heterogeneity is necessary to assess the determinants and the costs of a reversal correctly. Furthermore, the paper illustrates the dependency of the results on the underlying reversal defi-nition and shows that the costs of a reversal in terms of economic growth are overestimated for some reversal definitions, when heterogeneity and serial correlation are neglected.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCost {{fluctuations}} {{render the}} outcome of any treatment switch uncertain, so that decision makers might {{have to wait for}} more information before optimally switching treatments, especially when the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained cannot be fully recovered later on. ObjectiveTo analyze the timing of treatment switch under cost uncertainty. MethodsA dynamic stochastic model for the optimal timing of a treatment switch is developed and applied to a problem in medical decision taking, i. e. to patients with unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). ResultsThe theoretical model suggests that cost uncertainty reduces expected net benefit. In addition, cost volatility discourages switching treatments. The stochastic model also illustrates that as technologies become less cost competitive, the cost uncertainty becomes more dominant. With limited substitutability, higher quality of technologies will increase the demand for those technologies disregarding the cost uncertainty. The results of the empirical application suggest that the first-line treatment may be the better choice when considering lifetime welfare. ConclusionsUnder uncertainty and irreversibility, low-risk patients must begin the second-line treatment as soon as possible, which is precisely when the second-line treatment is least valuable. As the costs of <b>reversing</b> <b>current</b> treatment impacts fall, it becomes more feasible to provide the option-preserving treatment to these low-risk individuals later on...|$|E

The general geometry of field <b>reversing</b> <b>current</b> sheets is discussed, and this geometry is examined for the cases studied, by using the ISEE 1 and 2 coorbiting satellite data sets. A new technique is employed which removes the effects of a variable sheet normal velocity for the first time.

Current density profiles derived with this technique show the main cross-tail current sheet to be a structure that is many thermal ion-gyroradii thick and which is sometimes imbedded in a region that is three or more times thicker and contains much smaller current densities.
