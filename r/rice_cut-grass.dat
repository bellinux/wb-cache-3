50|$|Blue-winged teal are surface feeders and {{prefer to}} feed on mud flats, in fields, or in shallow water where there is {{floating}} and shallowly submerged vegetation plus abundant small aquatic animal life. They mostly eat vegetative matter consisting of seeds or stems and leaves of sedge, grass, pondweed, smartweed (Polygonum spp.), duckweed (Lemna spp.), Widgeongrass, and muskgrass (Chara spp.). The seeds of plants that grow on mud flats, such as nutgrass (Cyperus spp.), smartweed, millet (Panicum spp.), and <b>Rice</b> <b>Cut-grass</b> (Leersia oryzoides), are avidly consumed by this duck. One-fourth of the food consumed by blue-winged teal is animal matter such as mollusks, crustaceans, and insects.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} varying {{concentrations}} of two chelators: EDTA, citric acid (CA), and phosphorus on {{the accumulation of}} arsenic in soil by two perennial grasses, Leersia oryzoides and (<b>rice</b> <b>cut-grass)</b> Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue). Each experiment was run for eight weeks, after which plants were harvested, oven-dried, digested in acid and analyzed using an ICP-OES. Phosphorus soil amendments were applied as 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 mg P/kg soil. For the first chelator experiment, CA and EDTA concentrations of 0, 2. 5, and 5. 0 mmol/kg soil were added in pulse form to the soil. In the second chelator experiment, concentrations of CA were added in 0, 2. 0, 4. 0 mmol/kg soil and EDTA was added as 0, 0. 25, 0. 50 mmol/kg soil. Both plant species accumulated enough arsenic in the root and shoot tissues to be considered at hyperaccumulator species. Citric acid produced comparable results with EDTA, and is considerable much safer for the environment than any synthetic chelator. Certain soil amendments (citric acid and phosphorus) and hyperaccumulator species {{used in this study}} warrant further research in the field...|$|E
