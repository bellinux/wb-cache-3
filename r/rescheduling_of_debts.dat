40|$|Valuing {{financial}} securities often {{assumes that the}} contractual obligations of the security {{are going to be}} honored. However, frequently a party to a contract will default on its obligations. Because the contractual features of defaultable securities are usually complex {{and it is difficult to}} find comparable securities for which to observe prices, valuation requires formal models that take into account the security's complexities and the uncertainties surrounding future cash flows. Many financial institutions hold large amounts of these securities in their portfolios, and it is important that these institutions have a reliable estimate of the resulting credit exposure. Understanding the strengths and drawbacks of various modeling approaches is also important for implementing prudent risk-management policies to manage credit exposures.; The author of this article reviews developments in valuation models for defaultable securities dating back to Merton (1974), concluding that although researchers have improved considerably on the basic Merton framework, problems remain. For example, many of the institutional features of bankruptcy and defaults, such as <b>rescheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts,</b> cannot be readily incorporated in the models discussed without making the models intractable. He points out the need for the next generation of valuation models to incorporate at least some institutional features and be able to use the historical probabilities of defaults and credit rating changes without making unnecessarily strong assumptions.

40|$|Cropping pattern {{refers to}} the {{percentage}} of acreage occupied by various crops within the crop rotation. It is determined through cultivated' area assigned to each crop according to the sequence system necessitated by crop rotation considerations. The optimum crop pattern is the one, which achieves the highest possible net return depending on input and output prices together with crop yields. It is a dynamic process as it changes from time to another based on farmers' needs and crops profitability in the previous year. It also may differ based on whether we are looking {{from the point of}} view individual farmer, trader, middleman, and exporter or {{from the point of view}} the society as a whole. Various crops are competing on the limited land within the agricultural season. So expanding the acreage of any crop would automatically entail contraction of another competitive crop, as total supply of land is almost fixed and limited. The major objective behind designing an indicative cropping pattern is the issue of food security. This issue is important both from strategic perspective, as well as in the context of poverty. While there is emerging consensus on the definition of food security as aiming to assure the country adequate access to food, both internally and externally generated, there is still reference to the need to grow certain strategic crops. Moreover, there is a desire to achieve a measure of stabilization in producer and consumer prices through the development of buffer stocks. There are various options available, each of which has costs and benefits related to them. One option would be a high level of risk aversion, which would entail a cropping pattern that centers on subsistence crops. Another option may pursue efficiency pricing and therefore would result in crops being growing in which the country has a comparative advantage. For example, self-sufficiency for wheat could be enhanced to 75 % in an efficient manner. Meanwhile the domestic production of rice and sugar cane may expand to a frontier that misallocates resources of water and land. The agricultural production is very susceptible to risks originated from natural, economic or social fosters that are difficult to predict or control. In Egypt, cropping pattern, is influenced by local economic variables to up prices, i. e., cropped area is determined by farmer response to changes in absolute or relative prices of the preceding season, in addition to profitability of crops of the last season, where farmer can not change supply of labor, the elapse of period of time curding to the nature of the crops being produced. Egypt's cropping pattern is also affected by international variables related to transactions with international markets for food products and to transactions with international markets for food products and to problem related to world production of biological fuel, world financial crisis, world food crisis, and rules imposed by the international trade system. As a result, there is a deficit in the Egyptian balance of trade for food commodities amounting to L. E. 8 milliards on average for the last few years. The upsurge in demand for agricultural crops like wheat, maize, soybeans, vegetable, oils, and sugar crops for the use in producing biological fuel has resulted in a drastic increase in prices of food, during 2005 - 2007 the average rate of price increase of food commodities has been estimated at 83 % which led to a high increase in import bill in developing -and poor countries among them Egypt which is a not food importer. For many reasons developing an increase in domestic agricultural production of strategic food crops, i. e., cereals legumes. Vegetable, oils, and sugar crops, is the best way to confront international variables, Either through vertical or horizontal expansion of those crops in addition to reducing the acreage of high water consuming scraps, which is the objective behind suggesting the cropping pattern in the short and long terms. Each of these objectives is direct by associated with the master end of ensuring food serenity. Indicative cropping pattern during last years varies considerably as compared to the actual cropping pattern experienced by farmers' decisions irrespective of the agricultural policy of the government Egypt. However, indicative or proposed cropping pattern could be put into action by introducing economic, institution and organization instruments. Those various instruments should be streamlined and harmonized together. Economic instruments advisable for execution of cropping pattern could include subsidizing production and inputs for strategic export and import crops that minimize consumption of irrigation water, introducing contractual agricultural production system, especially, in regard to cotton, sugar cane and sugar beet in addition to other industrial crops. It is advisable to establish agricultural stabilization funds to insure' farmers against various types of risks notably price risks. More over incentives either negative like taxes or positive like interest rate reduction, and <b>rescheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> could also be provided and operated. One major organizational instrument that has been successful recently introduced at a probation scale in three governorates is the national project for development of the field irrigation system in wade and delta. It is estimated that application of that project would save 15 % of water consumed for irrigation. The saved water could be used for ameliorating and reclaiming an estimated acreage of 3 million feddans. In addition it is suggested that elimination of camels and messages on the fields would save and area of 0. 5 million feddans to be put under cultivation. The study has estimated risk associated with Egyptian cropping pattern by application of linear and non-linear mathematical programming. Three models of minimization risk have been proposed and manipulated including: (1) Minimization Of Total Absolute Deviations: (MOTAD). (2) Risk Input-Output MOTAD. (3) Two Stage Stochastic Programming – (TSSP-RIO-MOTAD). In addition to the various scenarios cited above with their respective major objective functions, the models do comprise acreage, means of production in terms of cost of production, monthly year round irrigation water, and annual agricultural labor on monthly basis. Sensitivity analysis has been estimated for depicting the effect of changing prices of wheat and rice on cropping pattern disposition, by the application of TSSP-RIO-MOTAD model. Among the major results of these analyses are: 1 - An increment of gross margin to farmers at L. E 3. 8 milliard which deeps that suggested cropping has achieved the profit maximization goal which producers would aim at. 2 - A huge amount of irrigation water has been saved estimated at 2. 6 milliard cubic meters. A magnitude of water saved of this amount could be assigned for reclaiming new lands at about 0. 7 million feddans. 3 - Capital resources saved estimated at L. E. 985 million. 4 - Augmenting acreage under wheat to reach as much as 3 million feddans, which help contributing positives to the nation's food security goal. 5 - Reduction in rice acreage so as not to exceed one million feddan. Adding to the nations objectives of saving irrigation water to be used for reclamation of additional new lands. 6 - Augmenting acreage cultivated to Soya beans, sunflower, maize, and summer sorghum at 84. 9 %, 69. 5 %, 41 %, and 12. 3 % respectively, which, once again, contributes to the nation's objective related to enhancing food security. 7 - Augmenting areas under lentil, lupine, chickpeas, broad bean, and fenugreek by 111 %, 62. 2 %, 39. 5 %, 19. 8 %, and 8. 6 % respectively, which positively adds to food security objective. The proposed cropping pattern derived through sensitivity analysis and based on varying farm- prices for wheat and rice is heavily dependent on the effectiveness and synergy of mechanisms and instruments suggested for addressing and implementing of the indicative cropping pattern. Securing the accomplishment of maximization of farmer's profit margin are very major and essential objectives of the proposed cropping pattern. ...|$|E

40|$|After 1980 s, in most {{developing}} countries, {{the rate}} <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> accumulation and {{increase in debt}} servicing are highlighted as major factors affecting {{the growth rate of}} output. Most of these countries lost their competitiveness in the international market mainly as a result of insufficient exchange rate adjustments. In addition, the weakening of terms of trade, economic mismanagement and crisis of governance also lowered growth rates in the developing countries. The downward pressure was larger in the countries facing higher debt burden as these countries faced higher interest rates, decline in the external resource inflow, lower export earnings, lower domestic output and lower imports. In case of South Asian countries, the external debt scenario has changed over time. According to World Bank (2001) Pakistan’s ranking worsened to ‘severely-indebted low income country’ from ‘moderately-indebted low income country’ in 1997, where as India’s ranking improved to ‘less indebted low income’ country from ‘moderately indebted’ in 1997.

Better quality issues exhibit increasing credit spread curves. The numerical analysis with reasonable parameters yields credit spreads of a size compatible to market spreads. A comparison to corporate debt supports the stylized fact that, using the same parameters,corporate debt is less risky than sovereign debt since the threat of liquidation is stronger than the threat of litigation.

40|$|The role <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> {{forgiveness}} is to alleviate {{what is known}} as"debt overhang". This concept is the core idea of the Brady deals, and it now comes to the African debt crisis. How can one gauge the hypothesis <b>of</b> the <b>debt</b> overhang? To what extent can one attribute the growth slowdown of the 1990 s to the <b>debt</b> crisis <b>of</b> the 1980 s? Using data from the past decade, the author finds that debt variables {{play a significant role}} in that slowdown. In one exercise, he finds that more than half the growth slowdown of the large debtor countries in the 1980 s could be attributed to the debt crisis. To what reasonable debt ratio should African debt be written down? Most exercises set the threshold <b>of</b> sustainability <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> at about 200 percent. The easiest way to rationalize such a threshold is first to measure the average value of debt-to-export ratios reached at the time <b>of</b> the first <b>rescheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> in a given country. Using Latin America as a benchmark, one finds an average threshold of 248 percent. However short-sighted such a ratio might be, it goes a long way toward rationalizing the view that a debt-to-export ratio between 200 and 300 percent is a strong signal of a forthcoming crisis. This naive approach takes no account of the changing environment (growth and interest rates) a country must confront. A more subtle approach should allow for the prospect of a country's growth to assess the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>debt</b> it inherits. With the author's formula for so doing, Africa's debt-to-export ratio should be brought to 198 percent. Another way to assess the sustainability <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> is to look at the secondary market, which allows one to estimate the prospect of repayment expected by market participants. Few African debts are actually quoted on secondary markets, but the author presents a formula for reconstructing estimates of repayment prospects econometrically. By that method, Africa's debt-to-export ratio should be 210 percent, suggesting that a threshold between 200 and 250 percent is about right.

40|$|It {{has been}} evident {{for some time}} that Pakistan’s debt burden is {{extremely}} onerous. The danger <b>of</b> external <b>debt</b> default first emerged in 1996 {{towards the end of the}} second Benazir government. Following the nuclear explosions by first India and then Pakistan and the subsequent imposition of economic sanctions by the Western countries in mid- 1998, Pakistan froze the foreign currency deposits, a major source of balance of payments financing in recent years, and went into a technical default on external debt. Following a fresh agreement with the IMF in January 1999, Paris and London Clubs provided substantial debt relief in the form <b>of</b> <b>rescheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> payments due in 1998 - 99, 1999 - 2000 and the first half of 2000 - 1. Despite debt relief, the burden <b>of</b> external <b>debt</b> remains extremely heavy and the danger of default has not disappeared. In any case, the access to international financial markets has been greatly curtailed, if not eliminated, especially because The Paris Club has applied the ‘comparability of treatment’ to claims of private sector investors. On the domestic side, the heavy burden <b>of</b> servicing public <b>debt</b> has made the much needed fiscal adjustment both difficult and disorderly. The rise in interest payments from 2. 2 percent of GDP in 1979 - 80 to 4. 9 percent in 1988 - 89 and to the peak of 7. 3 percent in 1998 - 99 made reductions in fiscal deficit hard to achieve. As interest payments now account for over 45 percent of government revenues, the fiscal deficit reduction has come mainly at the cost of development spending. Clearly the debt overhang is a major factor in the decline in the investment rate to 15 percent of GDP in 1998 - 99 and 1999 - 2000, the lowest level in more than two decades. Unless the debt burden can be brought down to more manageable levels, macro-economic management will remain problematical and growth prospects will remain clouded. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{structured}} to research on a financial derivative asset {{known as a}} credit default swap (CDS). A CDS is a contract in which the buyer of protection makes a series of payments (often referred to as CDS spreads) to the protection seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if a default event occurs. A default event can be defined in several ways, including failure to pay, restructuring or <b>rescheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> credit event repudiation, moratorium and acceleration. The main motivation of my PhD thesis is to investigate the determinants of the changes of CDS spreads and to model the evolution of spreads. Two widely traded types are corporate and sovereign CDS contracts, the first has as its underlying asset a corporate bond and, hence, hedges against the default risk of a company; the second type hedges against the default risk of a sovereign country. The two contract types have different risk profiles; for example, {{it is known that}} liquidity premium with different maturity varies significantly for a corporate CDS but less so for a sovereign CDS because, in contrast with the corporate markets where a majority of the trading volume is concentrated on the 5 -year CDS, the sovereign market has a more uniform trading volume across maturities. In light of the difference, this thesis is divided into four parts. Part A introduces the motivation and research questions of this thesis, followed by literature review on debt valuation, with emphasis on default and liquidity spreads modelling. Part B aims at the role liquidity risk plays in explaining the changes in corporate CDS spreads. Part C models sovereign CDS spreads with macro and latent factors in a no-arbitrage framework.

The quantitative team of this Division belonged to the Trade and Projections Branch, which officers were commissioned since 1979 to help countries in debt difficulties to present their cases to the Paris Club. The reason for this was that the staffs of that branch maintained a set of econometric models for major developing countries around the world, and had the quantitative skills for calculating additional flows needed to close the balance of payment gap, either through new flows or/and through <b>rescheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> This team was composed by Kenneth Ruffing (United States) team leader; Enrique Cosío-Pascal (Mexico) in charge of Latin America; Valery Prokohrenkov (USSR) in charge of North Africa and Middle East; Sam Chan-Tung (Mauritius) in charge of Asia and Oceania; Kombo Moyana (Zimbabwe) in charge of Sub-Saharan Africa; and Jacques Baert (Belgium) statistical assistant of the Branch.

This article explores factors that explain {{the probability of a}} country requiring debt rescheduling in a panel framework. The current literature is extended by modelling a dynamic random effects panel probit, in order to identify a presence of state dependence after controlling for country heterogeneity. We find clear evidence of state dependence when a 2 -year lag of the dependent variable is allowed for, suggesting that overall, the fact that a country has experienced a rescheduling arrangement in the past does indeed make them more likely to experience further rescheduling. The article stresses that in order to draw the appropriate policy conclusions from this finding, one must understand that the debt rescheduling variable is itself a policy response variable. The fact that further rescheduling is often required within 2 years of a previous action suggests that rescheduling as it took place in the 1980 s and 1990 s was an inadequate response that often did little to help countries move beyond their current debt crisis. ...|$|R
500|$|Joseph entered Cabinet-level {{politics}} on 19 April 1984 when, following the ALP's general election victory, {{he was made}} a Minister without Portfolio. In 1991 he became Minister of Finance and Trade, and along with Financial Secretary Keith Hurst and Minister of Economic Development Rodney Williams negotiated the <b>rescheduling</b> <b>of</b> Antigua's national <b>debt</b> with European creditors. The government's 1992 budget, announced and drafted by Joseph, included no new taxes but did involve a cut to government spending, in response to what he claimed was reduced spending by tourists and smaller amounts of international aid in 1990 and 1991. The 1993 budget contained similar provisions, ruling {{out the possibility of}} an income tax, as suggested by one of Antigua's major trade unions. This was accompanied by a programme of fiscal reforms, including [...] "expenditure control, improved revenue collection, external debt management, proper evaluation of projects, improved public sector efficiency, price controls on basic foods and commodities, tax reform and good governance".|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} the first to {{investigate}} <b>rescheduling</b> <b>of</b> distressed corporate <b>debt</b> when both the representative shareholderand the creditor face reservation prices. Parties expect from rescheduling both recovery and growth, but reservationprices are key dimensions to consider in the analysis in order to assess the opportunity and to design the new financial set-up. For reservation price, the creditor may have in mind the liquidation value of the firm he can get by a strict enforcement of his contractual rights in court. The shareholder requires fromrescheduling the recognition of her risky, specific and important (financial and intangible) involvements in the future. To shed light on rescheduling with reservation prices, we develop first a general parsimonious distribution-free structural framework. We derive sufficient conditions for rescheduling to take place and highlight situationswhere no rescheduling can occur. We characterize cases where rescheduling is for the creditor possible but sub-optimal. So the shareholder's reservation price can dramatically restrict the set of possible extensions and it does matter for the creditor. We then restrict our setting to undertake numerical analysis, our benchmark being the canonical <b>rescheduling</b> model <b>of</b> Longstaff (1990). Here, we can explore with simulations feasibility and optimality ofrescheduling for different magnitudes of reservation prices and different firms' profiles. We finally investigate variousconcerns related to rescheduling such as agency costs, exit from no-rescheduling situations and bargaining betweenstakeholders. We also discuss different ways to lower the shareholder's reservation price...|$|R
40|$|Mozambique's {{performance}} {{under the}} authorities' program {{during the first}} three quarters of 2003 continued to be satisfactory. The discussions focused on the macroeconomic policies for 2004 – 06 and the government's plans to address pending structural reforms to broaden and sustain growth and further reduce poverty. Discussions on structural issues concentrated on the authorities' plans to remove a number of obstacles to private sector development. A strengthened monetary and exchange rate management will be essential in Mozambique, particularly in view of the high degree of dollarization.

50|$|The {{probability}} <b>of</b> <b>rescheduling</b> is {{an increasing}} function <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> service ratio, import ratio, variance of export revenue and domestic money supply growth. The likelihood <b>of</b> <b>rescheduling</b> is a decreasing function of investment ratio due to future economic productivity gains. Debt rescheduling likelihood can increase if the investment ratio rises as the foreign country could become less dependent on its external creditors and so be less concerned about receiving credit from these countries/investors.|$|R

5000|$|The snap {{parliamentary}} elections called {{because of political}} opposition in the Greek parliament to elect a new Greek president, threatened to endanger the recently gained Greek recovery, according to several international economic analysts. The rising political uncertainty also caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining financial aid to Greece under its bailout programme, while noting its support would only resume pending {{the formation of a}} new-elect government respecting the already negotiated conditions. Opinion polls ahead of the election provided the anti-bailout party Syriza - which announced it would not comply with the previously negotiated terms in the bailout agreement and demand a [...] "write down on most of the nominal value <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> so that it becomes sustainable" [...] - with a lead, causing adverse developments on financial markets, with the Athens Stock Exchange suffering an accumulated loss of roughly 30% since the start of December 2014, and the interest rate of the ten-year government bond rising from a low of 5.6% in September 2014 to 10.6% on 7 January 2015. According to the ECB Executive Board member from France, [...] "It is illegal and contrary to the treaty to <b>reschedule</b> a <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> a state held by a central bank", meaning such a thing would be incompatible with continued membership of the eurozone. However, the risk of a Greek withdrawal from the eurozone {{as a result of the}} upcoming elections were assessed by economists from Commerzbank only to be around 25%, assuming the election would end with the same result as measured by the opinion polls in early January.|$|R
