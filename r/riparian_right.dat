50|$|In {{determining}} {{the contours of}} riparian rights, {{there is a clear}} distinction between navigable (public) waters and non-navigable waters. The land below navigable waters is the property of state, and subject to all the public land laws and in most states public trust rights. Navigable waters are treated as public highways with any exclusive <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> ending at the ordinary high water mark. Like a road, any <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> is subordinate to the public's right to travel on the river, but any public right is subject to nuisance laws and the police power of the state. It is not an individual right or liberty interest. Because a finding of navigability establishes state versus federal property, navigability for purposes of riverbed title is a federal question determined under federal law; the states retain residual power to define navigability for the purposes of defining the public trust over water within their borders. A non-navigable stream is synonymous with private property, or jointly-owned property if it serves as a boundary.|$|E
50|$|The California Doctrine {{of water}} law, {{established}} in the California Supreme Court ruling over Lux v. Haggin attempted to blend the two doctrines by endorsing the <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> as {{the law of the}} land, but outlining the circumstances under which the appropriative right could be held as superior. Under Lux v. Haggin, all private lands as well as public lands upon transfer to private ownership held riparian rights, but first priority could be given to an appropriator if the appropriative right had been established before riparian rights.|$|E
50|$|While <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> are {{superior}} to appropriative rights and may survive dormant and unused, in 1979 the California Supreme Court found that the California State Water Resources Control Board {{has the power to}} assign unused <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> lower priority than existing prior appropriations.|$|R
50|$|Some {{water rights}} {{are based on}} land {{ownership}} or possession. For example, many common law jurisdictions recognize <b>riparian</b> <b>rights,</b> which are protected by property law. <b>Riparian</b> <b>rights</b> state that only {{the owner of the}} banks of the water source have a right to the 'undiminished, unaltered flow' of the water.|$|R
50|$|<b>Riparian</b> water <b>rights</b> (or simply <b>riparian</b> <b>rights)</b> is {{a system}} for allocating water among those who possess land along its path. It has its origins in English common law. <b>Riparian</b> water <b>rights</b> exist in many jurisdictions with a common law heritage, such as Canada, Australia, and states in the eastern United States.|$|R
5000|$|The {{only two}} dissenting Justices (Scalia and Alito) are both from New Jersey. Scalia {{wrote in his}} opinion, [...] "The New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905 (Compact or 1905 Compact), Art. VII, 34 Stat. 860, {{addressed}} the “exercise of riparian jurisdiction,” {{and the power to}} “make grants … of riparian … rights.” The particular <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> at issue here is the right of wharfing out. All are agreed that jurisdiction and power over that right were given to New Jersey on its side of the Delaware River." ...|$|E
5000|$|The appropriative right, on {{the other}} hand, was an ad hoc {{invention}} of miners in the Mother Lode region, adapted specifically {{to the realities of}} gold extraction. The organizing principle of [...] "first in time, first in right" [...] served miners whose gold claims could be miles or tens of miles from running water, while the organization of miners' courts provided a mechanism to settle disputes. Under the appropriative right, entitlement to water proceeded from its actual use, as opposed to the <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> in which water rights are retained regardless of use, and could be sold or transferred.|$|E
50|$|Adapted from English common law, the {{riparian}} water right dictated that landholders bordering on or encompassing streams had the reasonable {{use of the}} water that flowed over their property. This water right was well adapted to temperate climates with year-round rainfall, but proved ill-fitting for California's more arid climate. This standard brought riparian rights-holders into conflict in low-water years, creating issues of both priority and quantity which could only be settled in court. Furthermore the <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> allowed for the monopolization of water rights by buying all the land adjacent to a stream, creating a conflict between large landholders with the means to buy up stream-adjacent land, and those who needed water rights in order to run profitable farms.|$|E

25|$|Justice White {{concluded}} that {{nothing in the}} record showed that the United States intended to withdraw the <b>riparian</b> water <b>rights</b> of the landholders when it built Water Street and cut the landholders off from the Potomac River. White also engaged in a lengthy discussion of the laying out of the city's boundaries, and the conveyance of private property to the federal government. There could be no doubt, White argued, that the private landowners intended to give all of their <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> to the federal government, {{and there could be}} no doubt that the federal government intended to give all <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> to those to whom it sold the land. The majority's argument led to a tautology in which no <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> existed.|$|R
2500|$|Justice White also {{examined}} the conveyance {{of the federal}} government's land to the new private landowners in depth as well. In his discussion, White interpreted the [...] "incorrect" [...] maps as indicating the <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> to which the new private landowners were entitled (rather than a problem of inaccurate mapping). White concluded several times {{that the federal government}} fully intended to convey <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> to the new landowners because the government and its agents repeatedly indicated in letters, memoranda, contracts of sale, and other documents and statements its expectation that the waterside landowners were to build and maintain docks, wharves, and quays and improve the <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> they enjoyed. To assume otherwise, White concluded, was nonsensical. [...] Either the federal government intended to convey <b>riparian</b> <b>rights,</b> or the government deceptively contemplated building Water Street and cutting the new landowners off from their access. [...] "...the first hypothesis is the one naturally to be assumed." [...] "The contracts for the sale of water lots with <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> attached, the reports of the surveyors, and the action of the commissioners, all blend into a harmonious and perfect whole, working from an original conception to a successful consummation of a well-understood result. The contrary view produces discord and disarrangement..." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{second issue}} {{in this case was}} whether plaintiffs must exhaust their {{remedies}} before the Water Board prior to bringing action in court. The California Supreme Court determined that remedy can be pursued from the Water Board by challenging the unreasonable or unbeneficial use of appropriated water or by bringing an independent public trust claim. Therefore, the plaintiffs could claim that DWP’s use of the water was unreasonable. Plaintiffs also could bring the public trust claim pursuant to section 2501 of the Water Code, which said, “The board may determine, in the proceedings provided for in this chapter, all rights to water of a stream system whether based upon appropriation, <b>riparian</b> <b>right,</b> or other basis of right.” Section 2501 refers to water rights as bringing the proceedings before the Water Board.|$|E
40|$|Allocation {{planning}} {{is the process}} by which decisions are made as to who will get how much of what resource. It also implies that the resource is scarce and in need of management. The primary goal of allocative water resource planning, therefore, is to create a process by which water is managed so that its use is maximized by all consumers. Historically, water resource allocation in the United States has been through adjudication rather than by legislation. Prior appropriation, <b>riparian</b> <b>right,</b> or some combination of the two have formed the basis of water law in court decisions. Both allocation systems hinge on the concept that water rights are usufructuary [...] the water itself is used but never owned in substance (Goldfarb 1988 : 11). Instead, rights to use of the water are obtained. Riparian rights, more fully described in Chapter Two, are water rights given to abutters of watercourses. Prior appropriation is described as 2 ̆ 2 qui prior est in tempore, potoir est in jure 2 ̆ 2 or, more simply, first in time, first in right (Meyers and Tarlock 1971 : 77). Both systems are primarily concerned with stream flow as opposed to groundwater or diffused overland flow...|$|E

2500|$|The case clearly {{established}} that West Virginia's <b>riparian</b> water <b>rights</b> to the Potomac River {{are the same}} as Virginia's, as established in Morris v. United States. However, in New Jersey v. New York, 523 U.S. 767 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a state can acquiesce in the regulation of its water rights by another state and still maintain its sovereign authority over those rights only so long as it protests the regulation. In Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56 (2003), the Court dealt with {{a situation in which the}} state of Virginia sought to exercise its <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> over the Potomac River. Maryland statute and regulation did not permit this exercise of rights, and Virginia sued. The U.S. Supreme Court held that Virginia had maintained its sovereignty over its <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> by continuously protesting Maryland's assertion of jurisdiction. [...] This has led some legal observers to conclude that West Virginia, too, must begin protesting Maryland's assertion of regulatory jurisdiction in order for West Virginia to maintain sovereignty over its <b>riparian</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

Justice McKinstry affirmed Miller and Lux's <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> along Buena Vista Slough, stating that [...] "The owners of land by or through which a watercourse naturally and usually flows have a right of property in the waters of the stream." [...] Justice McKinstry also acknowledged public use of the water; appropriation by irrigation companies or irrigation districts, he conceded, was permitted with just compensation.|$|R
