40|$|Thesis (M. Ass. Eval.) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Education, 2005 Manutention is {{the skills}} {{training}} component {{of an integrated}} approach to manual handling risk reduction. Based {{of the work of}} Paul Dotte, Manutention training courses are delivered in Australia through the auspice of the Australian Association of Manutention Practitioners (AAMP). The assessment and reporting of training outcomes is hampered by the lack of industry standards for manual handling trainers. In part {{this is due to the}} lack of recognition of manual handling as a skill, although there is ample evidence in the literature to suggest that, as a psychomotor skill, it can be taught, learnt and with practice, levels of expertise can be achieved. Standards referencing is considered a form of criterion referencing where levels of performance are defined along a continuum of increasing competence. Using this, framework the Manutention competency was defined and descriptive standards were articulated for each level. The aspects of performance and associated quality indicators that contribute to the competency were written as scoring rubrics. This study used item response theory to investigate whether the Manutention competency could be empirically validated using a standards <b>referenced</b> <b>framework.</b> It also investigated whether the scoring rubric could be applied to inform judgements of competence at varying levels. The finding supported the use of a standards <b>referenced</b> <b>framework</b> as a best practice assessment model for AAMP and lent weight to the argument that manual handling is a skill.

Results: Four CSRF were developed for four domains of child safety: road, water and home safety, and intentional injury prevention. Conclusion: The CSRF can be used as a reference, assessment and comparative tool by child safety practitioners and policy makers working at the sub-national level. Peer reviewe...|$|R
