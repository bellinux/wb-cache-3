Guidelines for a successful filter design are given, and components for a 5 -kW rectifier prototype are selected. Furthermore, formulas for the estimation of the quasi-peak detector output based on the LISN output voltage spectrum are provided. The damping of filter resonances is optimized for a given attenuation in order to facilitate a higher stability margin for system control. Further-more, the dependence of the filter input and output impedances and the attenuation characteristic on the inner mains impedance are discussed.
