60|$|I had not meant, however, to expatiate {{upon his}} defects, which {{are of the}} slenderest and most venial kind. The Scarlet Letter has the beauty and harmony of all {{original}} and complete conceptions, and its weaker spots, whatever they are, are not of its essence; they are mere light flaws and inequalities of surface. One can often return to it; it supports familiarity and has the inexhaustible charm and mystery of great works of art. It is admirably written. Hawthorne afterwards polished his style to a still higher degree, but in his later productions--it is almost always the case in a writer's later productions--there is a touch of mannerism. In The Scarlet Letter {{there is a high}} degree of polish, {{and at the same time}} a charming freshness; his phrase is less conscious of itself. His biographer very justly calls attention to the fact that his style was excellent from the beginning; that he appeared to have passed through no phase of learning how to write, but was in possession of his means from the first of his handling a pen. His early tales, perhaps, were not of a character to subject his faculty of expression to a very severe test, but a man who had not Hawthorne's natural sense of language would certainly have contrived to write them less well. This natural sense of language--this turn for saying things lightly and yet touchingly, picturesquely yet simply, and for infusing a gently colloquial tone into matter of the most unfamiliar import, he had evidently cultivated with great assiduity. I have spoken of the anomalous character of his Note-Books--of his going to such pains often to make a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> which either were not worth remembering or could be easily remembered without its aid. But it helps us to understand the Note-Books if we regard them as a literary exercise. They were compositions, as school boys say, in which the subject was only the pretext, and the main point was to write a certain amount of excellent English. Hawthorne must at least have written a great many of these things for practice, and he must often have said to himself that it was better practice to write about trifles, because it was a greater tax upon one's skill to make them interesting. And his theory was just, for he has almost always made his trifles interesting. In his novels his art of saying things well is very positively tested, for here he treats of those matters among which it is very easy for a blundering writer to go wrong--the subtleties and mysteries of life, the moral and spiritual maze. In such a passage as one I have marked for quotation from The Scarlet Letter there is the stamp of the genius of style.|$|E

Andaya was accused of excessive force in the in-custody death in 1995 of Aaron Williams, an unarmed black man who fought {{on the street with}} several officers. There was community outrage about his death and pressure on the department to bring justice against Andaya, who witnesses saw kick Williams in the head. In the year after the incident, the press reported that Andaya had a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> of misconduct in the 1980s. The San Francisco Chronicle reported in addition that Andaya was named in 10 complaints between 1983 and 1993, eight of them allegedly for misuse of physical force, when he was a policeman with the Oakland Police Department. Investigation revealed more brutality complaints in Oakland and two lawsuists against him; the San Francisco Police Commission voted to fire Andaya in June 1997 for falsifying his application to the department.|$|E

It is primarily focuses on the causes and consequences of crime and the means to find ways to ontain it at levels consistent with life in society. A review of the constitutional unctions of the state-level federal and state repression of crime, of the main theories bout the definitions of crime, the origins of the phenomenon of delinquency and rime and the traditional methods of fighting it, relating them to the rates of events eported, starting with the thesis o "delinquent born" of Cesare Lombroso and assing by several authors to reach the economic theory of rational choice epresented by Gary Beker, who served as a base for the simplified model proposed y AndrÃ Loreiro and JosÃ Carvalho also described, along with other authors, the relationship between spending and investment in police equipment with the ccurrence of crimes. The homicide and serious physical injuries and thefts and robberies were selected among the other categories of crime because of its otentially harmful nature, being the first to emerge of people to mind when you mention the word "crime" and show a tendency to growth. The database was ubmitted to descriptive statistical analysis and study their correlation with linear egression analysis, being regarded as explanatory variables spending on Information Technology, Human Resources Training and dependent variables olicing and Homicide and the Serious bodily injury and theft or robbery. The model is found globally significant and the findings explain the relationship between ariables, despite {{the fact that there are}} also other factors not expected to contribute significantly to reducing the occurrences. In addition, there is a theoretical review of he capacity of economic activities, social and public infrastructure to prevent the entry of the individual in criminal activity, a brief account of the history of the police orces of the State of PiauÃ and its infrastructure.

Enfoca-se primeiramente as causas e as conseqÃÃncias da criminalidade e os meios de se encontrar formas de contÃ-la em nÃveis compatÃveis com a vida em sociedade.

Os homicÃdios e lesÃes corporais graves e furtos e roubos foram selecionadas dentre as demais categorias de crime devido Ã sua natureza potencialmente danosa, sendo as primeiras que surgem Ã mente das pessoas quando se menciona a palavra âcrimeâ e demonstram uma tendÃncia ao crescimento. A base de dados foi submetida Ã anÃlise estatÃstica descritiva e estudadas as suas correlaÃÃes atravÃs de anÃlises de regressÃo linear, sendo consideradas como variÃveis explicativas os gastos em Tecnologia da InformaÃÃo, FormaÃÃo de Recursos Humanos e Policiamento e como variÃveis dependentes os HomicÃdios e LesÃes Corporais Graves e Roubos e Furtos.
