40|$|We {{consider}} a random walk (<b>RW)</b> <b>driven</b> {{by a simple}} symmetric exclusion process (SSE). Rescaling the RW and the SSE {{in such a way}} that a joint hydrodynamic limit theorem holds we prove a joint path large deviation principle. The corresponding large deviation rate function can be split into two components, the rate function of the SSE and the one of the RW given the path of the SSE. Such components have different structures (Gaussian and Poissoinian, respectively) and to overcome this difficulty we make use of the theory of Orlicz spaces. In particular, the component of the rate function corresponding to the RW is explicit. Comment: 45 page...|$|R
40|$|Coherent, black-body-referenced {{measurements}} of submillimeter-wave sideband generator (SBG) output power are reported here. This SBG utilizes a submillimeter-wave laser, microwave synthesizer, and high frequency Schottky diode to produce tunable radiation. An output power 10. 5 <b>RW</b> at a <b>drive</b> frequency of 1. 6 THz has been obtained, and SBG radiation was efficiently {{separated from the}} laser driver with Si etalons. The power measurements were made using a dual CO 2 -Submillimeter-wave laser system and two Schottky diodes, one as the sideband generator and one as the coherent receiver. The SBG efficiency of four different models of University of Virginia (UVa) diodes were studied and the output mode of the sideband (without the unshifted laser present) was also easured. Finally, {{the design of a}} single-sideband submillimeter-wave receiver is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} and optimal {{control of a}} class of random walks (RWs) is investigated {{in the framework of}} the Chapman-Kolmogorov (CK) and Fokker-Planck (FP) equations. This class of <b>RWs</b> includes jumps <b>driven</b> by a compound Poisson process and are subject to different barriers. A control mechanism is investigated that is included in the CK stochastic transition matrix and the purpose of the control is to track a desired discrete probability density function and attain a desired terminal density configuration. Existence and characterization of optimal controls are discussed. The proposed approach allows the derivation of a new FP model that accommodates the presence of the jumps and guarantees conservation of total probability in the case of reflecting barriers, which are modelled by appropriate operators. Results of numerical experiments are presented that successfully validate the proposed control framework...|$|R
40|$|RW Aur is a {{multiple}} T Tauri system consisting of an early-K type primary (A) and a K 5 companion (B) at {{a separation of}} 1. 4 arcsec. <b>RW</b> Aur A <b>drives</b> a bipolar optical jet that is well-characterized optically. We present results of a sensitive Chandra observation whose primary objective was to search for evidence of soft extended X-ray emission along the jet, as has been seen for a few other nearby T Tauri stars. The binary is clearly resolved by Chandra and both stars are detected as X-ray sources. The X-ray spectra of both stars reveal evidence for cool and hot plasma. Suprisingly, the X-ray luminosity of the less-massive secondary is at least twice that of the primary and is variable. The disparity is attributed to the primary whose X-ray luminosity is {{at the low end}} of the range for classical T Tauri stars of similar mass based on established correlations. Deconvolved soft-band images show evidence for slight outward elongation of the source structure of RW Aur A along the blueshifted jet axis inside the central arcsecond. In addition, a faint X-ray emission peak is present on the redshifted axis at an offset of 1. 2 +- 0. 2 arcsec from the star. Deprojected jet speeds determined from previous optical studies are too low to explain this faint emission peak as shock-heated jet plasma. Thus, unless flow speeds in the redshifted jet have been underestimated, other mechanisms such as magnetic jet heating may be involved.
