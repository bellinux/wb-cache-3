25|$|Two {{types of}} ghost craters {{occur in the}} Borealis region; both are nearly obliterated by smooth plains material. In one type found along the {{northwest}} border of Suisei Planitia (Guest and Greeley, 1983), only the uppermost parts of walls and rims protrude above smooth plains material. Ghost craters of this type display <b>rounded</b> <b>rim</b> crests that are densely cratered with secondaries, a feature typical of the rough surface of intercrater plains material. These craters are floored by smooth plains material and are therefore older than it; a similar relation occurs on the Moon, where the crater Archimedes is seen to be older than the mare material it contains. Another type of ghost crater, common in Borealis Planitia, is recognized only by an irregular or thin outline of a rim crest under a thin mantle of smooth plains material; the buried rim crest is shown on the map. The polygonal ghost crater centered at lat 82.5° N., long 100° W., northwest of Depréz, is a transitional form between these two types. Polar darkening is generally lacking on Mercury (Hapke, 1977), but darkening in restricted areas {{may be due to}} vapor-phase deposition accompanying micrometeorite impacts (Hapke, 1977). In the Borealis region, surface darkening affects some crater floors, and low-albedo areas are mapped in both intermediate plains and smooth plains materials. The low-albedo plains are marginal to the borders of Borealis and Suisei Planitiae, which suggests that darkening may be due to internal volatile materials escaping along the fractured margins of unrecognized buried or very degraded basins.|$|E

25|$|Over all of Mercury, the {{crispness}} of crater rims and the morphology {{of their}} walls, central peaks, ejecta deposits, and secondary-crater fields have undergone systematic changes with time.

The oldest craters consist only of shallow depressions with slightly raised, <b>rounded</b> <b>rims,</b> some incomplete. On this basis, five age categories of craters and basins have been mapped. In addition, secondary crater fields are preserved around proportionally far more craters and basins on Mercury than on the Moon or Mars, and are particularly useful in determining overlap relations and degree of modification.|$|R

50|$|A butler's sink is a {{rectangular}} ceramic sink with a <b>rounded</b> <b>rim</b> {{which is set}} into a work surface. There are generally two kinds of butler's sinks: The London sink and the Belfast sink. In 2006, both types of sinks usually were 61 cm across and 46 cm front-to-back, with a depth of 22.5 cm. London sinks were originally shallower than Belfast sinks. (One plumbing guide in 1921 suggested that the Belfast sink was 38 cm deep.) Some believe this was because London had less access to fresh water (and thus a greater need to conserve water), but this theory is now contested. It is more likely the two sinks had different roles within the household. But that difference usually {{does not exist in}} the modern era, and both sinks are now shallow. The primary difference both in the past and today between a Belfast and London sink is that the Belfast sink is fitted with an overflow weir which prevented water from spilling over the sink's edge by draining it away and down into the wastewater plumbing.|$|E

40|$|The fibre {{generator}} {{shape and}} dimension are key factors affecting the needleless electrospinning process and fibre fineness. In this work, cylinder with <b>rounded</b> <b>rim,</b> disc and ball {{were used as}} spinnerets to electrospin polyvinyl alcohol and polyacrylonitrile solutions. A finite element method was used to analyse how the spinneret geometry affected the electric field generated during electrospinning and the associated changes in fibre diameter and productivity. For cylinder spinnerets, increasing the rim radius reduced the discrepancy of electric field intensity between the cylinder end and middle area, which affected the fibre productivity. The electrospinning failed to operate when the rim radius was over 20  mm. With decreasing cylinder diameter, the electric field intensity in the middle area increased, improving the fibre productivity. Thinner disc spinnerets increased the electric field intensity, resulting in finer nanofibres and higher productivities. Ball spinnerets produced evenly distributed electric field, but failed to electrospin fibres when the diameters were below 60  mm. It {{has been found that}} strong and narrowly distributed electric field in the fibre-generating area can significantly facilitate the mass production of quality nanofibres. <br /...|$|E

The “textile” ceramics is regarded by the author as the key ethnic and cultural indicator of the Finnish community that populated forests of Eastern Europe during the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age.

To describe wares with “textile” prints, the author chose 3 standard sites with the most numerous ceramic complexes – 4 Kokshaysk, Sosnovaya Griva and the Akhmylovo settlements. All the complexes are similar, with prevailing thin-wall vessels with admixture of sand, with open or – rarely – closed neck and a smooth transition into body; with straight or <b>rounded</b> <b>rim,</b> with dominating spun chaotic prints, speckled arcuate and “rain”-like prints or their combinations; very common are patterns of irregular or round holes, arranged in horizontal lines.
