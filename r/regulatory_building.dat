40|$|It is {{estimated}} that South Africa has the eighth largest resources of shale gas reserves in the world. It is reported that shale gas extraction can have important benefits which include economic growth, poverty alleviation, carbon emission reduction and most significantly alleviate the current energy shortage. However the proposed extraction of shale gas using hydraulic fracturing requires large amounts of water and many hazardous chemicals which also risks water resource pollution. This can add to water stress and conflict because the Karoo is a semi-arid, water-deficient and drought prone region. Since the extraction thereof {{is a relatively new}} technology in South Africa {{there is a need to}} determine if the current regulatory and institutional framework in South Africa will be adequate to meet the demands posed by this potentially game-changing enterprise. This minor dissertation outlines the regulatory framework regarding both the water quality and quantity in the shale gas extraction process. It recommends that while there are some <b>regulatory</b> <b>building</b> blocks in place, many gaps exist. It will recommend that an inter-departmental co-operative steering committee is established to address the many overlapping responsibilities and at times contradicting requirements...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{notion of}} {{advancing}} levels of adequate regulatory compliance within {{the domain of}} construction and engineering {{is by no means}} a new phenomenon. An extensive degree of effort has over a number of decades previously focused on semi/fully automating design checking against <b>regulatory</b> <b>building</b> codes. After experiencing somewhat of a dip in popularity within academia, this research topic is once again of great interest due to the on-going adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the construction domain among other drivers like frequent updates to building regulatory documents particularly in relation to sustainability related issues like energy efficiency of buildings. This interest will only increase as we witness further widespread adoption of this new BIM paradigm across until now untouched disciplines. Unfortunately design checking within the remit of BIM still faces major problems with respect to national and local regulations as no sustainably sensible or scalable method has yet been implemented to ensure compliance rules are consistent with current legislation within these contexts. This work questions a suitable representational data format for UK construction and engineering regulations focusing on machine processable formats built entirely on open data standards which can then set the basis for addressing the aforementioned issues. We compare two existing legislation data models, namely the Crown Legislation Markup Language (CLML) and Akoma Ntoso, whilst in the process grading each on its suitability for most accurately accommodating and expressing th...|$|E
40|$|Performance-based {{fire safety}} system design enables fire safety {{engineers}} {{to assess the}} performance of buildings and components by taking into account various scenarios of real fires and their severity. This approach offers more flexibility to the fire safety engineer to adopt new design concepts such as aesthetic values, material and energy efficiencies, while complying with <b>regulatory</b> <b>building</b> codes. For such an approach, the testing of fire safety systems either experimentally or numerically is essential and since experimental studies are vastly expensive, fire models are usually used. State-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based fire models typically include pyrolysis and combustion sub-models for predicting fire growth and spread in addition to background mass, momentum and energy balance sub-models. Separately, the phenomena of pyrolysis and combustion of materials are quite complex and during a fire both phenomena occur simultaneously thus compounding the complexity. Simulating these phenomena relies primarily on the prescribed fire properties of combustible materials and any error in providing the input fire properties data may affect the prediction of the fire behaviour. This study has been conducted to characterize the fire properties for coupled pyrolysis and combustion simulation. The overarching objective is to find, given an unknown or novel material, how would a user go about quantifying the representative fire properties and use them optimally? A range of experimental techniques and where necessary, data post-processing methods have been established, developed, selected and implemented to determine critical fire properties. Two bench-scale instruments, the cone calorimeter and hot disk analyser, {{as well as two}} miligram-scale instruments, a thermogravimetric analyser and differential scanning calorimeter, have been used for this purpose...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is first, to gain insight into how the European member states have {{addressed}} the concept of sustainability in their <b>building</b> <b>regulatory</b> frameworks; and second, to gain insight in the effects of harmonization attempts of these frameworks by the European Commission (EC). Design/methodology/approach - Data on the member states' <b>building</b> <b>regulatory</b> regimes were gathered using a survey questionnaire. The survey questionnaire addressed over 60 different aspects of sustainable construction that may, in various ways, be regulated by the member states. Findings - The data obtained show mixed results. Some aspects of sustainable construction show far-reaching homogeneity, whilst others do not. It appears that current EC directives have a positive effect on homogeneity of sustainable construction regulation throughout Europe. However, this does not provide a firm base to advise more directives, as these often appear a too resource-intensive tool to achieve sustainable construction in a timely fashion. Additional and complementary approaches to such directives are proposed. Originality/value - The paper presents an overview of how European member states have addressed various aspects of sustainable construction in their construction regulatory frameworks. This provides valuable insights for further studies on regulatory change, regulatory convergence and divergence, and policy outcomes related to sustainable construction in the European Union. Also, the study presents a number of approaches to achieve homogeneity that may complement earlier approaches taken by the EC...|$|R

40|$|Cells use {{feedback}} {{to implement a}} diverse range of <b>regulatory</b> functions. <b>Building</b> synthetic feedback control systems may yield insight into the roles that feedback can play in regulation since it can be introduced independently of native regulation, and alternative control architectures can be compared. We propose a model for microbial biofuel production where a synthetic control system is used to increase cell viability and biofuel yields. Although microbes can be engineered to produce biofuels, the fuels are often toxic to cell growth, creating a negative feedback loop that limits biofuel production. These toxic effects may be mitigated by expressing efflux pumps that export biofuel from the cell. We developed a model for cell growth and biofuel production {{and used it to}} compare several genetic control strategies for their ability to improve biofuel yields. We show that controlling efflux pump expression directly with a biofuel-responsive promoter is a straight forward way of improving biofuel production. In addition, a feed forward loop controller is shown to be versatile at dealing with uncertainty in biofuel production rates...|$|R

Drawing on the comparison of how Italy and Germany deliberated the ways in which assisted reproductive technologies and human embryo stem cell research should be governed, we explore the conditions that affect the potential of a dignitarian ethic to effectively shape countries’ policy on these issues. We argue that two factors substantially affect its success. The first factor is the position of dignitarianism in the country’s bioethical landscape, that is, whether it is the dominant bioethical perspective or competes with other perspectives for regulatory relevance. The second factor is the willingness of the regulators to strike compromises with their opponents if dignitarianism is not the main bioethical perspective and competes with other ethical perspectives for <b>regulatory</b> relevance. <b>Building</b> on our analysis, we conclude by drawing three general patterns of the relationships between countries’ bioethical configurations and their regulatory policy...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the developments of European <b>building</b> <b>regulatory</b> systems and place them {{within the context of}} general trends in the regulatory sciences, particularly with reference to Europeanisation studies. Within the regulatory sciences there is broad consensus about the trend towards deregulation and privatisation in recent decades. Studies conducted under the rubric of ‘Europeanisation’ analyse the effects of European policies on the policy frameworks of the member states in more detail. Are the systems converging or diverging? Although the history of this kind of research is short, most authors agree that European policies have {{had a profound impact on}} the policies of the member states, but that this impact has not been uniform. In this paper, we analyse privatisation and deregulation trends within the <b>building</b> <b>regulatory</b> systems of eight European countries, and we consider whether the systems appear to be converging or diverging. We focus on three elements: the scope of the technical requirements, the building-permit procedures and the division of control and inspection responsibilities. The analyses reveal no evidence that the scope of technical requirements in European countries is diminishing. Through its directives, the European Union exercises a convergent influence on the contents, scope, and formulation of these technical requirements. In addition, all member countries are taking steps to streamline their administrative procedures. The importance of the role played by private organisations in checking and controlling regulations is increasing across the board. Although they differ in pace and emphasis, these administrative deregulation and privatisation trends exhibit a number of parallel developments. ...|$|R
