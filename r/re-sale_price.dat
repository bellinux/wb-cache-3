2500|$|The {{resale right}} (...) , which entitles an author to receive 5% {{of the new}} resale price for {{a work of art}} if that price is at least 20% higher than the last (<b>re-)sale</b> <b>price.</b> This applies only to works of the visual arts: paintings, sculptures, engravings, comics, and such, but not to {{photographs}} or manuscripts. This right is, like the moral rights, inalienable. It can be inherited.|$|E
50|$|The measure, {{which could}} affect about 500 {{publishers}} who produce 10,000 books a year, {{did not require}} a canton majority. Previously the <b>re-sale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance regulations were revoked in French Switzerland in the early 1990s and in 2007 in German Switzerland.|$|E

5000|$|Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., , stating that, [...] "under Colgate, the {{manufacturer}} can announce its <b>re-sale</b> <b>prices</b> {{in advance and}} refuse {{to deal with those}} who fail to comply, and a distributor is free to acquiesce to {{the manufacturer}}'s demand in order to avoid termination". Monsanto, an agricultural chemical, terminated its distributorship agreement with Spray-Rite on the ground that it failed to hire trained salesmen and promote sales to dealers adequately. Held, not per se illegal, because the restriction related to non-price matters, and so was to be judged under the rule of reason.|$|R
5000|$|While {{vertical}} price agreements remained taboo, in 1919 the Supreme Court in United States v. Colgate & Co., {{recognized the}} manufacturers right {{to deal with}} whomever it wanted, and as importantly, its right to refuse to deal. This distinction allowed manufacturers to announce terms under which they would deal with their resellers and then refuse {{to deal with those}} who failed to comply. Colgates progeny in 1984 further built upon this right in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., stating that, [...] "under Colgate, the manufacturer can announce its <b>re-sale</b> <b>prices</b> in advance and refuse to deal with those who fail to comply, and a distributor is free to acquiesce to the manufacturers demand in order to avoid termination".|$|R
5000|$|Rare groove is soul or jazz {{music that}} {{is very hard to}} source or {{relatively}} obscure. Rare groove is primarily associated with funk, jazz and pop, but is also connected to subgenres including jazz fusion, reggae, Latin jazz, soul, R&B, northern soul, and disco. [...] Vinyl records that fall into this category generally have high <b>re-sale</b> <b>prices.</b> Rare groove records have been sought after by not only collectors and lovers of this type of music, but also by hip-hop artists and producers. Online music retailers sell a wide selection of rare groove at more affordable prices, offering fast downloads in digital format. [...] This availability and ease of access has brought about a resurgence of the genre in recent years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} valuing future income streams {{as a present}} capital sum is to multiply the average expected annual cash-flow by a multiple, known as [...] "years' purchase". For example, in selling to a third party a property leased to a tenant under a 99-year lease at a rent of $10,000 per annum, a deal might be struck at [...] "20 years' purchase", which would value the lease at 20 * $10,000, i.e. $200,000. This equates to a present value discounted in perpetuity at 5%. For a riskier investment the purchaser would demand to pay a lower number of years' purchase. This was the method used for example by the English crown in setting <b>re-sale</b> <b>prices</b> for manors seized at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the early 16th century. The standard usage was 20 years' purchase.|$|R
40|$|On the {{possibility}} of reducing public expenditures on medicine through deregulation. The market for medicine is special in three essential respects: (a) The role of the buyer is divided by three agents: the (informed) doctor, who prescribes the medicine, the public health insurance, which pays most of the bill, and the (uninformed) consumer, who benefits from the medication and pays part of the bill. This division creates obvious incentive problems. (b) The distributors (pharmacies and wholesalers) have no market power as they are obliged to procure the medicine prescribed by the doctors - no more no less. (c) Competition among suppliers is limited; most medicine is provided by either a single producer of patented drugs or by a few competitors. Economic efficiency calls for some combination of regulation and competition, the exact combination depending upon the market structure of the various sub-markets. - First, we discuss the possibilities of designing an appropriate combination of administrative regulation and incentives suitable for enhancing cost-efficiency of prescription. Second, we analyse the economies of deregulating the pharmacy sector which, by now, is subject to both controls on both (total) gross profits and establishment. The conclusion is that deregulation is unlikely to increase economic efficiency. Third, {{we take a look}} at the whole sale sector which, by now, is subject to binding <b>re-sale</b> <b>prices</b> determined by the producers. Economic efficiency dictates that binding resale prices are upheld. Finally, we discuss the possibilities of strengthening the demand side as a way of reducing expenditures and recommend that the organization of the demand side should reflect the market structure of the supply side: In case of monopoly, the bargaining should be entrusted to a single, powerful public body. In case of imperfect competition, tendering appears appropriate. Public expenditure; Medicine through deregulation...|$|R
