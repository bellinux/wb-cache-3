40|$|We designed, built, tested, and fielded a vote {{counting}} {{system called}} Scantegrity. Scantegrity {{is part of}} a new class of end-to-end (E 2 E) verifiable voting systems. E 2 E verifiable systems are designed to solve chain of custody problems in elections by providing a privacy-preserving receipt to each voter. The voter can use the receipt to check a public record and verify that his or her ballot is counted without revealing the selected candidate. The public record gives election officials the ability to provide a strong, universally-accessible audit of the results, enabling transparent, verifiable elections that maintain privacy expectations. E 2 E systems offer radical improvements to integrity and transparency of election systems, and the adoption of E 2 E systems in public-sector elections can improve outcome integrity. In our design, we carefully considered the balance between usability and security issues, and we discuss the changes we made to implement the system. We examined the implementation through the results of a practical test of Scantegrity in a mock election in April 2009, which evaluated the system's performance and surveyed the election participants about their experience with the system. We describe a number of changes we made to the system {{as a result of this}} test. For example, Scantegrity required better printing technology and a tally reconciliation system. We evaluated the modified system a second time by fielding it in the Takoma Park, Maryland, November 2009 municipal election, where we were able to survey voters and observe events throughout election day. In addition to examining the performance of the system during election day, we analyzed the survey results and found that most voters felt positively about the system despite some problems when taking advantage of the new features. We suggest further improvement to the usability of Scantegrity by proposing and analyzing the addition of an automatic <b>receipt</b> <b>printer</b> in different configurations. To design the <b>receipt</b> <b>printer,</b> we took advantage of protections provided by the Trusted Computing platform that improve the reliability and robustness of the component. The final system automatically provides each voter a privacy-preserving receipt that can be used to verify each ballot has been counted properly...|$|E
40|$|Title: Customer {{satisfaction}} with {{the service of the}} store Sportex. cz Leader: Mgr. Jan Šíma Objectives: The aim of this work is to use the survey to find out the customer {{satisfaction with}} the service of the sports store Sportex. cz. Furthermore, {{based on the results of}} questionnaires, to propose new solutions and the arrangement for the existing sports shop Sportex. cz. If the customers are satisfied with the purchase, they will visit this store for further purchases in the future again. Methods: Quantitative research using electronic and written questioning Results: Customers are most satisfied with the service and retail facilities. Assortment is considered to be above average. The weakest aspect appears to be the availability and location of the store. Based on the results, as the main pillar of changes, it was recommended extending the range of the new products, introduce light banner in front of the store, extend the opening hours, buy of the <b>receipt</b> <b>printer</b> and rethink the pricing policy.

50|$|Modules {{could provide}} common {{smartphone}} features, such as cameras and speakers, but could also provide more specialized features, such as medical devices, <b>receipt</b> <b>printers,</b> laser pointers, pico projectors, night vision sensors, or game controller buttons. Each slot {{on the frame}} accepted any module of the correct size. The front slots are of various heights and took up the whole width of the frame. The rear slots had standard sizes of 1×1, 1×2 and 2×2. Modules could be hot-swapped without turning the phone off. The frame also included a small backup battery so the main battery can be hot-swapped. Modules were originally to be secured with electropermanent magnets, but this {{was replaced by a}} different method. The enclosures of the modules were planned to be 3D-printed, but {{due to the lack of}} development in the technology Google opted instead for a customizable molded case.|$|R

But recently ORIX Auto Infrastructure Services Ltd. has introduced an air-conditioned Radio Taxi service in Kolkata with the name 'Kolkata Cab' with fleets consisting of Indigo Marina only, which has gained popularity among the city dwellers because it has comfortable seats, GPS monitoring, digital tamper-proof meters, <b>receipt</b> <b>printers</b> and lost-and-found facilities. Mega Cabs are also there with the same facilities. Some other prospective Radio Taxis rolled into the city are Fast Track, Uber Black, Ola, Easy Cabs and Meru Cabs, which are quickly gaining acceptance due to some strikes by the taxi unions.|$|R
40|$|End-to-End (E 2 E) voting systems provide {{cryptographic}} {{proof that}} the voter's intention is captured, cast, and tallied correctly. While E 2 E systems guarantee integrity independent of software, most E 2 E systems rely on software to provide confidentiality, availability, authentication, and access control; thus, end-to-end integrity is not end-to-end security. Trustworthy Computing (TC) improves the security of software systems significantly. The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) protects secrets and enforces security policy in a self- contained cryptographic co-processor. Systems use TPMs to allocate security requirements not to untrustworthy software, but to tamper-resistant hardware, enabling applications such as digital rights management and secure computing platforms. Our research found that adding TC to voting systems is possible, practical, and enhances privacy even in E 2 E systems by managing election secrets inside trustworthy hardware. We produced 4 major results: [...] Analysis of how TC can benefit E 2 E [...] Design that adds TPMs to Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting systems, binding ballots and votes, with software state, and enforcing election day policy [...] Design that enables voters to verify voting platform system integrity using common and inexpensive programmable smart cards [...] Two designs that add trustworthy <b>receipt</b> <b>printers</b> to the Scantegrity E 2 E voting system adding usability, security, and enabling alternative voter interface...|$|R
