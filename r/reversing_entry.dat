Although these systems simplify experimental manipulation and provide relatively {{large amounts of}} soluble protein, they do {{not account for the}} complexity of signal regulation from other factors or cell types present in the cell's native physiological environment. Here we describe the general analytical and informatic methodologies used for the global quantitation of specific sites of phosphorylation from clinically relevant matrices such as human tissue or biological fluids compatible from a variety of different experimental designs. As an exemplar application of the methodology, a quantitative analysis of lipopolysaccharide challenged and ethyl nitrite protected mouse lung tissue was performed. Phosphopeptide enrichments from 600 ug aliquots of trypsin digested homogenized mouse lung tissue from four unique treatment groups was accomplished using an optimized TiO 2 spin-column protocol and were subjected to triplicate 1 D-LC-MS/MS analysis on a Waters NanoAcquity UPLC coupled to a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL. Following accurate mass and retention time alignment across all LC-MS runs performed within Rosetta Elucidator, a robust mean normalization of precursor ion intensities was applied and area under the curve quantitative measurements were made for all precursor ions. Qualitative identifications were assigned to each precursor ion following Mascot searches against a mus musculus database appended with <b>reverse</b> <b>entries</b> and scoring thresholds were adjusted to yield a peptide 1 % FDR. Across all four treatment groups, a total of 778 phosphopeptides were qualitatively identified. Analytical plus TiO 2 enrichment variation of pre-digested bovine alpha-casein spiked into each sample prior to enrichment yielded a phosphopeptide intensity variation of < 20 % RSD across approximately three orders of magnitude.

We tested the ability of 19 primary virus isolates to infect monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from different donors. Two HIV- 1 isolates were able to establish a productive infection in MDM from all donors tested, whereas eight completely lacked this capacity. Next to these isolates with extreme phenotypes, 50 % of the primary isolates under study displayed an intermediate phenotype. These intermediate macrophage-tropic isolates established a productive infection in MDM from some but not all donors tested. PCR analysis demonstrated that the capacity to replicate in MDM could be determined at the previously described level of virus entry.

Infection of mixed glial cultures in the presence of serum, cytokines, and growth factors (activating conditions) resulted in a robust productive infection of microglial cells as previously described for purified microglia. In contrast, similar mixed glial cells cultured in serum-free medium without cytokines or growth factors (mirroring a nonactivated CNS) supported HIV- 1 <b>entry,</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription, integration, and transcription, yet released little or no infectious virus. We found instead that nonactivated mixed glial cells expressed almost 10 -fold less Gag protein, but more importantly, analysis of the intracellular Gag products in quiescent cells showed an aberrant p 55 /p 24 Gag processing phenotype that appeared to be due to the premature activity of the viral protease.

Various hypotheses have been proposed for this cellular restriction including insufficient nucleotide pools and cellular factors, but none have been confirmed as the primary mechanism for restriction. A recent study by Chiu et al. implicates APOBEC 3 G, an anti-retroviral cytidine deaminase, as the cellular restriction factor. Here, we attempted to confirm these findings using the same strategy as reported by Chiu et al. of siRNA targeting knock-down of APOBEC 3 G expression. In contrast to the published study, our results do not support a role for APOBEC 3 G in restriction of HIV- 1 in quiescent CD 4 + T-cells.

In spite of the success of AIDS therapies and the existence of inhibitors of HIV- 1 <b>reverse</b> transcriptase, protease, <b>entry</b> and fusion, and integrase, HIV- 1 therapies still have a variety of problems which require continued development efforts to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity, while making drugs that can be used throughout both the developed and developing world, in pediatric populations, and in pregnant women.

40|$|Targeting host {{factors is}} a {{complementary}} {{strategy for the}} development of new antiviral drugs. We screened a library of isoxazolidine and isoxazole sulfonamides and found four compounds that inhibited HIV- 1 infection in human CD 4 + lymphocytic T cells with no toxicity at IC 90 concentrations. Structure-activity relationship showed that benzyl sulfonamides and a halosubstituted aromatic ring on the heterocycle scaffold were critical for antiretroviral activity. The size and position of the incorporated halogen had a marked effect on the antiretroviral activity. The sulfonamide derivatives had no significant effect on HIV- 1 <b>entry,</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription and integration but impaired a step necessary for activation of viral gene expression. This step was Tat-independent, strongly suggesting that the target is a cell factor. A virus partially resistant to the least potent compounds could be selected but could not be propagated in the long term, consistent with the possibility that HIV- 1 may be less likely to develop resistance against drugs targeting some host factors.

In order to study matrix protein function during assembly, cryo-electron microscopy and tomography studies were carried out on two virus families. Studies of coronavirus virus-like particles and virions revealed that the matrix protein M forms a two-dimensional network of endodornain-Iinked homodimers at the membrane. Structural differences were detected between M on membranes with rigid positive curvature and M on flaccid membranes with variable curvature. Studies of filamentous and round influenza A virus revealed structural and functional differences in the homodimeric matrix protein Ml that were associated with differences in local membrane curvature. The conformational change happened more commonly on filamentous particles than on spherical. In both virus families matrix proteins were found to control membrane bending and rigidity through a process that appears to involve ribonucleoprotein-dependent conformational changes. Both influenza Ml and coronavirus M lost rigid membrane bending activity upon exposure to pH 5. 0, demonstrating that the interactions that are proposed to lead to budding can be reversed under conditions that simulate the endosomal environment. Together, these observations help to explain how matrix proteins are able to produce sufficient force to drive the budding process through homotypic and heterotypic intramolecular interactions, and how the structural changes that drive egress can be <b>reversed</b> to facilitate <b>entry.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
