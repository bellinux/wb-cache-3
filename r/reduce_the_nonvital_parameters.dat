40|$|Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is the cyst {{arising from}} the cell rests of dental lamina. It can occur {{anywhere}} in the jaw, but commonly seen in the posterior part of the mandible.

40|$|The term odontogenic keratocyst {{was first}} {{described}} by Philipsen in 1956. This cyst actually {{arises from the}} cell rests of dental lamina. It can occur anywhere in the jaw but is commonly seen in the posterior part of the mandible. Since the clinical features and radiological appearance are not characteristic this condition is commonly misdiagnosed. This is more so when the lesion is related to <b>the</b> <b>nonvital</b> tooth. Odontogenic keratocyst has been rechristened as keratocystic odontogenic tumor by WHO working group in 2005. This was necessitated to differentiate this lesion from its orthokeratinizing variant which is currently considered as odontogenic cyst. This case report discusses odontogenic keratocyst of mandible. The term odontogenic keratocyst was first used by Philipsen in 1956 1. This relatively uncommon lesion arises from the cell rests of dental lamina. This is an aggressive cyst with rapid growth rate and a tendency to invade adjacent tissues including bone. It has {{a high rate of}} recurrence 2.

40|$|Apoptosis, or {{programmed}} cell death, is {{a general}} mechanism for removal of unwanted cells from the immune system. It is characterized by chromatin condensation, a reduction in cell volume, and endonuclease cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal length fragments. Apoptosis is also accompanied by a loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry, resulting in the exposure of phosphatidylserine at {{the surface of the}} cell. Expression of phosphatidylserine at the cell surface {{plays an important role in}} the recognition and removal of apoptotic cells by macrophages. Here we describe a new method for the detection of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry, using the binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V to phosphatidylserine. When Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and freshly isolated germinal center B cells are cultured under apoptosis inducing conditions, all cells showing chromatin condensation strongly stain with annexin V, whereas normal cells are annexin V negative. Moreover, DNA fragmentation is only found in the annexin V-positive cells. <b>The</b> <b>nonvital</b> dye ethidium bromide was found to stain a subpopulation of the annexin V-positive apoptotic cells, increasing with time. Our results indicate that the phase in apoptosis that is characterized by chromatin condensation coincides with phosphatidylserine exposure. Importantly, it precedes membrane damage that might lead to release from the cells of enzymes that are harmful to the surrounding tissues. Annexin V may prove important in further unravelling the regulation of apoptosi...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{organization}} of interval 62 B 3 - 4 to 62 D 3 - 4 on the Drosophila third chromosome was investigated. The region (designated DRE) includes four known loci: Roughened (R; 3 - 1. 4), {{defined by a}} dominant mutation disrupting eye morphology; <b>the</b> <b>nonvital</b> locus Aprt, structural gene for adenine phosphoribosyltranferase; Dras 3, a homolog of the vertebrate ras oncogene; and l(3) ecdysoneless (l(3) ecd), a gene that has been implicated in the regulation of larval molting hormone (ecdysteroid) synthesis. Overlapping chromosomal deletions of the region were generated by γ-ray-induced reversion of the R mutation. Recessive lethal mutations were isolated based upon failure to complement the recessive lethality of Df(3 L) R(R 2), a deletion of the DRE region that removes 16 - 18 polytene chromosome bands. A total of 117 mutations were isolated following ethyl methanesulfonate and γ-ray mutagenesis. These and two additional mutations define 13 lethal complementation groups. Mutations at two loci were recovered at disproportionately high rates. One of these loci is preferentially sensitive to radiation-induced mutational alterations. Additionally, an unusually low recovery rate for cytologically detectable rearrangement breakpoints within the γ-ray-sensitive locus suggests that an interval of the DRE region {{closely linked to the}} R locus may be dominantly sensitive to position effects. Lethal phase analysis of mutant hemizygotes indicates that a high proportion of DRE-region loci (11 of 13) are necessary for larval development. Mutations in five loci cause predominantly first-instar larval lethality, while mutations in four other loci cause predominantly second-instar lethality. Mutations in two loci cause late-larval lethality associated with abnormal imaginal disc development. A temperature-sensitive allele of one newly identified complementation group blocks ecdysteroid-induced pupariation. This developmental block is overcome by dietary 20 -hydroxyecdysone, suggesting that a second locus in the region in addition to l(3) ecd {{may play a role in}} the regulation of late larval ecdysteroid levels...|$|R
