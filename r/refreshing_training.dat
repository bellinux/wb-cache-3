40|$|Background: Mortality {{statistic}} {{was essential}} to provide basic information {{on the status of}} population health. Indonesiadoes not have a standard national role for recording and reporting cause of death for every case that occurs in hospital or at home. In 2005 NIHRD colaberations with WHO and University of Queensland to developed "Sertifikat MediaPenyebab Kematian" and verbal Aotopsi. This certificate was using in Pontianak city populations death to find the underlying cause of death since 2007. Methods: Training and socialization to medical doctors in every hospital in Pontianak city how to fill the certificate according t international standard in ICD- 10. Training to medical doctor and paramedic of health center how to do autopsy verbal and resume the diagnosis on underlying cause of death. Results: A 1207 of total death the higher frequency of underlying cause of death (UCoD) in Pontianak city in 2007 is stroke. The higher UCoD of infant death was intrauterine hypoxia and birth asphyxia that occur in neonatal period. The higher UCoD of BALITA (1 - 4 years) is drowning. 13. 26 % of death occur in production age (15 - 44 years), although the heigher age group death is > 65 years old (34. 12 %). The most UCoD in male production age group is transport accident while in female is other direct obstetric death. Lung Tb is common UCoD in productive age group, third rank in male and seventh rank in female. Conclusions: Recording and reporting system on UCoD in Pontianak city is developed but not optimal, because the result was still underestimate of mortality rate.

40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHThis {{study has}} reveled {{the levels of}} {{knowledge}} and compliance towards Universal Precautions and examined the factors that are influential in having a positive and negative effect on their adoption by healthcare practitioners in practice. Despite acceptable knowledge regarding the potential for infection and mechanisms to prevent these infections, this study has found out that health care workers are not as compliant with universal precautions as they need to be. The findings that compliance correlated directly with knowledge, with in-service training and with availability of protective equipment, provide important indications for future interventions. Therefore a regular on job <b>refreshing</b> <b>training</b> program on Universal Precautions, a written guideline and reminder poster on Universal Precautions and personal protective equipment {{need to be made}} available for all health care providers in every department of the hospital for better compliance...|$|E

40|$|Background: Virtual patient {{simulation}} {{has grown}} substantially {{in health care}} education. A virtual patient simulation was developed as a refresher training course to reinforce nursing clinical performance in assessing and managing deteriorating patients. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the development of the virtual patient simulation and evaluate its efficacy, by comparing with a conventional mannequin-based simulation, for improving the nursing students' performances in assessing and managing patients with clinical deterioration. Mehtods: A randomized controlled study was conducted with 57 third-year nursing students who were recruited through email. After a baseline evaluation of all participants' clinical performance in a simulated environment, the experimental group received a 2 -hour fully automated virtual patient simulation while the control group received 2 -hour facilitator-led mannequin-based simulation training. All participants were then re-tested one day (first posttest) and 2. 5 months (second posttest) after the intervention. The participants from the experimental group completed a survey to evaluate their learning experiences with the newly developed virtual patient simulation. Results: Compared to their baseline scores, both experimental and control groups demonstrated significant improvements (P<. 001) in first and second post-test scores. While the experimental group had significantly lower (P<. 05) second post-test scores compared with the first post-test scores, no significant difference (P=. 94) was found between these two scores for the control group. The scores between groups did not differ significantly over time (P=. 17). The virtual patient simulation was rated positively. Conclusions: A virtual patient simulation for a <b>refreshing</b> <b>training</b> course on assessing and managing clinical deterioration was developed. Although the randomized controlled study did not show that the virtual patient simulation was superior to mannequin-based simulation, both simulations have demonstrated to be effective refresher learning strategies for improving nursing students' clinical performance. Given the greater resource requirements of mannequin-based simulation, the virtual patient simulation provides a more promising alternative learning strategy to mitigate the decay of clinical performance over time...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of supplementary food program for elementary school student (PMT-AS) are to increase students' physical endurance by improving nutrition and health status which will motivate their interest and learning capabilities for advancing achievement {{in order to}} fulfill nine-year compulsory education. The implementation of PMT-AS involved women's group as cookers and also helps distribute foods to students. In large amount of foods cooking unwanted incidences could happened, such as food poisoning in Lampung Utara and Purwokerto (Banyumas). These unwanted incidences can be prevented if food processing followed health procedures. The {{objectives of}} this research are identifying food safety risk factors on food processing. Risk factors that are observed: raw materials resources, raw materials and food storage, food processing and food distribution. After the risk factors and critical points are known, {{it would be easier to}} do some improvement interventions. This study is a cross sectional type reseach. It is located in Kelurahan Bandarharjo (Semarang Utara Subdistirct) and Kelurahan Pakintelan and Patemon (Gunung Pati Subdistrict). 'This study was done in July 1998 — November 1998. The subjects are women who involved in food processing for PMT-AS programme. There were 27 respondents and samples are taken by purposive sampling method. The data were gathered from interviewing and observing. Risk factors will be discussed in three aspects; knowledge, practice and monitoring. Data were analyzed descriptively. Based on this research, there are some risk factors that will cause endanger to the food safety. The risk factors in knowledge aspect are low : on raw materials storage, washing raw materials, hand nail hygiene, usage of jewelry, washing and drying cooking / eating equipment. The risk factors in practice aspect are low : raw materials storage, washing raw materials, washing facilities, ventilation, usage of aluminum equipment, cooker didn't use special equipment to hold foods, didn't use head cover and apron and also students' washing hand method. The risk factor in monitoring aspect is the frequency of monitoring too rarely. It can be concluded that there were some risk factors in knowledge, practice and monitoring in food processing of supplementary food program. It is recommended to related department to make annual <b>refreshing</b> <b>training</b> for cooker (food processor), trained district officers and teachers to monitor food processing and food quality, increasing frequency of monitoring and develop practical module in food processing hygiene and sanitation. ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives]To {{evaluate}} the long-term effectiveness of 15 -min refresher basic life support (BLS) training following 45 -min chest compression-only BLS training. [Methods]After the 45 -min chest compression-only BLS training, {{the participants were}} randomly assigned to either the <b>refresher</b> BLS <b>training</b> group, which received a 15 -min <b>refresher</b> <b>training</b> 6 months after the initial <b>training</b> (<b>refresher</b> <b>training</b> group), or to the control group, which did not receive <b>refresher</b> <b>training.</b> Participants’ resuscitation skills were evaluated by a 2 -min case-based scenario test 1 year after the initial training. The primary outcome measure was the number of appropriate chest compressions during a 2 -min test period. [Results] 140 participants were enrolled and 112 of them completed this study. The number of appropriate chest compressions performed during the 2 -min test period was significantly greater in the <b>refresher</b> <b>training</b> group (68. 9 ± 72. 3) than in the control group (36. 3 ± 50. 8,p = 0. 009). Time without chest compressions was significantly shorter in the <b>refresher</b> <b>training</b> group (16. 1 ± 2. 1 s versus 26. 9 ± 3. 7 s, p < 0. 001).
