5|$|The {{history of}} East Texas Normal College (ETNC) {{comprises}} {{the history of}} the university now known as Texas A University–Commerce from its foundation as a private normal college in 1889 to its acquisition by the State of Texas in 1917. It was founded in Cooper by Kentucky native William L. Mayo, who served as its president from its foundation until his death in 1917, and moved to Commerce after its original campus burned down in 1894. A popular school for active teachers seeking state certification or recertification, it was largely shaped by Mayo's own personal beliefs about education, which focused on participation and hands-on learning instead of memorization or <b>rote</b> <b>learning.</b>|$|E
5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and <b>rote</b> <b>learning.</b> He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.|$|E

5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and <b>rote</b> <b>learning.</b> The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|A major {{influence}} on Ueshiba's early education was his elementary schoolteacher Tasaburo Nasu, {{who was a}} Shinto priest and who introduced Ueshiba to the religion. At {{the age of six}} Ueshiba was sent to study at the Jizōderu Temple, but had little interest in the <b>rote</b> <b>learning</b> of Confucian education. However, his schoolmaster Mitsujo Fujimoto was also a priest of Shingon Buddhism, and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect, which Ueshiba found intriguing. His interest in Buddhism was sufficiently great that his mother considered enrolling him in the priesthood, but his father Yoroku vetoed the idea. Ueshiba went to Tanage Higher Elementary School and then to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School, but left formal education in his early teens, enrolling instead at a private abacus academy, the Yoshida Institute, to study accountancy. On graduating from the academy, he worked at a local tax office for a few months, but the job did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo, funded by his father. Ueshiba Trading, the stationery business which he opened there, was short-lived; unhappy with life in the capital, he returned to Tanabe {{less than a year later}} after suffering a bout of beri-beri. Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of an ethics survey {{undertaken}} by final year business and marketing students at Macquarie University in Sydney. The survey identified each student’s ethical ideology and asked them to evaluate the ethical nature of five scenarios. The large majority of students were identified as Situationists as defined in Forsyth’s Taxonomy of Ethical Ideologies. Male students were found to be more likely to be higher on the Relativism scale, tending to reject moral absolutes, considering situations in relation to their own principles and the particular situation. Some gender influence was detected in the evaluations of two of the scenarios. Situationists do not rely on the simple application of moral rules that can be <b>rote</b> <b>learned.</b> They are more likely to attempt to think analytically about a situation, to identify the appropriate ethical response. This requires a much deeper understanding of ethical concepts and supports the need for training in effective analytical skills in business education rather than teaching of absolute moral rules. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{educators}} are currently concerned with producing graduates who have mastery {{of knowledge and}} generic or “soft ” skills. A blend of both attributes would equip graduating engineers with critical thinking and problem solving skills, continuous self-learning abilities, and teamwork and communication skills.

40|$|Abstract- Some typical {{optimization}} {{problems like}} knapsack problem, activity selection problem, coin change problem and subset sum problem {{are taught in}} different courses of theoretical computer science, or in the different modules of the same course. A few of these problems can be solved in polynomial time but the rest are NP-complete problems. Even though, every problem has its own nature and description; however after changing certain constraints, they become equivalent to each other. These problems are discussed independently in most textbooks which {{makes it harder for}} the students to interlink them. Students get confused very easily while transitioning between different problem domains even if one problem is described in the language of another problem. In this paper, we have carefully analyzed and investigated links between the aforementioned problems and have also diagnosed the major causes of failure in understanding. One of the primary reasons students face difficulty is that they have a tendency to <b>rote</b> <b>learn.</b> We suggest that these problems and their algorithms should be taught simultaneously in a generic language using super-ordinate learning, so that {{they may be able to}} maintain the currently missing links. We assert that this effort will empower the notion of meaningful learning...|$|R
40|$|Genetics is an {{important}} aspect of secondary education as it improves students, understanding of the inheritance of genetic diseases which are present in many families. Genetics also provides opportunities for students to learn important problem solving skills. Students experience difficulties with problem solving in genetics as they tend to <b>rote</b> <b>learn</b> algorithmic methods and not have a meaningful understanding of the concepts of meiosis, gametes and fertilisation which underpin genetics problems. Following instruction in the area of genetics, think-aloud protocols were collected from 20 Year 10 students, while solving four genetic problems. The students were also interviewed to probe their understanding of concepts related to the genetic problems. This enabled the researcher to explore how well students understood the concepts in relation to the algorithms they used to solve the four problems. This research found that students are more successful in autosomal and forwards working problems than in X-linkage and backwards working problems. There is a low level of meaningful problem solving and a poor understanding of the terms genotype, phenotype, meiosis, gametes and fertilisation. Students also have difficulties understanding why X-linked characteristics are inherited in the way they are, and the difference in structure of the X and Y chromosomes...|$|R

This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of <b>rote</b> <b>learning</b> and punitive discipline in education.

Incorrect application of statistical tests causes incorrect interpretation of the study results obtained through hard work. Yet statistics {{remains one of the}} most neglected and loathed areas, probably due to the lack of understanding of the basic principles. In microbiology, rapid progress is being made in the field of diagnostic test, and a huge number of studies being conducted are related to the evaluation of these tests. Therefore, a good knowledge of statistical principles will aid a microbiologist to plan, conduct and interpret the result. The initial part of this review discusses the study designs, types of variables, principles of sampling, calculation of sample size, types of errors and power of the study. Subsequently, description of the performance characteristics of a diagnostic test, receiver operator characteristic curve and tests of significance are explained. Lack of a perfect gold standard test against which our test is being compared can hamper the study results; thus, it becomes essential to apply the remedial measures described here. Rapid computerisation has made statistical calculations much simpler, obviating the need for the routine researcher to <b>rote</b> <b>learn</b> the derivations and apply the complex formulae. Thus, greater focus has been laid on developing an understanding of principles.
