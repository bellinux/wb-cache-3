In 1833, the Light Company of the 46th Regiment of Foot were authorized to wear red cap distinctions instead of the <b>regulation</b> <b>Light</b> Infantry green, apparently in commemoration of this gesture, and in 1934, the Royal Berkshire Regiment, which carried on the traditions of the 49th Foot, were authorized to wear a red distinction in their head dress although, misleadingly, this was granted 'to commemorate the role of the Light Company at the battle of Brandywine Creek'. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, the descendants of both regiments wore red backing to their cap badges and did so until 2006 when The Light Infantry and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment were absorbed by The Rifles.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{motor vehicle}} {{development}} in the UK had been effectively stopped {{by a series of}} Locomotive Acts introduced during the 19th century which severely restricted the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on the public highways. Following intense advocacy by motor vehicle enthusiasts, including Harry J. Lawson of Daimler, the worst restrictions of these acts, (the need for each vehicle to be accompanied by a crew of three, and a 2 mi/h km/h speed limit in towns), was lifted by the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896. [...] Under this <b>regulation,</b> <b>light</b> locomotives (those vehicles under 3 tons unladen weight) were exempt from the previous restrictions, and a higher speed limit - 14 mi/h km/h was set for them. To celebrate the new freedoms Lawson organised the Emancipation Run held on 14 November 1896, the day the new Act came into force. This occasion has been commemorated since 1927 by the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.|$|E
40|$|Light {{is crucial}} for plant life, and {{perception}} of the light environment dictates plant growth, morphology, and developmental changes. Such adjustments in growth and development in response to light conditions are often established through changes in hormone levels and signaling. This review discusses examples of light-regulated processes throughout a plant's life cycle {{for which it is}} known how light signals lead to hormonal <b>regulation.</b> <b>Light</b> acts as an important developmental switch in germination, photomorphogenesis, and transition to flowering, and light cues are essential to ensure light capture through architectural changes during phototropism and the shade avoidance response.

40|$|Most organisms have an {{endogenous}} circadian {{clock that}} is synchronized to environmental signals such as light and temperature. Although circadian rhythms {{have been described}} in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans at the behavioral level, these rhythms appear to be relatively non-robust. Moreover, in contrast to other animal models, no circadian transcriptional rhythms have been identified. Thus, whether this organism contains a bona fide circadian clock remains an open question. Here we use genome-wide expression profiling experiments to identify light- and temperature-entrained oscillating transcripts in C. elegans. These transcripts exhibit rhythmic expression with temperature-compensated 24 -h periods. In addition, their expression is sustained under constant conditions, suggesting that they are under circadian <b>regulation.</b> <b>Light</b> and temperature cycles strongly drive gene expression and appear to entrain largely nonoverlapping gene sets. We show that mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolish both light- and temperature-entrained gene expression, implying that environmental cues act cell nonautonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. Together, these findings demonstrate circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and suggest tha...|$|E

Since GI has many important pleotropic functions as described above scattered through literature, it is worthwhile and about time to encapsulate the available information in a concise review. Therefore, in this review, we are making an attempt to summarize (i) the various interconnected roles that GI possibly plays in the fine-tuning of plant development, and (ii) the known mutations of GI that have been instrumental in understanding its role in distinct physiological processes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCarbon assimilation, a key {{determinant}} of plant biomass production, is under circadian <b>regulation.</b> <b>Light</b> and temperature are major inputs {{of the plant}} clock that control various daily rhythms. Such rhythms confer adaptive advantages to the organisms by adjusting their metabolism in anticipation of environmental fluctuations. The relationship between the circadian clock and nutrition extends far beyond the regulation of carbon assimilation as mineral nutrition, and specially iron homeostasis, is regulated through this mechanism. Conversely, iron status {{was identified as a}} new and important input regulating the central oscillator, raising the question {{of the nature of the}} Fe-dependent signal that modulates the period of the circadian clock. Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that fully developed and functional chloroplasts as well as early light signalling events, involving phytochromes, are essential to couple the clock to Fe responses. Nevertheless, the exact nature of the signal, which most probably involves unknown or not yet fully characterized elements of the chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signalling pathway, remains to be identified. Finally, this regulation may also involves epigenetic components...|$|E

40|$|Abstract from short. pdf file. Doctoral supervisor: Dr. Emmanuel Liscum, III. Includes vita. Using {{the model}} plant Arabidopsis thaliana, our {{research}} focuses on the intersection between pathogen defense and photobiology. PIXL is a putative resistance protein found to be an interactor of phototropin 1. Mutants lacking PIXL have altered light responsiveness, suggesting the wild-type protein could act as an intermediary between light and defense signaling. Additionally, phototropin double mutants exhibited less accumulation of pathogenesis-related protein 2, suggesting a role in induction or stability of the protein. We also provide further characterization of immune regulatory protein SRFR 1. Cross kingdom homology is seen across the length of SRFR 1. In certain genetic backgrounds, srfr 1 mutants have markedly different morphology, reduced viability, appear stunted and constitutively express several defense related genes. When a srfr 1 mutant plant is transformed with orthologous MmSRFR 1 from Mus musculus, the drastic srfr 1 phenotype is reduced. This observation suggests a level of conserved function for MmSRFR 1 in Arabidopsis.

40|$|Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is {{the first}} enzyme {{involved}} in the phenylpropanoid pathway and plays important roles in the secondary metabolisms, development and defense of plants. To study the molecular function of PAL in anthocyanin synthesis of Coleus (Solenostemon scutellarioides (L.) Codd), a Coleus PAL gene designated as SsPAL 1 was cloned and characterized using a degenerate oligonucleotide primer PCR and RACE method. The full-length SsPAL 1 was 2450 bp in size and consisted of one intron and two exons encoding a polypeptide of 711 amino acids. The deduced SsPAL 1 protein showed high identities and structural similarities with other functional plant PAL proteins. A series of putative cis-acting elements involved in transcriptional <b>regulation,</b> <b>light</b> and stress responsiveness {{were found in the}} upstream regulatory sequence of SsPAL 1. Transcription pattern analysis indicated that SsPAL 1 was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined and was enhanced by light and different abiotic factors. The recombinant SsPAL 1 protein exhibited high PAL activity, at optimal conditions of 60 °C and pH 8. 2. Although the levels of total PAL activity and total anthocyanin concentration have a similar variation trend in different Coleus cultivars, there was no significant correlation between them (r = 0. 7529, p > 0. 1), suggesting that PAL was not the rate-limiting enzyme for the downstream anthocyanin biosynthetic branch in Coleus. This study enables us to further understand the role of SsPAL 1 in the phenylpropanoid (flavonoids, anthocyanins) biosynthesis in Coleus at the molecular level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableRelatively {{new to the}} {{scientific}} community is the RNA interference pathway (RNAi) {{that can be used}} to silence post-transcriptional gene expression. Long dsRNA can be introduced into cells and through various mechanisms become a shorter siRNA-RISC complex. This complex targets and hydrolyzes mRNAs with complimentary sequences. This means that theoretically, any gene in which the exon-spliced RNA sequence is known can be targeted by engineered siRNA. The goal of my research project is to develop peptide mediated siRNA targeting of melanoma cells. The cell line used has a plasmid vector that exhibits luminescence when an enzyme is induced (luc+). This luminescence gene is targeted by our siRNA and we can quantify the down regulation of the gene using a light meter. siRNA has been introduced into the melanoma cells using lipofection to investigate the proposed amount of gene down <b>regulation</b> (<b>light</b> activity). Recordings take place at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Continuing research is necessary to validate results. siRNAs are usually introduced into cells through non-specific techniques like poly-cationic transfection or lipofection. However, peptide mediated siRNA delivery is brand new to the field. Wild-type α-MSH is a peptide that is implicated in the regulation of skin pigmentation for which the receptors are present in human melanoma cell lines. However, these α-MSH peptides are broken down and metabolized by enzymes in the body within a few minutes. An α-MSH analog named NDPMSH is able to resist the metabolic processes of the body as well as selectively bind to the melanoma receptors. This molecule targets the Melanocortin 1 receptor on the melanoma cell lines and is internalized (Chen et. Al 688). This peptide, when linked to the siRNA, can theoretically be delivered selectively to melanoma cells and inhibit gene expression. The long -term goal of this research project is to use the NDPMSH peptide to usher the siRNA to melanoma tumor cells in vivo, causing them to undergo apoptosis...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{increase}} {{in the amount of}} oil and natural gas exploration due to fuel reserves that were once inaccessible in North America becoming available through methods such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. However, these methods of exploration generate substantial amounts of oil contaminated waste which pose significant pollution risks of which current methods of treatment are slow and ineffective. This project aims to design a better operating process for use with Anaerobic Thermal Desorption Units (ATDU) that are currently manufactured by RLC Technologies which offer more environmentally safe and quick processing of such wastes. Current methods used to treat oil contaminated waste include land farming and deep well injection. These methods in essence leave the oils on or in the ground that has raised concern regarding land and groundwater pollution. These methods are practiced due their lack of regulation and little cost investment. RLC provides a waste treatment service that is currently more cost efficient {{than the rest of the}} current market for thermal desorption plants. Through success of this project, a more cost effective method can be offered by RLC Technologies that can be competitive with the current <b>regulation</b> <b>light</b> methods in practice. The focus of the project is on aiding RLC in the utilization of their ATDU for their plant operations. In order to do so, the team will study the effects of drum rotation speed, temperature, and waste composition on waste materials from drill cuttings and (remove!) synthetically created waste on a bench and pilot scale sized batch ATDU. The data collected will be used for determining the thermal efficiency by analyzing how much of the base oils are collected. The desired outcomes are to improve the oil recovery of the current ADTU capabilities by at least ten percent while reducing costs associated with it’s operation. There will be efforts to increase the amounts of the diesel ranged oils in the recovered product through controlling the thermal cracking in the ADTU. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} no studies {{of the effects of}} soil P {{deficiency}} on pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) photosynthesis, despite the fact that P deficiency is the majorxonstraint to pearl millet production in most regions of West Africa. Because current photosynthesis-based crop simulation models do not explicitly take into account P deficiency effects on leaf photosynthesis, they cannot predict millet growth without extensive calibration. We studied the effects of soil addition on leaf P content, photosynthetic rate (A), and whole-plant dry matter production (DM) of non-water-stressed, 28 d pearl millet plants grown in pots containing 6. 00 kg of a P-deficient soil. As soil P addition increased from 0 to 155. 2 mg P kg- 1 soil, leaf P content increased from 0. 65 to 7. 0 g kg- 1. Both A and DM had maximal values near 51. 7 mg P kg- 1 soil, which corresponded to a leaf P content of 3. 2 g kg- 1. Within this range of soil P addition, the slope of A plotted against stomatal conductance (gs) tripled, and mean leaf internal CO 2 concentration ([CC^];) decreased from 260 to 92 pL L '., thus indicating that P deficiency limited A through metabolic dysfunction rather than stomatal <b>regulation.</b> <b>Light</b> response curves of A, which changed markedly with P leaf content, were modelled as a single substrate, Michaelis-Menten reaction, using quantum flux as the substrate for each level of soil P addition. An Eadie-Hofstee plot of light response data revealed that both Km, which is mathematically equivalent to quantum efficiency, and Vmax, which is the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis, increased sharply from leaf P contents of 0. 6 to 3 g kg- 1, with peak values between 4 and 5 g P kg- 1. Polynomial equations relating Km and Vmax, to leaf P content offered a simple and attractive way of modelling photosynthetic light response for plants of different P status, but this approach is somewhat complicated by the decrease of leaf P content with ontogeny...|$|E
40|$|Species of the dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium are {{prominent}} producers of saxitoxin and its analogs, known as paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), {{which are the}} causative agents of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Under certain environmental conditions, some species of the genus Alexandrium can proliferate and form harmful algal blooms (HABs). In this study, a real time PCR assay was developed {{and a set of}} suitable reference genes was tested to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the class II aminotransferase (sxtA 4) putatively involved in saxitoxin synthesis, during growth in batch culture of Alexandrium catenella. No significant changes in transcript abundance of sxtA 4 were detected at different growth rates. The phylogenetic analysis of sxtA 4 and the comparison of cDNA and gDNA copies of sxtA 4 revealed that preferential transcription of high GC genomic DNA copies of sxtA 4, {{may play a role in}} its transcriptional <b>regulation.</b> <b>Light</b> plays a key role in the regulation of cell division, synchronized by the circadian rhythm and is therefore likely to be a major regulator of the signalling pathways leading to the development of toxic blooms. Light penetrates the water column with varying intensities and qualities, which impact the regulation of cell proliferation and nutritional status of microalgae. Light quality was shown to be a major regulator of PST production. Alexandrium catenella Group IV produced significantly higher amounts of the PSTs when grown in red and white light in comparison to blue light. Biotic factors which can influence PST production include the bacterial communities associated with Alexandrium. In this study, bacterial communities associated with toxic and non-toxic Alexandrium tamarense Group V strains were studied via PCR-based 454 pyrosequencing. The strains displayed a similar microbial diversity when analyzed on the family level, in both cases dominanted by the Rhodobacteraceae family, but differed on the genus and species level. The Rhodobacteraceae associated with the toxic strain were closely related to Thalassobacter genus, while the Rhodobacteraceae associated with the non-toxic Alexandrium were closer related to the genus Loktanella. Several orders with lower abundance such as Rhizobiales and Sphingomonadales were also identified in both strains. The novel molecular approaches implicated in this study are excellent tools complementing traditional methods in the investigation of the capacity and regulation of PST production of toxic Alexandrium strains. This work has shown that an integrative approach of molecular and traditional methods, as well as the combined investigation of biotic and abiotic fators are promising to further elucidate the evolution of PST production capacity in dinoflagellates...|$|E
