Nowadays by motorizing development are producers specialized for tire properties parameterize. This fact is necessary to satisfy the improving subtlety of <b>requirements</b> <b>on</b> <b>tyre</b> component properties, not only in dependence of season but also its region, car model, car axle type, case of axle suspension and {{last but not least}} especially customers requirements. Ways to satisfy requirements are various and consequently different costly. They lead from basic research of raw materials and its combination, through the most often applied research and chemism development to the economize case – parameters configuring of curing process. The work deals with find out the dependency between parameter differences of vulcanization process and final dimensional – deformation tyre parameters...|$|R
40|$|During {{the winter}} 1993 / 94, the Swedish National Road Administration {{received}} considerable criticism for its winter maintenance {{and in particular}} for the high consumption if road salt. This led to discussions on changing the rules for winter maintenance. Some ice or snow was temporary allowed on the roads with high winter maintenance standard. More roads were degraded to lower winter maintenance standard where ice or snow were permanently permitted. In addition, certain changes intended to influence driver behaviour and vehicle equipment for example mandating the use of winter tyres were to be studied. The purpose of the first investigation described in this paper was to calculate the socio-economic consequences that may be expected from a <b>requirement</b> <b>on</b> winter <b>tyres</b> in various circumstances. In the second investigation in this paper the traffic safety effect of the requirement is studied. A requirement of using winter tyres when it is slippery was selected based on facts from the first investigation...|$|R

The tyre cooling patents are separated into five functional groups and reviews are made based on practicality and potential for significant heat transfer. This analysis has made it evident that potential cooling effectiveness is often compromised by practicality of an invention. The patents deemed to have the most potential for cooling are those which incorporate a working fluid which undergoes a phase change to transfer heat between different regions of the wheel assembly. Finally, these inventions are also related to current research projects which aim to develop a new cooling technique and extend the working life of earthmoving tyres...|$|R
