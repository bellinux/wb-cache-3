40|$|The Italian {{pianist and}} pedagogue Vicente Scaramuzza {{has become one}} of the most {{prominent}} musical figures in Argentina. His students achieved international recognition and his school of piano playing is still being passed on by his former students. My piano teacher in Buenos Aires, Nilda Somma, studied for fourteen years under his supervision, and shared with me his annotations, fingerings, and <b>re-distributions</b> (it is important to point out that decades ago, redistributing notes between both hands in certain passages was not a controversial practice). ^ Among Vicente Scaramuzza 2 ̆ 7 s most renowned students are Martha Argerich, Bruno Gelber, Enrique Barenboim (who later taught his son Daniel), Nilda Somma, Antonio de Raco, Sylvia Kersenbaum, Daniel Rivera, Daniel Levy, and Cristina Viñas. ^ Only one book has been published about Vicente Scaramuzza 2 ̆ 7 s approach to piano technique and tone production. Enseñanzas de un gran Maestro, written by his former student Maria Rosa Oubiña de Castro, provides detailed explanations and illustrations of his unique approach. ^ During lessons, Vicente Scaramuzza would circle a problematic passage and then, in a separate notebook write a full explanation of the necessary steps to solve the issue. My former piano teacher, Nilda Somma, kept her notebooks with Scaramuzza 2 ̆ 7 s annotations, in addition to scores with fingerings and <b>re-distributions.</b> A closer examination of these invaluable materials will help shed light on the musical intelligence and technical mastery of Scaramuzza. ^ The most distinctive characteristic of his school of piano playing is the strong connection between awareness of the anatomy of the hand, <b>re-distributions,</b> tone production, and musical goals. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main concern}} that {{joins us in}} this {{workshop}} is income and consumption inequality, in particular, the w ll being of the poor (poverty), or less fortunate (unlucky-risk) in society. I {{have been asked to}} make some reflections regarding risk and its relationship with poverty. I will start by discussing poverty and risk at a general level using the conceptual framework of the recently developed dynamic contract theory. Then, I will argue that this conceptual framework provides an excellent tool to design and evaluate social insurance schemes. I will illustrate this point with the particular problem of unemployment insurance design, a problem I have been working in for the last several years. Consider two alternative two-peri d models useful to think about equilibrium income distributions and the relationship between efficiency and ex-post <b>re-distributions.</b> The first one is a model with different preferences over leisure. Thus, those with a lower marginal utility of leisure will work harder, and in equilibrium will have higher income and consumption. In this deterministic world, the solution to a Pareto problem with the competitive equilibrium weights does not require any ex-post redistribution 2. This is hardly surprising, since the first welfare theorem applies. The second one is a model with identical preferences and endowment shocks realized in the second period. If there are no contingent markets, the equilibrium will also be characterized by a non-degenerated distribution of income and consumption. In this case, as the first welfare theorem does not hold, there are efficient ex-post <b>re-distributions.</b> This is the case even considering the Pareto weights that replicate the competitive equilibrium. In fact, efficient ex-post <b>re-distributions</b> are the ones that make the variance of consumption equal to zero. 1 DO NOT QUOTE.

25|$|Thus arose {{a popular}} {{movement}} for land <b>re-distribution,</b> which dominated Roman {{politics in the}} period after 150 BC. An especially powerful constituency demanding reform were legionary veterans, discharged after many years campaigning outside Italy. These were typically the sons of small tenant farmers, who often returned to find their ancestral plot taken over by a big landowner. Their cause was championed by populist politicians, most notably Tiberius Gracchus. The movement aimed to re-possess public lands held by wealthy individuals, by limiting the amount any individual could hold.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} the {{underlying}} factor was the <b>re-distribution</b> of Roman state-owned land (ager publicus). The Roman economy was overwhelmingly agricultural (over 80% of people lived and worked on farms) and thus rights over land were the foremost determinant of wealth. The growth in the Roman and Italian population led to ever greater hunger for land. In turn, this led to pressure for <b>re-distribution</b> of the ager publicus. This was the land confiscated from defeated Italian states but not allocated to Latin colonies. It was held as a public asset and rented out to Roman tenant farmers. Over time, the number of small plots diminished as they were acquired by big landowners, both Roman and allied Italians, who fenced off large tracts of pasture-land and loaned small farmers money and then seized their plots when {{they were unable to}} pay the debt, due to a variety of factors. The growth of large landed estates (latifundia) was accompanied by the displacement of citizen-farmers by large gangs of slaves, who supplied much cheaper labour. This was considered undesirable by even many senators, as it shrank the recruitment-base of the legions, whose backbone were small farmers (slaves were excluded from military service). In addition, Italian small farmers had occupied much public land.|$|E

25|$|The Social Credit {{government}} {{did away with}} the Instant-runoff voting system, {{that had been in}} place in the rural constituencies, and the Single Transferable Vote system in Edmonton and Calgary, both of which had been in place since 1924. The move was made to standardize and simplify voting results across the province. Under single transferable vote and instant-runoff voting, results would take up to five days to count all the possible vote transfers, before anyone was declared elected. This was especially problematic, in Edmonton that elected seven members. As well, the government in 1955 had lost a few members in rural constituencies due to IRV, when they had received the largest portion of the vote in the constituency but were not elected to the seat after <b>re-distribution</b> of the ballots in the second round.

25|$|About 1655 {{the county}} was mapped under the Down Survey. The county was also {{covered by the}} Civil Survey, which was {{conducted}} 1654–56 (but which recorded land ownership in 1640–41). These surveys were conducted to aid the confiscation and <b>re-distribution</b> of lands. The lands of the Irish and Anglo-Normans were confiscated and given to Cromwell's soldiers as payment for their service in the Parliamentarian Army. In other counties Adventurers were allotted lands, but the lands in County Wexford were to go primarily to soldiers. It was only the landowners who were ordered west of the Shannon and who went into exile on the Continent – the ordinary people were allowed to stay on in their homes to serve as tenants for their new landlords. However, many soldiers (though not all) sold their lands almost immediately. Cromwell's death in 1658 meant {{that some of the}} grants of land that he had made were cancelled and a small number of the old proprietors were restored to their estates under Charles II. Other beneficiaries were Charles II's supporters, especially those who had helped 'restore' him to the English throne. All this is borne out by the Books of Survey and Distribution. More dispossessions were made when James II was defeated and dethroned, {{near the end of the}} 17th century, primarily the lands of his supporters. It was at Duncannon, in the south-west of the county that James II, after his defeat at the Boyne, embarked for Kinsale and then to exile in France.|$|E

The effects of a long incumbency bolstered by the cumulative effects of a number of <b>re-distributions</b> limited Labor's losses to nine seats. In several of these the margin of defeat was less than 300 votes. In the final result the Coalition had 47 seats, one short of a majority. However, it could rely on the support of two conservative independents--Douglas Darby, a former Liberal who was subsequently readmitted to the party room, and Harold Coates, who had won the seat of Hartley.

40|$|The {{analysis}} and behaviour of transfer beams that support in-plane loaded shear walls have been receiving added emphasis owing to their importance {{in connection with}} the design of tall buildings. In this paper, {{analysis and}} structural behaviour of transfer beams supporting in-plane loaded shear walls are presented, where emphasis is placed on the interaction between the transfer beam and the supported shear wall. The interaction effect is shown to cause significant stress <b>re-distributions</b> both in the transfer beam and in the shear wall within an interactive zone. Parameters that significantly influence the structural behaviour and force transfer mechanism are also highlighted. Based on finite element analysis, interaction-based design tables are constructed and presented for the design of the transfer beam-shear wall system, which is represented by an equivalent portal frame. The design tables have been shown to provide practising engineers a very simple and efficient, yet accurate, means of analysis of the internal forces of the transfer beams and the support columns.

40|$|Layered {{transition}} metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, i. e. 1 T-TiSe_ 2 and 2 H-NbSe_ 2, harbor a second order charge density wave (CDW) transition where phonons {{play a key}} role for the periodic modulations of conduction electron densities and associated lattice distortions. We systematically study the transport and capacitance characteristics over a wide temperature range of Schottky barriers formed by intimately contacting freshly exfoliated flakes of 1 T-TiSe_ 2 and 2 H-NbSe_ 2 to n-type GaAs semiconductor substrates. The extracted temperature-dependent parameters (zero-bias barrier height, ideality and built-in potential) reflect changes at the TMD/GaAs interface induced by CDW formation for both TMD materials. The measured built-in potential reveals chemical-potential shifts relating to CDW formation. With decreasing temperature a peak in the chemical-potential shifts during CDW evolution indicates a competition between electron energy <b>re-distributions</b> and a combination of lattice strain energies and Coulomb interactions. These modulations of chemical potential in CDW systems, such as 1 T-TiSe_ 2 and 2 H-NbSe_ 2 harboring second-order phase transitions, reflect a corresponding conversion from short to long-range order.

Our revised estimate of ~ 450 Tg N yr- 1 (Tg = 1012 g) produces an oceanic fixed N budget with a large deficit (~ 200 Tg N yr- 1) that can be explained only by positing an ocean that has deviated far from a steady-state, {{the need for a}} major upwards revision of fixed N inputs, particularly nitrogen fixation, or both. Oceanic denitrification can be significantly altered by small <b>re-distributions</b> of carbon and dissolved oxygen. Since fixed N is a limiting nutrient, uncompensated changes in denitrification affect the ocean´s ability to sequester atmospheric CO 2 via the "biological pump". We have also had to modify our concepts of the oceanic N 2 O regime to take better account of the extremely high N 2 O saturations that can arise in productive, low oxygen waters. Recent results from the western Indian Shelf during a period when hypoxic, suboxic and anoxic waters were present produced a maximum surface N 2 O saturation of > 8000 %, a likely consequence of "stop and go" denitrification.

Aims To estimate the density, phenology, breeding success and diet of Black Kites in Delhi. Methods During 2013, Black Kite nests were surveyed in 24 plots of 1 km 2 distributed throughout Delhi. A sample of 151 nests was checked regularly to record laying date, breeding success and diet. Results The average density was 15 nests/km 2. The majority of nests were on trees (91 %) and the rest on artificial structures. Mean laying date was 31 January and the laying season was protracted over four months. Mean number of fledged young was 0. 73, 1. 09 and 1. 53 per territorial, breeding and successful pair. Diet was dominated by scavenged meat and by rats, pigeons and doves abundant in the city. Conclusions Density has been stable since 1960 - 1970 s and probably represents the highest ever recorded for a raptor. This is probably promoted by a combination of (i) availability of rubbish, (ii) few predators and (iii) high tolerance by people. The conservation status of this raptor seems satisfactory, but removal of mature trees for rapid development may result in local declines or <b>re-distributions,</b> suggesting the need for continued monitoring. © 2014 British Trust for Ornithology.
