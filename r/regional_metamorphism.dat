500|$|In {{extensive}} {{regions of}} the Slave province of northern Canada, the magma that later became batholiths heated the surrounding rock to create metamorphic regions called aureoles about 2,575million years ago. These regions are typically [...] wide. The creation of aureoles was a continuous process, but three recognizable metamorphic phases can be correlated with established deformational phases. The cycle began with a deformation phase unaccompanied by metamorphism. This evolved into the second phase accompanied by broad <b>regional</b> <b>metamorphism</b> as thermal doming began. With continued updoming of the isotherms, the third phase produced minor folding but caused major metamorphic recrystallization, resulting in the emplacement of granite {{at the core of}} the thermal dome. This phase occurred at lower pressure because of erosional unloading, but the temperatures were more extreme, ranging up to about [...] With deformation complete, the thermal dome decayed; minor mineralogical changes occurred during this decay phase. The region has since been effectively stable.|$|E
40|$|Ultrahigh {{temperature}} (UHT) metamorphism is {{the most}} thermally extreme form of <b>regional</b> crustal <b>metamorphism,</b> with temperatures exceeding 900  °C. UHT crustal metamorphism is recognised in more than 50 localities globally in the metamorphic rock record and is accepted as ‘normal’ in the spectrum of regional crustal processes. UHT metamorphism is typically identified {{on the basis of}} diagnostic mineral assemblages such as sapphirine + quartz, orthopyroxene + sillimanite ± quartz and osumilite in Mg–Al-rich rock compositions, now usually coupled with pseudosection-based thermobarometry using internally-consistent thermodynamic data sets and/or Al-in-Orthopyroxene and ternary feldspar thermobarometry. Significant progress in the understanding of <b>regional</b> UHT <b>metamorphism</b> in recent years includes: (1) development of a ferric iron activity–composition thermodynamic model for sapphirine, allowing phase diagram calculations for oxidised rock compositions; (2) quantification of UHT conditions via trace element thermometry, with Zr-in-rutile more commonly recording higher temperatures than Ti-in-zircon. Rutile is likely to be stable at peak UHT conditions whereas zircon may only grow as UHT rocks are cooling. In addition, the extent to which Zr diffuses out of rutile is controlled by chemical communication with zircon; (3) more fully recognising and utilising temperature-dependent thermal properties of the crust, and the possible range of heat sources causing metamorphism in geodynamic modelling studies; (4) recognising that crust partially melted either in a previous event or earlier in a long-duration event has greater capacity than fertile, unmelted crust to achieve UHT conditions due to the heat energy consumed by partial melting reactions; (5) more strongly linking U–Pb geochronological data from zircon and monazite to P–T points or path segments through using Y + REE partitioning between accessory and major phases, as well as phase diagrams incorporating Zr and REE; and (6) improved insight into the settings and factors responsible for UHT metamorphism via geodynamic forward models. These models suggest that <b>regional</b> UHT <b>metamorphism</b> is, principally, geodynamically related to subduction, coupled with elevated crustal radiogenic heat generation rates...|$|R

40|$|Published online 22 December 2016. The Southern Granulite terrane, {{southern}} India, comprises a vast {{exposure of}} deep crust and forms a key {{region in the}} reconstruction of the Gondwana supercontinent. An E-W–trending crustal-scale shear zone, the Palghat-Cauvery suture zone system, which formed during the late Neoproterozoic–Cambrian (0. 75 – 0. 50 Ga), marks a prominent terrane boundary separating terranes with a predominantly late Neoarchean (ca. 2. 5 Ga) <b>regional</b> granulite <b>metamorphism</b> to the north from those with an Ediacaran–Cambrian (0. 63 – 0. 50 Ga) <b>regional</b> granulite <b>metamorphism</b> to the south. Focusing on the younger granulite metamorphic domains, we present here new zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions for 11 charnockite orthogneisses from the Madurai, Trivandrum, and Nagercoil blocks and contribute to the resolution of the age of their magmatic protoliths. This study shows that the charnockite orthogneisses south of the Palghat-Cauvery suture zone relate to a minimum of four distinct episodes of felsic magmatism centered at: ca. 2. 62 – 2. 46 Ga, ca. 2. 05 – 1. 84 Ga, ca. 1. 0 – 0. 9 Ga, and ca. 0. 80 – 0. 76 Ga, pertaining to the Siderian, Orosirian, and Tonian Periods. Hafnium isotope analyses of zircon grains from the charnockite gneisses suggest that the protoliths of the ca. 2. 05 – 1. 98 Ga gneisses from the Trivandrum and Nagercoil blocks and the ca. 1. 0 – 0. 9 Ga gneisses along the southeastern Madurai block involved a significant juvenile magma component, while the protoliths of charnockite gneisses elsewhere in the Madurai block formed mainly through recycling of older crust up to ca. 3. 2 Ga. A regional granulite-facies metamorphic imprint during the Ediacaran–Cambrian marked an advanced stage in the amalgamation of the Madurai, Trivandrum, and Nagercoil blocks into the East African orogen and its collision with the Dharwar craton.

40|$|Blueschists were {{discovered}} in the metamorphic rocks of the Medvednica mountain. Two varieties of blueschists are recognised, one with garnets and another with omphacite. Determined mineral associations are composed of sodic amphibole (glaucophane and crossite), garnet, omphacite and white mica. These mineral associations indicate metamorphic conditions which are transitional between blueschist and eclogite facies, i. e. high pressures at relatively moderate temperatures (LG, HP/LT). Such conditions are often characteristic of subduction zones. The occurrence of high-pressure metamorphic rocks in the Medvednica mountain, together with local outcrops of ultramafic rocks (serpentinised harzburgite, dunite and serpentinite) indicate subduction related rocks of the Dinaric part of the Tethyan oceanic crust.
