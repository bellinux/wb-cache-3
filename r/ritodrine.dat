30|$|<b>Ritodrine</b> is a β 2 -mimetic and {{commonly}} used for management of preterm labor.

However, in the present case, hyperkalemia occurred 1  h after cessation of <b>ritodrine.</b> Vanishing β 2 -stimulation following cessation of <b>ritodrine</b> conversely increases efflux of potassium from the cells to increase plasma potassium levels. Indeed, there are several similar case reports revealing hyperkalemia following cessation of <b>ritodrine</b> in parturients [3 – 7]. In addition, in the present case, surgical stress with massive bleeding could reduce insulin secretion and induce insulin resistance by increases in catecholamine and cortisol release.

Case Report: A 34 -year-old woman with twin pregnancy was treated with <b>ritodrine</b> for preterm uterine contractions at 27 weeks and 6 days gestation.

40|$|Management of preterm labor {{involves}} the use of tocolytic drugs to inhibit preterm uterine contractions. This study compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous administration of atosiban and <b>ritodrine</b> in the treatment of spontaneous preterm labor. Methods: A randomized study was conducted in pregnant women of Chinese origin in Taiwan with threatened preterm delivery. Patients were randomized to receive either atosiban (n = 23) or <b>ritodrine</b> (n = 22). Tocolytic efficacy of the drug was assessed as the proportion of women who did not deliver and did not need alternative tocolytic treatment at 7 days after therapy initiation. Safety of the drugs was assessed as the number of adverse events or neonatal morbidity. Results: The number of women who did not deliver and did not require alternative tocolytic therapy at 7 days was similar between the atosiban and <b>ritodrine</b> groups. There were no serious adverse events, but maternal cardiovascular adverse events, particularly tachycardia, occurred significantly more in women treated with <b>ritodrine</b> (0 % atosiban vs. 18. 18 % <b>ritodrine,</b> p < 0. 05).

This study included 215 preterm infants born to women treated with and without <b>ritodrine</b> hydrochloride. CK, LDH, and amylase levels in the umbilical blood at delivery were determined. Infants were divided according to the <b>ritodrine</b> tocolysis, as follows: Group A (n= 91), not exposed to ritodrine; Group B (n= 44), IV <b>ritodrine</b> for < 1 week; Group C (n= 80), IV <b>ritodrine</b> for ≥ 1 week. The CK concentration in cord blood of Group C (198. 8 ± 14. 2 [*]IU/L) was significantly higher in comparison with Group A (155. 0 ± 7. 3 [*]IU/L, P< 0. 05). There was no significant difference in LDH and amylase levels in the three groups. The CK significantly correlated with gestational age (r= 0. 42, P< 0. 01) and birth weight (r= 0. 38, P< 0. 01). LDH and amylase levels did not change with gestational age nor birth weight. In conclusion, long-term <b>ritodrine</b> tocolysis leads to increased umbilical blood CK level...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate, in vivo and in vitro, the {{influence}} of <b>ritodrine</b> and oxytocin on the placental release of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and placental lactogen (HPL). The in-vivo study was performed on maternal sera collected before and 1 h after the onset of either <b>ritodrine</b> treatment (50 micrograms i. v. /min; administered to 15 women at risk of premature labour) or oxytocin infusion (2 mU i. v. /min; administered to 21 women for acceleration of slow labour). The in-vitro study was performed on human term placental explants incubated in the presence of 4 - 400 ng ritodrine/ml or 15 - 1500 microU oxytocin/ml. HCG and HPL were measured by radioimmunoassay on maternal sera and incubation media. Maternal circulating concentrations of HCG and HPL remained unaffected after 1 h of <b>ritodrine</b> or oxytocin treatment. The in-vitro release of HCG and HPL by placental explants was not modified when <b>ritodrine</b> or oxytocin was added to the incubation media. The lack of influence of <b>ritodrine</b> and oxytocin on the placental secretion of HCG and HPL suggests that beta 2 -adrenergic and oxytocin receptors are not involved in the releasing process.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the hemodynamic and {{metabolic}} changes after <b>ritodrine</b> and nifedipine tocolysis. Methods: For an open randomized study, patients with preterm labor (N = 185) were allocated to groups to receive <b>ritodrine</b> intravenously (N = 90) or nifedipine orally (N = 95). Results: The mean diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the <b>ritodrine</b> group 24 h (65 +/- 12 vs. 70 +/- 8, P= 0. 001) and 48 h (65 +/- 12 vs. 71 +/- 8, P= 0. 004) after starting tocolysis compared with the nifedipine group. Mean maternal heart rate was significantly higher in the <b>ritodrine</b> group 24 h (105 +/- 17 vs. 86 +/- 13, P < 0. 0001) and 48 h (100 +/- 21 vs. 85 +/- 12, P < 0. 0001) after starting tocolysis compared with the nifedipine group. Mean fasting glucose levels were higher (6. 68 +/- 2. 53 vs. 4. 93 +/- 1. 23, P = 0. 0016), while mean potassium levels were lower (3. 52 +/- 0. 84 vs. 3. 81 +/- 0. 45, P = 0. 04) in the <b>ritodrine</b> group 48 h after starting tocolysis compared with the nifedipine group. Conclusions: Use of nifedipine for preterm labor is associated with a lower incidence of adverse hemodynamic and metabolic changes compared with <b>ritodrine</b> after 24 and 48 h of tocolysis. In our opinion nifedipine is the preferred drug of choice for the treatment of preterm labor. (C) 2003 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

40|$|The {{action of}} the uterine relaxant <b>ritodrine</b> on placental, myometrial and cardiac blood pools has been {{examined}} during spontaneous and oxytocin-induced uterine activity. 113 mIndium was injected intravenously and the blood pools were measured by recording gamma-activity externally. After i. v. injection of <b>Ritodrine,</b> the typical blood pool changes in labor were inhibited. Thereafter, placental and myometrial blood pools increased more than due to inhibition of labor alone. Simultaneously, there was a corresponding decrease in cardiac blood pool indicating an increase in cardiac output. The rapid inflow {{of blood in the}} uteroplacental region after <b>Ritodrine</b> indicates an improved hemodynamic situation. This action could be of benefit in emergency situations in a hyperactive ischaemic uterus during labor...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{pregnancy}} is a condition in which plasma magnesium falls because of accumulation of the ion in the placenta and fetus. Magnesium (Mg) is therefore widely given as a supplement during pregnancy, particularly in cases of preterm labour. In our experience, the combination of oral Mg (magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid) at a dose of 360 mg/day with conventional <b>ritodrine</b> treatment allows a reduction in <b>ritodrine</b> dosage, accompanied by a significant reduction in side effects. We therefore evaluated changes in fetal blood flow, using pulsed Doppler, in women submitted to combined magnesium and <b>ritodrine</b> treatment compared to those treated with <b>ritodrine</b> plus placebo. The Mg-treated group showed a decrease in vessel resistance both in the umbilical artery and in the fetal middle cerebral artery, indicating that fetal vasculature is sensitive to exogenous Mg. Measurement of plasma and mononuclear cell Mg showed an intracellular increase in the cation of about 10 per cent. We conclude that oral magnesium supplementation in pregnancy is safe and that it has a positive effect on the fetal circulation...|$|E
