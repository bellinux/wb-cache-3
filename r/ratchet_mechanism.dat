50|$|Trailer winches are {{designed}} to load (or unload) boats and other cargo to and from a trailer. They {{are made up of}} a <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> and cable. The handle on the <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> is turned to tighten or loosen the tension on the winch cable. There are both manual and motorized trailer winches.The winch is normally found {{on the front of the}} trailer by the towing A frame.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ratchet</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which {{prevents}} the spool from rotating {{when there is}} tension on the line. this prevents inadvertent unreeling of line, as the ratchet lever must {{be held in the}} open position to allow unwinding. The <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> is usually a ratchet wheel on the spool which engages with a spring-loaded pawl which can either be held open by a trigger lever, or clipped open by a knob or lever on the handle. The ratchet allows the spool to be manually rotated to wind in line when engaged.|$|E
5000|$|A freehub {{is a type}} of bicycle hub that {{incorporates}} a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and the name freehub is a registered trademark of Shimano. A set of sprockets (called a [...] "cassette") are mounted onto a splined shaft of the freehub to engage the chain. The <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is a part of the}} hub, in contrast to a freewheel, an older technology, which contains both the sprockets and a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism</b> in a single unit separate from the hub. In many high-end and midrange bicycles, freehubs have replaced freewheel systems.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ratchet</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications, {{including}} these: ...|$|R
50|$|A {{latching}} relay uses a solenoid to actuate a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{that keeps the}} relay closed even if power to the relay is terminated.|$|R
50|$|The Unified Crew Hatch (UCH) {{measured}} 29 in high, 34 in wide, {{and weighed}} 225 lb. It was {{operated by a}} pump handle, which drove a <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> to open or close fifteen latches simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} {{used was}} that of a derringer, with four fixed barrels. The linear hammer and its integral firing pin rotated within a fixed breechblock behind these barrels. The lock action was driven by a central coil spring around the hammer rotation axis, cocked by the <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> that rotated the hammer after each shot. This <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism,</b> although only visible when the hammer was stripped and removed, bore some relation to the cylinder of the Webley-Fosbery self-loading revolver or even some retractable ballpoint pens. A similar rotating hammer in a 4-barrel breech was later used by Hillberg in the COP [...]357 Derringer. Reloading was in the usual derringer fashion, by the barrels tipping forward on a hinge ahead of the breech block.|$|E
50|$|Most iron {{hands are}} based on the same {{constructive}} principles, although there are considerable differences in complexity. Fingers can be flexed passively (for example using the healthy hand) and are locked in place by a <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism,</b> similar to those of contemporary flintlocks. Extension of the fingers works by spring pressure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chain gear}} {{sprockets}} wear {{faster than the}} <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Replacing individual sprockets on a freehub cassette is easy compared to that on some freewheels.|$|R
50|$|Cassettes are {{distinguished}} from freewheels in that a cassette has {{a series of}} straight splines that form the mechanical connection between the sprockets and the cassette compatible hub, called a freehub, which contains the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The entire cassette is held on the hub {{by means of a}} threaded lockring. Some cassette systems from the late 1980s and early 1990s use a threaded small sprocket to hold on the larger splined sprockets. Cassettes resemble freewheels when installed, but are clearly different when removed as they do not contain a freewheel's internal <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R

50|$|Similarly an {{electromagnetic}} <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> can be {{used with}} a linear screw actuator so that the drive system lifting a load will lock in position when power to the actuator is turned off. To lower the actuator, an electromagnet is used to counteract the spring force and unlock the ratchet.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A Polyphon {{is a large}} disk-operated music box. The plectra {{stick out}} from the {{backside}} of the disk; as the disk rotates they contact a <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> that in turn plucks the tines. A large sounding board amplifies the sound. Many interchangeable disks would be available for producing favorite melodies.|$|E
50|$|In another type, {{a ratchet}} relay has a <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{that holds the}} {{contacts}} closed after the coil is momentarily energized. A second impulse, in the same or a separate coil, releases the contacts. This type {{may be found in}} certain cars, for headlamp dipping and other functions where alternating operation on each switch actuation is needed.|$|E
50|$|A lever {{attached}} to a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism</b> was used to rotate the cylinder. A spring-loaded dog would slip into recesses in the cylinder, holding it in the correct position for firing.|$|R
50|$|Ratchet {{fasteners}} are {{the most}} complex of the three fasteners to thread, but offer advantages in taking up the slack in the webbing and tensioning the assembly. Once the webbing is threaded through the fastener, the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism</b> is employed {{to take up the}} slack and tension the assembly to the necessary level. The <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism</b> functions similarly to a socket wrench; you open and close the fastener repeatedly to pull the webbing through the fastener. Releasing the tension is a simple matter of depressing the release lever and pulling the webbing back through the fastener.|$|R
40|$|Seismic damage-resistant structures, such as jointed precast {{connections}} and rocking wall structures, usually require supplementary energy dissipation devices to limit peak displacements. Yielding steel fuses or buckling restrained braces (BRBs) can provide energy dissipation {{but have a}} tendency to create residual compressive forces after joint closing that can resist the re-centring of the structure and fight the post-tensioning forces on subsequent cycles. A ratcheting, tension-only device has been developed to offer resistance to loading in tension, while offering negligible resistance to compressive motion, and can be used in conjunction with a range of energy dissipation mechanisms. This lack of compressive forces allows re-seating of a rocking connection to minimise residual structural displacements. Upon re-loading, fuse engagement will be more rapid due to the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism,</b> as the absence of residual compressive loads reduces the amount of elastic take-up before yielding occurs. A tension-only solution also removes the requirement for buckling restraint to be designed into the fuse element. Two prototype <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been designed and experimentally tested in an MTS- 810 test machine with fuses providing a yield force of 45 kN and an ultimate tensile force of 65 kN. Experimental proof-of-concept testing on fourteen fuse elements demonstrated the function of the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and assessed the hysteretic behaviour of each system. The influence of tooth pitch is investigated experimentally, varying from 3 - 40 mm in the different prototypes...|$|R
50|$|Classic style rollerskis {{usually have}} wide wheels to improve balance and better {{simulate}} classic ski technique. The wheel diameter is often less than 75mm {{to reduce the}} overall weight of the rollerskis. A <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> is installed in either the front or rear wheel of each classic rollerski to allow uni-directional travel and simulate propulsion from classic ski strides on snow. The non-ratcheted wheel on each classic rollerski is free-rolling.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{known as}} the freehub body, is still {{replaceable}} on most hubs, but forms a structural part of the hub. Cassette systems have a major advantage in that the drive-side axle bearing can be out near the frame, rather than being back towards {{the centre of the}} axle behind the freewheel. This greatly reduces the stress on the rear axle, making bent or broken axles extremely rare.|$|E
5000|$|Clamping {{pressure}} is applied either through a mechanical method {{such as a}} screw or <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> that tightens the band, or through the elastic nature of the band material itself. There are a range of styles of band clamp available for purchase, in particular the type used for framing as described above. In addition to these, many other items may be put {{to use as a}} band clamp. These include: ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{probabilistic}} SBRA Method {{application to the}} model of the behaviour of the lithosphere of the Earth. The method extends our initial work where we created the geomechanical model of the lithosphere. The basic idea was about the generation of thermoelastic waves due to thermal expansion of the rock mass and the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R
50|$|Turnstiles {{often use}} <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{to allow the}} {{rotation}} of the stile in one direction allowing ingress but preventing rotation in the other direction. They are often designed to operate only after a payment has been made, usually by inserting a coin or token in a slot; or by swiping, tapping, or inserting a paper ticket or electronically-encoded card.|$|R
2500|$|Some cranksets {{have been}} {{produced}} that incorporate a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism</b> to accommodate coasting. In this case, the chain continues to rotate with the rear wheel when the rider stops pedaling. [...] The ultimate goal of freewheeling cranks is to allow the rider to shift the chain while coasting. [...] Shimano's discontinued FF system (Front Freewheeling) {{is one of the}} more commonly seen examples.|$|R
50|$|The Whitehead gag --invented in 1877 by Walter Whitehead (1840-1913), {{a surgeon}} in Manchester, Englandhttp://www.adair.at/eng/museum/equipment/mouthgags/whitehead.htm-- {{consists}} of two hinged metal frames that wrap around {{the front of the}} patient's head and which have sections bent to fit between the front teeth. When spread apart, the frames separate the jaws, holding the mouth open. The desired degree of separation is set and maintained by a <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{on each side of the}} frame.|$|E
5000|$|The {{method of}} track {{tensioning}} is a commonly noted difference. Initially, the design based on A24 Cavalier used a worm drive for tensioning. This was noted as being slow to operate, and trapped dirt. BRC&W developed an alternative <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{based on the}} Valentine tank, and this was incorporated into the A27M Cromwell design, also enabling the tank to accept wider 15.5" [...] tracks. [...] Centaur under Leyland continued without this development.|$|E
50|$|The {{sprockets}} in {{a cassette}} are usually {{held together by}} three small bolts or rivets for ease of installation. These keep the sprockets and spacers in the correct order and position when they are removed from the freehub body. When the sprockets {{need to be replaced}} due to wear or the user wishes to change gear ratios available, only the sprockets are replaced, not the <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Cassettes also allow the use of sprockets with fewer teeth, as in micro drive systems.|$|E
50|$|The rotary solenoid is an {{electromechanical}} device used to rotate a <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism</b> when power is applied. These {{were used in}} the 1950s for rotary snap-switch automation in electromechanical controls. Repeated actuation of the rotary solenoid advances the snap-switch forward one position. Two rotary actuators on opposite ends of the rotary snap-switch shaft, can advance or reverse the switch position.|$|R
40|$|This article {{shows how}} the {{probabilistic}} SBRA (Simulation-Based Reliability Assessment) Method (i. e. stochastic Monte Carlo approach) {{is applied to the}} model of the behaviour of the lithosphere of the Earth (geomechanical model). The main idea is based on the genesis of thermoelastic waves (i. e. influence of our Son) due to thermal expansion of the rock mass and the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> SBRA method applied in this problem is a new and innovative trend for modelling in mechanics...|$|R
50|$|A {{breaker bar}} {{is a long}} non-ratcheting bar that is used with socket wrench style sockets. Breaker bars are used to break loose very tight {{fasteners}} because their additional length allows {{the same amount of}} force to generate significantly more torque than a standard length socket wrench. The use of a breaker bar also prevents damage to the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a socket wrench. Often, after the first 1/2 turn of a fastener, the fastener is then loose enough to be turned with a socket wrench.|$|R
50|$|The {{timing chain}} was {{hydraulic}} tensioned {{and had a}} <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> to keep the chain tight. The timing chain rode on one pivoting chain guide resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper timing chain guide in between the camshaft sprockets. The timing chain was lubricated via cast-off {{from the top of}} the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing. The SOHC and DOHC engines used different timing chain sets.|$|E
50|$|The Inchworm was a ride-on toy for {{children}} {{produced by the}} Hasbro Corporation, first introduced in the early 1970s. A scooter with yellow wheels {{in the shape of}} a green caterpillar wearing a yellow hat, the Inchworm was jointed under the saddle so its wheelbase could expand and contract. The wheels were constricted by a <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> to rotating forward. As the rider bounced up and down on the saddle, the toy moved forward in a way somewhat resembling a Geometer caterpillar, with the ratcheting wheels making a clicking sound.|$|E
50|$|Pascal adapted a pawl and <b>ratchet</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{to his own}} turret wheel design; the pawl {{prevents}} the wheel from turning counterclockwise during an operator input, {{but it is also}} used to precisely position the display wheel and the carry mechanism for the next digit when it is pushed up and lands into its next position. Because of this mechanism, each number displayed is perfectly centered in the display window and each digit is precisely positioned for the next operation. This mechanism would be moved six times if the operator dialed a six on its associated input wheel.|$|E
40|$|Thermo-mechanical {{coupling}} {{takes place}} in jointed rock masses subjected to large thermal oscillations. Examples range from exposed surfaces under daily and seasonal thermal fluctuations to subsurface rock masses affected by engineered systems such as geothermal operations. Experimental, numerical and analytical results show that thermo-mechanical coupling can lead to wedging and <b>ratcheting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that result in deformation accumulation when the rock mass is subjected to a biased static-force condition. Analytical and numerical models help in identifying the parameter domain where thermo-mechanical ratcheting can take place...|$|R
