Joseph Whitworth changed this by creating the quick return mechanism in the mid-1800s. Using kinematics, he {{determined that the}} force and geometry of the <b>rotating</b> <b>joint</b> would affect the force and motion of the connected arm.

In 1978, Metro {{was the first}} large transit agency to order high-capacity articulated buses (buses with a <b>rotating</b> <b>joint).</b> Today, King County Metro {{has one of the}} largest articulated fleets in North America (second only to MTA New York City Transit) and articulated buses account for about 42% of the agencies fleet. In 1979, the agency ordered Flyer coaches with some of the first wheelchair lifts in the nation, promising a completely new level of independence for disabled residents. Early lifts were severely flawed, but by the mid-1980s the lifts were generally reliable and were ordered on all new buses. With the retirement of the MAN SG-220 buses in 1999, the entire fleet became wheelchair-accessible.|$|E
50|$|Many {{such devices}} contain {{non-functional}} circuitry or naively constructed approximations of radio transmitters. A few do have functional circuitry, {{putting out a}} weak signal with a function generator or a simple timer circuit, but are still largely useless in comparison with a coil-based metal detector; others {{have been found to}} contain intentionally obfuscated or completely superfluous components (from individual components such as inductors or ribbon cables up to, in some cases, pocket calculators), often indicative of intentional fraud, incompetence, or both, by the designer. Such functioning circuitry as exists in such devices usually has no obvious way (motor, solenoid, etc.) to connect to any <b>rotating</b> <b>joint</b> in the device either, meaning the devices are often entirely dependent on the ideomotor effect to function.|$|E

The transmitter was a magnetron located in single story building and reaching the aerial through a <b>rotating</b> <b>joint</b> in the rotating cabin before being fed to the hornstacks on the aerial. The aerial was built with two 60 foot by 21 foot elliptical parabolic antennas placed back-to-back, one acting as the radar, and the other as an IFF/secondary radar system.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the cost-effectiveness of conventional parabolic trough (PT) fields {{it is essential to}} reduce Capital Expenditure (Capex) as well as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs, in particular the need for flexible hosing or <b>rotating</b> <b>joints,</b> which are used because the tubular receiver also tracks in a solidary way with the trough. One possible alternative is to design a different type of optic with the center of mass on the center of the tubular receiver, generating the possibility of it being fixed, thereby dispensing with flexible hosing or <b>rotating</b> <b>joints,</b> without penalizing its overall efficiency or even concentration. In this work, two possible optical solutions, combining parabolic-type primaries with second-stage non-imaging optics concentrators for fixed receivers, are presented. These concentrators are designed using the Simultaneous Multiple Surface (SMS) design method and the infinitesimal etendue limit. A performance comparison with a conventional PT in terms of optical efficiency, CAP (Concentration-Acceptance Product) and other performance data are also presented, including an estimate of the total amount of yearly collected energy (kW h/m 2 of entrance aperture) for one particular location â€“ Faro (Portugal) ...|$|R

5000|$|Bots are {{constructed}} with two basic tools: shapes and joints. Shapes include rectangles, circles and triangles. Shapes have different settings, {{such as the}} ability to fixate them to their position, the ability to toggle collision with other shapes (excluding the sandbox), and the ability to alter their density. In IncrediBots, density is a value between 1-30 that can be changed to make the shape lighter or heavier. Shapes actively interact with each other through joints. The types of <b>joints</b> are <b>rotating,</b> sliding and fixed. Fixed joints 'weld' the two shapes together and cannot break. <b>Rotating</b> <b>joints</b> allow for rotational movement, and have a 'motor' that can be enabled. Once enabled, the motor causes rotational movement between the shapes when the user-set key is pressed, or automatically if set to do so. <b>Rotating</b> <b>joints</b> also have a set power and speed (between 1-30), and user-defined upper and lower rotation limits much like a servo motor,these joints can break. They also have a floppy or non-floppy option, which toggles a rotational 'brake'. Sliding joints are similar to 2 dimensional pneumatic pistons. They connect two objects but are unique in that the two objects {{do not have to be}} overlapping, and in that they collide with other shapes and add weight to the objects. Like <b>rotating</b> <b>joints,</b> they have set power and speed (1-30). Sliding joints also have an auto-oscillation setting which makes it expand and contract automatically. A fourth joint, thrusters, were once available only to [...] "IncrediBots Supporters" [...] in the first two games, but is currently a default joint in IncrediBots 3. They simply create a set amount of force in a chosen direction, applying it when the activation key is pressed, or automatically if set. Combined, shapes and joints allow for a huge amount of flexibility in creation.|$|R

The last link is the floating link, which is also called a coupler or connecting rod because it connects an input to the output.|$|R
40|$|Copyright Â© 2014 by ASME. In {{this paper}} we present an {{algorithm}} that automatically creates the linkage loop equations for planar 1 -DoF linkages of any topology with <b>rotating</b> <b>joints,</b> demonstrated up to 8 -bars. The algorithm derives the linkage loop equations from the linkage graph {{by establishing a}} cycle basis through a single common edge. Divergent and convergent loops are identified and used to establish the fixed angles of the ternary and higher links. Results demonstrate the automated generation of the linkage loop equations for the five distinct 6 -bar mechanisms, Watt I-II and Stephenson I-III, {{as well as the}} seventy one distinct 8 -bar mechanisms. The resulting loop equations enable the automatic derivation of the Dixon determinant for linkage kinematic analysis of the position of every possible assembly configuration. The loop equations also enable the automatic derivation of the Jacobian for singularity evaluation and tracking of a particular assembly configuration over the desired range of input angles. The methodology provides the foundation for the automated configuration analysis of every topology and every assembly configuration of 1 -DoF linkages with <b>rotating</b> <b>joints</b> up to 8 -bar.
