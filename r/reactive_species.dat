50|$|Arsenic {{can cause}} {{oxidative}} stress through {{the formation of}} <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> (ROS), and <b>reactive</b> nitrogen <b>species</b> (RNS). <b>Reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> are produced by the enzyme NADPH oxidase, which transfers electrons from NADPH to oxygen, synthesizing a superoxide, which is a reactive free radical. This superoxide can react to form hydrogen peroxide and a <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species.</b> The enzyme NADPH oxidase is able to generate more <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> {{in the presence of}} arsenic, due to the subunit p22phax, which is responsible for the electron transfer, being upregulated by arsenic. The <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> are capable of stressing the endoplasmic reticulum, which increases the amount of the unfolded protein response signals. This leads to inflammation, cell proliferation, and eventually to cell death. Another mechanism in which <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> cause cell death would be through the cytoskeleton rearrangement, which affects the contractile proteins. The <b>reactive</b> nitrogen <b>species</b> arise once the <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> destroy the mitochondria. This leads to the formation of the <b>reactive</b> nitrogen <b>species,</b> which are responsible for damaging DNA in arsenic poisoning. Mitochondrial damage is known to cause the release of <b>reactive</b> nitrogen <b>species,</b> due to the reaction between superoxides and nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide (NO) is a part of cell regulation, including cellular metabolism, growth, division and death. Nitric oxide (NO) reacts with <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> to form peroxynitrite. In cases of chronic arsenic exposure, the nitric oxide levels are depleted, due to the superoxide reactions. The enzyme NO synthase (NOS) uses L-arginine to form nitric oxide, but this enzyme is inhibited by monomethylated arsenic (III) compounds.|$|R

25|$|Areas {{containing}} a {{high concentration of}} <b>reactive</b> <b>species</b> following absorption of energy from radiation are referred to as spurs. In a medium irradiated with low LET radiation the spurs are sparsely distributed across the track and are unable to interact. For high LET radiation the spurs can overlap, allowing for inter-spur reactions, leading to different yields of products when compared to the same medium irradiated with the same energy of low LET radiation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the <b>reactive</b> <b>species</b> generated by the radiation can take part in following reactions, this is similar to the idea of the non-electrochemical reactions which follow the electrochemical event which is observed in cyclic voltammetry when a non-reversible event occurs. For example, the SF5 radical formed by the reaction of solvated electrons and SF6 undergo further reactions which lead to the formation of hydrogen fluoride and sulfuric acid.|$|E

Therefore, the maximum rate of polymerization is somewhere in the middle.|$|E

Correlations between <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> levels and sperm motion parameters in semen from the <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> - positive group were also investigated. <b>Reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> were detected in semen samples of 282 cases (33. 3 %).

25|$|Reaction with {{cysteine}} 822 confers {{a rather}} special property to the covalently inhibited enzyme, namely irreversibility to reducing agents.

25|$|Both {{the harmful}} effects of {{radiation}} upon biological systems (induction of cancer and acute radiation injuries) and the useful effects of radiotherapy involve the radiation chemistry of water. The vast majority of biological molecules are present in an aqueous medium; when water is exposed to radiation, the water absorbs energy, and as a result forms chemically <b>reactive</b> <b>species</b> that can interact with dissolved substances (solutes). Water is ionized to form a solvated electron and H2O+, the H2O+ cation can react with water to form a hydrated proton (H3O+) and a hydroxyl radical (HO.). Furthermore, the solvated electron can recombine with the H2O+ cation to form an excited state of the water, this excited state then decomposes to species such as hydroxyl radicals (HO.), hydrogen atoms (H.) and oxygen atoms (O.). Finally, the solvated electron can react with solutes such as solvated protons or oxygen molecules to form respectively hydrogen atoms and dioxygen radical anions. The fact that oxygen changes the radiation chemistry might be one reason why oxygenated tissues are more sensitive to irradiation than the deoxygenated tissue at the centre of a tumor. The free radicals, such as the hydroxyl radical, chemically modify biomolecules such as DNA, leading to damage such as breaks in the DNA strands. Some substances can protect against radiation-induced damage by reacting with the <b>reactive</b> <b>species</b> generated by the irradiation of the water.|$|E

Indeed, increased <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> levels contribute to pathomechanisms in several human diseases, either by its impaired defense system or increased production of <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species.</b> However, in the last two decades, the importance of <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> in many cellular signaling pathways has been unraveled. Homeostatic levels were shown to be necessary for correct differentiation during embryonic expansion of stem cells.

25|$|While it is {{possible}} to do some types of research using an irradiator much like that used for gamma sterilization, it is common in some areas of science to use a time resolved experiment where a material is subjected to a pulse of radiation (normally electrons from a LINAC). After the pulse of radiation, the concentration of different substances within the material are measured by emission spectroscopy or Absorption spectroscopy, hence the rates of reactions can be determined. This allows the relative abilities of substances to react with the <b>reactive</b> <b>species</b> generated by the action of radiation on the solvent (commonly water) to be measured. This experiment is known as pulse radiolysis which is closely related to Flash photolysis.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{consists}} of a mixture of electrons, ions, radicals, neutrals and photons. Some of these species are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, while others are not. Even for simple gases like argon this mixture can be complex. For plasmas of organic monomers, the complexity can rapidly increase as some components of the plasma fragment, while others interact and form larger species. Glow discharge is a technique in polymerization which forms free electrons which gain energy from an electric field, and then lose energy through collisions with neutral molecules in the gas phase. This leads to many chemically <b>reactive</b> <b>species,</b> which then lead to a plasma polymerization reaction. The electric discharge process for plasma polymerization is the “low-temperature plasma” method, because higher temperatures cause degradation. These plasmas are formed by a direct current, alternating current or radio frequency generator.|$|E
25|$|A {{predisposing factor}} to {{developing}} DIL is N-acetylation speed, or {{the rate at}} which the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators. These metabolites (byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body) of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated, meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst. Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a <b>reactive</b> <b>species</b> that is able to bond to protein. Monocytes, one type of white blood cell, detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells, creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response. Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL.|$|E

500|$|A paradox in {{metabolism}} is that, {{while the}} vast majority of complex life on Earth requires oxygen for its existence, oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing reactive oxygen species. Consequently, organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as DNA, proteins and lipids. In general, antioxidant systems either prevent these <b>reactive</b> <b>species</b> from being formed, or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell. However, reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions, such as redox signaling. [...] Thus, the function of antioxidant systems is not to remove oxidants entirely, but instead to keep them at an optimum level.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} molecular mechanism of <b>reactive</b> oxygen <b>species</b> production by flavin dehydrogenases mitochondrial glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH).

2500|$|Polymerization {{is likely}} to take place through either ionic and/or radical {{processes}} which are initiated by plasma formed from the glow discharge. The classic view presented by Yasuda [...] based upon thermal initiation of parylene polymerization [...] is that there are many propagating species present at any given time as shown in Figure 3. This figure shows two different pathways by which the polymerization may take place. The first pathway is a monofunctionalization process, bears resemblance to a standard free radical polymerization mechanism (M•)- although with the caveat that the <b>reactive</b> <b>species</b> may be ionic and not necessarily radical. The second pathway refers to a difunctional mechanism, which by example may contain a cationic and a radical propagating center on the same monomer (•M•). A consequence is that 'polymer' can grow in multiple directions by multiple pathways off one species, such as a surface or other monomer. This possibility let Yasuda to term the mechanism as a very rapid step-growth polymerization. In the diagram, Mx refers to the original monomer molecule or any of many dissociation products such as chlorine, fluorine and hydrogen. The M• species refers to those that are activated and capable of participating in reactions to form new covalent bonds. The •M• species refers to an activated difunctional monomer species. The subscripts i, j, and k show the sizes of the different species involved. Even though radicals represent the activated species, any ion or radical could be used in the polymerization. As can be seen here, plasma polymerization is a very complex process, with many parameters effecting everything from rate to chain length.|$|E
