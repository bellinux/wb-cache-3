40|$|The {{theory of}} cosmological {{perturbations}} {{is a well}} elaborated field. To deal with the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity one generally introduces combinations of the metric and matter perturbations which are gauge invariant up to the considered order in the perturbations. For linear cosmological perturbations one works with the so-called Bardeen potentials widely used in this context. However, there exists no common procedure to construct gauge invariant quantities also for higher order perturbations. Usually, one has to find new gauge invariant quantities independently for each order in perturbation theory. With the <b>relational</b> <b>formalism</b> introduced by Rovelli and further developed by Dittrich and Thiemann, it is in principle possible to calculate manifestly gauge invariant quantities, that is quantities that are gauge invariant up to arbitrary order once one has chosen a set of so-called reference fields, often also called clock fields. This article contains {{a review of the}} <b>relational</b> <b>formalism</b> and its application to canonical general relativity following the work of Garcia, Pons, Sundermeyer and Salisbury. As the starting point for our application of this formalism to cosmological perturbation theory, we also review the Hamiltonian formulation of the linearized theory for perturbations around FLRW spacetimes. The main aim of our work will be to identify clock fields {{in the context of the}} <b>relational</b> <b>formalism</b> that can be used to reconstruct quantities like the Bardeen potential as well as the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable. This requires a careful analysis of the canonical formulation in the extended ADM-phase space where lapse and shift are treated as dynamical variables. The actual construction of such observables and further investigations thereof will be carried out in our companion paper. Comment: Invited review for Int. J. Mod. Phys. D, 57 pages, no figure...|$|E

40|$|Statistical <b>relational</b> {{learning}} <b>formalisms</b> combine first-order logic with {{probability theory}} {{in order to}} obtain expressive models that capture both complex relational structure and uncertainty. Despite the significant progress made in this field, several important challenges remain open. First, the expressivity of statistical relational learning comes at the cost of inefficient learning and inference in large-scale problems that contain many objects. Second, while many real-world relational domains are hybrid in that they contain objects that are described by both continuous and discrete properties, little {{attention has been paid to}} learning from such data. Third, most formalisms ignore the dynamic nature of real-world problems by considering only the static aspects captured by a single snapshot of time in the dynamic process. This thesis tries to tackle these shortcomings and makes the following four contributions. First, we propose a graph-sampling based approach that approximately counts the number of pattern occurrences in the data, which enables scaling up parameter learning of statistical relational models. Second, we propose a novel statistical <b>relational</b> learning <b>formalism</b> that models hybrid relational domains. Third, we designed the first structure learning algorithm that is able to learn hybrid relational models. Fourth, we adapted our algorithm to learn temporal dependencies present in the data.

40|$|Abstract. Creating, maintaining, and deducing {{accurate}} world knowl-edge in a dynamic, complex, adversarial, and stochastic environment {{such as the}} RoboCup {{environment is}} a demanding task. Knowledge should be represented in real-time (i. e., within ms) and deduction from knowledge should be inferred within the same time constraints. We propose an ex-tended assertional formalism for an expressive SROIQ(D) Description Logic to represent asserted entities in a lattice structure. This structure can represent temporal-like information. Since the computational com-plexity of the classes of description logic increases with its expressivity, the problem demands either a restriction in the expressivity or an empir-ical upper bound on {{the maximum number of}} axioms in the knowledge base. We assume that the terminological/relational knowledge changes significantly slower than the assertional knowledge. Henceforth, using a fixed terminological and <b>relational</b> <b>formalisms</b> and the proposed lattice structure, we empirically bound the size of the knowledge bases to find the best trade-off in order to achieve deduction capabilities of an exist-ing description logic reasoner in real-time. The queries deduce instances using the equivalent class expressions defined in the terminology. We have conducted all our experiments in the RoboCup 3 D Soccer Simu-lation League environment and provide justifications of the usefulness of the proposed assertional extension.

40|$|Belief {{networks}} (BNs) {{extracted from}} statistical <b>relational</b> learning <b>formalisms</b> often include variables with conditional probability distributions (CPDs) that exhibit a local structure (e. g, decision trees and noisy-or). In such cases, naively representing CPDs as tables {{and using a}} general purpose inference algorithm such as variable elimination (VE) results in redundant computation. Contextual variable elimination (CVE) partly addresses this problem by representing the BN in terms of smaller units called confactors. This leads to a more compact representation and faster inference. CVE requires that a variable’s confactors are mutually-exclusive and exhaustive. We propose CVE-OC (CVE with overlapping contexts), which lifts these restrictions. This seemingly simple step shows to be powerful and allows for a more efficient encoding of confactors and a reduction of the computational cost. Experiments show that CVE-OC outperforms CVE on multiple problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Qualitative {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} reasoning is a research field that studies <b>relational,</b> constraint-based <b>formalisms</b> for representing, and reasoning about, {{spatial and temporal}} information.

In this paper, we present a new framework that allows for decomposing composition tables into logically simpler parts, while preserving logical equivalence, e. g., the decomposition in start- and end-points for Allen’s Interval Calculus. We show that finding such decompositions is an NP-complete problem and present a SAT-based method to generate decompositions. Finally, we discuss the impact of our decomposition method on SAT encodings of problem instances, and present a reasoning system built on decompositions that compares favorably with state-of-the-art solvers.

In this paper, we present a new language feature for CP-logic, where we allow negation in the head of rules to express the inhibition of an effect in a modular manner. This is a generalization of the inhibited noisy-or structure that can deal with cycles and, foremost, is non-conflicting. We introduce syntax and semantics for this feature and show how this is a natural counterpart to the standard noisy-or.

40|$|Abstract—Tables are {{extremely}} important components of documents, because they bear very informative content in a compact and structured way. Being {{able to understand}} a table’s internal organization would allow to extract and reuse the data they contain. This {{can be reduced to}} recognizing critical cells only. Since purely algorithmic approaches are unable to deal with the many different table layouts designed to represent particular kinds of information and/or particular perspectives on them, Machine Learning may represent an effective solution. On one hand, the spatial organization of tables puts a strong emphasis on the relationships among cells; on the other, the extreme variability in style, size, and aims of tables requires flexible approaches.

40|$|Operations on spatial objects {{have great}} individuality. As a consequence, the spatial data {{modelling}} approaches, {{which have been}} proposed, have to consider either data types of the form set of spatial objects or non- 1 NF data structures or a limited spatial functionality of the operations.

All the types consist of connected spatial objects that can be involved in all the spatial operations, which are defined. A <b>relational</b> <b>formalism</b> is developed {{for the management of}} spatial data. It considers nonnested relational data structures. The relational algebra consists of a kernel set of operations, the ordinary relational operations and two more. All others are defined in terms of those in the kernel.

The <b>relational</b> <b>formalism</b> in the incarnation of Rovelli’s partial and complete observables provides a possible mechanism for turning a non gauge invariant operator into a gauge invariant one. In this paper we investigate whether the spectrum of such a physical, that is gauge invariant, observable can be predicted from the spectrum of the corresponding gauge variant observables. We will not do this in full LQG but rather consider much simpler examples where field theoretical complications are absent. We find, even in those simpler cases, that kinematical discreteness {{of the spectrum}} does not necessarily survive at the gauge invariant level. Whether or not this happens depends crucially on how the gauge invariant completion is performed. This indicates that “fundamental discreteness at Planck scale in LQG ” is far from established.
