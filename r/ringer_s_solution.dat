40|$|Background: This thesis {{presents}} a new application of fluid kinetic analysis using mathematical tools to evaluate fluid therapy problems. Several models {{were developed to}} mathematically handle fluid distribution concerning bleeding and anaesthesia, arterio-venous differences in plasma dilution, peripheral fluid accumulation and differences in fluid distribution among young and elderly patients. Non-linear regression models were used to fit equations to sampled haemoglobin data. Methods: I: Six chronically instrumented sheep were subjected to four randomly ordered experiments while conscious or during anesthesia with isoflurane. After plasma volume measurement 15 % or 45 % of the blood volume was withdrawn. To quantify transcapillary refill, mass balance and kinetic calculations utilized repeated measurements of haemoglobin concentration. II: Fifteen volunteers received an intravenous (iv) infusion of 15 mL/kg of lactated <b>Ringer</b> <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> during 10 min. Simultaneous arterial and venous blood haemoglobin (Hb) samples were obtained and Hb concentrations measured. III: Ten healthy female non-pregnant volunteers participated. The protocol included an infusion of acetated <b>Ringer</b> <b>s</b> <b>solution,</b> 25 ml/kg over 30 minutes. Blood samples were repeatedly. A standard bladder catheter was continuously monitoring urine excretion. Plasma dilution, peripheral accumulation and urine output were modelled simultaneously. IV: Twenty four volunteers participated. Two age groups, a young group (age 18 - 25) and an elderly group (age 70 - 90) were formed. On separate occasions, the subjects in both groups were given a crystalloid 25 mg/ml glucose solution, either orally (ORAL) or intravenously (IV) in a crossover design {{with at least two}} weeks in between. On each occasion, the subjects got 7 ml/kg of the crystalloid solution during 15 minutes. Results: I: After either normotensive or hypotensive hemorrhage, transcapillary refill occurred more rapidly during the first 40 min than during the next 140 min (p < 0. 001). In conscious sheep, at 180 min, 57 % and 42 % of the bled volume had been restored after normotensive and hypotensive hemorrhage, respectively, in contrast to only 13 % and 27 % (p < 0. 001) in isoflurane-anesthetized sheep. Using parameters derived from kinetic analysis, simulations illustrate that both the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces are weaker in the presence of isoflurane than in the awake state. II: The AV difference in plasma dilution was only positive during the infusion and for 2. 5 min thereafter, which represents the period of net flow of fluid from plasma to tissue. Kinetic analysis showed that volume expansion of the peripheral fluid space began to decrease 14 min (arterial blood) and 20 min (venous blood) after the infusion ended. III: Maximum urinary output rate was found to be 19 (13 31) ml/min. The subjects were likely to accumulate three times as much of the infused fluid peripherally as centrally; Elimination efficacy, Eeff, was 24 (5 35) and the basal elimination kb was 1. 11 (0. 28 2. 90). The total time delay Ttot of urinary output was estimated to 17 (11 - 31) min. IV: The lag-time of glucose given orally was estimated to be 17 (8 25) min for the younger group and 18 (13 22) min for the elderly. For fluid, the lag-time was estimated to 29 (21 - 34) min for the younger and 25 (16 39) min for the elderly. Conclusions: Final conclusion is that mathematical modelling of clinical applications can be done in several different clinical settings and will improve the understanding of fluid distribution. It is possible to continuously model fluid behaviour in the body as seen in Papers II-III. This should enhance the understanding of accumulating oedema in the body which is an apparent problem for all clinicians...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{paper about}} {{geometry}} of (iterated) variations. We explain why no sources of divergence are {{built into the}} Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) Laplacian, whence {{there is no need}} to postulate any ad hoc conventions such as "δ(0) = 0 " and "δ(0) = 0 " within BV-approach to quantisation of gauge systems. Remarkably, the geometry of iterated variations does not refer at all to the construction of Dirac's δ-function as a limit of smooth kernels. We illustrate the reasoning by re-deriving - but not just "formally postulating" - the standard properties of BV-Laplacian and Schouten bracket and by verifying their basic inter-relations (e. g., cohomology preservation by gauge symmetries of the quantum master-equation).

40|$|Lobatostoma manteri sp. nov. is described. It {{differs from}} {{other species of}} this genus {{in the number of}} {{marginal}} alveoli (usually 56 – 62), the location of the testis near the posterior end and the large size of the cirrus pouch. Mature worms occur in the intestine of the fish Trachinotus blochi. Eggs containing fully developed larvae are laid. The eggs are eaten by snails and hatch in the stomach. Larvae have an oral sucker, pharynx, simple caecum, ventro-terminal acetabulum, two dorsal excretory bladder cells in front of the acetabulum, and a caudal appendage. They migrate into the digestive gland and differentiate to pre-adults with fully developed genital organs and the full number of alveoli on the adhesive disk; young spermatozoa and egg cells develop but do not mature. Pre-adults have a minimum number of 8500 sensory papillae on the surface. The worms are usually found in a cavity formed by enlargement of the main duct and one or more (?) side ducts of the digestive gland near the stomach in Cerithium moniliferum, or in the stomach and main ducts of the digestive gland of Peristernia australiensis. They may creep from the ducts into the stomach and back into the ducts. Fish become infected by eating snails. Worms from fish die soon after transfer into sea water but can be kept alive for up to 13 days in frog 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Ringer</b> <b>solution</b> or dilute sea water (1 : 5), in which they lay eggs containing larvae infective to snails.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Enrofloxacin is an antimicrobial drug approved for veterinary use only. Enrofloxacin is administered orally or parentally. Veterinarians may dilute the drug for injection or topical use in a commercial physiological solution. The injectable commercially used Enrofloxacin, Baytril, is sometimes too strong, causing vomiting, and much smaller concentrations are effective topically. It is hypothesized that the dilution of enrofloxacin in some commercially used solutions will not affect the drug s efficacy. The purpose of my study was to test the aforestated hypothesis. In the experiment, stock solutions of enrofloxacin in physiological saline solution, dextrose 5 % in water, lactated <b>Ringer</b> <b>s</b> <b>solution,</b> Epi-otic solution, and vinegar. E. coli 2592 - 2 (standardized solution in saline) was the microorganism chosen to be tested because it is know to be susceptible to enrofloxacin. At time 0, 1 day, and 7 days and temperatures of 25 ?C and 4 ?C, decreasing tube dilutions of each stock solution and a standard enrofloxacin solution (control) were made using Mueller-Hinton broth. Each dilution of the enrofloxacin solution and an equal amount of bacterial solution were combined and incubated for 24 hours. The resulting growth was read using ultraviolet spectrophotometry and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of enrofloxacin in each solutionwas determined and compared to the control. Results showed that the MIC s at time 0 were: control- 8 mg/ml, saline 0. 25 mg/ml, dextrose- 4 mg/ml, ringer- 1 mg/ml, epi-otic- 4 mg/ml, and vinegar- 2 mg/ml. The results for both temperatures at 1 day followed the same pattern. At 7 days, crystals of enrofloxacin were observed in all solutions at both temperatures, hence these solutions were not tested by tube dilution. Therefore, it can be concluded that because the commercial solutions caused a decrease in MIC, they all appear to increase rather than decrease the efficacy of enrofloxacin. The experiment shows that some physiological solutions cal alter the efficacy of enrofloxacin when the two are combined for clinical use, but this alteration is favorable...|$|E

As a result of these experiments, the author has developed anew staining method using Lugol 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> and has proved that it is superior to sudan III staing method. Further experiments were carried out in order to investigate into the mechanism of staining. A comparative study of this method with the staining method using fluoroscopic dye, which had recently been developed, was also performed. The results of the experiments are summarized as follows: 1. The eggs killed by heating stained well by sudan III staining method, but the eggs killed by other means did not stain well. Attemts were made to enhance the ability to stain by applying various pre-treatment but without success. 2. The live eggs stained with Lugol 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> are not decolorized by alcohol, but the dead eggs stained with Lugol 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> are decolorized by alcohol. It would thus be possible to discern by this method whether eggs are dead or alive. Although it has no absolute value, this method is superior to sudan III staining method and is availabe for experimental purposes. 3. It seems that the permeability of the egg-shell plays an important part in Lugol 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution</b> staining method. Although results vary with the change in the methods used for killing eggs, it seems that the permeability of shells of eggs are enhanced when they are dead, thereby promoting decolorization. 4. It is assumed that it is the. third layer that plays {{a significant role in the}} permeability of the eggshell. 5. It seems that the staining method using fluoroscopic dyes, which has more or less similar value as sudan III staining method, is inferior to Lugol 2 ̆ 7 <b>s.</b> <b>solution</b> staining method in discerning whther Ascaris eggs are dead or alive...|$|R

This type specimen is used frequently for fatigue tests. The stress field induced by a ring force in an infinite body is used to solve these problems. The fundamental solutions and calculation method developed here have a wide applicability for various kinds of axisymmetric notch problems under torsion, tension or bending.

40|$|An ideal {{artificial}} bone {{is expected}} to grow together with other natural bones with aid of osteoblast cells and to fade out into other natural bones at the same rate of restructuring natural bone. Magnesium is thought to be one of candidate materials, since it has a potential to enhance natural bone growth and to homogenize the implanted artificial bodies with natural bone. In the present study, we are concerned with the formation of trabecular pattern in the natural bone to consider how to reconstruct this pattan in the artificial bone made from magnesium. For that purpose, a series of experiments were perfonned to observe the chemical behavior of dipped magnesium plate and cellular magnesium in Hank 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution.</b> A magnesium specimen is annealed at 773 - 803 K for various periods in an atmosphere to homogenize its microstructure. Mass change of magnesium is estimated by immersing it in Hank 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>solution.</b> It is well known that magnesium is easily corroded by chlorine ion. Both x-ray diffraction and energy dispersed x-ray analyses were carried out in order to identify a reaction product and its chemical composition.
