5000|$|In {{the sport}} of baseball, a baserunner {{is said to be}} in scoring {{position}} when he is on second or third base. The distinction between being on first base and second or third base is that a runner on first can usually only score if the batter hits an extra-base hit, while a runner on second or third can score on a single. This is also known as [...] "ducks on the pond". <b>Runners</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> scoring position refers to the number of runners on second or third base {{at the end of an}} inning and is an inverse measure of a team's offensive efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Beau was the 12/1 mount of two-time winning jockey Carl Llewellyn and {{had won the}} Whitbread Gold Cup, a {{respected}} Aintree trial, by a distance in 1999. His form in 2000 had been less impressive and his heavy weight handicap was also considered a tough ask, but the horse was coping well with it during the race and was leading the only four <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the race when an awkward jump at the 19th fence put his reins over his head. Jockey Llewellyn fought {{to try to save}} the situation but, without steering, was unsurpisingly unseated at the next fence. The rider desperately chased his mount to the next fence in a bid to remount and possibly claim third place, but was unable to do so.|$|E

50|$|The {{initial entry}} for the 2014 Epsom Derby, {{announced}} in December 2012, consisted of 406 yearlings. The number of entries was 32 fewer {{than for the}} 2013 race and included 68 from Godolphin Racing and 56 from the partners of the Coolmore Stud. The number of potential runners was reduced to 118 at the first scratching date in March 2014, and subsequently increased to 133 when a further 15 horses were entered at the second entry stage in April 2014. The field for the Derby began to take its final shape at the May scratching deadline when 27 <b>runners</b> were <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the race, and the final confirmation stage on 2 June saw the final field settled at 17 runners with 11 further withdrawals and the additional entry of Romsdal {{at a cost of}} £75,000. Snow Sky was withdrawn at the declaration stage on 5 June, leaving 16 runners to contest the 2014 Derby.|$|R

The number of entries was an increase of 66 on the initial entry for the 2015 race, and included 53 horses from the Godolphin Racing organisation and 77 from the Coolmore Stud. The number of potential runners was reduced to 136 at the first scratching date in March 2016 with Foundation (trained by John Gosden) and Midterm, the son of Midday, (Michael Stoute) heading the betting market at odds of 12 to 1. Aidan O'Brien trained 36 of the <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the race. A further 9 horses were added at the second entry stage in April 2016 {{at a cost of}} £8,000 per entry. The second entries included Carntop, bred and owned by Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.|$|E
50|$|The {{qualifying}} round {{ended with}} Glenbrien Champ and the Grace Peppercorn trained Ebony Tim winning {{well and the}} Irish won eight of the sixteen heats. One {{of the first round}} heats resulted in a one-two for McKenna as Lauragh Six beat Count Five with Game Ball scraping through in third. Best heat winner was another Irish entry Dipmac trained by Seamus Graham. Matt O’Donnell’s Powersville Jet became the new favourite after recording a second round time of 29.24 just one length ahead of Proud Dodger, Game Ball tumbled out after failing to take third place from Lauragh Six. The Irish made up half of the 24 <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the quarter-finals but Dipmac failed to progress from heat one and picked up a wrist injury. Heat two went to Whisper Wishes in 29.32 and the Irish had another bad result in the third heat when Powersville Jet and Count Five both went out after trouble along with Amazing Man a finalist from the previous year. The fourth and final heat was an Irish clean sweep, Proud Dodger won from Back Garden and Morans Beef.|$|E

50|$|<b>Runners</b> <b>left</b> on base by {{a pitcher}} are not counted in {{determining}} innings pitched. It {{is possible for}} a pitcher to enter a game, give up several hits and possibly even several runs, and be removed before achieving any outs, thereby recording a total of zero innings pitched.|$|R
5000|$|In Central Texas, {{this version}} of the game is {{sometimes}} called Cops and Robbers.

5000|$|Base runs will {{sometimes}} project {{many more than}} three <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> on base per inning, {{despite the fact that}} three is the upper limit. For example, if walks have a B coefficient of [...]1, an inning with 10 walks and three outs will yield an estimate of 10*1/(1+3) = 2.5 runs, meaning that 7.5 runners must have been stranded.|$|R

Previously, snitch <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> the pitch to be pursued by seekers {{returning}} to the field after a predetermined amount of time. The term off-pitch seeking is applied to the pre-Rulebook 8 scenario. Many countries play using the eighth edition's rules all the while keeping the seventh edition's off-pitch seeking rules.|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} to this statistic {{is called}} Batting Average {{with two outs}} and Runners in Scoring Position, which is also calculated by dividing a players' hits with runners on second or third by his at bats in this situation. A hit {{is more likely to}} score at least one or two runs-depending on the speed of the runner, the strength of the outfielder's arm, the number of runners in scoring position, etc.-because the runners will be going on contact—that is, they run once the batter hits the ball. But if the batter records an out, then the inning ends with those <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> on base.|$|R

5000|$|The fielders now {{suspect that}} the <b>runner</b> <b>left</b> third base too early and also missed the plate. Suppose that a fielder, with the live ball, touches third base and tells the nearest umpire, [...] "I think he left too early." [...] This is a proper legal appeal, and the umpire should rule with a safe signal, perhaps saying, [...] "No, he was fine." [...] Now no legal appeal may again occur on that runner at third base. Suppose then that a fielder, with the live ball, touches home base and says to the nearest umpire, [...] "I think he never touched home." [...] This is a legal and viable appeal, and so the umpire should call the runner out and direct that his run shall not count.|$|R

50|$|The start was {{situated}} near {{to where the}} modern day Melling Road is and took the runners out into open countryside, jumping a line of natural banks, no more than 2 ft high before reaching a post and rails over a brook. They then took the <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> towards the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, turning sharply (where the modern day Canal Turn is) to run along the canalside back towards the racecourse, negotiating the Second Brook (the modern day Valentine's Brook). The runners would then enter the 'racecourse proper' {{at the far end}} of the circuit to run back towards the stands, jumping a plain fence (the modern day Chair before jumping a wall topped with gorse (the modern day Water Jump). The field then took another circuit of the course, this time bypassing the final two obstacles towards the finishing post.|$|R

50|$|September 9 - At Dodger Stadium, a duel {{between the}} Los Angeles Dodgers' Sandy Koufax and Bob Hendley of the Chicago Cubs is perfect until Dodger left fielder Lou Johnson {{walks in the}} fifth inning. Following a {{sacrifice}} bunt, Johnson steals third base and scores on a throwing error by Cubs catcher Chris Krug. Johnson later has the game's only hit, a 7th-inning double. Koufax's fourth no-hitter in four years is a perfect game, the first in Dodgers history. One hit by two clubs in a completed nine-inning game is also a major league record, as is the one <b>runner</b> <b>left</b> on base. The two base runners in a game is an ML record. For Chicago pitchers, {{it is the second}} one-hitter they've thrown against the Dodgers this year and lost. A week later in the rematch in Chicago's Wrigley Field, Hendley beats Koufax and the Dodgers, 2-1.|$|R
5000|$|... 9:37 p.m. (ET) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, CaliforniaNeither team's {{starting}} pitcher was particularly {{effective in the}} series opener; however, neither team's offense was able to capitalize, as this game set a MLB postseason record for <b>runners</b> <b>left</b> on base combined between the two teams, with 30. Los Angeles starter Randy Wolf loaded the bases with no outs in the first inning, allowing one run to score on a fielding miscue. In {{the bottom half of}} the inning, St. Louis starter Chris Carpenter gave up a two-run home run to Matt Kemp, giving the Dodgers a lead they would never relinquish. The St. Louis bullpen gave up only one run over three innings, while the Los Angeles bullpen gave up one run over [...] innings.
