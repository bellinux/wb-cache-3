30|$|Although lipids {{have often}} been condemned, the use of lipid and its {{products}} has drawn a dramatic interest in recent years due to findings related to their effects on human health. Apart from enhancing flavor, texture, and mouthfeel to foods, lipids also provide essential fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (AA), and γ-linolenic acid], fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), and other minor components (phospholipids, tocopherols, tocotrienols, carotenoids, sterols, and phenolic compounds) (Rizliya and Mendis 2014; Shahidi 2006). Particularly, the roles of carotenoids, EPA, and/or DHA in heart health, mental health, brain, and retina development, have been well documented (Alabdulkarim et al. 2012; Guerin et al. 2003; Swanson et al. 2012; Yamashita 2013), and such lipid constituents have been <b>regconized</b> as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals for improving human health. By this reason, fish oils {{have been used for}} enriching DHA and EPA of many food products such as powder milk formulate, salad oil, fruit beverage, vegetable juice (Kolanowski and Berger 1999), dairy products (Kolanowski and Weißbrodt 2007), soft goat cheese (Hughes et al. 2012), or cookies (Jeyakumari et al. 2016). Lobster oils have a potential use as a source of natural ω- 3 fatty acids for many fortified products since they have been demonstrated to contain PUFAs and ω- 3 fatty acids as high as that of fish oil (menhaden) or krill oils (Albalat et al. 2016; Tsvetnenko et al. 1996). Moreover, higher bioavailability of fatty acids derived from crustacean oils compared to those of fish oils (Köhler et al. 2015) together with the antioxidant superior of crustacean oils provided by carotenoids make them ideal for application as a novel and beneficial food ingredient (Tetens 2009) or as oil supplement (Köhler et al. 2015). With a significant richness in astaxanthin, PUFAs, and ω- 3 fatty acids, lobster oil was suggested for use as a dietary supplement (Nguyen 2017) since oils produced from fish livers are often considered as an important source of vitamins A and D with several therapeutic properties (Gunstone 2006; Rizliya and Mendis 2014). In addition, lobster liver oil contains very strong specific flavors, which combined with the unique and inherent ability of oils for absorbing and preserving flavors, would be a promising application for flavor industry. For this reason, lobster lipids were investigated for production of infused lobster oil, salt plated with lobster flavors, and lobster seasoning, and they obtained promising results (Nguyen 2017).|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between foreign aid and economic growth in Vietnam from 1993 to 2012. The main objective is {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the reality of aid-growth relationship in Vietnam, how and through which channels aid may influence outcomes, and what make aid works better or less well. In the research, growth accounting analysis is conducted to <b>regconize</b> contributions of foreign assistance to production factors. An empirical model is estimated using the Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (ARDL) approach to cointegration for the purpose of evaluating of the direct impact of aid on final economic outcome. Additionally, the study conducts an analysis reviewing both positive and negative effects of foreign aid across different sectors. The empirical results indicate that foreign aid has a significantly positive role in promoting economic growth in Vietnam. The results of growth accounting exercise and the analysis of fundamental channels through which aid has contributed to development outcomes also obtain more evidence supporting the beneficial impacts of aid, especially on macroeconomic management, infrastructure, and human capital accumulation. However, at the same time, such aid-related problems as high volatility and unpredictability of the inflow, absorptive capacity constraints, and rent seeking behavior could burden the recipient's administration and in turn, undermine the aid effectiveness. Based on these findings, a set of policy implications has been suggested. Firstly, Vietnamese government and its donor community should put more effort into improving the coordination among involved parties. Secondly, the analysis implies the importance of systematic evaluations of completed aid programs and projects. Thirdly, the quality of institution and managerial capacity should be strengthened in addition to aid effort. Fourthly, Vietnam needs to be acutely conscious of the problems involving due to high volatility and unpredictability of aid and then implement necessary measures to alleviate pressure on fiscal management. Finally, there is a need to adopt a more self-sustainable approach in enhancing economic growth in the long-run...|$|R
