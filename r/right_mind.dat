25|$|The {{editorial}} board of Nacional reacted by accusing the police of Pukanić's death by {{failure to provide}} police protection. They stated that Pukanić's round-the-clock protection by two police officers was lifted on August 1 not by Pukanić's request in his <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> but under a pressure from the police. Pukanić allegedly received two death threats {{after the end of}} the protection and promptly forwarded them to the police, but they failed to act upon them. The redaction also condemned the prosecution office for investigating false accusations against Pukanić instead of concentrating on finding his April assailant. As of now, there are only informal speculations as to the motive of the assassin.|$|E
25|$|The hired hand Ray Lamphere {{was deeply}} {{in love with}} Gunness; he {{performed}} any chore for her, no matter how gruesome. He became jealous of the many men who arrived to court his employer and began making scenes. She fired him on February 3, 1908. Shortly after dispensing with Lamphere, she presented herself at the La Porte County courthouse. She declared that her former employee was not in his <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> and was a menace to the public. She somehow convinced local authorities to hold a sanity hearing. Lamphere was pronounced sane and released. Gunness was back {{a few days later}} to complain to the sheriff that Lamphere had visited her farm and argued with her. She contended that he posed a threat to her family and had Lamphere arrested for trespassing.|$|E

500|$|The two volume {{biography}} of Whitehead by Victor Lowe {{is the most}} definitive presentation {{of the life of}} Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no Nachlass; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death. Additionally, Whitehead was known for his [...] "almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy", and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life. [...] This led to Lowe himself remarking on the first page of Whitehead's biography, [...] "No professional biographer in his <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> would touch him." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception of the preview {{release of}} RT 8.1 was mixed; both ExtremeTech and TechRadar praised the {{improvements}} to the operating system's tablet-oriented interface, along {{with the addition of}} Outlook; TechRadars Dan Grabham believed that the inclusion of Outlook was important because [...] "nobody in their <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> would try and handle work email inside the standard Mail app—it's just not up to the task."

[...] The conversation convinced an amazed Jackson and Pollard that Artest [...] "wasn't in his <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> to ask that question". Auburn Hills police entered the locker room to make arrests, but the team rushed Artest onto the bus and refused to take him off. The police decided to protect the Pacers as they left the arena and to later contact the team after reviewing game film. Outside of the arena, there were dozens of police cruisers lining the roads out of the parking lots.|$|E

60|$|And here a {{few words}} must be said to persons with whose {{difficulties}} I deeply sympathise, but from whose conclusions I differ utterly: those, namely, who say that if we reject the miracles of these saints' lives, we must reject also the miracles of the New Testament.

2500|$|The noted American author John Dos Passos {{joined the}} {{committee}} and wrote its 127-page official review of the case: Facing the Chair: Story of Americanization of Two Foreignborn Workmen.

[...] "Nobody in his <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> who was planning such a crime would take a man like that along," [...] Dos Passos wrote of Vanzetti.
