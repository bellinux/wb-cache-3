5|$|Since 1 January 1941, {{the date}} of the {{foundation}} of the LROS, 290 bird species have been recorded in the counties in an apparently natural wild state at least once. A further nine were documented prior to that date, but have not been recorded subsequently. There are nine introduced species that maintain themselves without necessary recourse to further introduction. The total list for the LROS <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> is therefore 308 species.|$|E
500|$|This {{led to the}} 2004 {{introduction}} of the Genesis HD—a [...] HD SDI camera with improved colorimetry- and sensitometry-related specs. Its Super 35 mm film–sized <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> made it focally compatible with regular 35mm lenses, giving it a true 35mm depth of field. The camera's electronics—including its CCD (charge-coupled device) image sensor—and HDCAM SR record deck were manufactured by Sony. The chassis and mechanics were designed by a Panavision team led by Albert Mayer Jr., son of the Panaflex designer. The Genesis was first used on Superman Returns (2006) followed soon after by Flyboys (2006); But the comedy Scary Movie 4 (2006), shot afterward on a mixture of 35mm film and the Genesis, actually went into general release first because of the extensive visual effects work needed to complete both Flyboys and Superman Returns. Subsequent to the completion of major design work on the Genesis, Panavision bought out Sony's 49 percent share of DHD Ventures and fully consolidated it in September 2004.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1986 {{speaking}} engagement at the University of Georgia, Max Weinberg (drummer for the E Street Band) stated that [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was his all-time favorite song that the band had recorded. Later, {{in a separate}} question and answer session, Weinberg explained {{that it was his}} favorite because the song was not written in advance for the various instrumental parts. After a grueling studio session while members of the band were in the booth at the sound board, one member of the band at a time returned to the <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> joining in to make up their own new parts to the song that had been intended as an acoustic guitar-only song. Even Springsteen came out and started singing vocals. It sounded so good that they did it again and recorded it. Without reviewing the recording, Springsteen said, let's do that one more time. So they recorded the second take (or the third time the unwritten version had ever been played). That second studio take was the CD release on the Born in the U.S.A. album.|$|E

50|$|Recognizing the structure’s {{inherent}} superior acoustics, Kassem {{decided to}} use the church sanctuary as a <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> and build {{at the rear of the}} space a modern engineering control room with direct to disc recording and LP lathe cutting capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{recording}} studio had 100 foot high ceilings, a large floorspace for the <b>recording</b> <b>area,</b> {{and the control}} room was {{on the second floor}} being only 8 by 14 feet. Later, the control room was moved down to the ground floor.|$|E
50|$|This live {{area was}} {{specially}} designed for band recordings {{with an emphasis}} on separation and natural acoustics. It consists of the live <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> with a Yamaha grand piano, 1 stone drum room, an acoustically variable second drum room and 2 isolation booths.|$|E
30|$|Lens {{distortion}} causes substantial {{error in}} {{edges of the}} <b>recorded</b> <b>area,</b> particularly in some wide-angle cameras. To solve this problem, a commonly used radial distortion correction method [18] was applied. The image coordinates were converted into distortion-free coordinates before the calibration.|$|R

50|$|Kassem {{decided to}} use the church {{sanctuary}} as a <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> due to its superior acoustics.

5000|$|Studio 7 is the <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> where common heard artists on {{the station}} record and play some of their songs live. Since 1992, John Mellencamp, Sarah McLachlan, John Mayer, Lionel Richie, Barenaked Ladies, Alanis Morissette, and others have {{performed}} here while on tour in a major venue in Boston (e.g. Boston Garden, Tweeter Center, etc.).|$|E

For comparison, Studio One at Abbey Road Studios, the London recording studio where The Beatles recorded almost all of their albums and singles between 1962 and 1970, measures 94 {{feet long and}} 55 feet wide and is the world’s largest purpose-built recording studio.|$|E
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to address these and other problems, Panavision {{followed}} this up in 2004 with the Genesis, a full bandwidth (4:4:4) camera with improved colorimetry and sensitometry-related specs and, probably most importantly, a Super 35 mm film-sized <b>recording</b> <b>area,</b> thus making it focally compatible with regular Cine Primo lenses and giving a true 35 mm depth of field.|$|E
50|$|From 1992 to 1995 the van Baelen {{brothers}} {{oversaw the}} first phase of the construction on the new facility. A total of 185,000 man hours was spent in the construction of three studios, a 350m2 live <b>recording</b> <b>area,</b> various adjacent recording areas, a restaurant and hotel accommodations. By using standalone concrete bunkers, mounted on helical springs, they achieved a sound isolation of 100.7dB between each isolated bunker.|$|E

50|$|The band's {{sound is}} heavy with minimal synthesizers and {{electronic}} effects that they call modern rock, however in their earlier <b>records,</b> <b>Area</b> 11's sound commonly blended heavy metal guitar riffs {{with a wider}} more prominent range of synthesizers and electronic effects, which they {{sometimes referred to as}} gaijin rock.|$|R
50|$|The studio had {{a vintage}} 1974 EMI Neve. One of only 7 made. The <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> was a 1000 sq ft main room and mezzanine, with two {{adjoining}} isolation rooms {{and a third}} separate isolation booth. The main room was 20 ft high and was New Zealand's only high-stud professional studio live room. It had virtually no permanent acoustic absorption, relying on room shape and deflective elements to achieve control of reverberation.|$|E
5000|$|During {{his tenure}} with the Record Plant in Los Angeles, Jimmy {{developed}} an even closer friendship with Gary Kellgren {{and the two}} of them took over Sly Stone's custom project studio in Sausalito, CA called [...] "The Pit" [...] that featured eccentric amenities such as a recessed <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> with shag carpeting and secret passages; there, they worked closely with Sly Stone, Paris, Sammy Hagar, Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, and Tower of Power.|$|E
5000|$|In sound recording, {{talkback}} {{refers to}} the intercom system used in recording studios and production control rooms (PCR) in television studios to enable personnel to communicate {{with people in the}} <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> or booth. While the control room can hear the person in the booth over the studio microphones, the person in the booth hears the control room over a PA, monitor speaker, in their headphones or Interruptible feedback (IFB) earpiece. Take numbers, reference data, and sometimes count-ins or remarks are also [...] "stamped" [...] onto recordings through talkback, similar to a clapperboard.|$|E

5000|$|A {{program could}} be saved to mylar-based magnetically coated cards (71 mm &times; 9.5 mm), which were fed through the reader by a small {{electric}} motor through a worm gear and rubber roller at a speed of 6 cm/s. [...] The <b>recording</b> <b>area</b> used {{only half of the}} width of the card. While reversing the card to store a second program was possible, it was officially discouraged (unlike in later models such as the HP-67) because {{the other half of the}} card was touched by the rubber wheel during transport, causing extra abrasion. When inserted into an extra slot between the display and the keyboard, the printing on top of the card would correspond to the top row of keys (A - E), which served as shortcuts to the corresponding program entry points.|$|E
