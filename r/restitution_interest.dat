40|$|The {{attempt to}} combine the {{contractual}} interests properly so-called with the <b>restitution</b> <b>interest</b> in the Fuller and Purdue three interests model of remedies for breach of contract is ineradicably incoherent. Stimulated by reflection on contemporary restitution doctrine’s understanding of the quasi-contractual remedies of recovery and quantum meruit, this paper argues that the complete elimination from the law of contract of the <b>restitution</b> <b>interest,</b> which incorporates those remedies into the three interests model, would improve both the coherence of the model of contractual interests and the substantive law of remedies for breach...|$|E
40|$|Restatement Second of Contracts {{provided}} that contract law serves to protect {{one or more}} of three interests: the expectation interest, the reliance interest, and the <b>restitution</b> <b>interest.</b> There is, however a fourth interest that contract law should and does protect: the disgorgement interest, which is the promisee 2 ̆ 7 s interest in requiring the promisor to disgorge a gain that was made possible by the promisor 2 ̆ 7 s breach, but did not consist of a benefit conferred on the promisor by the promisee. It is not clear why Restatement Second excluded the disgorgement interest. Perhaps the drafters believed that this position was compelled by positive law. That proposition, however, would have been doubtful even when Restatement Second was published, and it is clearly wrong today: some appellate cases, and a handful of trial court cases, have denied protection to the disgorgement interest, but a dozen or so American appellate cases, as well as cases decided by the highest courts of several other common law jurisdictions, have afforded such protection. Alternatively, the drafters of Restatement Second may have believed that the disgorgement interest should not be protected as a normative matter That proposition also cannot be supported. On the contrary, there are strong efficiency reasons, as well as moral reasons, for protecting the disgorgement interest, because in certain categories of cases, protection of that interest in contract law is necessary to provide efficient incentives to the promisor, to effectuate contracts, or to prevent unjust enrichment. Of course, the disgorgement interest should not be protected in all cases in which a promise is legally enforceable, any more than the reliance interest, the <b>restitution</b> <b>interest,</b> or for that matter the expectation interest are protected in all cases. Rather, {{as in the case of}} those interests, the disgorgement interest should be protected when appropriate, and in certain categories of cases protection of the disgorgement interest is always appropriate...|$|E
40|$|In {{contract}} {{disputes between}} transnational contracting parties, damages are often awarded to compensate a claimant for loss, injury or detriment {{resulting from a}} respondent’s failure to perform the agreement. In fact, damages may be the principal means of substituting for performance or they may complement other remedies, such as recision or specific performance. Damages for breach of contract typically serve to protect one of three interests of a claimant: (1) performance interest (also known as expectation interest); (2) reliance interest; or (3) <b>restitution</b> <b>interest.</b> The primary goal of damages in most jurisdictions is to fulfil a claimant’s performance interest by giving the claimant the substitute remedy of the “benefit of the bargain” monetarily. This typically includes compensation for actual loss incurred {{as a result of}} the breach and for net gains, including lost profits, that the claimant was precluded from because of the respondent’s actions. All legal systems place limitations on damage awards. The most common limitations are causation, foreseeability, certainty, fault, and avoidability. In order to obtain damages, there must be a causal connection between the respondent’s breach and the claimant’s loss. In addition, the claimant must show that the loss was foreseeable or not too remote. Further, the claimant is required to show with reasonable certainty the amount of the damage. Many civil law countries also require, as a prerequisite to an award of damages for breach of contract, that the respondent be at fault in breaching the agreement. Damages may also be limited by the doctrine of avoidability, which provides that damages which could have been avoided without undue risk, burden, or humiliation are not recoverable. The rules concerning damages for breach of contract are complex and vary greatly from country to country. Furthermore, in some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, the applicable rules differ among states and provinces. This chapter, which is part of a comprehensive study of the awarding of damages in private international law, focuses on the general rules concerning damages awarded in lieu of performance because of a breach of contract (“performance damages”). It begins with an overview of the purposes served by awarding damages. It then examines performance damages for breach of contract in common law and civil law countries. The study subsequently analyzes the awarding of damages under the Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG), general principles of law, and principles of equity and fairness...|$|E

25|$|According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Barclays' {{inadequate}} supervisory procedures {{failed to}} stop many customers from swapping one mutual fund for another when {{the benefits of}} switching might be undermined by the transaction costs, resulting in $8.63 million of losses for their customers between January 2010 and June 2015.
