The case study is the municipality of Alcorcon, which is served by the new metro line since 2003. Specifically, we explore the location patterns by different industry sectors, to evaluate if the new metro line has encouraged the emergence of a ?Metrosur spatial economy?.

It involves training and development activities that get the community actively involved in the development of their locality. Put simply, capacity {{building is}} any initiative that increases the desire or ability of individuals, groups and organisations to effectively participate in economic development activities. Community capacity building assists groups by enhancing skills essential to <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>planning,</b> development and implementation. Capacity building cannot be seen or undertaken in isolation as it is deeply embedded in the social, economic and political environment. It is about strengthening peoples capacity to determine their own values and priorities and to act on these, which gives us the basis of development. In examining community capacity building and local economic development, it is essential to recognise the importance of building links between social economy organisations and the private sector as well as governments in order to address the complex social and economic problems which all communities confront.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the emerging body of literature examining the interregional income migration in the United States and offers explanations for why certain areas emerge as magnets for nonearnings income flows while other areas are losing this increasingly important source of personal income. By synthesizing ideas from contemporary understandings of life-course influences on migration and earlier work on income migration, the paper builds a theoretical model of factors shaping income migration across space and tests the model with evidence from Census 2000 by using both ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression techniques. The analysis {{highlights the importance of}} life-course understandings of migration in shaping nonearnings income flows across space. Demographic factors such as concentrations of married couples with no children combine with quality-of-life and economic variables to explain nonearnings income migration. Other factors such as housing-market costs and immigration rates shape nonearnings income flows more powerfully in certain regions than in others. The results have important policy implications. With the baby boomers on the cusp of retirement, an understanding of the geographies of nonearnings income will be important for future <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>planning</b> and forecasting, as these income sources will become increasingly large components of total personal income. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the “Concurrent Mining and Reclamation or CMR” technology. CMR technology studies have demonstrated that farmland utilization and water resources development can be minimized and/or enhanced through CMR planning as compared to traditional reclamation approaches. It is an advanced technology in subsidence land reclamation, and a leading technology in the world. The application of CMR in China is explained in this paper through two case studies from different parts of China with different geologic conditions, surface topographic and hydrologic characteristics. Most of the CMR applications to date have focused to minimize the loss of farmland use for agriculture during and after the entire mining process without a consideration of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>planning.</b> Case study II has attempted to quantify impacts of CMR planning on surface hydrologic resources. It has identified another important research area of CMR for minimization and/or enhancement of water resources quantity and quality related to underground mining of coal. Since water resources represent one of the global mega challenges, this area of research has very high potential. Furthermore, CMR planning studies require at a minimum sub-optimization studies, application of principles of systems analysis and operations research need to be incorporated. CMR planning has the potential to develop and sustain emerging economic communities while simultaneously recovering coal as a valuable energy resource. The concepts and technologies are scientifically sound with potential for applications around the global.|$|R
40|$|Accessibility is {{a concept}} that has become central to {{physical}} planning during the past 50 years; improving accessibility is an aim that has now made its way into mainstream transport planning and policymaking throughout the world. Batty (2009) traces the origins of the concept back to the 1920 s. It was used in location theory and <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>planning,</b> becoming important once transport planning began, mainly in North America where it was associated with transport networks and trip distribution patterns. Its conceptual basis dates back further. Hansen (1959), in his classic and much cited expose, ‘How accessibility shapes land use’ rolled out our first real definition: the potential for interaction (based on the notion of potential traced back to the social physics school in the nineteenth century). Several authors have written review articles on accessibility measures, often focusing on a particular category of accessibility, such as location-based accessibility (Martin and Reggiani, 2007; Reggiani, 1998), person-based accessibility (e. g., Kwan, 1998; Pirie, 1979) or utility-based accessibility (e. g., Koenig, 1980; Niemeier, 1997). Here we use the review of Geurs and van Wee (2004), as a point of departure to look at accessibility measures from different perspectives (land use, transport, social as well as economic impacts). We also use the typology of accessibility measures developed by Halden, which classified accessibility measures according {{to the ways in which}} they had been successfully used (Halden, 2003) ...|$|R
