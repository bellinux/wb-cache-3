40|$|INTRODUCTION The main {{requirement}} of maintenance and renovation of bridges is the continuous {{inspection of the}} condition and corrosion state of the bridges during the whole lifetime. The required mode, depth and frequency of inspections is defined in regulations. Carrying out these investigations is rather costly apart from the simple visual supervision. The most commonly accepted method in Hungary of examining the statical behaviour of the structure at <b>regular</b> <b>supervisions</b> is the load test. The load test is carryed out by placing known concentrated forces on given points of the bridge and measuring the displacements. By {{increasing the number of}} the positions of load and points of measuring the "weak cross-sections" can be determined with approximate accuracy.

40|$|Background: Research {{has shown}} that {{families}} of disabled children who have a key worker benefit from this service and recent policy initiatives {{emphasize the importance of}} such services. However, research is lacking on which characteristics of key worker schemes for disabled children are related to better outcomes for families. Methods: A postal questionnaire was completed by 189 parents with disabled children who were receiving a service in seven key worker schemes in England and Wales. Path analysis was used to investigate associations between characteristics of the services and outcomes for families (satisfaction with the service, impact of key worker on quality of life, parent unmet need, child unmet need). Results: The four path models showed that key workers carrying out more aspects of the key worker role, appropriate amounts of contact with key workers, <b>regular</b> training, <b>supervision</b> and peer support for key workers, and having a dedicated service manager and a clear job description for key workers were associated with better outcomes for families. Characteristics of services had only a small impact on child unmet need, suggesting that other aspects of services were affecting child unmet need. Conclusions: Implications for policy and practice are discussed, including the need for <b>regular</b> training, <b>supervision</b> and peer support for key workers and negotiated time and resources for them to carry out the role. These influence the extent to which key workers carry out all aspects of the key worker's role and their amount of contact with families, which in turn impact on outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to assess QoL {{depending}} on the choice of therapeutic regimen. From a total of 200 patients, half (n =  100) were treated with insulin (66 % were females, age 52. 1  ±  7. 4 —group A), the remaining 100 received oral treatment (74 % females, age 63. 3  ±  8. 3 —group B). For self-assessment of QoL, the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was used. In group A, we found a negative influence of increased level of glycemia and occurrence of coexisting diseases in the somatic domain. In the psychological domain, frequent checkups showed a positive influence while circulatory failure produced negative results. For social domain, disobeying of recommended diet was strongly negative as well as increased levels of glycemia and coexisting disease for environmental domain. In group B, for somatic domain, correct values of glycemia and place of residence had positive influence. Incorrect values of BMI, WHR, and co-existing disease influenced the same domain negatively. In the psychological domain, a positive influence had place of residence but a negative BMI, ischemic heart disease, clinical complications. For environmental domain, a positive influence had correct values of glycemia but a negative BMI, ischemic heart disease and clinical complications. Finally, the social domain for group B was negatively influenced by BMI, ischemic heart disease, clinical complications, and lack of <b>regular</b> <b>supervisions</b> of glycemia level.

This article seeks to analyse school inspectors’ {{work in the}} Swedish school inspectorate’s <b>regular</b> <b>supervision.</b> The {{research}} problem revolves around tensions between, on the one hand, juridical and standardised scripts for action and tacit and embodied professional knowledge on the other. The inspectorate’s prevalent search for ‘equivalent judgements’ and the high stakes nature of inspectors’ judgement making give rise to complicated professional dilemmas and what Peter Dahler-Larsen labels constitutive effects. Inspectors struggle with their judgements and seek to merge programmatic and technical elements within the current model of <b>regular</b> <b>supervision</b> with their accumulated professional experience. The article draws {{particular attention to the}} inspectorate’s urge to make the implicit explicit. Inspectors’ oblige inspectees to provide detailed descriptions of their work; i e to be inspectable.

40|$|Abstract Background Individuals {{affected}} by severe Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are often heavy users of Mental Health Services (MHS). Short-term treatments currently used in BPD therapy are useful to target disruptive behaviors {{but they are}} less effective in reducing heavy MHS use. Therefore, alternative short-term treatments, less complex than long-term psychodynamic psychotherapies but specifically oriented to BPD core problems, {{need to be developed}} to reduce MHS overuse. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding Sequential Brief Adlerian Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (SB-APP) to Supervised Team Management (STM) in BPD treatment compared to STM alone in a naturalistic group of heavy MHS users with BPD. Effectiveness was evaluated 6 times along a two-year follow-up. Methods Thirty-five outpatients who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (STM = 17; SB-APP = 18) and then compared. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and CGI-modified (CGI-M) for BPD, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), and Symptom Checklist- 90 Revised (SCL- 90 -R) were administered at T 1, T 3, T 6, T 12, T 18 and T 24. At T 12 the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form (WAI-S) was also completed. At the one-year follow-up, SB-APP group did not receive any additional individual psychological support. MHS team was specifically trained in BPD treatment and had <b>regular</b> <b>supervisions.</b> Results All patients improved on CGI, GAF, and STAXI scores after 6 and 12 months, independently of treatment received. SB-APP group showed better outcome on impulsivity, suicide attempts, chronic feelings of emptiness, and disturbed relationships. We found a good stabilization at the one year follow-up, even after the interruption of brief psychotherapy in the SB-APP group. Conclusions Although STM for BPD applied to heavy MHS users was effective in reducing symptoms and improving their global functioning, adding a time-limited and focused psychotherapy was found to achieve a better outcome. In particular, focusing treatment on patients' personality with a specific psychotherapeutic approach (i. e. SB-APP) seemed to be more effective than STM alone.
