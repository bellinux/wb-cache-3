40|$|ABSTRACT. Buchenavia tomentosa Eichler is {{a common}} plant in Brazilian cerrado. Fruits of this plant are {{employed}} in human feeding and folk medicine. Cattle producers affirm that consumption of the fruits cause abortion in cows, and even death. Considering that the plant may be consumed by pregnant women and animals, {{the present study was}} undertaken to evaluate the possible toxic effects of the ingestion of B. tomentosa fruit (10 % added to the diet), from the first to the twenty-first days of gestation, on reproductive parameters and on physical and neurobehavioral development of rats offspring. An increase in food consumption at pregnancy days 11 and 17, and weight increase at day 17 of pregnancy were observed. Besides that, we verified an increase in weight of male offspring on post natal day 1. Other parameters were not affected by plant consumption. These results indicate that the consumption of B. tomentosa at 10 % during pregnancy cause slight toxicological effects. The changes verified in the present study indicate toxic action of the fruit possibly induced by flavonoids with hormonal action; however, further studies must be accomplished to corroborate this hypothesis.

40|$|Germ-line {{mutations}} of {{the mouse}} have for years comprised one class of biological markers for mammalian <b>reproductive</b> and developmental <b>toxicology.</b> Understanding the molecular nature of mutations and the mechanisms by which mutations are translated into specific (and often complex) phenotypes, however, still looms as a major goal of mammalian biology. Molecular genetic analysis of heritable mouse mutations constitutes a significant, experimentally malleable strategy for relating genomic DNA structure to genic expression and function in mammals. The integrated use of recombinant DNA technology, which allows both the identification and analysis of expression of single genes, and classical genetic and cytogenetic analysis, which allow the important correlation between basic DNA defects and the organismic consequences of such defects, has been crucial to this strategy. Some of the approaches (e. g., specific-gene cloning, random-clone analysis of genomic regions, insertional mutagenesis) for studying the nature and effect of both mutations and their wild-type counterparts that have resulted from this integration of genetic analysis and molecular biology have been applied to many loci within the murine genome.

To better understand the impact of histochemical publications onto the different biological and medical disciplines, it was useful to look at the journals where the articles published in a multidisciplinary journal of histochemistry have been cited: it was observed that, in the five-years period considered, 20 % only of the citations were in histochemical periodicals, the remaining ones being in journals of Cell & Tissue biology,  general and experimental Medicine, Oncology, Biochemistry & Molecular biology, Neurobiology, Anatomy & Morphology, Pharmacology & <b>Toxicology,</b> <b>Reproductive</b> biology, Veterinary sciences, Physiology, Endocrinology, Tissue engineering & Biomaterials,  as well as in multidisciplinary journals.

40|$|Vaginally applied {{antimicrobial}} compounds (microbicides) {{are being}} developed as an alternative method for preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. In addition to identifying compounds effective against a spectrum of sexually transmitted pathogens, {{it will be important}} to ensure that these compounds are safe. Avoiding toxicity, inflammatory responses, or alteration of the function of resident immune cells are important consid-erations for the development of vaginally applied microbicides. Studies were performed with two classes of candidate microbi-cide compounds to determine if they would interfere with the recognition of antigen by CD 41 and CD 81 T lymphocytes. The presence of nontoxic concentrations of the anionic detergent cholic acid or the sulfated polymer lambda carrageenan did not inhibit recognition of immune peptide by antigen-specific T cells. However, antigen recognition by both CD 41 and CD 81 T lymphocytes was inhibited {{in the presence of the}} naphthalene sulfonate polymer PRO 2000. Brief (4 -h) exposure of antigen-presenting cells or T cells to PRO 2000 did not result in inhi-bition of antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells or the ability of specific T cells to respond to antigen stim-ulation, suggesting that the inhibition was temporary. Binding of antibodies specific for CD 18, CD 8, and CD 3 was impaired in the presence of PRO 2000, suggesting that the mechanism by which this microbicide inhibits T cell recognition of antigenic peptide may involve masking or internalization of surface pro-teins involved in T cell signaling or stabilizing T cell-antigen-presenting cell interactions. The assays described in this study represent a useful means to screen candidate topical microbi-cide compounds for inappropriate interactions with immune cells and may be useful for prioritization of candidate micro-bicide compounds. female <b>reproductive</b> tract, immunology, <b>toxicology,</b> vagin...|$|R
40|$|During life {{humans are}} exposed to diverse {{hazardous}} compounds, which can have toxicological effects. <b>Reproductive</b> and developmental <b>toxicology</b> are research areas dedicated {{to the study of}} the potential of a compound to affect male and female fertility, and development of the embryo and fetus during pregnancy, respectively. An important developmental process is the development of the neural system. The developing brain is more susceptible to toxic interference and can be affected at doses much lower than those affecting adult brain function. Alterations in these processes can result in severe congenital abnormalities of the nervous system of humans. Developmental neuro toxicity testing (DNT) is therefore an important toxicological area in the hazard and risk assessment of chemicals. Regulatory toxicity testing requires an enormous number of test animals. These in vivo tests are time consuming, expensive and give rise to many ethical concerns. To reduce the number of test animals used for reproductive toxicity testing, there is a need for high throughput alternative test methods. The use of embryonic stem cells (ESC) offers a great alternative, since they are able to differentiate into all cell types originating from the three germ layers in vitro. Therefore, ESC offer the ability to mimic early in vivo embryonic development. We studied the use of both mouse ESC (mESC) differentiation towards both myocardial and neural cells, and human ESC (hESC) differentiation towards neural cells, with transcriptomics to study gene expression as an indicator of developmental toxicity. Using mESC within the Embryonic Stem cell Test (EST) we demonstrated that the use of transcriptomics as a read-out after 24 hours of exposure enables ranking of compounds of one compound class of phthalates based on their potency, corresponding to existing in vitro and in vivo data. To lower the number of genes normally involved in whole genome array analysis, we described a statistical method to obtain smaller gene sets usable for potency ranking. Subsequently, a mESC based neural differentiation assay (mESTn) was developed as an alternative method for DNT. In the mESTn the effects of methyl mercury on neural outgrowth was demonstrated. However, mouse based test systems have a limited ability to the human toxicity response, due to differences in biological mechanisms, pathways and pharmacokinetics. Therefore, human based test systems are preferred for human risk analysis. We have developed a neural differentiation assay based on hESC cells (hESTn), as an alternative for DNT. The effects on neural differentiation of two anticonvulsant drugs, valproic acid and carbamazepine were studied. Neural differentiation and developmental processes were affected by drug exposure. Ultimately, with a comparative study between the mESTn and the hESTn it was shown that there were common genes regulates in both assays, involved in neural differentiation and affected by compound exposure...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{a report on the}} Fourth Berlin Workshop on Terminology in Developmental Toxicology, which was held in April 2002. The {{workshop}} is part of an international project in the field of harmonization of terminology in developmental toxicology supported by IPCS. The goal of the Harmonization Project is to ensure better chemical risk assessment. The aim of this Fourth Workshop was to discuss the results of a previously conducted survey on classification of external and visceral anomalies, which are listed in the international glossary, developed under the auspices of IFTS (1997 glossary). The discussions among experts from research institutions, regulatory agencies, and industries were mainly focussed on terms for which there was disagreement and/or uncertainties and the possible reasons. For the illustration of "gray-zone" anomalies, pictures were provided by the participants, which constituted the basis for detailed discussions. There was high agreement that most of the external anomalies (> 66 %) should be classified as malformations. The few external anomalies for which there was low agreement to classify as a malformation were discussed in detail. None of the external findings, which had in the survey a high agreement, were categorized as a variation. A high agreement regarding the classification of approximately one-third of visceral anomalies was achieved with 34 and 2 % being described as malformation and variation, respectively. Most of the visceral findings had low agreement indices and there appeared to be several reasons for this. Thus, the response, 'Not known/not used in the laboratory' (N) was often given. A couple of reasons for difficulties in the classification of an anomaly were that it is only rarely seen upon fetal examination or tends to be species specific. Furthermore, the classification of some anomalies as malformation or variation will remain vague as the decision must be made on a case-by-case basis. Factors affecting the decision include: the availability of appropriate historical control data, description of the grading and severity, whether the anomaly occurs in isolation or whether there is a relationship with an abnormal process, and finally, if the change represents an irreversible one, affecting human and/or animal health. It was concluded that a severity grading, supported by pictures of the anomaly, would be especially helpful to classify certain changes as malformation or as variation. Several of the soft tissue changes were considered likely to be the consequence of functional disorders and thus not strictly developmental anomalies. The possibility to describe a finding as 'Not Malformation' (Unclassified) was agreed upon. As a general conclusion it was emphasized that the observation of a permanent structural change should be considered to be a warning of possible consequences to humans, even when there is no apparent adverse effect on health and survival in adult animals of the species under investigation. Therefore, research is needed to further investigate postnatal consequences. Future collaboration in the field of <b>reproductive</b> and developmental <b>toxicology</b> should aim to further develop and implement a harmonized approach to the interpretation of study data. Therefore, this terminology work will continue in close cooperation with the IPCS Harmonization Project.
