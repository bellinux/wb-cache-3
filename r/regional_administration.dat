25|$|In the 21st century, {{the city}} has been working on new {{projects}} to restore itself as the strategic capital within the country. Rapid urban growth, including the mass migration of peasants to the main cities, attracted by economic development, has led to the demand of numerous proposals to accommodate such growth. Barranquilla has always been famous for its chaotic urban planning, understandable given its spontaneous origin as a port and the reality of high administrative corruption which has hampered the channeling of resources for building an urban centre of greater structure and dimensions. The presentation of a new infrastructure, changes in local and <b>regional</b> <b>administration,</b> decentralization since 1991, international pressure to open markets, and competition between the other major Colombian cities will bring about considerable development in Barranquilla into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Norway's <b>regional</b> <b>administration</b> is {{organised}} in 19 counties (fylke), with 18 of them {{subdivided into}} 431 municipalities (kommune) per 1 January 2006. The municipal sector is {{a provider of}} vital services to the Norwegian public, accounting for about 20% of Norwegian GNP and 24% of total employment. Norway had 435 municipalities of varying size in 2003, each administered by an elected municipal council. They are grouped into 19 counties (fylker), each governed by an elected county council. Each county is headed by a governor appointed by the king in council. Oslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 18 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years. The municipalities have wide powers over the local economy, with the state exercising strict supervision. They {{have the right to}} tax and to use their resources to support education, libraries, social security, and public works such as streetcar lines, gas and electricity works, roads, and town planning, but they are usually aided in these activities by state funds.|$|E
40|$|Regions and {{regional}} identity {{have become more}} important over the last decades. At the same time regions have become less discernable as distinct historically rooted spatial entities. Globalisation {{and the decline of}} collective identities through individualisation transform both this regional reality and how regions are conceptualised. This article analyses the shifts in types of regional identities used by <b>regional</b> <b>administrations</b> in an increasingly competitive environment. It uses the contrast between ‘thick’ traditional and historical rooted well-established regional identities, and ‘thin’ regional identities which are more transitory and focus more on economic competitiveness. These concepts are used to analyse the regional identity of <b>regional</b> <b>administrations</b> in Northwest Germany and the Netherlands. Hybrid regional identities combining a locally specific mix of thick and thin elements of regional identity, and which link up with regional identities at other relevant scales, appear to be the most effective regional identities for <b>regional</b> <b>administrations</b> facing the challenges of both globalisation and the decline in collective identities...|$|R

Police repelled an attack by pro-Russian militants upon an office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Krasnyi Lyman on 12 April, but the building was later captured by the separatists after a skirmish.

This created an outcry within the Jewish community of Russia. The controversy was further exacerbated by Klykov's connections with Pamyat and other anti-Semitic organizations, {{as well as by}} his involvement in the [...] "letter of 500", a controversial appeal to the Prosecutor General to review all Jewish organizations in Russia for extremism.
