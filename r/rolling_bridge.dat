5|$|In 1913, the Hull Bridge {{upstream}} of Beverley, {{which had}} caused so much disagreement in the 18th century {{until it had}} been replaced in 1801, was demolished by the County Council, who installed a steel <b>rolling</b> <b>bridge</b> in its place. Once the Tickton Bypass bridge had been built a short distance upstream, it no longer needed to carry road traffic, and it {{was replaced by a}} footbridge in 1976.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first section}} of present-day MD 304 to be paved was the Bridgetown Road segment, which was built as a state aid road by 1915. [...] Water Street, Railroad Avenue, and Ruthsburg Road east to <b>Rolling</b> <b>Bridge</b> Road were paved as a state aid road by 1921. [...] Chesterfield Avenue was paved as a state road in 1924 and 1925. [...] Corsica Neck Road and a new bridge across the Corsica River were {{completed}} in 1935, and designated MD 606. [...] MD 304 was extended to a point just east of present-day US 301 in 1938. [...] The state highway was extended to Greenville Road in 1942 and to MD 481 in Ruthsburg in 1948.|$|E
50|$|Scherzer was the {{inventor}} of a refinement of the Bascule bridge called the Scherzer <b>rolling</b> lift <b>bridge.</b> His last engineering work before he died, done in 1893, was the design of two of these <b>rolling</b> lift <b>bridges</b> in Chicago. His design pivots the bridge like a rocking horse. The friction is lowered because it is rolling friction. Moreover when the bridge is open the channel is completely free as the mechanism has rolled away the bridge from the edge leaving the passage free for wide traffic. The first <b>rolling</b> lift <b>bridge</b> ever built was the Van Buren Street Bridge {{in the city of}} Chicago and was patented by Scherzer. The second <b>rolling</b> lift <b>bridge</b> constructed spanned the Chicago River between Jackson and Van Buren Streets. These bridge projects were for the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad Company.|$|R

50|$|Fort Nelson is {{a typical}} Polygonal or Palmerston Fort. It is six-sided with a deep ditch {{protected}} by three caponiers. Above each caponier is a well-protected emplacement for 13-inch mortars. It was originally entered by two Guthrie <b>rolling</b> <b>bridges</b> and has a barrack block for 172 officers and men, protected by a V-shaped redan. A large open parade ground gives access to the magazines 40 feet underneath it. There are open emplacements on the ramparts for 64 pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns and RML 6.6-inch howitzers. There are also three Haxo casemates for 7 inch rifled breech-loaders.|$|R

5000|$|In 2002 Heatherwick Studio {{designed}} The <b>Rolling</b> <b>Bridge</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "the curling bridge") {{as part of}} a redevelopment of Paddington Basin. The bridge unfolds across the Grand Union Canal every Friday at noon. To give access to upcoming water traffic, the bridge curls into an octagon. The bridge consists of eight triangular sections hinged at the walkway level and is connected above by two part links that collapse towards the deck under the control of hydraulic pistons. The <b>Rolling</b> <b>Bridge</b> won the 2005 British Structural Steel Award.|$|E
50|$|Access to {{the fort}} was down a curving ramp {{cut into the}} glacis, then through a {{gatehouse}} set deep in the scarp of the ditch, reached by a <b>rolling</b> <b>bridge</b> that withdrew into the gatehouse.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional use of {{the term}} [...] "rolling bridge" [...] dates from at least the Victorian era, and is used to {{describe}} a type of retractable drawbridge used to span a ditch or moat surrounding a fortification. That type of bridge is not hinged, and remains horizontal when it is rolled inside the gates of a fort. Modern versions are called retractable bridges or thrust bridges. One particular version of the <b>rolling</b> <b>bridge</b> type was known as the Guthrie <b>rolling</b> <b>bridge,</b> examples of which may still be seen at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth. Certain types of bascule bridges roll on an arc; an example is the Pegasus Bridge.|$|E

50|$|A Guthrie <b>rolling</b> <b>bridge</b> {{was a kind}} of {{retractable}} bridge, an 18th-century {{version of}} the drawbridge. It was commonly installed as the access across the narrow steep sided ditches characteristic of the polygonal forts of this era.|$|E

5000|$|... 1893 Lift bridge patent - Because of Scherzer's early demise, {{his brother}} {{took over the}} Scherzer Rolling Lift Bridge Company and derived {{fourteen}} additional related patents pertaining to <b>rolling</b> lift <b>bridges</b> and built 175 of these type bridges nationwide by 1916.|$|R
50|$|The STREAM {{consists}} of 30 test items involving upper-limb movements, lower-limb movements, and basic mobility items. It is a clinical measure of voluntary movements and general mobility (<b>rolling,</b> <b>bridging,</b> sit-to-stand, standing, stepping, walking and stairs) following a stroke. The voluntary movement {{part of the}} assessment is measured using a 3-point ordinal scale (unable to perform, partial performance, and complete performance) and the mobility part of the assessment uses a 4-point ordinal scale (unable, partial, complete with aid, complete no aid). The maximum score one can receive on the STREAM is a 70 (20 for each limb score and 30 for mobility score). The higher the score, the better movement and mobility is available for the individual being scored.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} {{bridge was}} constructed between 1898 and 1902 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (replacing an earlier bridge) {{as one of}} two through girder Scherzer <b>rolling</b> bascule <b>bridges</b> on the New Haven Line. The bridge consisted of twin parallel rolling lift spans.|$|R

50|$|By the mid-1890s, the fort's {{armament}} became obsolete, {{and instead}} of upgrading the armaments, the nearby Pembroke Battery was built. The fort became an ammunition depot and storage area for small arms ammunition. Its gate was widened and a fixed metal bridge replaced the original <b>rolling</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1913, the new {{bridge was}} {{demolished}} by the County Council, who installed a steel <b>rolling</b> <b>bridge</b> in its place.

50|$|As the {{condition}} of the line could no longer handle the ever-increasing traffic, Stralsund station was rebuilt in 1905 and the track was duplicated in 1907 and 1908. At the same time the Peene bridge in Anklam was replaced, with the old <b>rolling</b> bascule <b>bridge</b> replaced by two bascule bridges with a span of 32 metres.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} an {{electrically}} powered road bridge {{built on the}} Scherzer <b>rolling</b> lift <b>bridge</b> principle road bridge, built in 1925 {{to the design of}} Alfred C.

It was formally opened by the Prince of Wales (Edward VIII), commemorated on a plaque on the bridge.|$|R
