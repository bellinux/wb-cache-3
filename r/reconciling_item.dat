40|$|In December 2007 the SEC {{issued a}} formal rule release that allows foreign-private issuers that employ the IFRS to file their {{financial}} statements without providing a reconciliation to U. S. GAAP. While the rule change was made after the SEC received and analyzed comments from various constituents on the proposing release, the rule change {{has not been}} without controversy and may {{have argued that the}} decision was 'premature', based at least partially on evidence of the usefulness of the reconciliations to investors and others. The purpose of our study is to provide a more complete picture of the information that will be lost to investors due to the rule change. Our analysis focuses on the quantitative values included in the reconciliation, a measure of the information formerly required by the SEC. We identify 100 FPIs that filed 20 -Fs during 2006 using IFRS. We collect and classify the line-by-line amounts into 22 categories and, using this classification, examine the frequency, magnitude, and sign of the <b>reconciling</b> <b>items.</b> We also sort the FPIs based on market cap (size) and industry and provide the same statistics within those groups. In our analyses we document that there are a few categories where a large proportion of FPIs have reported <b>reconciling</b> <b>items</b> while there are several categories where <b>reconciling</b> <b>items</b> are relatively infrequent. In addition, we observe that size does seem to matter; the frequency, magnitude, and sign of the <b>reconciling</b> <b>items</b> differ across size groups. We also observe differences across industry groups. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research analyzing reconciliations of net income and stockholders’ equity from reports prepared according to Germany's Commercial Code (HGB) to either International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP). We describe the distribution of the <b>reconciling</b> <b>items</b> and assess their value relevance to firm market values 3 months after the financial statement date. The work helps to identify many issues not apparent from research that focuses only on promulgated accounting standards. Among other things, the research presented in this paper demonstrates that, when reconciling to IFRS or US GAAP, German companies must reverse significant software and film licensing revenue. Other areas of significant difference, not surprisingly, show greater conservatism in reporting under HGB than IFRS or US GAAP, particularly in asset capitalizations and write-offs as well as in accruals of provisions and reserves. The latter category is value relevant to the firms’ market values after controlling for all other categories of <b>reconciling</b> <b>items</b> from HGB to either IFRS or US GAAP, indicating that German markets value these companies’ provisions and accruals under the German reporting system...|$|R

S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U. S. GAAP) from 2004 - 2006. The application of IFRS generally resulted in higher net income than U. S. GAAP. Many differences have already been resolved by the convergence projects of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board.

40|$|We {{measure the}} {{preparedness}} of listed firms for international financial reporting standards (IFRS) {{by changes in}} explanations from Australian GAAP to IFRS between the half-year and annual accounts. About one-third of sample firms changed their explanations for earnings, cashflows or equity by averages of about - 7 %, 67 % and 3 % respectively. Most changes are less than 5 % for earnings and equity, and tax is the item most commonly revised. More profitable firms and firms with more <b>reconciling</b> <b>items</b> {{are most likely to}} change an explanation. In a telephone survey of chief financial officers, 70 % revealed that the change followed an incorrect application of an accounting rule in the half-year accounts.

25|$|Asset tracking: {{companies}} {{needing to}} track valuable assets for insurance or other monitoring purposes can now plot the real-time asset location {{on a map}} and closely monitor movement and operating status. For example, haulage and logistics companies often operate trucks with detachable load carrying units. In this case, trailers can be tracked independently of the cabs used to drive them.

40|$|PURPOSE - This study {{seeks to}} {{examine the impact of}} Australian {{equivalents}} to international financial reporting standards (A-IFRS) on the accounts of small-, medium- and large-sized firms. DESIGN/ METHODOLOGY/ APPROACH - For 135 listed Australian entities, the half-yearly accounts ended 30 June 2005 are examined to identify the effects of A-IFRS. Data are gathered on the change in major balance sheet and income statement elements, the major <b>reconciling</b> <b>items</b> and earnings variability. FINDINGS - Findings show {{that more than half of}} small firms have no change in net income or equity from A-IFRS, and that there is an increase in the number of adjustments to net income and equity with firm size. The study also finds that A-IFRS has increased net income for small- and medium-sized firms. Equity has increased (decreased) under A-IFRS for small (large) firms. Small firms experience higher earnings variability than medium-sized or large firms under A-IFRS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS / IMPLICATIONS - The sample is limited to 31 December reporting date firms and not all A-IFRS must be complied with when firms restate their comparatives. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - Analysts, auditors and other account users should be aware that the effects of A-IFRS are correlated with firm size. ORIGINALITY / VALUE - This is the first Australian empirical paper on the effects of A-IFRS. It raises doubts about the contentions of some that A-IFRS will have widespread adverse effects on firms&# 039; accounts...|$|R
5|$|In the 1944 {{legislative}} session, {{the rival}} parties fought to a stalemate over the budget. The primary issue was deciding who would control the state's sizable budget surplusthe legislature or the governor. In {{an effort to}} unify the two sides, Willis backed off his call for a repeal of the income tax; another legislator proposed the repeal anyway, but it was defeated. Two months {{after the end of}} the session, Willis called a special session to <b>reconcile</b> the educational <b>items</b> in the budget. Once in session, legislators approved a full budget. The vote to accept the budget was deemed invalid, however, because approving a full budget was not part of Willis's initial call for a special session. In response, Willis called a second special session, and the Assembly passed a full budget on June 16, 1944.|$|R
