30|$|In this study, {{we focus}} on reconstructing 4 -D light field from images on an {{illuminated}} object. In order to estimate 4 -D light field, most of conventional works directly capture {{a huge number of}} images for all the directions from all 3 -D positions and resultantly, they suffer from the cost problem for measuring all rays. Instead of direct capturing, our method estimates unknown parameters of the 4 -D light field so that the images rendered with reconstructed lighting would become as similar as possible with captured original images based on an inverse lighting techniques [4]. To achieve the goal of both accurate and robust estimation, we have developed a new inverse lighting method based on a convex optimization technique. Our method introduces the range of possible <b>radiant</b> <b>intensities</b> from a physical constraint and it actualizes the reconstruction of the 4 -D light field from a few images.|$|R

2500|$|The candela ( [...] or symbol: cd) is {{the base}} unit of {{luminous}} intensity in the International System of Units (SI); that is, luminous power per unit solid angle emitted by a point light source {{in a particular}} direction. Luminous intensity is analogous to <b>radiant</b> <b>intensity,</b> but instead of simply adding up the contributions of every wavelength {{of light in the}} source's spectrum, the contribution of each wavelength is weighted by the standard luminosity function (a model of the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths).

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for estimating light sources from a single image of a scene that is illuminated by major near point light sources, a few directional light sources and ambient light. We propose to employ a pair of reference spheres as light probes and introduce the difference sphere that we acquire by differencing the inten-sities of two image regions of the reference spheres. Because the effect by directional light sources and ambient light is eliminated by differencing, the key advantage of considering the difference sphere is that it enables us to identify near point light sources including their <b>radiant</b> <b>intensities.</b> We also show that analysis of gray level contours on spherical surfaces facilitates separate identification of multiple combined light sources and is well suited to the difference sphere. We demonstrate the effec-tiveness of the entire algorithm with experimental results while also investigating the applicability to an open scanner in indoor scene.

40|$|The {{basis for}} the {{application}} of Thomson scattering to the analysis of coronagraph images has been laid decades ago. Even though the basic formulation is undebated, a discussion has grown in recent years about the spatial distribution of Thomson scatter sensitivity in the corona and the inner heliosphere. These notes are an attempt to clarify the understanding of this topic. We reformulate the classical scattering calculations in a more transparent way using modern SI-compatible quantities extended to field correlation matrices. The resulting concise formulation is easily extended to the case of relativistic electrons. For relativistic electrons we calculate the Stokes parameters of the scattered radiation and determine changes in degree and orientation of its polarisation, blue-shift and <b>radiant</b> <b>intensities</b> depending on the electron velocity magnitude and direction. We discuss the probability to see these relativistic effects in white-light coronagraph observations of the solar corona.

40|$|Movements of stomata {{responding}} to visible and infrared radiations were analyzed in an intact cucumber leaf by applying an improved heat balance method {{for evaluation of}} transpiration rate and leaf conductance. In step response to the visible radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) induced dynamics of water balance in the whole leaf through osmotic change in guard cells and mesophyll, and resulted in hydroactive stomatal oscillation with a natural period of about 30 min at the higher <b>radiant</b> <b>intensities.</b> In the infrared radiation, leaf-air vapor density difference (W_L-W_A) was rapidly raised by the thermal effect of the radiation, and subsequently rapid increase in the peristomatal transpiration caused hydropassive stomatal opening through hydraulic interaction between guard cells and adjacent epidermal cells. This hydropassive stomatal opening was more active at the more rapid changes in W_L-W_A; there was a linear relationship between degree of the hydropassive stomatal opening and changing rate of W_L-W_A. Thus, the visible radiation containing PAR brought about the hydroactive stomatal movement mainly through physiological processes, whereas the infrared radiation caused the hydropassive stomatal movement through physical processes {{in response to the}} thermal effect...|$|R

40|$|Our pattern theoretic {{approach}} to automatic target recognition for infrared scenes combines structured and unstruc-tured representations: rigid, 3 -D faceted models for known targets {{of interest and}} flexible, simply connected shapes to accommodate the unknown "clutterers " that the algorithm may encounter. The <b>radiant</b> <b>intensities</b> of both kinds of targets form nuisance variables which are incorporated into the parameter space. Statistical inference proceeds by simulating hypothesized scenes and comparing them to the collected data via a likelihood function. For a given target pose, we derive closed-form expressions for estimates of the thermodynamic variables via a weighted least-squares approximation. Since the number ofobjects in the scene, both rigid and flexible, is unknown and must be estimated, the parameter space is a union of subspaces of varying dimension. Without constraints on the model order, scene descriptions may become too complex. We apply Rissanen's minimu:m description length (MDL) principle, which offers a mathematical foundation for balancing the brevity of descriptions against their fidelity to the data. For continuous parameters, the description length involves the log-determinant of the empirical Fisher information matrix. The relationship of Rissanen's MDL to Schwartz's application of Laplace's method of integration and to the Cramer-Rao bound are discussed. Examples of likelihood surfaces and associated complexity penalties are given for synthetic tank data. In these experiments, the minimum description length approach correctly deduces the number of thermodynamic parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of realistic graphics is {{the creation}} of images that provoke the same responses that a viewer would have to a real scene. This STAR addresses two related key problem areas in this effort which are located at opposite ends of the rendering pipeline, namely the data structures used to describe light during the actual rendering process, and the issue of displaying such <b>radiant</b> <b>intensities</b> in a meaningful way. The interest in the first of these subproblems {{stems from the fact that}} it is common industry practice to use RGB colour values to describe light intensity and surface reflectancy. While viable in the context of methods that do not strive to achieve true realism, this approach has to be replaced by more physically accurate techniques if a prediction of nature is intended. The second subproblem is that while research into ways of rendering images provides us with better and faster methods, we do not necessarily see their full effect due to limitations of the display hardware. The low dynamic range of a standard computer monitor requires some form of mapping to produce images that are perceptually accurate. Tone reproduction operators attempt to replicate the effect of real-world luminance intensities. This STAR report will review the work to date on spectral rendering and tone reproduction techniques. It will include an investigation into the need for spectral imagery synthesis methods and accurate tone reproduction, and a discussion of major approaches to physically correct rendering and key tone mapping algorithms.

Results suggest that finger withdrawal latencies to low intensity heat were increased following shock presentation, providing additional evidence that fear reduces pain on a measure that is influenced by supraspinal processes. Both self-report and physiological (SCL, HR, BP) measures of emotion confirmed that the intended affective states were induced. Finger temperature was unaffected by emotion manipulations; thus, skin cooling does not appear to mediate increased withdrawal latencies.
