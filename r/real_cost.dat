[...] Part of the cost of making pretzels is that neither the flour nor the morning are available any longer, for use in some other way.

40|$|Bankruptcy-related costs may be {{categorized}} into four areas: (1) <b>Real</b> <b>costs</b> {{borne by the}} distressed firm; (2) <b>Real</b> <b>costs</b> borne directly by the claimants; (3) Losses to the distressed firm that are offset by gains to other entities; (4) <b>Real</b> <b>costs</b> borne by parties other than the distressed firm or its claimants. Cost categories 1, 2, and 3 are relevant for claimants, while Categories 1, 2, and 4 are relevant for society. Focusing on the first three categories, the present study reaches the following conclusions: First, after allowing for their costs of collections, claimsholders recover approximately 56 % of the bankrupt firm’s predistress value (PDV). Second, dealing with financial distress generally consumes between 12 % and 20 % of the distressed firm’s PDV. Taking the midpoint of this range (16 %) implies that the losses {{that lead to the}} firm’s distress average approximately 28 % of its PDV. These estimated values demonstrate the importance of bankruptcy costs in determining an optimal capital structure and explaining the level of risk premiums. Because of its impact on risk premiums, the cost of capital and needed tax rates, the cost of dealing with financial distress has an adverse impact on resourc...|$|R

Wright estimated it would cost $5,000, yet the Suttons ultimately paid $10,000 and were furious. The experience of going well over budget was one shared by most of Wright's clients.

More bluntly, Paul Sprague states that [...] "Wright either misrepresented the true cost of his designs, or else simply was unable to ascertain their <b>real</b> <b>cost</b> in advance of construction."

2500|$|Chief {{among these}} {{circumstances}} were continued {{improvements to the}} public transportation network. [...] This network continued to expand and Woodside evolved as a hub for railroad (the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line electrified in 1908), elevated rapid transit (the joint IRT/BRT Corona and Woodside Line, 1917), and electrified trolleys (Newtown Railway Company, 1895, and New York and Queens County Line, 1896). With the incorporation of Queens into New York City in 1898 and subsequent passage of legislation mandating a five-cent citywide transit fare in 1904, Woodside residents had both abundant and inexpensive options for rapid public transportation. In fact the <b>real</b> <b>cost</b> of the five-cent fare declined dramatically during the inflation years of World War I and the 1920s, and it remained in place, despite further inflation, until 1948. The construction of bridge and tunnel connections to Manhattan—the Queensboro Bridge in 1909 and the Steinway Tunnel in 1915—enabled the working members of a tenement-dwelling immigrant family to rent a garden apartment in Woodside while having jobs in the central city. The commute was cheap and short, and during rush hours, the five-cent trip took as little as eight minutes to Times Square. Although other areas of Queens benefited from the expansion of cheap transit, Woodside was, back then, the only village in Queens with both railroad and rapid transit stations in addition to trolley lines.|$|E

40|$|Distance-related {{costs have}} changed at {{different}} rates across categories of resource flows and across modes and media between 1960 and 1998. The cost of moving knowledge/information has dropped much faster than the costs of moving people or materials. The costs of processing and moving information have dropped by 98 % and 92 % respectively, in real terms since 1960. In addition, there are big differences in the rates of change within the <b>real</b> <b>costs</b> of moving people using different travel modes [...] just as big differences exist within the <b>real</b> <b>costs</b> of moving materials using different modes.

60|$|When {{first the}} virgin soils of America came into bearing, the {{proportions}} {{of the population of}} those continents themselves, and consequently of their own local requirements, to those of Europe were very small. As lately as 1890 Europe had a population three times that of North and South America added together. But by 1914 the domestic requirements of the United States for wheat were approaching their production, and the date was evidently near when there would be an exportable surplus only in years of exceptionally favorable harvest. Indeed, the present domestic requirements of the United States are estimated at more than ninety per cent of the average yield of the five years 1909-1913.[5] At that time, however, the tendency towards stringency was showing itself, not so much in a lack of abundance as in a steady increase of <b>real</b> <b>cost.</b> That is to say, taking the world as a whole, there was no deficiency of wheat, but in order to call forth an adequate supply it was necessary to offer a higher real price.

60|$|After 1870 {{there was}} {{developed}} {{on a large}} scale an unprecedented situation, and the economic condition of Europe became during the next fifty years unstable and peculiar. The pressure of population on food, which had already been balanced by the accessibility of supplies from America, became {{for the first time in}} recorded history definitely reversed. As numbers increased, food was actually easier to secure. Larger proportional returns from an increasing scale of production became true of agriculture as well as industry. With the growth of the European population there were more emigrants on the one hand to till the soil of the new countries, and, on the other, more workmen were available in Europe to prepare the industrial products and capital goods which were to maintain the emigrant populations in their new homes, and to build the railways and ships which were to make accessible to Europe food and raw products from distant sources. Up to about 1900 a unit of labor applied to industry yielded year by year a purchasing power over an increasing quantity of food. It is possible that about the year 1900 this process began to be reversed, and a diminishing yield of Nature to man's effort was beginning to reassert itself. But the tendency of cereals to rise in <b>real</b> <b>cost</b> was balanced by other improvements; and--one of many novelties--the resources of tropical Africa then for the first time came into large employ, and a great traffic in oil-seeds began to bring to the table of Europe in a new and cheaper form one of the essential foodstuffs of mankind. In this economic Eldorado, in this economic Utopia, as the earlier economists would have deemed it, most of us were brought up.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{chapters}} {{of this book}} I have not generally had in mind the situation or the problems of England. [...] "Europe" [...] in my narration must generally be interpreted to exclude the British Isles. England {{is in a state}} of transition, and her economic problems are serious. We may be on the eve of great changes in her social and industrial structure. Some of us may welcome such prospects and some of us deplore them. But they are of a different kind altogether from those impending on Europe. I do not perceive in England the slightest possibility of catastrophe or any serious likelihood of a general upheaval of society. The war has impoverished us, but not seriously;--I should judge that the real wealth of the country in 1919 is at least equal to what it was in 1900. Our balance of trade is adverse, but not so much so that the readjustment of it need disorder our economic life.[157] The deficit in our Budget is large, but not beyond what firm and prudent statesmanship could bridge. The shortening of the hours of labor may have somewhat diminished our productivity. But it should not be too much to hope that this is a feature of transition, and no due who is acquainted with the British workingman can doubt that, if it suits him, and if he is in sympathy and reasonable contentment with the conditions of his life, he can produce at least as much in a shorter working day as he did in the longer hours which prevailed formerly. The most serious problems for England have been brought to a head by the war, but are in their origins more fundamental. The forces of the nineteenth century have run their course and are exhausted. The economic motives and ideals of that generation no longer satisfy us: we must find a new way and must suffer again the malaise, and finally the pangs, of a new industrial birth. This is one element. The other is that on which I have enlarged in Chapter II.;--the increase in the <b>real</b> <b>cost</b> of food and the diminishing response of nature to any further increase in the population of the world, a tendency which must be especially injurious to the greatest of all industrial countries and the most dependent on imported supplies of food.|$|E
