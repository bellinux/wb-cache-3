2500|$|In {{the same}} month, Rochelle Tyl, {{author of two}} studies used by FDA to assert BPA safety in August 2008, said those studies did not claim that BPA is safe, {{because they were not}} {{designed}} to cover all aspects of the chemical's effects. In May 2009, Minnesota and Chicago were the first US jurisdictions to pass regulations limiting or banning BPA. In June 2009, the FDA announced its decision to reconsider the BPA safety levels. Grassroots political action led Connecticut to become the first US state to ban bisphenolA not only from infant formula and baby food containers, but also from any reusable food or beverage container. [...] In July 2009, the California Environmental Protection Agency's Developmental and <b>Reproductive</b> <b>Toxicity</b> Identification Committee in the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment unanimously voted against placing BisphenolA on the state's list of chemicals that are believed to cause reproductive harm. The panel was concerned over the growing scientific evidence showing BPA's reproductive harm in animals, found that there was insufficient data of the effects in humans. Critics pointed out that the same panel failed to add second-hand smoke to the list until 2006, and only one chemical was added to the list in the last three years. In September, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was evaluating BPA for an action plan development. [...] In October, the NIH announced $30,000,000 in stimulus grants to study the health effects of BPA. This money was supposed to result in many peer-reviewed publications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and {{its parent}} {{compound}} herbicide glyphosate are analogs to glycine, {{which have been}} reported to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of cancer cells, but not normal cells. Methoxyacetic acid (MAA) is the active metabolite of ester phthalates widely used in industry as gelling, viscosity and stabilizer; its exposure is associated with developmental and <b>reproductive</b> <b>toxicities</b> in both rodents and humans. MAA has been reported to suppress prostate cancer cell growth by inducing growth arrest and apoptosis. However, it is unknown whether AMPA and MAA can inhibit cancer cell growth. In this study, we found that AMPA and MAA inhibited cell growth in prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C 4 - 2 B, PC- 3 and DU- 145) through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G 1 phase. Importantly, the AMPA-induced apoptosis was potentiated with the addition of MAA, which was due to downregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat containing 2 (BIRC 2), leading to activation of caspases 7 and 3. These results demonstrate that the combination of AMPA and MAA can promote the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, suggesting that they can be used as potential therapeutic drugs in the treatment o...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the protective effects of cinnamon on lead acetate induced <b>reproductive</b> <b>toxicities</b> in rats. Thirty-two male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, 8 rats in each. Control rats received distilled water, while treated rats received lead acetate (30 mg/kg), cinnamon (250 mg/kg) and lead acetate and cinnamon (30 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg) for 60 days by gavage tube. In cinnamon treated rats, the relative weights of testes, epididymis, seminal and prostate glands were significantly (P < 0. 05) increased compared with that in lead acetate treated rats. Sperm cell concentration and viability were significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced, while sperm abnormalities were significantly (P < 0. 05) increased in lead treated rats. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were significantly reduced (P < 0. 001) in lead acetate treated rats compared to the other groups, while the addition of cinnamon to lead acetate improved the level of SOD compared to the lead treated group. There was a marked reduction (P < 0. 001) in the expression of androgen receptor and significant (P < 0. 001) increase in the level of caspase- 3 protein expression in the testis of lead treated rats. In conclusion, cinnamon exhibited protective effect on reproductive system by inhibiting lead acetate induced oxidative stress and excessive cell apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMethylmercury (MeHg) is a {{persistent}} environmental pollutant {{that occurs in}} the food chain, at occupational sites, and via medical procedures. Exposure in humans and animal models results in renal, neuro, and <b>reproductive</b> <b>toxicities.</b> In this study, we demonstrate that chronic exposure to MeHg (10 μM) causes epigenetic landscape modifications of histone H 3 K 4 trimethylation (H 3 K 4 me 3) marks in Caenorhabditis elegans using chromatin immuno-precipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The modifications correspond to the locations of 1467 genes with enhanced and 508 genes with reduced signals. Among enhanced genes are those encoding glutathione-S-transferases, lipocalin-related protein and a cuticular collagen. ChIP-seq enhancement of these genes was confirmed with increased mRNA expression levels revealed by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, we observed enhancement of H 3 K 4 me 3 marks in these genes in animals exposed to MeHg in utero and assayed at L 4 stage. In utero exposure enhanced marks without alterations in mRNA expression except for the lpr- 5 gene. Finally, knockdown of lipocalin-related protein gene lpr- 5, which is involved in intercellular signaling, and cuticular collagen gene dpy- 7, structural component of the cuticle, by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in increased lethality of animals after MeHg exposure. Our results provide new data on the epigenetic landscape changes elicited by MeHg exposure, as well as describe a unique model for studying in utero effects of heavy metals. Together, these findings may help to understand the toxicological effects of MeHg at the molecular level...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate exposure levels of various chemicals used in wafer fabrication product lines in the semiconductor industry where work-related leukemia has occurred. Methods: The research focused on 9 representative wafer fabrication bays among a total of 25 bays in a semiconductor prod-uct line. We monitored the chemical substances categorized as human carcinogens with respect to leukemia as well as harmful chemicals used in the bays and substances with hematologic and <b>reproductive</b> <b>toxicities</b> to evaluate the overall health effect for semiconductor industry workers. With respect to monitoring, active and passive sampling techniques were introduced. Eight-hour long-term and 15 -minute short-term sampling was conducted for the area as well as on personal samples. Results: The results of the measurements for each substance showed that benzene, toluene, xylene, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methoxy-ethanol, 2 -heptanone, ethylene glycol, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid were non-detectable (ND) in all samples. Arsine was ei-ther “ND ” or it existed only in trace form in the bay air. The maximum exposure concentration of fl uorides was approximately 0. 17 % of the Korea occupational exposure limits, with hydrofl uoric acid at about 0. 2 %, hydrochloric acid 0. 06 %, nitric acid 0. 05 %, isopro-pyl alcohol 0. 4 %, and phosphine at about 2 %. The maximum exposure concentration of propylene glycol monomethyl ether ac-etate (PGMEA) was 0. 0870 ppm, representing only 0. 1 % or less than the American Industrial Hygiene Association recommended standard (100 ppm).

Although <b>reproductive</b> <b>toxicities</b> have been surveyed in some studies in animal models, the infertility effects of sperm function induced by indium compounds have not been greatly investigated. We designed a study to investigate the toxicities of subacute exposure to indium compounds on male sperm function and the process of spermatogenesis in a rodent model. Fourteen Sprague-Dawley rats on postnatal Day (PND) 84 were randomly divided into exposure and control groups, and weekly received intraperitoneal injections of indium chloride (1. 5  mg/kg body weight) and normal saline, respectively, for 8 weeks. Cauda epididymal sperm count, motility, morphology, chromatin DNA integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and testis DNA content were investigated. The indium chloride exposed group showed significant toxicity to sperm function, as well as an increased percentage of sperm morphological abnormality and chromatin DNA damage. Furthermore, positive correlations between abnormal sperm morphology, chromatin DNA damage, and superoxide anion generation were also noted. The results of this study demonstrated the toxic effect of subacute low dose indium exposure during sexual maturation on sperm function, resulting in sperm chromatin DNA damage through an increase in sperm ROS generation in a rodent model...|$|R
