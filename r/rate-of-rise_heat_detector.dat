50|$|Each type of heat {{detector}} has its advantages, and it cannot {{be said that}} one type of {{heat detector}} should always be used instead of another. If one were to place a <b>rate-of-rise</b> <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> above a large, closed oven, then every time the door is opened a nuisance alarm could be generated due to the sudden heat transient. In this circumstance the fixed threshold detector would probably be best. If a room filled with highly combustible materials is protected with a fixed heat detector, then a fast-flaming fire could exceed the alarm threshold due to thermal lag. In that case the <b>rate-of-rise</b> <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> may be preferred.|$|E
50|$|Allowing for a {{grandfather}} clause {{that did not}} require schools to retrofit to a new standard if they already met previous regulations, the school legally complied {{with the state of}} Illinois and city of Chicago fire codes of 1958 and was generally clean and well-maintained; nonetheless, several fire hazards existed. Each classroom door had a glass transom above it, which provided ventilation into the corridor but also permitted flames and smoke to enter once heat broke the glass. The school had one fire escape. The building had no automatic fire alarm, no <b>rate-of-rise</b> <b>heat</b> <b>detectors,</b> no direct alarm connection to the fire department, no fire-resistant stairwells, and no heavy-duty fire doors from the stairwells to the second floor corridor. At the time, fire sprinklers were primarily found in factories or in new school construction, and the modern smoke detector did not become commercially available until 1969.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rate-of-Rise</b> (ROR) <b>heat</b> <b>detectors</b> {{operate on}} a rapid rise in element {{temperature}} of 12° to 15°F (6.7° to 8.3°C) increase per minute, irrespective of the starting temperature. This type of <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> can operate at a lower temperature fire condition than would be possible if the threshold were fixed. It has two heat-sensitive thermocouples or thermistors. One thermocouple monitors heat transferred by convection or radiation while the other responds to ambient temperature. The detector responds when the first sensing element's temperature increases relative to the other.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> is a {{fire alarm}} device {{designed}} to respond when the convected thermal {{energy of a}} fire increases the temperature of a heat sensitive element.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Between {{one and two}} school fires {{occur in}} Sweden every day. In most cases, arson {{is the cause of}} the fire. The most severe fires {{generally}} start outside the building and spread up along the façade and into the attic through ventilation openings in the eaves. Linear <b>heat</b> <b>detectors</b> can be placed on façades to detect these types of fires. Such devices detect fire when short-circuited at a specific temperature. In this article, an attempt to simulate linear <b>heat</b> <b>detectors</b> is presented. Data from small-scale and full-scale experiments are compared with these simulations. The small-scale experiments and simulations demonstrate that the cable failure model in Fire Dynamics Simulator can be used to predict detection in linear <b>heat</b> <b>detectors</b> that use short-circuiting as the means of signaling an overheated condition. The full-scale experiments provide a measure of the uncertainties involved, as well as the possibility of using simulations of linear <b>heat</b> <b>detectors</b> in a fire engineering design...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{revisions}} to NFPA 72, the National Fire Alarm Code, have specified the response time index (RTI) as the sensitivity listing for <b>heat</b> <b>detectors.</b> Originally derived as a sprinkler sensitivity rating, {{there has been}} little work performed to validate the use of the RTI rating for <b>heat</b> <b>detectors.</b> RTI values are determined by plunging the devices into a hot wind tunnel at 200 C (392 F) and 1. 5 m/s (4. 9 ft/s). These test conditions are unrealistically severe for the majority of expected ceiling jet profiles. While the RTI correlation is purported to be independent of temperature and velocity, data from previous studies indicates otherwise. This study examined the effects of low temperature and low velocity plunge test conditions on the constancy of the RTI for several common <b>heat</b> <b>detectors.</b> The RTI correlation was found to be inconsistent across temperature and velocity test conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the smoke {{transport}} lag time at the early stage of fires in long-narrow spaces, which {{is defined as the}} time from fire onset to the time when smoke reaches a given position on the ceiling. For a <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> at a specific location on the ceiling, the smoke transport lag time {{is a part of the}} response time of the <b>heat</b> <b>detector.</b> Especially when the heat release rate is relatively small at the early stage of fires, the smoke transport lag time will be very long, which will hence lead to the increase of <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> response time. It is clear that the prediction of smoke transport lag time is critical to the activation time of the <b>heat</b> <b>detector.</b> However, previous studies have much focused on fire characteristics in long-narrow spaces, leaving very few on the transport time lag. Therefore, in this study, a theoretical model regarding smoke transport time lag was developed for both steady and time-dependent fires based on the weak-plume theory. This model was validated by a series of reduced-scale experiments. It can be concluded from comparison that the predictions of this model agree reasonably well with the corresponding experimental results. Using the proposed method, the dimensionless equations of smoke transport time lag, velocity and temperature considering the smoke lag effect in a long-narrow space for time-squared fires were also theoretically deduced. Additionally, to further determine the applicability of &# 039;Quasi-steady&# 039; state assumption for time-squared fires, a calculation method regarding the critical time was also developed. The outcomes from this study will be beneficial to the development of fire detection model in long-narrow spaces...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFire {{detector}} {{plays an}} important role in ship fire safety system. Usually, there are two types of fire detectors including fire smoke <b>detector</b> and <b>heat</b> <b>detector,</b> which are widely used in exit passageway, corridor, ladderway, and other long and narrow spaces in ship. Due to the smoke plume characteristics in these limited spaces are different to that of free plume in open place, the detection time calculating model of <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> for these two different conditions are consequently different. This work is to develop a new detection time calculating model based on the fire plume rules including characteristics of temperature and velocity of fire smoke distributing in long and narrow spaces. Numeric method for calculating detection time is also presented. Finally, some calculations and analysis for a given fire scenario are performed. The numeric results are compared with that of the existing detection time calculating model based on free plume theory, which demonstrate the applicability of the model proposed in this article...|$|R

30|$|As a {{researcher}} at the National Bureau of Standards, he was a strong technical advocate for smoke alarm technology and residential applications in particular. He had been impressed with an article authored by McGuire and Ruscoe [9] (NRC of Canada) which reported an assessment of 342 residential fire deaths in Ontario from 1956 – 1960. In this paper the authors evaluated the lifesaving potential of a <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> in every room or a single, or a smoke detector outside the bedrooms and {{at the head of the}} basement stairs [10].
