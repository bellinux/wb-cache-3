The serological screening investigations of blood sera by ELISA of <b>equine</b> <b>animals</b> from the same villages and regions during one active period of flight of culicoides did not establish the presence of antibodies to this dangerous transmissive disease.

5000|$|Direhorse (Pa'li in Naʼvi) - The Direhorse is a bioluminescent, hexapodal, superficially <b>equine</b> <b>animal.</b> It is scientifically {{known as}} Equidirus hoplites.

The Direhorse is grey with blue stripes and stands thirteen feet (3.9 meters) tall, fourteen feet (4.2 meters) long. The Naʼvi [...] "break" [...] a Direhorse by connecting the fleshy tip of their hair to the animal's antennae. Xenobiologists {{call this a}} neural whip. Once intertwined, the Naʼvi rider can communicate motor commands instantly through the neural interface; however, this connection {{does not lead to}} a lifelong, exclusive bond, as it does with the Mountain Banshee.
