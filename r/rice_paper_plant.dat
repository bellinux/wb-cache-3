50|$|In Europe, {{around the}} 1900s, a paperlike {{substance}} was originally known as rice paper, {{due to the}} mistaken notion that it is made from rice. In fact, it consists of the pith of a small tree, Tetrapanax papyrifer, the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> <b>plant</b> (蓪草).|$|E
50|$|Edible <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is {{used for}} making fresh summer rolls (salad rolls) or fried spring rolls in Vietnamese cuisine, where the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is called bánh tráng or bánh đa nem. Ingredients of the food <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> include white <b>rice</b> flour, tapioca flour, salt, and water. The tapioca powder makes the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> glutinous and smooth. It is usually sold dried in thin, crisp, {{translucent}} round sheets that are wrapped in cellophane. The sheets are dipped briefly in hot water to soften them, then wrapped around savoury or sweet ingredients.|$|R
50|$|There {{are seven}} steps {{in making the}} dish: {{steeping}} the rice, husking the rice, mixing the flour, spreading the flour, drying the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> in the sun, grilling the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> and wetting the paper by dew in the night. Commonly used rice strains are Bằng Cóc rice, So Miên rice or Nàng Miên rice. Rice is soaked in water equal to the volume of rice. If it is soaked too long, the rice will lose its fragrance. The soaked rice is mixed with salt and grilled, spread over a flat pan in a very thin round shape. When spreading, the water temperature must be kept constant. The next piece is spread over the pan just as the last piece is removed, and skilled workers time the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> cooking process by smelling the smoke. Next, the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is spread over a bamboo grid and left to dry in the sun, and wind. If the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is left to dry too long, it will be brittle, but if not left to dry long enough, it will be tough. The <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is then grilled over a fire of peanut shells, and the cooks turn the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> over regularly {{to prevent it from}} being burned or smoke-stained. When night dews begin to drop, the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is left outside to be wetted by the dew; the length of time it's left outside depends on the amount of dew which falls that day.|$|R

50|$|Another way of {{printing}} the direct {{method is to}} have the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> already cut to size before preparing the plate to print. The heavier print paper has been put in the bath and dampened according to the printmaker's preference, then set aside. If the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> was painted on, it has been dried and is also set aside, ready. The plate is inked and wiped then placed on the press face up. Thin paste is brushed {{on the back of the}} <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> and it is placed face down on the plate and registered. The paste is put on just enough to coat but not saturate, which dampens the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> appropriately. If one tries to brush paste on a damp piece of <b>rice</b> <b>paper,</b> it will rip. The print paper is then placed on top of the pasted side of the <b>rice</b> <b>paper,</b> a sheet of newsprint added on top of the stack and the felts then covering the stack. It is then run through the press. This process is less tricky to maneuver than the first method, is cleaner, and more accurate in registration.|$|R

By test of SEM, we observed nano-structure morphology in the image of opal particle and <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> sample. A series of mechanical properties had been tested as GB 18739 or QB/T 3515 standard. After testing of anion concentration, maximum of <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> reached- 9510 cm- 3,meet the needs of human health. There is no doubt opal is a kind of environmental material for human health. <b>Rice</b> <b>paper</b> is produced from pulped fibers of blue san-dalwood mixed with a rice straw that grows in a soil rich of silica [4].
