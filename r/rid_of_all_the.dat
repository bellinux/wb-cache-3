5|$|In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton, making them hollow. Early avian-style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build could sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too large to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> excess heat through their skin.|$|E

Marge quickly realizes that it is Homer and the children that make Christmas special for her, so Martha gets <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> decorations with a magic wand. Marge then wakes up on Christmas Day to find that her family has brought her the ingredients for breakfast in bed. Their attempts to cook it go awry, so they go out for breakfast instead.|$|E

Parker and Stone {{deliberately}} included several scenes that looked like they might lead to Kenny's death, but they decided because it was Christmas {{that they would not}} kill him. The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti-semite and racist, particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she can get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Mexicans in South Park. Parker said this decision was made because, [...] "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally.

50|$|The {{management}} of R. microsporus {{can be either}} complete sterilization, antifungal use, or the blocking of sporulation so it cannot spread. This fungal-bacterial symbiont is classified as a biosafety level 2 organism. A common method of sterilization is getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reproductive structures of the fungus. More difficult sterilizations oftentimes requires control agents such as antifungals are employed. However, R. microsporus is also naturally resistant to fluconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole and the echinocandins. Antifungal prescription drugs that usually will control R. microsporus are amphotericin B and triazoles such as posaconazole, it’s also occasionally susceptible to itraconazole. Another way to control this pathogen would be to eliminate its bacterial endosymbiont, without this endosymbiont the fungus is unable to sporulate.|$|R

Then Laufer told them that Blauvor was not {{the wife of a}} king, but an ogress who had stolen her from a neighbouring palace and had brought her up as her daughter. And besides being an ogress she was also a witch, and by her black arts had sunk the ship in which the father of Sigurd and Lineik had set sail. It was she who had caused the disappearance of the courtiers, for which no one could account, by eating them during the night, and she hoped to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people in the country, and then to fill the land with ogres and ogresses like herself.|$|E

There were good men among the Roman Catholics who knew such an act would be horrible; {{but there were some}} among them who had learnt to hate everyone that they did not reckon as of the right religion, and to believe that everything was right that was done for the cause of their Church. So these men agreed that {{on the day of the}} meeting of Parliament, when the king, with the queen and Prince of Wales, would all be meeting the lords and commons, they would blow the whole of them up with gunpowder; and, while the country was all in confusion, the king dead, and almost all his lords and the chief country squires, they would take the king's younger children--Elizabeth or Charles, who were both quite little--and bring one up as a Roman Catholic to govern England.|$|E

As soon as Lady Glyde and Miss Halcombe can travel they must both have change of air. My friends, Count Fosco and the Countess, will leave us before that time to live in the neighbourhood of London, and I have reasons for not opening the house to any more company, with a view to economising as carefully as I can.

60|$|This was in 361, {{and without}} going to Rome Julian hastened on to Constantinople, where he was {{received}} as Emperor. He no longer pretended to be a Christian, but had all the old heathen temples opened again, and the sacrifices performed as in old times, {{though it was not}} easy to find any one who recollected how they were carried on. He said that all forms of religion should be free to every one, but he himself tried to live like an ancient philosopher, getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> pomp of jewels, robes, courtiers, and slaves who had attended Constantius, wearing simply the old purple garb of a Roman general, sleeping on a lion's skin, and living on the plainest food. Meantime, he tried to put down the Christian faith by laughing at it, and trying to get people to despise it as something low and mean. When this did not succeed, he forbade Christians to be schoolmasters or teachers; and as they declared that the ruin of the Temple of Jerusalem proved our Lord to have been a true Prophet, he commanded that it should be rebuilt. As soon as the foundations were dug, there was an outburst of fiery smoke and balls of flame which forced the workmen to leave off. Such things sometimes happen when long-buried ruins are opened, from the gases that have formed there; but it was no doubt the work of God's providence, and the Christians held it as a miracle.|$|E

Why, when I consider that we employ over twenty thousand men and boys, and that these men and boys are tempted, more almost than any other class of people, by goods lying about constantly in large quantities in the open air, and in all sorts of lonely and out-of-the-way places, my surprise is that our bad men are so few. No doubt we shall always have one or two prowling about, and may occasionally alight on a nest of 'em, but we shall manage to keep 'em down--to winnow them out faster, perhaps, than they come in.
