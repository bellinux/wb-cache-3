The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R
50|$|Suspension {{was simple}} but {{effective}} with double wishbone and coil springs {{at the front}}, and a live <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> with trailing <b>arms</b> and coils at the rear. Brakes consisted of discs at the front and drums at the rear. The suspension, steering gear, brakes and <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> were adapted from the Vauxhall Firenza {{with the exception of}} the front brakes, which were the widely used Girling Type 14 Calipers.|$|R
50|$|The {{familiar}} {{range of}} PSA powertrains drove {{the front wheels}} of a conventionally designed chassis. At the front was a standard MacPherson strut layout with anti-roll bar, while the rear used the PSA Peugeot-Citroën independent trailing arm/torsion bar set up that was first introduced on the Peugeot 305 estate. However, PSA's chassis engineers employed some unusual features, including passive rear wheel steering, though less than on the ZX, (by means of specially designed compliance bushes in the rear suspension), and in-house developed and constructed shock absorbers. At high mileages this is prone to wear of the axle mounting bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> trailing <b>arm</b> bearings, which then wear the trailing <b>arm</b> <b>axle</b> tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly.

50|$|The initial Firenza was {{available}} in a base model 1159 cc overhead valve and two models with overhead camshaft, in 1598 cc and 1975 cc variants. The latter was the same engine as used in the earlier Viva GT. Some six months after launch, in December 1971, performance was boosted when the engine capacities were enlarged to 1256 cc, 1798 cc and 2279 cc respectively. All models had a front-mounted four-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels. Suspension was double wishbone and coilsprings at the front, and a live <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> with trailing <b>arms</b> and coils at the rear. The SL model in each engine size carried {{the highest level of}} trim.|$|R
5000|$|Fixing {{understeer}} or oversteer {{conditions is}} achieved by either an increase or decrease in grip on the front or <b>rear</b> <b>axles.</b> If the front axle has more grip than a similar vehicle with neutral steer characteristics, the vehicle will oversteer. The oversteering vehicle may be [...] "tuned" [...] by hopefully increasing <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> grip, or alternatively by reducing front axle grip. The opposite is true for an understeering vehicle (<b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> has excess grip, fixed by increasing front grip or reducing rear grip).The following actions will have the tendency to [...] "increase the grip" [...] of an <b>axle.</b> Increasing moment <b>arm</b> distance to cg, reducing lateral load transfer (softening shocks, softening sway bars, increasing track width), increasing tire contact patch size, increasing the longitudinal load transfer to that axle, and decreasing tire pressure.|$|R

50|$|Beneath the {{carriage}} body is the undergear or undercarriage (or simply carriage), {{consisting of the}} running gear and chassis. The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the running gear. The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle {{at the ends of}} a bar or beam called an axle or axletree. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the running gear, or forecarriage, is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed <b>rear</b> <b>axle.</b> In some carriages a 'dropped axle', bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows a low body with large wheels.

In {{order to}} {{research}} the fatigue fracture problem of the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> of a China-made car at the reliability test stage on the durable enhancement roads of proving ground, and the strain loading spectrum of the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> fracture location and the weak points of the finite element analysis was measured. The fatigue damage of the broken crack at the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> on the durable enhancement roads was calculated and contrasted detailedly. At the same time, a six-channel MTS coupling system is used to conduct the vibration mode frequency sweep to the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> and car body of test car and the benchmarking car, and through vibration frequency sweep, {{an analysis of the}} reason of differences between the two cars and its relationship with the car body vibration frequency is made. The enhancement test and frequency sweep results show that the fatigue damage of two vehicles focuses mainly on the washboard road, the impact of the speed on the fatigue damage of the test car fluctuates significantly, the damages of the two cars vary greatly when the forced vibration excitation frequency of the washboard road is greater than 20 Hz and the vibration modal frequency of the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> is close to the excitation frequency of the washboard road, causing high stress distribution and then fatigue fracture to the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> of the test car.

40|$|Tractor trolley or {{trailers}} {{are very}} popular and cheaper mode of goods transport in rural {{as well as}} urban area. But these trailers are manufactured in small scale to moderate scale industry.
