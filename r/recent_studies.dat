5|$|As {{with all}} dinosaurs, {{much of the}} biology of Massospondylus, {{including}} its behavior, coloration, and physiology, remains unknown. However, <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> have allowed for informed speculation on subjects such as growth patterns, diet, posture, reproduction, and respiration.|$|E
5|$|More <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> on basal {{pterosaur}} hindlimb morphology seem to vindicate {{a connection}} to Scleromochlus. Like this archosaur, basal pterosaur lineages have plantigrade hindlimbs that show adaptations for saltation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> {{have found}} some {{traditional}} Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity). This may imply that distribution range and population size for each of such distinct species are smaller than previously thought.|$|E

He interpreted P. blackfeetensis as having a steeper, taller face than P. maximus, with the crest migrating backward toward the eyes during growth. More <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> have regarded the differences as insufficient to support two species.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, 42% of all {{households}} and 76% of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners. As a result, there was a considerable discrepancy between household and personal income. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies,</b> {{such as the one}} conducted by Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren, have shown that the average American household needs two incomes in order to live what is commonly perceived as a middle-class lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, the Eskayan speech variety {{has been}} {{associated}} with languages as disparate as Hebrew, Greek, and Etruscan. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> have revealed that the syntax of Eskayan is virtually identical to that of Boholano-Visayan, lending weight to the theory that Eskayan is actually an auxiliary variety of this language.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> have {{demonstrated}} that rather than forming a single monophyletic group (a clade), the halfbeak family actually includes a number of lineages ancestral to the flyingfishes and the needlefishes. In other words, as traditionally defined, the halfbeak family is paraphyletic.|$|E

While many European cattle breeds probably evolved from domesticated Near East ancestors, their genetics were heavily influenced by different herd management approaches across Europe.|$|E
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} or leisure {{sociology}} {{is the study}} of how humans organize their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the work-leisure relationship. More <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> in the field move away from the work-leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} The Man in the Moone, {{along with}} Kepler's Somnium, {{to be one}} of the first works of science fiction. The book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by Cyrano de Bergerac and Aphra Behn, but has been neglected in critical history. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> have focused on Godwin's theories of language, the mechanics of lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.|$|E

5|$|This slow-moving but {{aggressive}} fish dominates feeding frenzies, and is {{a danger}} to shipwreck or air crash survivors. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> show steeply declining populations because its large fins are highly valued as the chief ingredient of shark fin soup, and as with other shark species, the whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|Yates and Warren {{also named}} Dvinosauria, a clade of small aquatic temnospondyls from the Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic. They placed Dvinosauria within Limnarchia, but more <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> {{disagree}} on their position. For example, a 2007 study places {{them even more}} basal than euskelians, while a 2008 study keeps them as basal limnarchians.|$|E
50|$|A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> {{suggested}} that SON {{may be a}} novel therapeutic molecular target for pancreatic cancer as {{the results of a}} <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> show that this protein is very important as far as proliferation, survival and tumorigenicity of cancer cells are concerned. Specifically, these results revealed that the serine-arginine-rich protein involved in the RNA splicing process, could suppress pancreatic cell tumorigenicity.|$|R

5|$|Zinc {{serves as}} a simple, inexpensive, and {{critical}} tool for treating diarrheal episodes among children in the developing world. Zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea, but <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes {{for as long as}} three months.|$|E
5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} {{in the last couple}} of decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums. <b>Recent</b> <b>studies</b> indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E
5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some <b>recent</b> <b>studies</b> argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
