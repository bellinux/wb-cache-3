25|$|The {{whole of}} the island is covered with dense forests, mostly coniferous. The Yezo (or Yeddo) spruce (Picea jezoensis), the Sakhalin fir (Abies sachalinensis) and the Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii) are the chief trees; on the upper parts of the {{mountains}} are the Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) and the Kurile bamboo (Sasa kurilensis). Birches, both Siberian silver birch (Betula platyphylla) and Erman's birch (B. ermanii), poplar, elm, bird cherry (Prunus padus), Japanese yew (Taxus cuspidata) and several willows are mixed with the conifers; while farther south the maple, rowan and oak, as also the Japanese Panax ricinifolium, the Amur cork tree (Phellodendron amurense), the Spindle (Euonymus macropterus) and the vine (Vitis thunbergii) make their appearance. The underwoods abound in berry-bearing plants (e.g. cloudberry, cranberry, crowberry, red whortleberry), <b>red-berried</b> <b>elder</b> (Sambucus racemosa), wild raspberry and Spiraea.|$|E
50|$|Sambucus racemosa is {{a species}} of {{elderberry}} known by the common names red elderberry and <b>red-berried</b> <b>elder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{blackberry}} elder Sambucus melanocarpa {{of western}} North America is intermediate between the preceding and next groups. The flowers are in rounded panicles, but the berries are black; it {{is a small}} shrub, rarely exceeding 3 - 4 m tall. Some botanists include it in the <b>red-berried</b> <b>elder</b> group.|$|E
5000|$|Green Bay National Wildlife Refuge {{contains}} {{a variety of}} plants native to the area. Hog Island has an abundance of Canada yew. This plant is greatly decreasing in number on the island because {{of the increase in}} white-tailed deer and their appetite for this shrub. Other vegetation common to the wildlife refuge, specifically Hog Island, includes: <b>red-berried</b> <b>elder</b> and red raspberry plants.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-berried</b> <b>elder</b> {{complex is}} {{variously}} {{treated as a}} single species Sambucus racemosa found throughout the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere with several regional varieties or subspecies, or else {{as a group of}} several similar species. The flowers are in rounded panicles, and the berries are bright red; they are smaller shrubs, rarely exceeding 3 - 4 m tall.|$|E
50|$|The three {{islands are}} largely {{limestone}} and dolomite outcroppings of the Niagara Escarpment, exhibit geology typical of changing water levels and glaciation, and rise {{only a few}} feet above the surface of Lake Michigan. Canadian yew, red raspberry, and <b>red-berried</b> <b>elder</b> grow on Hog Island, while only the remnants of a mixed birch, cedar, and tamarack forest remains on Spider Island, after having succumbed to thousands of nesting birds. There is no known vegetation on Gravel Island.|$|E
50|$|Franklin's ground {{squirrel}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on vegetation {{in the spring}} and late summer, but with meat and eggs forming a significant proportion of their diet in the early summer. In the spring, they feed on roots, new shoots, and grasses, shifting to leaves and flowers, and then to fruit and seeds as the year progresses. Plants eaten include dandelion, stinging nettle, <b>red-berried</b> <b>elder,</b> white clover, and wild peas, as well as garden vegetables. Animal material consumed ranges from insects to eggs, small rodents, fish and frogs, up to rabbits and even fully-grown mallards.|$|E
