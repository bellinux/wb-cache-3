5000|$|Wheels {{sometimes}} need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, {{and then}} the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed {{on the left side}} of the grinder from the operator's viewpoint, with wheel rotation [...] "toward" [...] the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas on the other side the nut is right-handed. [...] "In other words, to remove the nut, it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation." [...] Holding the wheel against the wrench's turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is on either side of the wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel flange from bearing directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) on the flange. The wheel's inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a bushing (sleeve) to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves gently tapping it with a fingernail or tool handle (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell's ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "hoarse" [...] sound (failing to [...] "sing") indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the <b>ring</b> <b>test,</b> the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel flanges, and nut are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, {{and then the}} grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the initial steps of {{formation}} of a biofilm using the BioFilm <b>Ring</b> <b>Test</b> and the Crystal violet staining technique. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. The two methods revealed that four strains formed a rapid biofilm. The biofilm formed by these strains was detected after only 45 min with the BioFilm <b>Ring</b> <b>Test</b> and after 6 h with the Crystal violet method. The enumeration of bacteria of the PA 01 strain confirmed that, after 30 min, {{a significant amount of}} bacteria had attached {{on the bottom of the}} culture wells. After 48 h the Crystal violet method detected a biofilm with all strains. The four strains which rapidly formed a biofilm did not differ from the slow-forming strains by their mucoid character or their swarming motility or their synthesis of rhamnose. They showed higher swimming mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the BioFilm <b>Ring</b> <b>Test</b> is a method specially suited for the study of the initial phase of the formation of a biofilm.

The value of chemical data depends to a great extent {{on the quality of the}} analytical work provided by the laboratories involved in the monitoring. To maximize the spatial and temporal comparability of monitoring data over time, every effort must be taken to ensure accuracy of the analytical measurements. This has been done in forest monitoring in Europe within the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests). In this context, different expert panels and groups have developed a comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) program for the participating laboratories over the past two decades. As part of this drive to improve the inter- and intracomparability of analytical data, the laboratories have participated in a number of interlaboratory calibration exercises (otherwise known as <b>ring</b> <b>tests)</b> and held extensive discussions on harmonizing and improving the use of analytical methodology and QA/QC procedures.
