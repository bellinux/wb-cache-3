Weighing nearly nine tons, it was his final major work, completed just before he died. One of three public Moore sculptures in Berlin (the others being Three Way Piece No.2: The Archer (1964-65) at the Neue Nationalgalerie and Reclining Figure (1956) at the Akademie der Künste), Butterfly was initially a loan to (then West) Berlin in 1986, but the city council wanted the sculpture permanently, and asked Moore if he would donate it. The letter arrived just before his death and went unanswered. In 1988 it was sold by the Henry Moore Foundation to Berlin for 4.5 million Deutsche Mark (around $2.58 million at the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day),</b> then a huge sum for a public sculpture. The sculpture was eventually badly damaged by a combination of environmental pollution and vandalism, and restored in 2010.|$|E

In the first instance, however, the Coalition Commissioners were to receive {{the whole of the}} 700 million in fifteen bonds of 46⅔ million each; the first of which was payable on 31 March 1816, the second on 21 July 1816, and so on, every fourth month. In the month preceding the commencement of each of these four monthly periods, France was to redeem successively one of these bonds for 46⅔ millions, by exchanging it against the first-mentioned daily assignations payable to bearer, which assignations, for the purpose of convenience and negotiability, were again subdivided into coupures, or sets of smaller sums. As a guarantee for the regular payment of these assignations, and to provide for deficiencies, France assigned, moreover, to the allies, a fund of interest, to be inscribed in the Grand Livre of her public debt, of seven millions francs on a capital of 140 millions. A liquidation was to take place every six months, when the assignations duly discharged by the French Treasury were to be received as payments to their amount, and the deficiency arising from assignations not honoured would be made good, with interest, at five percent from the fund of interest inscribed in the Grand Livre, in a manner specified in this convention.|$|E

The adjusted yearly trends for all stations range from − 0. 15 μg m − 3 yr − 1 to − 1. 2 μg m − 3 yr − 1 or − 1. 2 % yr − 1 to − 3. 3 % yr − 1...|$|R
40|$|The Chinese ancient {{accounts}} of timing observations of 48 lunar eclipses and <b>the</b> secular variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's spin speed are discussed. A series <b>of</b> expressing <b>the</b> secular deceleration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's rotation was obtained. <b>The</b> average increase <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> is about 1. 5 milliseconds per century. Key Words : Earth's rotation, lunar eclipse. I. INTRODUCTION During the last about three decades, much research {{attention has been}} directed toward <b>the</b> long-term variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's rotational speed and the non-tidal contributions in the variation based on ancient records <b>of</b> astronomical observations. <b>The</b> studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient records gave a preliminary scenery of secular variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's rotation over twenty centuries before the 17 th century. However, <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> values derived from the records is far from uniform, and some gaps exist in the data series. It is important to utilize more records of ancient astronomical observations to improv [...] ...|$|R
60|$|It was, and {{no doubt}} still is, a desolate-looking spot, at any <b>rate</b> for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when owing to <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} hills, it receives but little sun. Everything about it, especially when I was there {{in a time of}} rain, seemed dank and miserable, although <b>the</b> flat floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kloof was clothed with a growth of tall, coarse grass, and weeds that bore an evil-smelling flower. Perhaps some sense of appropriateness had caused the Zulu kings to choose this lonesome, deathly-looking gorge as one of their execution grounds. At any rate many had been slain here, for skulls and the larger human bones, some of them black with age, lay all about among the grass, as they had been scattered by hyenas and jackals. They were particularly thick beneath and around the table-like rock that I have mentioned.|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{four young}} (mean age 29. 2 years, range 25 - 35) and 21 elderly (mean age 66. 5, range 60 - 80) healthy {{subjects}} collected their urine in timed aliquots over 24 hours. The elderly subjects {{had been selected}} for their fitness by clinical and laboratory examinations and all lived independently at home. Sodium and potassium excretions were reduced in the elderly subjects compared with the young subjects, potassium excretion considerably so. This was despite similar 24 hour urine volumes and total solute excretion by both groups. <b>The</b> ratios <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> excretion of water, electrolytes, and solutes during the night to <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> excretion during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{were found to be}} higher in the elderly than the young subjects. Reduced day to night ratios of urinary excretion may be partly responsible for complaints of nocturia and sleep disturbance in elderly people...|$|R

METHODS [...] <b>The</b> urinary excretion <b>of</b> adrenaline and noradrenaline of 32 lorry drivers, who also had loading and unloading activities to perform, was studied for one working day and one rest day. Each driver was asked to provide six urine samples on both days. RESULTS [...] For all samples, except the first (overnight) sample, <b>the</b> excretion <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> both catecholamines on <b>the</b> working <b>day</b> were higher than those on <b>the</b> rest <b>day.</b> Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were carried out to find out which factors in the drivers' working situation were related to <b>the</b> excretion <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> excretion <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> adrenaline on <b>the</b> rest <b>day,</b> age, and psychosomatic complaints were positively related to the excretion rate on <b>the</b> working <b>day</b> (all P < 0. 05).

25|$|Oocytes are {{carefully}} denudated from the cumulus cells, as these cells {{can be a}} source <b>of</b> contamination during <b>the</b> PGD if PCR-based technology is used. In <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reported cycles, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is used instead <b>of</b> IVF. <b>The</b> main reasons are to prevent contamination with residual sperm adhered to the zona pellucida and to avoid unexpected fertilization failure. The ICSI procedure is carried out on mature metaphase-II oocytes and fertilization is assessed 16–18 hours after. The embryo development is further evaluated every day prior to biopsy and until transfer to the woman’s uterus. During the cleavage stage, embryo evaluation is performed daily on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number, size, cell-shape and fragmentation <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blastomeres.
