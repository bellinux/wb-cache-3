5|$|The {{most widely}} {{recognized}} {{legacy of the}} 1966 smog was the political <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> which galvanized the nascent environmental movement in the United States and prompted demand for sweeping air-pollution control laws. The smog has been remembered for various purposes by scientists, historians, journalists, writers, artists, activists, and political commentators.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} {{of the history of the}} Moberly-Jourdain {{adventure}} and the extensive public <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> Terry Castle noted with skepticism the claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women. Castle concludes that, when all proposed explanations have been considered, a core of mystery remains as much in relation to the psychological dynamics of the pair as to any aspects of the paranormal associated with their story.|$|E
5|$|Die Another Day was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, {{based on}} the {{screenplay}} by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, {{in the style of}} Fleming's original novels' use of cutting-edge technology. So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function – the glass windows and rubber tyres – are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent's adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005. As the novelisation was published after Benson's final original 007 novel, The Man with the Red Tattoo, it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.|$|E

On 2 February, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the DA's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the timing was not right as the <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} of Benefits Street defended the series, {{arguing that the}} <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> demonstrated the importance of making such a documentary. The series was mentioned in the House of Commons, and prompted some political debate {{on the topic of}} welfare. A number of programmes were commissioned by other channels covering the same topic, while Channel 4 commissioned a follow up series provisionally titled Immigration Street that would follow the lives of immigrants living in the United Kingdom. Benefits Street gave Channel 4 their highest viewing figures for any show since 2012. In August 2014, Love Productions confirmed the second series of Benefits Street was being filmed in Kingston Road, Stockton-on-Tees, England, United Kingdom. Series two aired from 11 May 2015 for four episodes.|$|E

25|$|Ireland's {{performance}} in the 2016 Rio Olympics was unsuccessful, with Ireland not featuring in any medal positions, despite having a number of seeded boxers.

25|$|The {{aftermath}} of the Rising, {{and in particular the}} British <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> helped sway a large section of Irish nationalist opinion away from hostility or ambivalence and towards support for the rebels of Easter 1916. Dublin businessman and Quaker James G. Douglas, for example, hitherto a Home Ruler, wrote that his political outlook changed radically {{during the course of the}} Rising because of the British military occupation of the city and that he became convinced that parliamentary methods would not be enough to remove the British presence.|$|E
50|$|The {{episode was}} watched by 15.76 million viewers, issuing a {{significant}} rise in ratings {{from the previous}} episode two months prior.

25|$|Dr. David Clarke, a {{consultant}} to the National Archives, has investigated the background of this memo and the <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> at the Ministry of Defence. His interviews with the personnel involved confirmed the cursory nature of the investigation made by the MoD, and failed to find any evidence for any other reports on the incident made by the USAF or UK apart from the Halt memo. Halt has since gone on record as saying he believes that he witnessed an extraterrestrial event that was then covered up.|$|E
25|$|With {{much greater}} numbers and heavier weapons, the British Army {{suppressed}} the Rising. Pearse {{agreed to an}} unconditional surrender on Saturday 29 April, although sporadic fighting continued until Sunday, when word reached the other rebel positions. After the surrender the country remained under martial law. About 3,500 people were taken prisoner by the British, {{many of whom had}} played no part in the Rising, and 1,800 of them were sent to internment camps or prisons in Britain. Most {{of the leaders of the}} Rising were executed following courts-martial. The Rising brought physical force republicanism back to the forefront of Irish politics, which for nearly 50 years had been dominated by constitutional nationalism. It, and the British <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> led to increased popular support for Irish independence. In December 1918, republicans, represented by the reconstituted Sinn Féin party, won a landslide victory in the general election to the British Parliament. They did not take their seats, but instead convened the First Dáil and declared the independence of the Irish Republic. The Soloheadbeg ambush started the War of Independence.|$|E

500|$|... "Robbery, Assault and Battery" [...] {{was mostly}} written by Banks, {{in an attempt}} to {{replicate}} the humour in some of Gabriel's lyrics. Collins sang the song in character, inspired by his earlier role as the Artful Dodger in Oliver! before he became a professional musician. [...] "Ripples..." [...] was a combination of a 12-string guitar piece composed by Rutherford and a piano-led middle section written by Banks. The title track was inspired by Banks reading William Golding's The Inheritors and described an alien visiting Earth and the <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Community members {{often become}} {{involved}} in the debate over banning fighting. In December 2006, a school board trustee in London, Ontario attended a London Knights game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> [...] This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the Ontario Hockey League, where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators. On the advice of its Medical Health Officer, the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.|$|E

500|$|The United States media, while {{generally}} reporting negatively on Scientology {{in domestic}} news, {{has taken an}} at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany. Richard Cohen for example, writing in the Washington Post, said in 1996: [...] "Scientology might be one weird religion, but the German <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> is weirder still– not to mention disturbing." [...] Alan Cowell, writing in the New York Times, wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology– motivated by officials' fear that Scientology [...] "was a totalitarian movement growing, like the Nazi party, from inconsequential beginnings"– was itself redolent of [...] "the Nazi era's authoritarianism".|$|E
500|$|The music press {{predicted}} that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur's fan-base. These fears were also shared by James who revealed that the front rows of the gigs that the band were performing at during the Britpop years were primarily attracting 15-year-old girls and that he thought the change in style was a [...] "fucking big balls move." [...] Andy Ross, who was running Food Records at the time, admitted that when he first heard it he was [...] "taken aback. We'd won Brits, we'd won two consecutive Q magazine Albums of the Year and my initial reaction was it's awkward and difficult. My immediate reaction was will you sell as many records?

Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching.
