5|$|The Australian squadrons {{played a}} limited {{role in the}} allied advance from Amiens on 8 August 1918, with No. 3 Squadron engaged in {{reconnaissance}} and contact patrols to help identify the locations of forward troops. They also undertook extensive aerial photography to aid in <b>remapping</b> and the locating of German artillery positions. During this period Nos. 2 and 4 Squadrons were in the Ypres–Arras area and were involved in patrols and raids on the railways {{in the vicinity of}} Lille. With the Germans in retreat during September 1918, the squadrons felt considerable pressure just keeping up. Regardless, No. 4 Squadron took part in, perhaps its most spectacular action, in the very last weeks of the war. On 29 October, 15 Australian Sopwith Snipes encountered more than 60 German Fokkers, in an action which became one of the largest air battles of the war. The Australians gained the upper hand and 10 Fokkers were shot down for the loss of one Snipe, and the damage of several others.|$|E
25|$|Neuroplasticity can be {{observed}} at multiple scales, from microscopic changes in individual neurons to larger-scale changes such as cortical <b>remapping</b> in response to injury. However, cortical <b>remapping</b> is more extensive early in development. Behavior, environmental stimuli, thought, and emotions may also cause neuroplastic change through activity-dependent plasticity, which has significant implications for healthy development, learning, memory, and recovery from brain damage.|$|E

40|$|Collisions in {{overlapping}} channels are becoming {{an increasingly important}} problem in the deployment of high-speed wireless networks. In this paper, we present <b>Remap,</b> a simple, novel paradigm for handling collisions in overlapping OFDM channels. <b>Remap</b> introduces the novel concept of retransmission permutation that permutes the bit-to-subcarrier assignment after each retransmission, departing from the traditional, simply-repeat paradigm. <b>Remap</b> is simple to implement and able to exploit collision-free subcarriers to decode packets despite successive collisions in {{overlapping channels}}. We apply <b>Remap</b> to 802. 11 g {{to demonstrate that the}} diversity created by <b>remapped</b> packets can substantially improve decoding efficiency and improve wireless throughput.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between phantom limb sensation and neuroplasticity {{is a complex}} one. In the early 1990s V.S. Ramachandran theorized that phantom limbs {{were the result of}} cortical <b>remapping.</b> However, in 1995 Herta Flor and her colleagues demonstrated that cortical <b>remapping</b> occurs only in patients who have phantom pain. Her research showed that phantom limb pain (rather than referred sensations) was the perceptual correlate of cortical reorganization. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as maladaptive plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Some {{high end}} {{keyboards}} allow users flexibility to reprogram keyboard mappings at the hardware level. For example, the Kinesis Advantage contoured keyboard allows for reprogramming single keys (not key combinations), {{as well as}} creating macros for <b>remapping</b> combinations of keys (this however includes more processing from the keyboard hardware, and can therefore be slightly slower, with a lag that may be noticed in daily use).|$|E
25|$|The {{guaranteed}} {{cycle count}} may {{apply only to}} block zero (as {{is the case with}} TSOPNAND devices), or to all blocks (as in NOR). This effect is mitigated in some chip firmware or file system drivers by counting the writes and dynamically <b>remapping</b> blocks in order to spread write operations between sectors; this technique is called wear leveling. Another approach is to perform write verification and <b>remapping</b> to spare sectors in case of write failure, a technique called bad block management (BBM). For portable consumer devices, these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond the life of the device itself, and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications. For high reliability data storage, however, it is not advisable to use flash memory that would {{have to go through a}} large number of programming cycles. This limitation is meaningless for 'read-only' applications such as thin clients and routers, which are programmed only once or at most a few times during their lifetimes.|$|E

50|$|CAUTION: Although Shift and Ctrl can be reprogrammed using Macros as {{described}} in the next section, they should not be <b>remapped.</b> Unpredictable results may occur, depending on how long those keys are held down. Therefore, in <b>REMAP</b> mode, pressing the sequence Shift (without holding it down), and then lowercase-A, sometimes <b>remaps</b> the A key to become another Shift key, but not dependably. However, the following restoration process seems dependable.|$|R
25|$|Prime, Crawford and Vesia (2008) {{performed}} an experiment using a TMS {{in order to}} understand what structure or structures play a role in transsaccadic memory. It was found that transsaccadic memory was disrupted when TMS stimulation was delivered to the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) around the time of a saccade. Prime et al. hypothesized that TMS interfered with the normal spatial <b>remapping</b> operations of the rPPC, in particular the parietal eye fields, that occur during a saccade.|$|E
25|$|Pattern {{separation}} {{is the ability}} to differentiate one memory from other stored memories. Pattern separation begins in the dentate gyrus, a section of the hippocampus involved in memory formation and retrieval. Granule cells in the dentate gyrus process sensory information using competitive learning, and relay a preliminary representation to form place fields. Place fields are extremely specific, as they are capable of <b>remapping</b> and adjusting firing rates in response to subtle sensory signal changes. This specificity is critical for pattern separation, as it distinguishes memories from one another.|$|E
25|$|Modern HDDs {{present a}} {{consistent}} interface {{to the rest}} of the computer, no matter what data encoding scheme is used internally. Typically a DSP in the electronics inside the HDD takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses PRML and Reed–Solomon error correction to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by error detection and correction, and performs bad sector <b>remapping,</b> data collection for Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, and other internal tasks.|$|E
50|$|An {{exception}} or branch misprediction {{causes the}} <b>remap</b> file {{to back up}} to the <b>remap</b> state at last valid instruction via combination of state snapshots and cycling through the previous tags in the in-order pre-graduation queue. Since this mechanism is required, and since it can recover any <b>remap</b> state (not just the state before the instruction currently being graduated), branch mispredictions can be handled before the branch reaches graduation, potentially hiding the branch misprediction latency.|$|R

The time-shift attack {{has even been}} demonstrated on a commercial quantum cryptosystem. This is the first demonstration of quantum hacking against a non-homemade quantum key distribution system. Later on, the phase-remapping attack was also demonstrated on a specially configured, research oriented open QKD system (made and provided by the Swiss company Id Quantique under their Quantum Hacking program). It {{is one of the}} first ‘intercept-and-resend’ attacks on top of a widely used QKD implementation in commercial QKD systems. This work has been widely reported in media.|$|E
25|$|Although place {{cells are}} part of a non-sensory {{cortical}} system, their firing behavior is strongly correlated to sensory input. Place cells fire when an animal is located in parts of the environment known as place fields. These circuits may have important implications for memory, as they provide the spatial context for memories and past experiences. Like many other parts of the brain, place cell circuits are dynamic. They are constantly adjusting and <b>remapping</b> to suit the current location and experience of the brain. Place cells do not work alone to create visuospatial representation; they are a part of a complex circuit that informs place awareness and place memory.|$|E
25|$|The HDD's {{electronics}} {{control the}} movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the disk controller. Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor. Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and <b>remapping</b> sectors of the media which have failed.|$|E

In the obstacle detection, we {{make use of the}} features of vertical edges on objects from <b>remapped</b> images to indicate the relative positions of obstacles. The static information of <b>remapped</b> images in the current frame is referred to determining the features of source images in the searching stage from either the profile or temporal IPM difference image. The profile image can be acquired by several processes such as sharpening, edge detection, morphological operation, and modified thinning algorithms on the <b>remapped</b> image. The temporal IPM difference image can be obtained by a spatial shift on the <b>remapped</b> image in the previous frame. Moreover, the polar histogram and its post-processing procedures will be used to indicate the position and length of feature vectors and to remove noises as well. Our obstacle detection can give drivers the warning signals within a limited distance from nearby vehicles while the detected obstacles are even with the quasi-vertical edges.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Timothy (Phleum pratense L.), a cool-season {{hexaploid}} perennial, is {{the most}} important forage grass species in Nordic countries. Earlier analyses of genetic diversity in a collection of 96 genebank accessions of timothy with SSR markers demonstrated high levels of diversity but could not resolve population structure. Therefore, we examined a subset of 51 accessions with <b>REMAP</b> markers, which are based on retrotransposons, and compared the diversity results with those obtained with SSR markers. Results Using four primer combinations, 533 <b>REMAP</b> markers were analyzed, compared with 464 polymorphic alleles in the 13 SSR loci previously. The average marker index, which describes information obtained per experiment (per primer combination or locus) was over six times higher with <b>REMAPs.</b> Most of the variation found was within accessions, with somewhat less, 89  %, for <b>REMAPs,</b> than for SSR, with 93  %. Conclusions SSRs revealed differences in the level of diversity slightly better than <b>REMAPs</b> but neither marker type could reveal any clear clustering of accessions based on countries, vegetation zones, or different cultivar types. In our study, reliable evaluation of SSR allele dosages was not possible, so each allele had to be handled as a dominant marker. SSR and <b>REMAP,</b> which report from different mechanisms of generating genetic diversity and from different genomic regions, together indicate a lack of population structure. Taken together, this likely reflects the outcrossing and hexaploid nature of timothy rather than failures of either marker system...|$|R
25|$|When {{there is}} damage {{to just one}} side of the MTL, there is {{opportunity}} for normal functioning or near-normal function for memories. Neuroplasticity describes the ability of the cortex to remap when necessary. <b>Remapping</b> can occur in cases like the one above, and, with time, the patient can recover and become more skilled at remembering. A case report describing a patient who had two lobectomies– in the first, doctors removed part of her right MTL first because of seizures originating from the region, and later her left because she developed a tumor– demonstrates this. This case is unique because it is the only one in which both sides of the MTL were removed at different times. The authors observed that the patient was able to recover some ability to learn when she had only one MTL, but observed the deterioration of function when both sides of the MTL were afflicted. The reorganization of brain function for epileptic patients has not been investigated much, but imaging results show that it is likely.|$|E

500|$|In Stanley Kubrick's 1968 {{science fiction}} film , {{astronaut}} David Bowman slowly disassembles {{the mind of}} an artificial intelligence named HAL by sequentially unplugging its memory banks. Carr likened the emotions of despair expressed by HAL as its mind is disassembled to his own, at the time, cognitive difficulties in engaging with long texts. He felt as if someone was [...] "tinkering with [...] brain, <b>remapping</b> the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory". HAL had also {{been used as a}} metaphor for the [...] "ultimate search engine" [...] in a PBS interview with Google co-founder Sergey Brin as noted in Carr's book The Big Switch, and also Brin's TED talk. Brin was comparing Google's ambitions of building an artificial intelligence to HAL, while dismissing the possibility that a bug like the one that led HAL to murder the occupants of the fictional spacecraft Discovery One could occur in a Google-based artificial intelligence. Carr observed in his essay that throughout history technological advances have often necessitated new metaphors, such as the mechanical clock engendering the simile [...] "like clockwork" [...] and the age of the computer engendering the simile [...] "like computers". Carr concluded his essay with an explanation as to why he believed HAL was an appropriate metaphor for his essay's argument. He observed that HAL showed genuine emotion as his mind was disassembled while, throughout the film, the humans onboard the space station appeared to be automatons, thinking and acting as if they were following the steps of an algorithm. Carr believed that the film's prophetic message was that as individuals increasingly rely on computers for an understanding of their world their intelligence may become more machinelike than human.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn 2014, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) {{published}} a global renewable energy roadmap—called <b>REmap</b> 2030 —to double {{the share of}} renewables in the global energy mix by 2030 compared to 2010 (IRENA, A Renewable Energy Roadmap, 2014 a). A <b>REmap</b> tool was developed to facilitate a transparent and open framework to aggregate the national renewable energy plans and/or scenarios of 26 countries. Unlike the energy systems models by IEA-ETSAP teams, however, the <b>REmap</b> tool {{does not account for}} trade-offs between renewable energy and energy efficiency activities, system planning issues like path dependency and investments in the grid infrastructure, competition for scarce resources— e. g. biomass—in the commodity prices, or dynamic cost developments as technologies get deployed over time. This chapter compares the <b>REmap</b> tool with the IEA-ETSAP models at two levels: the results and the insights. Based on the results comparison, it can be concluded that the <b>REmap</b> tool {{can be used as a}} way to explicitly engage national experts, to scope renewable energy options, and to compare results across countries. However, the ETSAP models provide detailed insights into the infrastructure requirements, competition between technologies and resources, and the role of energy efficiency needed for planning purposes. These insights are particularly relevant for countries with infrastructure constraints and/or ambitious renewable energy targets. As more and more countries are turning to renewables to secure their energy future, the <b>REmap</b> tool and the ETSAP models have complementary roles to play in engaging policy makers and national energy planners to advance renewables...|$|R
