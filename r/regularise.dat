As well as removing the word 'Military' from {{the full name}} of the Order, this opened up the grades of Knight Commander and Companion to civil appointments, and the Military and Civil Divisions of the Order were established. New numerical limits were imposed, and the opportunity also taken to <b>regularise</b> the 1815 expansion of the Order. The 1847 statutes also abolished all the medieval ritual, however they did introduce a formal Investiture ceremony, conducted by the Sovereign wearing the Mantle and insignia of the Order, attended by the Officers and as many GCBs as possible, in their Mantles.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} of local prisons in locations such as castles had been criticised, since John Howard's {{work in the}} 1770s, and pressure for reform continued {{to grow in the}} 1850s and 1860s. Reform of the legislation surrounding bankruptcy and debt in 1869 largely removed the threat of imprisonment for unpaid debts, and in the process eliminated the purpose of the debtor's prisons in castles such as St Briavels. Efforts were made to <b>regularise</b> conditions in local prisons but without much success, and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised British prisons, including prisons at castles like York. Compensation was paid to the former owners, although in cases such as York where the facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction, this payment was denied. In the short term this led to a 39% {{reduction in the number of}} prisons in England, including some famous castle prisons such as Norwich; over the coming years, centralisation and changes in prison design led to the closure of most remaining castle prisons.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{document}} outlines an algorithm {{which extends}} and enhances the <b>regularised</b> gradient. The <b>regularised</b> gradient {{is known to}} be a thin gradient. It has little noise, is multi-scale and has been extensively used, for instance, for the extraction of road markers from particularly challenging image sets. However, the intensity values taken by the <b>regularised</b> gradient are usually not representative of the perceived contrast across object boundaries. This limitation may prevent hierarchical segmentations based on the waterfalls or synchronous floodings from being meaningful with respect to the actual human perception of saliency. The proposed enhancement of the <b>regularised</b> gradient preserves the thinness and multi-scale properties of the latter whilst taking the actual contrast across different image scales into account...|$|R

25|$|Efforts {{were made}} to <b>regularise</b> the {{financial}} position of the company, but it was unable to escape from its difficulty and went into receivership {{for a second time}} in 1889. By then it had become obvious that continuing inaction was impossible, and discussion had taken place with the Great Western Railway with a view to the larger company buying the Wye Valley concern. The unsatisfactory situation dragged on, and finally in December 1904 the sale was agreed. The GWR was to pay 2.5% of face value on ordinary shares, and 12.5% on preference shares. Ordinary shareholders had thus lost nearly all their money. The sale took formal effect on 1 July 1905. As the GWR had been working the line from the beginning, there was no obvious outward change so far as the travelling public were concerned.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrincipal {{component}} analysis (PCA) is a well-established method {{commonly used to}} explore and visualise data. A classical PCA model is the fixed effect model where data are generated as a fixed structure of low rank corrupted by noise. Under this model, PCA does not provide the best recovery of the underlying signal in terms of mean squared error. Following the same principle as in ridge regression, we propose a <b>regularised</b> version of PCA that boils down to threshold the singular values. Each singular value is multiplied by a term which {{can be seen as}} the ratio of the signal variance over the total variance of the associated dimension. The <b>regularised</b> term is analytically derived using asymptotic results and can also be justified from a Bayesian treatment of the model. <b>Regularised</b> PCA provides promising results in terms of the recovery of the true signal and the graphical outputs in comparison with classical PCA and with a soft thresholding estimation strategy. The gap between PCA and <b>regularised</b> PCA is all the more important that data are noisy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{recent years}} {{discontinuous}} maps, which are {{commonly referred to}} as maps with gaps, have been derived from applications, both electronic and mechanical, and {{it has been shown that}} these maps have suprisingly rich dynamics. In this paper we study a new class of maps which we refer to as <b>regularised</b> maps with gaps because they have very similar dynamics to maps with gaps but are yet continuous. We derive two examples of <b>regularised</b> maps with gaps from two mechanical applications, the impact oscillator and the cam-follower system. We review the dynamics of the maps with gaps and study the dynamics of <b>regularised</b> maps with gaps and compare it to the behaviour of the mechanical applications which we model...|$|R

In practice, there was inherent conflict between king and uparaja and frequent disputed successions. However, it is evident that the power of the Throne of Ayutthaya had its limit. The hegemony of the Ayutthaya king was always based on his charisma in terms of his age and supporters. Without supporters, bloody coups took place from time to time. The most powerful figures of the capital were always generals, or the Minister of Military Department, Kalahom. During the last century of Ayutthaya, the bloody fighting among princes and generals, aiming at the throne, plagued the court.|$|E

2500|$|A long-awaited {{resumption}} of creating dioceses began in 1836 with Ripon. Ripon Town Council assumed {{that this had}} elevated the town {{to the rank of}} a city, and started referring to itself as the City and Borough of Ripon. The next diocese formed was Manchester and its Borough Council began [...] informally to use the title city. When Queen Victoria visited Manchester in 1851, widespread doubts surrounding its status were raised. The pretension was ended when the borough petitioned for city status, which was granted by letters patent in 1853. This eventually forced Ripon to <b>regularise</b> its position; its city status was recognised by Act of Parliament in 1865. From this year Ripon bore city status whilst the rapidly expanding conurbation of Leeds – in the Ripon diocese – did not. The Manchester case established a precedent that any municipal borough in which an Anglican see was established was entitled to petition for city status. Accordingly, Truro, St Albans, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Wakefield were all officially designated as cities between 1877 and 1888.|$|E
