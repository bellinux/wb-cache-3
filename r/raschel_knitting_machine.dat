5000|$|<b>Raschel</b> <b>knits</b> do not stretch {{significantly}} {{and are often}} bulky; consequently, they are often used as an unlined material for coats, jackets, straight skirts and dresses. These fabrics can be made out of conventional or novelty yarns which allows for interesting textures and designs to be created. [...] The qualities of these fabrics range from [...] "dense and compact to open and lofty and can be either stable or stretchy, and single-faced or reversible. [...] The largest outlet for the <b>Raschel</b> warp <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> is for lace fabric and trimmings. <b>Raschel</b> <b>knitting</b> is also used in outdoors and military fabrics for products such as backpacks. It is used to provide a ventilated mesh next to the user's body (covering padding) or mesh pockets and pouches to facilitate visibility of the contents (MIL-C-8061).|$|R
40|$|On the {{assumption}} that grid-like knitted fabrics from flax fibres should be embedded in light-weight concrete, cellular concrete and plaster, investigations were performed on various yarns from flax fibres under near-practical conditions (pH-value 12, temperature 80 - 190 C, storage time up to 10 hours). At increasing temperature and storage {{time there was a}} different decrease of the maximum tensile force in connection with a reduction of the other testing features (Tt, EpsH, fibre length) according to the texture and fineness of the flax yarns. It was proved that yarns from flax fibres and flax tows can be processed on <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> (<b>raschel</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machines,</b> stitch-bonding and small circular warp <b>knitting</b> <b>machines)</b> to <b>knitted</b> grids with different mesh sizes and net mesh structures without problems. Surprisingly it was found that there was nearly no degradation at the immersion in alkali for net grids with mesh legs of a high packing density. Single tests for the reinforcement of test beams from light-weight concrete and plaster were performed with the producted knittted grids. The bending tensile tests with light-weight concrete (cement mortar with light-weight aggregates) result in a slight increase of the bending tensile strength and with cellular concrete partly in a substantial increase of the same. The reinforcing tests with plaster did not result in an increase of the bending tensile strength. For all reinforced variants a distinct reduction of the crack propagation was determined. Fundamental informations on the adhesive bond and the concrete compatibility were obtained. Due to the shortened time for the subject matter systematic repeat tests were not possible so that a statistical assurance {{of the results of the}} reinforcing tests can only be attained in a later timeSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1176 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the impact compressive behavior of warp-knitted spacer fabrics developed for human body protections. A series of warp-knitted spacer fabrics was produced on a double-needle bar <b>Raschel</b> warp <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> by varying their structural parameters, including spacer monofilament inclination and fineness, fabric thickness, and surface layer structure. A drop-weight impact tester was used to test these fabrics with predefined impact energy. The impact process of a typical spacer fabric was analyzed based on its impact contact force-displacement curve, energy absorbed-contact force curve and transmitted force-time curve. The effects of the structural parameters on the impact compressive behavior of the warp-knitted spacer fabrics were also discussed. The relationship between the peak transmitted force and peak contact force was established for these fabrics. The study shows that the warp-knitted spacer fabrics {{can be used as a}} type of effective material for human body protection due to their high energy absorption capacity and reduction of the contact peak force. The study also shows that all the structural parameters significantly affect the impact compressive behavior of the warp-knitted spacer fabrics in terms of peak contact force, peak transmitted force, and energy absorbed at different impact compressive stages. According to the results obtained, the warp-knitted spacer fabrics studied can reduce about 33. 16 % of the peak contact force. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

5000|$|In Industrial Knitting applications, {{the terms}} [...] "Flat" [...] and [...] "Circular" [...] have very {{different}} meanings to those given above. A [...] "Flat" [...] or Vee Bed <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> consists of 2 flat needle beds arranged in an upside-down [...] "V" [...] formation. These needle beds can be up to 2.5 metres wide.

A flat <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> is very flexible, allowing complex stitch designs, shaped knitting and precise width adjustment.
