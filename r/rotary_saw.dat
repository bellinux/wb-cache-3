5000|$|Gunplay is {{influenced}} by the franchise's antagonists. Because Necromorphs are re-animated and re-purposed corpses, often lacking nervous, respiratory and circulatory systems, the conventions of stopping power are largely irrelevant to them. Thus, instead of targeting foes' heads or center of mass, players are encouraged to engage in [...] "strategic dismemberment" [...] by shooting off their arms and legs. Some Necromorphs can be easily defeated in this manner, but others may change attack patterns or even spawn entirely new enemies when slain. Relatedly, the game's weapons are characterized as being repurposed power tools or mining implements, such as plasma cutters, <b>rotary</b> <b>saws</b> and gravitic repulsion tools, though an increasing amount of dedicated military ordnance becomes available as the franchise progresses.|$|R

A military-grade automatic rifle is available, and Isaac can also attack enemies by clubbing them with his weapon or stomping on them. All weapons feature a secondary-fire mode; for example, the plasma cutter can be rotated 90 degrees for more effective dismemberment of vertical limbs (such as legs on a normal bipedal humanoid). The player must scavenge for ammunition and items, which are found throughout the ship or dropped by Necromorphs when killed.

40|$|Organic {{matter from}} plants {{have not been}} used optimally, {{especially}} paddy straw. Paddy straw was not strongly suggested to burn because it just left ash that not so useful to increase land fertility and plant nutrient. Organic matter decomposition can be accelerated by decreasing its size. This material can be more useful when it converts into organic fertilizer where some other materials were added and mixed thoroughly, and the proccess could be accelerated by adding activated microorganism. This process could made faster if {{the size of the}} organic matter is small. Several types of crusher have been designed either by big companies from the industrial countries or small companies like Indonesia. Crushers made by big countries are usually used by big companies. The main problem of the major types of crushers fabricated by big company was that the size of the crushing material was not small enough so it needed longer time to decomposite by microorganism. The classic problem encountered at the machine itself was that the blades was not strong enough that they could break if the impact was too high. 	This research was aimed to design a crusher machine that could produce a smaller size of plant residus than the other machines could do. The knives consisted of 10 rotary saws with 10 inches in diameter installed at certain distance among them. At the left and right side of every <b>rotary</b> <b>saw</b> were installed a plate with 1 cm in thick that functioned as a flywheel and made the rotary saws strong. A 7. 5 HP diesel engine used as a power source and double belt-pulley as transmition power. A V-shaped hopper was installed {{on the left side of}} the concave and outlet was at the right bottom of the concave. The raw material was thrown into the crushing chamber manually. The machine was tested using 100 kg of paddy straw (10 bags). 	The results showed that the effective capacity was 206, 2 kg/hr. The main result was released from the screen of 100 mesh. The weight of the machine was 191 kg (included engine) and it consumed 0, 9 liter per hour of diesel fuel and the average rotating speed 812 RPM. Generally, the machine was able to operate without worrying of knives would break. Keywords: Plants residus, <b>rotary</b> <b>saw,</b> crushing machine, material capacity...|$|E
50|$|Its {{return is}} brief, {{as one of}} the antagonists destroys it successfully. However, plans for a new car are {{discovered}} and soon the protagonists build the Mach 6. The Mach 6's engine is not designed to run on gas, which is a crucial story point, even though gas is still used for it through most of the series. It has all the features of the Mach Five, but redesigned or changed in some form or another. For example, the <b>rotary</b> <b>saws</b> are kept, but they're turned into laser saws, and the blades can pivot so things that are over head can be cut.

50|$|Tube {{notching}} for {{fabrication of}} circular tube is thus most commonly {{done with a}} <b>rotary</b> hole <b>saw</b> in which a hole saw of {{the diameter of the}} tube being attached to is fed into the stock to be notched at a semi-perpendicular angle. This produces a semi-circular notch. Rather than using large presses, such saw notching may only require a simple jig, also making it suitable for on-site working.|$|R
40|$|An {{off-line}} near-infrared reflectance (NIR) {{feasibility study}} was conducted to explore the critical steps in the NIR determination of the major potato constituents (dry matter, starch, and protein) in relatively large (10 kg) potato samples. The results were important for the design of an automated industrial analysis system for potatoes with in-line NIR. The 10 -kg potato samples were pulped with an industrial <b>rotary</b> <b>saw</b> blade rasp. A critical step in the NIR measurements was the occurrence of phase separation in the potato pulp. Phase separation manifests itself directly after pulping the potatoes and significantly affects the NIR spectrum. Therefore, during the NIR measurements, the potato pulp had to be stirred continuously. The NIR spectra (1, 100 - 2, 500 nm) were measured by applying an optical fiber NIR probe (EDAPT- 1) connected to the NIR spectrophotometer (Technicon Infralyzer IA 500). NIR models for the concentration of dry matter, starch, and coagulating protein in potatoes have been developed. With the partial least squares regression procedure, promising NIR models were calculated. The NIR models were validated using an independent validation set of potato samples. The root mean square error in prediction of the samples in the validation set was 0. 5 % (w/w) for dry matter, 0. 63 (w/w) for starch concentration, and 0. 06 % (w/w) for the coagulating protein. © 2010 EAPR...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of organic fertilizer was still constrained by low crushing capacity, especially for paddy straw. This material {{has not been}} utilize optimally for organic fertilizer. Paddy rice harvest index is about 0, 5, meaning paddy rice plant produced straw as much as 50 {{percent of the total}} material which was yielded by paddy plantation. It is a potential source for organic fertilizer. The problem is that farmers could cut it into small piece in high capacity. Several machines have been designed to solve this low capacity but many trouble operations found by these machines. In this research, the knives were replaced by rotary saws. These rotary saws were connected to the shaft by screw mode. The objective of this research was to create a capable machine that could crush the paddy straw and overcome the disadvantage of previous machines. Another objective was to get the yield as small as possible so the decomposition process will run rapidly. This research used an engineering design method. It was conducted through 5 steps; they were Definition of the problem, Gathering of information, Generation of alternative solutions, Evaluation of alternatives and decision making, and Communication of the results. The designed machine was drawn into technical drawing and then fabricated it at the Agricultural Engineering Workshop. The rotary saws were rotated by a 7. 5 hp-diesel engine. The material capacity was 190. 6 kg per hour at 1400 rpm while the fuel consumption was 0. 85 L/hour. In conclusion, the shaft to shaft transmision could be applied to the <b>rotary</b> <b>saw</b> crusher with a lighter fibration and smaller size.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{influence}} of asbestos {{on the health of}} the workers engaged in works in which they use materials made of asbestos, the environmental investigation and their health examination were carried out in a shipyard where such materials have been used increasingly in recent years. The clarified facts and the conclusions thereby were as follows: 1) At the shipbuilding plant, lagging workers and carpenters were engaged in asbestos-handling works. The environmental airs around the lagging workers and carpenters were measured and proved to have 4 and 55. 4 fibres/c㎥ of asbestos in maximum respectively. Carpenters were engaged in works cutting several kinds of noninflammable board and sound proofing board. For the works, large quantity of asbestos dust was generated. It was observed that the lack of experience and knowledge for asbestos-works had delayed the measures to protect the hazards. The need of the establishment of the countermeasures against general dust hazards as well as asbestos dust hazards must be urgently recognized. 2) The asbestos-handling works might influence on other works which were carried out simultaneously in the same new ship under construction. The prevention of asbestos hazards for other workers must be considered. 3) Chest X-ray examination explored that 35. 7 % of lagging workers and 31. 0 % of carpenters had pneumoconiosis. Asbestos bodies were found with high frequency in both groups. The facts supported that they had suffered from the exposure of asbestos substantially. Between the two groups, differences of X-ray findings were observed; irregular small opacities in lagging workers and irregular small opacities as well as compound small opacities in carpenters. They were thought to be due to the differences of kinds of dust inhaled. 4) The countermeasures against the cutting procedure of asbestos cloth and pipe covering in the case of lagging workers, and the dust generated in high density by electric <b>rotary</b> <b>saw</b> in the case of carpenters are the urgent need to be established...|$|E

40|$|Outbreaks of wound {{infection}} with Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus {{occurred in a}} abattoir and a pork-processing factory in Autumn 1980. Investigations showed that staff handling the meat before de-boning were particularly affected and that bone {{was the cause of}} 48 % of the wounds which became clinicially infected. Of the total isolates of Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus from wounds of known cause 75 % were from lesions caused by bone. In one outbreak streptococcal infection was seen principally in newly-employed staff. Group L streptococci were found in several sites in the pork factory and were isolated from infected lesions in two workers. Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus were cultured from tap handles in the lavatories. Sixty-six workers were examined in a non-epidemic period and 59 % were found to have current wounds on the hand or wrists; 13 % of wounds were infected but Strep. pyogenes was not isolated. Bone was the commonest of the many causes of injury, accounting for 31 % of all wounds. Butchers had the highest rates of wounding and most bone-inflicted injury was seen in this group. Packers were the only group to wear protective gloves regularly. Damaged fingernails were found in 50 % of workers, including a high proportion of nail-biters (33 % of all workers). The epidemic strain of Staph. aureus was cultured from bitten fingernails. Three of four infected workers carrying epidemic organisms in the throat were examined and all were nail-biters. Sharp-edged bone was produced by <b>rotary</b> <b>saws</b> early in the production line and bone dust contaminated the carcasses and adjacent surfaces.

The new car features a transparent, holographic screen (better known as the 'comp') over the dashboard that the driver can use to interact live with his crew, and with other racers. Apparently, Speed mentions it can dispense rubber spiders out the back, and also real spiders, but he has not confirmed this. In recent episodes in Season 2, a new Mach 6 feature has been revealed after the completion of the gasless engine. When the Mach 6 gets up to the speed of 250 mph, an electrical charge causes the car to jump to another location in a matter of seconds. However, this feature can only be used three times before the car can be restarted. It has also been hinted that the Mach 6 has the ability to time travel with the right part for the gasless engine.|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} semi-industrial {{system with}} in-line near-infrared reflectance (NIR) for {{the characterization of}} the chemical composition of potatoes was designed and constructed, and its performance was tested. The system consisted of the following subsystems: sample crate manipulator, weighing unit for the gross sample weight, potato washing machines with a washing water recycling system, belt for visual inspection of the potatoes, unit for measuring the underwater weight (UWW), industrial <b>rotary</b> <b>saw</b> blade rasp for pulping the potatoes equipped with a sulfite dosage system for inhibiting enzymatic browning of the pulped potatoes, and industrial NIR system for the measurement of the potato composition. The whole system was controlled and operated by a programmable logic controller and process personal computer system. The system was able to process 12 potato samples per hour. Measurements were done to establish the sample carry-over in the system. The carry-over was proven to be well below the maximum acceptable level of 2 %. The UWW values established with the automatic system corresponded very well with the UWW data obtained by manual weighting. The day-to-day reproducibility of the UWW system was tested with golf balls. These balls have about the same specific gravity and size as potatoes. The day-to-day reproducibility coefficient of variation of the UWW unit was 0. 4 %. As a principle of proof, two tentative partial least squares calibration models, one for the starch concentration {{and one for the}} coagulating protein concentration in the potato samples, were calculated, applying leaving one out cross-validation. Both models were very promising. The by NIR-predicted starch concentrations showed to be at least as good or even better than the by UWW-obtained starch concentrations. The average difference between the by NIR-predicted and the chemically measured starch concentration was 0. 0 ± 0. 3 % (w/w). For the coagulating protein concentration, the average difference between the by NIR-predicted and the chemically measured concentration was 0. 00 ± 0. 06 % (w/w).

Three different contact angles were measured: the sessile angle, the advancing angle, and the receding angle. All angles were measured with a goniometer Krüss G 23. ResultsThe highest contact angle was observed in Group 4 (control group), considering both sessile and advancing angles. Hypoclean and Chlor-Xtra solutions immediately spread on the dentin surface, yielding a zero-degree contact angle. Pure NaOCl solution showed a 35 -degree sessile contact angle and a 64 -degree advancing contact angle. The detected receding angle was zero.

This material can be more useful when it converts to organik fertilizer where some other materials were added and mixed thoroughly, and the proccess could be accelerated by activated bacteria. this proccess could made faster if the size of the organic matter is small. Several types of crusher have been designed either by big companies from the industrial countries or small companies like Indonesia. Crushers made by big counties are usually used by big companies. Crusher machines made by small factories that have low capacity, often were often in trouble when the material to be broken have strong and long fiber. In some cases the knives often broke because they were just welded to the axis where the knives rotated. 	This research was aimed to design a crusher machine that could produce a smaller size of plant residus than the other machines could do. The knives consisted of 16 <b>rotary</b> <b>saws.</b> There were 15 spacers made of 0. 5 cm-thick, 15 cm in diameter placed one after another of the knives. To rotate the sharp, a 1. 5 HP electric motor was used with a belt-pulley transmission. A trapezium hopper was installed right over the knive-cylinder. This machine was tested for several source of organic matters like palmoil empty fruit bunch, cassava tree, corn corb, palmoil leaf, and acacia tree. 	The results showed that the material capacity to crush the palmoil empty fruit bunch, cassava tree, corn corb, palmoil leaf, and another tree (angsana tree) were 154, 6 kg/jam, 172, 4 kg/jam, 163, 2 kg/jam, 67 kg/jam, dan 160, 4 kg/jam in subsequently. There was no regular shape of crushed material except for palmoil empty fruit bunch. For the palmoil empty fruit bunch, 	the product formed a long fiber and small size material like sand.

40|$|Our primary {{objective}} was to measure root canal penetrations of aqueous antibacterial nano-chitosan (Nano-CS), for the first time. The second {{objective was to}} compare and contrast such penetrations to those of chitosan (CS) itself, as well as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), chlorhexidine (CHX) and ethylenediamintetraacetic acid (EDTA), at the routinely used concentrations. Molar roots were split longitudinally by a <b>rotary</b> diamond <b>saw.</b> Nano-CS was made by dissolving CS in acetic acid and adding tripolyphosphate (TPP), followed by a freeze-drying process. Dentin penetrations are estimated through measurements of sessile contact angles. Penetrations of the probed irrigants were assessed as inverse functions of their sessile contact angles. Accordingly, all Nano-CS solutions showed smaller sessile angles compared to those of NaOCl, CS, and EDTA samples. Hence, Nano-CS {{appeared to be a}} superior irrigant for demonstrating a higher penetration than the latter three. It fell only behind CHX, yet, the superb chelating ability of Nano-CS enabled it to remove smear layer to a larger extend than all of our other irrigants including CHX. Nano-CS could be considered as a new irrigant. Higher penetration was its main advantage over CS, and commercial NaOCl, and EDTA. This was verified by  the smaller sessile contact angle of Nano-CS. Anticipated chelating effect of Nano-CS could anchor more efficient removal of smear layer. This was another advantage of Nano-CS over other irrigants including CHX. Other advantages of Nano-CS included its reported biocompatibility, biodegradability and antibacterial effects. Commercialization of Nano-CS was deemed in the near horizon...|$|R
