40|$|To {{plan and}} execute {{rehabilitation}} of a decimated dentition {{is probably one}} of the most intellectually and technically demanding tasks faced by any prosthodontist. Attachments are small interlocking devices, which are used to connect prosthesis and abutments that offer a variety of solutions to challenge of balance between functional stability and cosmetic appeal. This clinical report describes a multidisciplinary approach for complete oral rehabilitation of a patient with few remaining natural teeth using precision attachment (ceka Preci-Clix Radicular RC) for mandibular overdenture and semi precision attachment (ceka <b>revax</b> extracoronal and ceka vertix) for maxillary cast partial denture...|$|E
40|$|Every year, many archeological {{findings}} are discovered. It {{is necessary to}} document and conserve these items dug up from the ground. However, archeologists and conservators cannot handle such a big amount of newly found items. This work offers an alternative approach to standard conservation techniques, increasing the processing capacity and lowering the cost on items’ conservation. Studied alternative, mainly for protection of metallic artefacts, includes thin films based on parylene and organosilicons. Thin films were prepared on two experimental apparatuses. Parylene films were deposited by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Final product was a thin film of parylene C. Organosilicon thin films were deposited via plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). PECVD apparatus operates with capacitively coupled radiofrequently initiated plasma. Using hexamethyldisiloxane, thin films very similar to silicon dioxide were produced, thus called SiOx. Thin films were characterized by several methods and compared to standard treatment used by conservators – tannate layer, acrylic furnish Paraloid B 72 and microcrystalline wax <b>Revax</b> 30. Parylene films showed excellent conformity and resistance to corrosion on iron substrate. First signs of corrosion were observed on layer of 5 µm thickness after 24 hours in salt fog. On samples coated by SiOx films, corrosion was spreading wide even during 1 st hour of the corrosion test. Most probable cause was that SiOx film has thermal expansion coefficient different from iron substrate and due to this fact cracking occurs during cooling down of the treated substrate. On samples coated by standard treatment, corrosion occurred after 1 - 3 hours of the test. Oxygen transmission rate (OTR) measurements (performed on polypropylene substrate) confirmed good barrier properties of parylene C. Best parylene thin films had OTR approximately 170 cm 3 •m- 2 •atm- 1 •day- 1. SiOx films reached good results with OTR 300 cm 3 •m- 2 •atm- 1 •day- 1, compared to clean polypropylene substrate with OTR 1700 cm 3 •m- 2 •atm- 1 •day- 1. Standard conservation layers could not be applied on polypropylene substrate, thus their OTR was not measured. We {{did not succeed in}} finding a substrate which is compatible for all types of treatments. Next, the study focused on combinations of thin films forming sandwich structures. All types let the corrosion attack the substrate during the 1 st hour of the test. The cause was insufficient film thickness as well as crack ing of SiOx films due to different thermal expansion properties from the iron substrate. Although SiOx thin films were not deposited on substrate directly, they have excellent adhesion to parylenu and thus they could tear parylenu films due to thermal expansion. However, OTR measurements showed improvement in barrier properties. Multilayer parylene C–SiOx–parylene C–SiOx had OTR 5 cm 3 •m- 2 •atm- 1 •day- 1. Final result is that parylene C thin films have better barrier properties than standard coatings and are suitable for conservation of metallic archaeological artefacts. SiOx films and multilayers showed poor anticorrosion protection of metallic substrates but they have good barrier and chemical properties in combination with other types of substrates. Mainly deposited on polymers, there is great potential for their application in many fields. Further research would be focused on new substrates for SiOx thin films and on the improvement of UV stability of parylene films...|$|E
