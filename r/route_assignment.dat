5000|$|<b>Route</b> <b>assignment</b> allocates trips {{between an}} origin and {{destination}} by a particular mode to a route. Often (for highway <b>route</b> <b>assignment)</b> Wardrop's principle of user equilibrium is applied (equivalent to a Nash equilibrium), wherein each driver (or group) chooses the shortest (travel time) path, subject to every other driver doing the same. The difficulty is that travel times are a function of demand, while demand {{is a function of}} travel time, the so-called bi-level problem. Another approach is to use the Stackelberg competition model, where users ("followers") respond to the actions of a [...] "leader", in this case for example a traffic manager. This leader anticipates on the response of the followers.|$|E

Local authorities may request <b>route</b> <b>assignment</b> from the Caltrans Transportation System Information Program, and all requests require approval of the executive committee of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).|$|E
50|$|Mode choice {{analysis}} {{is the third}} step in the conventional four-step transportation forecasting model. The steps, in order, are trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice analysis, and <b>route</b> <b>assignment.</b> Trip distribution's zonal interchange analysis yields a set of origin destination tables that tells where the trips will be made. Mode choice analysis allows the modeler to determine what mode of transport will be used, and what modal share results.|$|E

This is categorized by an employee's five-digit badge number, {{though some of}} the longest serving employees still have only four-digits. An employee's badge number indicates the relative length of employment with the MBTA; badges are issued in sequential order. The rating structure determines many different things, including the rank in which perks are to be offered to employee, such as: When offering the choice for quarter-annual <b>route</b> <b>assignments</b> ("picks"), overtime offerings, and even the rank to transfer new hires from part-time roles to a full-time role.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} reduced-complexity genetic {{algorithm}} for secure and dynamic deployment of resource constrained multi-hop mobile sensor networks. Mobility and security are relatively expensive operations since they involve both communication and computation. Furthermore, these operations have to co-exist with optimal node and <b>route</b> <b>assignments.</b> The {{goal of this}} paper is to achieve optimal secure coverage and improved battery life using dynamic re-locatability. The genetic algorithm is used to adaptively configure optimal position and security attributes by dynamically monitoring network traffic, packet integrity, and battery usage. This results in minimization of the power consumption of the sensor system while maximizing the sensor objectives (coverage and exposure). I...|$|R
50|$|While {{the portion}} of US 202 in New York has {{remained}} relatively unchanged since the <b>route's</b> <b>assignment</b> in 1934, the overlapping routes have changed over time. The alignments of NY 118 and NY 100 north of New Croton Reservoir were flipped , placing NY 100 on the Croton Reservoir-Croton Falls highway. The resulting overlap between NY 100 and US 202 lasted as late as 1990; however, it was eliminated by 2004 when NY 100 was cut back to end at US 202 in Somers. In the early 1940s, {{the portion of}} US 202 between Peekskill and Amawalk became part of NY 35, an east-west route connecting Peekskill to Ridgefield, Connecticut.|$|R
50|$|Trip {{distribution}} (or destination {{choice or}} zonal interchange analysis) {{is the second}} component (after trip generation, but before mode choice and <b>route</b> <b>assignment)</b> in the traditional four-step transportation forecasting model. This step matches tripmakers’ origins and destinations to develop a “trip table”, a matrix that displays the number of trips going from each origin to each destination. Historically, this component has been the least developed component of the transportation planning model.|$|E
50|$|Predictive {{time delay}} {{is based on}} the concept that the system or the user knows when the {{congestion}} point is reached or when the delay of the freeway would be equal to the delay on city streets, and the decision for <b>route</b> <b>assignment</b> is taken in time. On the other hand, reactive time delay is when the system or user waits to experience the point where the delay is observed and the diversion of routes is in reaction to that experience. Predictive delay gives significantly better results than the reactive delay method.|$|E
50|$|Transport {{planning}} {{allows for}} high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of transport forecasting, planners {{are able to}} predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport {{as part of the}} supply chain. Transport as a field is also studied through transport economics, a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. Transport engineering, a sub-discipline of civil engineering, must take into account trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and <b>route</b> <b>assignment,</b> while the operative level is handled through traffic engineering.|$|E

30|$|The {{required}} {{four steps}} to model trips consist of calculating trip generation, trip distribution, modal split and <b>route</b> <b>assignments.</b> The sources to inform these steps traditionally {{have come from}} travel diaries and census data [1]. However, the presence of new {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) provide big data sources that are allowing novel research and applications related to human mobility. Recent studies have advanced the knowledge on trip generation by studying the number of different locations visited by individuals through mobile phones and quantifying their frequent return to previously visited locations. These have demonstrated that the majority of travels occur between a limited number of places, with less frequent trips to new places outside an individual radius [2, 3]. In the domain of trip distributions, new models have helped us to predict number of commuting trips when lacking data for calibration [4].|$|R

Even the smallest theft is strictly prohibited by Royalty Airlines, and could mean termination.

Through a course of events, Donna discovers that Christine had switched their test booklets when they were being handed up to their trainer.|$|E
50|$|The {{planning}} {{aspects of}} transportation engineering relate to elements of urban planning, and involve technical forecasting decisions and political factors. Technical forecasting of passenger travel usually involves an urban transportation planning model, requiring {{the estimation of}} trip generation (how many trips for what purpose), trip distribution (destination choice, where is the traveler going), mode choice (what mode is being taken), and <b>route</b> <b>assignment</b> (which streets or routes are being used). More sophisticated forecasting can include other aspects of traveler decisions, including auto ownership, trip chaining (the decision to link individual trips together in a tour) and the choice of residential or business location (known as land use forecasting). Passenger trips {{are the focus of}} transportation engineering because they often represent the peak of demand on any transportation system.|$|E
50|$|In mode choice, {{trips are}} {{assigned}} to a mode (usually auto or transit) based on what’s available in a particular zone, {{the characteristics of the}} household within that zone and the cost of the mode for each mode in terms of money and time. Since most trips by bicycle or walking are generally shorter, they are assumed to have stayed within one zone and are not included in the analysis. Finally, in <b>route</b> <b>assignment,</b> trips {{are assigned to}} the network. As particular parts of the network are assigned trips, the vehicle speed slows down, so some trips are assigned to alternate routes {{in such a way that}} all trip times are equal. This is important because the ultimate goal is system-wide optimization, not optimization for any one individual. The finished product is traffic flows and speeds for each link in the network.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{collaborative}} {{vehicle routing problem}} of multiple distribution centers with simultaneous pickup and delivery considering the constraint {{of the number of}} vehicles and vehicle’s work time, and the fairness of routing arrangement. The objective functions include minimizing the number of utilized vehicles, the travel distance, and the standard deviation of maximum load and vehicle’s utilized time. This paper proposes a mutiobjective mathematical programming model to formulate this problem. And a TS algorithm with Lagrangian Relaxation Approach is designed. This algorithm gives the maximum lower bound of the solutions, achieves the optimal feasible solutions by <b>routes</b> <b>assignment</b> and adjustment strategies. The Tabu Search is embedded with a random neighborhood ordering with restart and shaking methods. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm presented satisfactory solutions, and the collaborative routing arrangement is more economical, fair, and reasonable than non-collaborative arrangement...|$|R
30|$|An {{important}} {{topic is}} to explore <b>route</b> <b>assignments</b> {{in the context of}} smart multimodal systems [5, 6], where individual daily trips follow recommendations based on personal and global constraints. This is of special interest towards efficient cities, where individuals could be automatically routed reducing the probability of traffic congestion {{and at the same time}} reducing the environmental impact. From the individual’s point of view, for instance, one might want to choose a trip which minimizes the amount of traffic along the route, or to avoid routes across areas with high criminality level, or to favorite routes across more touristic areas, etc. On the other hand, the choices of certain routes at individual level, without accounting for the state of the system, often leads to traffic congestion [7, 8] which, in turn, is responsible for increasing pollution while decreasing the quality of the environment, with evident impact on the community.|$|R
40|$|High-speed {{photonic}} switching networks {{can switch}} optical signals {{at the rate}} of several terabits per second. However, they suffer from an intrinsic crosstalk problem when two optical signals cross at the same switch element. To avoid crosstalk, active connections must be node-disjoint in the switching network. In this paper, we propose a sequence of decomposition and merge operations, called conjugate transformation, performed on each switch element to tackle this problem. The network resulting from this transformation is called conjugate network. By using the numbering-schemes of networks, we prove that if the <b>route</b> <b>assignments</b> in the original network are link-disjoint, their corresponding ones in the conjugate network would be node-disjoint. Thus, traditional nonblocking switching networks can be transformed into crosstalk-free optical switches in a routine manner. Furthermore, we show that crosstalk-free multicast switches can also be obtained from existing nonblocking multicast switches via the same conjugate transformation. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
50|$|<b>Route</b> <b>{{assignment}},</b> route choice, or {{traffic assignment}} concerns {{the selection of}} routes (alternative called paths) between origins and destinations in transportation networks. It is the fourth step in the conventional transportation forecasting model, following trip generation, trip distribution, and mode choice. The zonal interchange analysis of trip distribution provides origin-destination trip tables. Mode choice analysis tells which travelers will use which mode. To determine facility needs and costs and benefits, {{we need to know}} the number of travelers on each route and link of the network (a route is simply a chain of links between an origin and destination). We need to undertake traffic (or trip) assignment. Suppose there is a network of highways and transit systems and a proposed addition. We first want to know the present pattern of traffic delay and then {{what would happen if the}} addition were made.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{drawbacks}} to {{the application}} of many early models was the inability {{to take account of}} congested travel time on the road network in determining the probability of making a trip between two locations. Although Wohl noted as early as 1963 research into the feedback mechanism or the “interdependencies among assigned or distributed volume, travel time (or travel ‘resistance’) and route or system capacity”, this work has yet to be widely adopted with rigorous tests of convergence, or with a so-called “equilibrium” or “combined” solution (Boyce et al. 1994). Haney (1972) suggests internal assumptions about travel time used to develop demand should be consistent with the output travel times of the <b>route</b> <b>assignment</b> of that demand. While small methodological inconsistencies are necessarily a problem for estimating base year conditions, forecasting becomes even more tenuous without an understanding of the feedback between supply and demand. Initially heuristic methods were developed by Irwin and Von Cube (as quoted in Florian et al. (1975) [...] ) and others, and later formal mathematical programming techniques were established by Evans (1976).|$|E

40|$|Most {{research}} about the {{vehicle routing problem}} (VRP) does not collectively address many of the constraints that real-world transportation companies have regarding <b>route</b> <b>assignments.</b> Consequently, our primary objective is to explore solutions for real-world VRPs with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, multi-depot subcontractors (drivers), and pickup/delivery time window and location constraints. We use a nested bi-criteria genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the total time to complete all jobs with the fewest number of route drivers. Our model will explore the issue of weighting the objectives (total time vs. number of drivers) and provide Pareto front solutions {{that can be used}} to make decisions on a case-by-case basis. Three different real-world data sets were used to compare the results of our GA vs. transportation field experts’ job assignments. For the three data sets, all 21 Pareto efficient solutions yielded improved overall job completion times. In 57 % (12 / 21) of the cases, the Pareto efficient solutions also utilized fewer drivers than the field experts’ job allocation strategies...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{present a}} simple traffic micro-simulation model that models {{the effects of}} {{capacity}} cut-off, i. e. the effect of queue built-up when demand is exceeding capacity, and queue spillback, i. e. the effect that queues can spill back across intersections when a congested link is filled up. They derive the model`s fundamental diagrams and explain it. The simulation is used to simulate traffic on the emme/ 2 network of the Portland (Oregon) metropolitan region (20, 000 links). Demand is generated by a simplified home-to-work assignment which generates about half a million trips for the AM peak. <b>Route</b> <b>assignment</b> is done by iterative feedback between micro-simulation and router.

40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of the traffic flow dynamics in urban road networks, most quantitative descriptions of city traffic so far are based on computer simulations. This contribution pursues a macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) simulation approach, which facilitates a simple simulation of congestion spreading in cities. First, we show that a quantization of the macroscopic turning flows into units of single vehicles is necessary to obtain realistic fluctuations in the traffic variables, and how this can be implemented in a fluid-dynamic model. Then, we propose a new method to simulate destination flows without the requirement of individual <b>route</b> <b>assignments.</b> Combining both methods allows us to study a variety of different simulation scenarios. These reveal fundamental relationships between the average flow, the average density, and the variability of the vehicle densities. Considering the inhomogeneity of traffic as an independent variable can eliminate the scattering of congested flow measurements. The variability also {{turns out to be a}} key variable of urban traffic performance. Our results can be explained through the number of full links of the road network, and approximated by a simple analytical formula.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this study centers on {{developing}} an aggregate air itinerary share model estimated at the city-pair level within the US air transportation system. This <b>route</b> demand <b>assignment</b> model {{is part of a}} new modeling approach that has as its ultimate output the prediction of detailed traffic information for the US air transportation system. In this approach, city-pair demand generation, <b>route</b> demand <b>assignment</b> and air traffic levels estimations are completed in 3 different stages within a single framework. Aiming to fully develop the overall model, in this paper we focus on estimating the 2 nd stage, the air itinerary choice model. In order to achieve this, the first approach taken applies a multinomial logit model and uses a combination of stated preferences (SP) and revealed preferences (RP) data to estimate the model. By using a mixed dataset, we attempt to improve the RP model results, which often perform poorly due to high demand inelasticity. Preliminary results show the potential of this approach, although further analysis is required to understand the results obtained. For the final paper, different approaches and further interactions among the model attributes will be applied to improve the model’s performance...|$|R
