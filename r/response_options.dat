2500|$|Globally, some atheists also {{consider}} themselves Agnostic, Buddhist, Hindu, Jains, [...] Taoist, or hold other related philosophical beliefs. Some, like Secular Jews and Shintoists, may indulge in some religious activities {{as a way}} of connecting with their culture, all the while being atheist. Therefore, given limited poll options, some may use other terms to describe their identity. Some politically motivated organizations that report or gather population statistics may, intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresent atheists. Survey designs may bias results {{due to the nature of}} elements such as the wording of questions and the available <b>response</b> <b>options.</b> Statistics are generally collected on the assumption that religion is a categorical variable. Instruments have been designed to measure attitudes toward religion, including one that was used by L. L. Thurstone. This may be a particularly important consideration among people who have neutral attitudes, as it is more likely that prevailing social norms will influence the responses of such people on survey questions that effectively force respondents to categorize themselves either as belonging to a particular religion or belonging to no religion. A negative perception of atheists and pressure from family and peers may also cause some atheists to disassociate themselves from atheism. Misunderstanding of the term may also be a reason some label themselves differently.|$|E

Purpose of the Study: To evaluate if the Upper Limb Functional Index (ULFI) clinimetric properties are improved by modification to a three-point <b>response</b> <b>option</b> and {{to verify the}} factor structure. Methods: Stage 1, calibration (n = 139) used ULFI dichotomous responses, and stage 2, validation (n = 117) used a three-point <b>response</b> <b>option.</b> The clinimetric properties were compared in physical therapy outpatients with the QuickDASH as the reference standard. Repeated measurements were made at two to four weekly intervals. Results: The ULFI three-point <b>response</b> <b>option</b> improved reliability [intraclass correlation coefficient (2, 1) = 0. 98], internal consistency (α = 0. 92), QuickDASH concurrent validity (r = 0. 86), and responsiveness. Minimal detectable change (90 % confidence interval) was 7. 9 %, and factor structure was unidimensional. Missing responses were < 0. 5 %, and practical characteristics were unchanged.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{original}} {{version of the}} Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ 30 orig) suffers from a ceiling effect and hence has reduced clinical validity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of adding eight more demanding items (CHAQ 38) and a new categorical <b>response</b> <b>option</b> (CATII) on discriminant validity and score distribution in a European patient sample. Methods Eighty-nine children with Juvenile Idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 22 healthy controls, aged 7 - 16 years, were recruited from eight centres across Europe. Eight new CHAQ items and scoring option were translated back and forth for the countries in which they were not already present. Demographic, clinical, and CHAQ data were collected on-site. Subsequently, five different scoring methods were applied, i. e. the original method (CHAQ 30 orig) and four alternatives. These alternatives consisted of the mean item scores for the 30 and 38 -question versions with either the original (CATI), or the new categorical <b>response</b> <b>option</b> (CATII). The five versions were tested for their ability to distinguish between patients and controls. Furthermore score distributions were evaluated and visualized by box and whisker plots. Results Two CHAQ revisions with the new <b>response</b> <b>option</b> showed poor discriminative ability, whereas one revised version (CHAQ 38 CATI) had comparable discriminative ability comparable to the original CHAQ. A profound ceiling effect was observed in the original scoring method of the CHAQ (27 %). The addition of eight more demanding items and application of a plain mean item score reduced this significantly to 14 % (χ 2 = 4. 21; p Conclusions Revising the CHAQ by adding eight more demanding items and applying a plain mean item scoring (CHAQ 38 CATI) maintained discriminant ability and reduced the ceiling effect in a European patient sample. The new categorical <b>response</b> <b>option</b> (CATII) seemed promising, but was less able to distinguish children with JIA from healthy controls and had less favourable distribution characteristics. The CHAQ 38 CATI is advocated for future use in mildly affected JIA patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, the rise in attacks on {{communication}} devices in networks {{has resulted in a}} reduction of network functionality, throughput, and performance. To detect and mitigate these network attacks, researchers, academicians, and practitioners developed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) with automatic response systems. The response system is considered an important component of IDS, since without a timely response IDSs may not function properly in countering various attacks, especially on a real-time basis. To respond appropriately, IDSs should select the optimal <b>response</b> <b>option</b> according to the type of network attack. This research study provides a complete survey of IDSs and Intrusion Response Systems (IRSs) on the basis of our in-depth understanding of the <b>response</b> <b>option</b> for different types of network attacks.
