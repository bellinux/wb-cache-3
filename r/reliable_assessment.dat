25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. Instructors are faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid, <b>reliable</b> <b>assessment</b> that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E

Ed. (Hons) in-service programme. The study addresses the following questions relating to the development of new forms of assessment. a) 	Can valid and <b>reliable</b> <b>assessments</b> of the performance of pupils be made in areas of the curriculum which are not amenable to measurement by standardised tests, by the provision of criteria for assessment in terms of observable pupil behaviours and structures classroom activities in which to observe these behaviours? b) 	Do teachers make valid and <b>reliable</b> <b>assessments</b> of pupil performance in areas of the curriculum not amenable to measurement by standardised tests? c) 	If teachers are unable to make valid and <b>reliable</b> <b>assessments</b> of pupils what are the factors contributing to their judgements of pupil performance in such areas? d) 	What is the relationship between pupil performance in those areas of the curriculum not assessed by standardised tests and other pupil characteristics such as age, sex, social class, attainment in basic skills, pupil type and teaching style? e) 	Does in-service education affect the quality of teachers’ assessments by the provision of appropriate information skills to facilitate assessment of pupil performance in areas other than those tested by standardised achievement tests? The results of the study indicate that the structured activities provided reasonably valid measures of pupil performance on study skills dimensions of questioning, sequencing, comprehension, originality and appropriateness. However, teachers’ assessments were found to be subject to a number of sources of invalidity. Pupil performance was also found to vary by sex and age on aspects of the structured activities and teaching style influences were noted. The study of in-service provision raised questions regarding the processes and outcomes of teacher professional learning in the current climate of accountability and advocacy of teacher self-evaluation...|$|R

Shallow clouds (e.g., stratus, stratocumulus, shallow cumulus) play particularly important roles in the energy budget of the earth through radiation process because they cover a broad area of the earth (e.g., Randall et al. 1984).

The Psychological Operations (PSYOP) branch has the unique responsibility for nesting assessment into every Military Information Support Operation it conducts. This critical element of PSYOPs operational design {{is capable of}} demonstrating psychological effects, identifying behavioral changes, eliminating ineffective programs, and facilitating continuous methodological improvement. Unfortunately, the PSYOP community has struggled for decades with providing valid assessments of psychological operations. Recently, numerous sources have admonished the branch for failing to deliver valid or <b>reliable</b> <b>assessments.</b> Drawing from organizational theory, this thesis develops the Dynamic Capability Alignment Model that supports PSYOP branchs development of an officer with the professional educational foundation to conduct the core task: assess. The model provided a structured/focused question framework for analyzing the branchs officer selection, training, career progression, and operational design {{in an attempt to}} identify the root cause for the communitys failure to deliver <b>reliable</b> <b>assessments.</b> The analysis identified the absence of a sound scientific foundation as the root cause of PSYOPs inability to conduct assessment. This fundamental problem is exacerbated by inadequate academic selection criteria and the existence of numerous organizational challenges. This thesis concludes with recommendations for establishment of the appropriate scientific and professional educational foundation for the PSYOP branch to execute its new core task: assess.

Recent advances in educational measurement, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence have placed this goal within our reach. Intelligent systems may be improved by leveraging assessment information that is gathered from various sources (e. g., summative and formative), thus providing a viable approach toward accomplishing the aforementioned goal. This chapter analyzes the role of assessment in intelligent systems, summarizes the characteristics of successfully deployed intelligent systems, and describes an evidence-based approach to incorporating valid and <b>reliable</b> <b>assessments</b> into enhanced intelligent systems...|$|R

Psychologists are responsible for using valid and <b>reliable</b> <b>assessments</b> that are administered in a preferred language by the client. Informed consent is expected to be obtained in accordance to the guidelines on the [...] "Informed Consent" [...] standard, unless the assessment is required by the law, a routine practice or required to test for the ability to make decisions.

Psychologists may refrain from releasing test data in order to protect a participant. Psychologists are also responsible for developing valid and <b>reliable</b> <b>assessments</b> and interpreting test results by taking other factors that may influence the interpretations while also indicating any limitations associated with the interpretations. Psychologists are required to be appropriately trained in order to administer assessments and are responsible for using current tests. Psychologists are also responsible for providing necessary information when outsourcing interpretation and the interpretation of test results. Psychologists are required to explain the test results to the client or other identified persons, unless otherwise specified. Psychologists are also required to maintain security and integrity in regards to all test material.|$|R
