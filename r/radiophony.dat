50|$|In 1942, the French {{composer}} and theoretician Pierre Schaeffer, began his exploration of <b>radiophony</b> {{when he joined}} Jacques Copeau and his pupils in {{the foundation of the}} Studio d'Essai de la Radiodiffusion Nationale. His work laid the foundations of the Musique concrète. This technique involved editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. The first pieces of musique concrète in Paris were assembled by him, who went on to collaborate with Pierre Henry.|$|E

50|$|Gustavo Matamoros {{catalog of}} {{compositions}} includes numerous pieces for solo electroacoustic media or electroacoustics combined with traditional instruments. It {{also includes a}} wide variety of works based on contemporary and experimental techniques such as mixed media, installations, sound portraits, <b>radiophony,</b> text and video. He has composed a series of “Retratos” (Portraits) based on sound materials produced by the subjects portrayed on the pieces. Venezuelan composers Marianela Arocha and Adina Izarra have referred to those pieces as follows: “From the 90’s onward many forms of mix repertoire are present, also more research and improvising can be seen among the (Venezuelan) composers. Like in Gustavo Matamoros “Retratos” where each performer chooses its own material which the composer transforms on tape and sets for the interaction in concert. The composer himself speaks of gesture and morphology: all sounds are possible and allowed; all of them make sense within different contexts”. Some of the subjects for those “Portraits” are: guitarist and composer Flores Chaviano, oboist and composer Joseph Celli, poet Bob Gregory, double-bassist Luis Gómez Imbert and composer Ricardo Dal Farra.|$|E

This happens {{in the context of}} the end of the crisis and the start of economic and social development, promoting culture, creating a solid class of peasants with a certain social status, in villages, together with the priest, teacher and gendarme, increasing of the number of subscriptions and development of the Romanian <b>radiophony...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{anthology}} of essays, prose, poetry, and radio plays, explores the myriad aesthetics of <b>radiophony</b> and sound art and their cultural and experimental possibilities. The history of radiophonic art, its practice, forms, and utopian dimensions {{are some of}} the topics addressed {{from a wide range of}} approaches, including the historical, political, popular cultural, literary and archeological. Special attention is given to aspects of the body-mind relationship in connection with <b>radiophony,</b> such as the nature of the voice, and issues of gender, desire, and pyschopathology.

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, the Internet may be heralded as the great bringer of free information to all, but in the earlier parts of the 20 th century this role appointed to the great new invention, the radio. In Denmark, the earliest experiments with radio broadcasting started as private initiatives in the 1910 s and 1920 s. By 1925, the state took over responsibility for the broadcasting of radio and established Den Danske Statsradiofoni (The Danish State <b>Radiophony).</b> Thereby, a monopoly was built which was maintained until the 1980 s...|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, the {{relatively}} new distribution of voice through podcasting is considered: a distribution that extends voices - and voice performances {{in particular -}} not only through space, but also potentially through time. One of the key attributes that may be genuinely new and even revolutionary to podcasting lies in its {{creation of a new}} and extended sphere for the performance of the essentially acousmatic voice. By acousmatic, we mean the transmission and reception of voices (people and things) without their origin being visible. Podcasting thus opens up a new sphere of voicings, and of words in motion and 'in suspension': through the MP 3 download of the 'voicecast' an ever growing reservoir of old and new voices await activation as they find listeners. This means that a genuinely new extended auditory space for these acousmatic voices has emerged. It is a voice-talk sphere which draws on traditions of radio talk and <b>radiophony,</b> distinguishing itself from that other audio sphere extended by the MP 3 download: music. This discussion of podcasting considers this singular audio media form in its historical context and as having potentially revolutionary qualities. At the same time, podcasting's closest kin remains an 'old media' form, the radio. This is why we choose to assess podcasting {{in the context of the}} long history of radio dissemination and <b>radiophony,</b> particularly the tradition incorporating amateur radio, community radio, and other manifestations of the citizen voice. As a means of gleaning the potential of the digitized podcast voice, we survey recent applications of podcasting in various forms, including its recent massive uptake by the public service radio sector - which appears to be constituting a revitalization of the public radio (and public institutional) voice. 27 page(s...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposal}} of categorization of <b>radiophony</b> content, considering four levels of planning: (1) the segment, (2) the format, (3) the programming and (4) the content itself, this last one usually {{organized in the}} shape of programs. The objective is to approach and contrast what is practiced in the commercial radio broadcasting stations in Brazil to processes adopted by the radios in the United States, a market which is as a reference for the national entrepreneurship. For this, there will be part of a bibliographic review in relation to the subject, considering work of authors like Fornatale and Mills (1980), Warren (2005), Keith (2010) and Hausman, Messere, O’Donnell and Benoit (2010); and notes on the topic from The Museum of Broadcast Communications Encyclopedia of Radio, published by Sterling (2004). </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with the Act on <b>radiophony</b> and television a public broadcaster, such as the regional broadcasters of Polish Radio, is required to fulfil the so-called public mission. One important element of the programme which fulfilling this mission entails is the news bulletin. News bulletins emitted on Polish Radio Olsztyn in selected weeks of 2015 and 2016 are analysed. From this analysis, it emerges that particular {{attention is paid to}} this element of the programming in Radio Olsztyn. This is testified to both by the frequency with which bulletins are broadcast – as much as 28 times a day on weekdays, or the number of news items in each bulletin and their wide-ranging character, as well as the large number of journalists involved in the preparation of this scheduled item, the network of correspondents and local studios in Elbląg and Ełk. The radio station is an important source of regional and local information. However, although the method of preparing the information for the bulletins may be described as easy on the ear, their choice is typified by a high degree of conventionalisation...|$|E
40|$|As transformações tecnológicas têm alterado profundamente a história do rádio. Além dos sucessivos avanços, duas rupturas, do ponto de vista da linguagem, marcam a história da radiofonia, justamente por causa da tecnologia. A primeira ruptura foi com o advento da TV; a segunda acontece agora, com a webradio, que aponta para um novo modelo de radiofonia. Este processo de evolução, que chamamos de radiomorfose, altera e reconfigura os gêneros e as formas de interação presentes no rádio. O objetivo desta tese é conhecer os novos gêneros e as novas formas de interação na webradio. Para se chegar a esse fim, foi realizada pesquisa qualitativa, com corpus delimitado a 30 emissoras de rádio agrupadas em três grandes grupos (hertzianas, hertzianas com presença na {{internet}} e webradios). Em cada grupo, foram estudadas as duas categorias de análise desta tese: gênero e interação. Como parte do estudo da interação nas webradios, foi feito ainda um levantamento sobre a usabilidade das homepages. A partir do referencial teórico e pela pesquisa realizada, concluímos que os novos gêneros da webradio são o chat, o e-mail (mensagem eletrônica), o endereço eletrônico, a enquete e o fórum, nascidos genuinamente em meio digital. Mas também são novos, no suporte internet, os tradicionais gêneros radiofônicos hertzianos. Tratam-se de formas híbridas, nascidas da complexa tessitura digital da webradio. A webradio pode ser entendida como uma constelação de gêneros que abriga formatos antigos, novos e híbridos. Como as novas formas de interação na webradio, podemos elencar o chat, o fórum, a enquete e o e-mail (correio eletrônico). Mas como a web é um ambiente heterogêneo, que permite mais manipulação que o rádio hertziano, as webradios disponibilizam a seus usuários várias ferramentas interativas com o objetivo de atrair e fidelizar o seu público. A principal delas, com certeza, é o próprio site, constitutivamente polifônico, marcado por vozes não apenas sonoras, como no rádio hertziano, mas também estruturalmente formado por textos e imagens. Technological transformations have profoundly {{altered the}} history of the radio. Apart from the consecutive progress, two ruptures {{from the point of view}} of language have marked {{the history of}} <b>radiophony,</b> precisely because of technology. The first rupture happened with the onset of TV; the second is in progress now, with webradios, which points to a new model of <b>radiophony.</b> This process of evolution, which we call radio morphosis, alters and reshapes the genres and forms of interaction present on the radio. The aim of this thesis is to understand the new genres and the new forms of interaction on webradios. To do this, a qualitative research was performed, with a corpus restricted to 30 broadcasting stations, classified in three large groups (hertzian, hertzian with presence on internet, and webradios). In each group, the two categories of analysis of this thesis were studied: genre and interaction. As part of the study into interaction on webradios, a survey about usability of homepages was also done. Based on theoretical reference and the research performed, we concluded that the new genres of webradios are chats, e-mails (electronic messages), electronic addresses, surveys, and forums, all genuinely originated from digital media. But the traditional hertzian <b>radiophony</b> genres in internet environments are also new. They deal with hybrid forms, born from the complex digital structure of webradios. The webradio can be understood as a constellation of genres, which shelter old, new, and hybrid formats. As new forms of interaction on webradios, we can list chats, forums, surveys, and e-mails (electronic mail). But as the web is a heterogeneous environment, which allows more manipulation than the hertzian radio, webradios make available various interactive tools to their users with the objective of attracting and inducing the loyalty of their public. The main one, is certainly the site itself, determinatively polyphonic, marked by voices not only producing sound, as on the hertzian radio, but also structurally formed by texts and images...|$|E
