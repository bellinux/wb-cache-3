5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
25|$|Surveys in 2009 found a radicalization in the {{positions}} of Israeli Arabs towards the State of Israel, with 41% of Israeli Arabs recognizing Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> as a Jewish and democratic state (down from 65.6% in 2003), and 53.7% believing Israel has a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> as an independent country (down from 81.1% in 2003). Polls also showed that 40% of Arab citizens engaged in Holocaust denial.|$|E

25|$|People {{should and}} {{do have a}} {{constitutional}} right to criticize Israel, even harshly, including challenging its <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist.</b> There must be robust debate about the wisdom of Israel's policies, and there is much to criticize.|$|E
25|$|The teachings {{repeatedly}} reject Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> {{present the}} conflict {{as a religious}} battle for Islam, teach Israel's founding as imperialism, and actively portray {{a picture of the}} Middle East, both verbally and visually, in which Israel does not exist at all.|$|E
50|$|Estonians' {{individual}} {{human rights and}} collective <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> as an ethnic entity, have been routinely violated for eight centuries since the Northern Crusades and Baltic German rule, followed by two centuries of Russian imperial suzerainty and ending with {{half a century of}} Soviet occupation. Estonia's first constitution of 1920 included safeguards for civil and political rights that were the standard of the day. The 1925 Law on Cultural Autonomy was an innovative piece of legislation that provided {{for the protection of the}} collective rights for citizens of non-Estonian ethnicities.|$|R
50|$|Parliament on {{the other}} hand, {{particularly}} the Commons, first of all saw the relationship as a partnership. Parliament believed the king ruled by contract (an unwritten one, yet fully binding). Parliament believed that its own <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> and <b>to</b> function in the ongoing work {{of the government of}} the country were as sacrosanct as those of the King and, in that sense, Parliament's <b>rights</b> were equal <b>to</b> those of the King. Furthermore, Parliament believed that in return for grants of subsidies to the Crown, the king should take its views on policy formulation and execution into account.|$|R
50|$|In People v. Davis (1994), the California Supreme Court {{examined}} {{this and}} concluded fetal viability was not essential for <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist.</b> They reasoned that abortion {{cases such as}} Wade v. Roe discuss where {{to draw the line}} for legitimate state interest in situations where the interests of fetus and mother conflict. Such cases do not discuss, and do not preclude, a legitimate state interest in protecting the potentiality of human life perhaps arising at a different time in situations where the rights of the fetus {{do not have to be}} set against the rights of the mother.|$|R
25|$|The Jewish {{community}} in Ireland was also given recognition. The explicit granting of a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> to the Jewish faith in Ireland marked {{a significant difference}} to the legal approach to Jewish rights in other European states, though contemporary Irish society was not free of anti-semitism.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 Palestinian {{legislative}} elections Hamas won {{a majority}} in the Palestinian Legislative Council, prompting the United States and many European countries to cut off all funds to the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority insisting that the Hamas must recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous peace pacts. Israel refused to negotiate with Hamas, since Hamas never renounced its beliefs that Israel has no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> and that the entire State of Israel is an illegal occupation which must be wiped out. EU countries and the United States threatened an economic boycott if Hamas will not recognize Israel's existence, not renounce terrorism and shall support the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel in the past. Hamas officials have openly stated that the organization does not recognize Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> even though the organization expressed openness to hold a long-term truce. Hamas is considered by Israel and many other countries to be a terrorist organization and therefore not entitled to participate in formal peace negotiations.|$|E
25|$|The {{signing of}} the Oslo accords marked a {{milestone}} in Israeli-Palestinian relations, as {{for the first time}} both peoples recognised their counterpart's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist.</b> Furthermore, the Oslo Peace Process was initiated; this process was a framework for future negotiations which aimed to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict within a five-year period according to the logic of the 'two state solution', as set out in UN General Assembly Resolution 181.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{held that}} a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy <b>existed</b> and {{included}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> abortion until viability, a point {{to be determined by}} the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being.|$|R

50|$|Performance right {{originated}} in the 1988 Act. However, it has been greatly expanded by amendments to that Act. A performance {{is defined as a}} dramatic performance, a musical performance, a reading of a literary work or a variety act. The performers involved in a performance and any person who has recording <b>rights</b> with respect <b>to</b> a performance qualify for performance rights. However a performance must be a qualifying performance for the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist.</b> As with copyright, the criteria for qualification of a performance are based upon nationality of the people involved and the country where the performance takes place. In this context person means a legal entity, not necessarily an individual.|$|R
25|$|In June 2009, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak {{repeated}} {{his support for}} the peace plan. He also stated that it does not mean recognizing Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> as a Jewish state, since that would imply giving up the right of return. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman also made similar statements and he called on the international community to push Israel towards accepting the peace plan. Both leaders had responded to an address by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.|$|E
25|$|Hartley {{has been}} an {{advocate}} for the adult film industry's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> and, before the rise to stardom of Jenna Jameson, she had often been called on when television news programs and talk shows required an articulate, leading adult film actress to support the pro side. The two came under hard scrutiny from the mostly female audience, but they refused to back down and were outspoken in their support of the industry. She and Ona Zee spoke out strongly against illegal drugs in the industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{attitudes of}} the Catholic side towards the {{government}} and the ensuing Civil War was expressed in a joint episcopal letter from July 1, 1937, addressed by the Spanish bishops to all other Catholic bishops. Spain was said to be divided into two hostile camps, one side expresses anti-religious and anti-Spanish, the other side upholding the respect for the religious and national order. The Church was pastorally oriented and not willing to sell its freedom to politics but had to side with those who started out defending its freedom and <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist.</b>|$|E

50|$|Earth Law Center {{and partner}} {{groups around the}} world are {{involved}} in a movement <b>to</b> recognize the <b>rights</b> of nature. Earth Law Center asserts that the overarching legal system generally treats the natural world as property that can be exploited and degraded, rather than as an ecological partner with its own <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> and thrive. They further assert that environmental regulations in turn accept this overarching system and assume that the environment will be protected if humans take from it a little less, and a little less quickly, but that this will simply slow, and never stop, environmental degradation. The rights of nature movement contends that the value and rights of the natural world arise from the fact of its existence. Several notable legal instruments incorporate nature's rights, including the 2008 Constitution of Ecuador, which recognizes the inalienable <b>rights</b> of ecosystems <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> and flourish and allows for citizens <b>to</b> enforce these <b>rights,</b> and Bolivia's Law of the Rights of Mother Earth and subsequent Framework Law on Mother Earth and Integral Development for Living Well, which recognize legal rights for Mother Earth.|$|R

25|$|This Fifth Amendment was {{introduced}} by the Fianna Fáil government of Jack Lynch and supported by every other major political party. The Catholic Church did not voice any objection to the amendment, but it was opposed by some conservative Catholics. Some leading members of the Church of Ireland and the Jewish Community said during the campaign that while they appreciated the Article's recognition of their existence (and {{in the case of}} the Jewish Community, their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> in contrast to anti-Jewish laws in other states) in 1937, it was no longer needed in the 1970s and had lost its usefulness.|$|E
25|$|In November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat broke 30 {{years of}} hostility with Israel by visiting Jerusalem at the {{invitation}} of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. Sadat's two-day visit included a speech before the Knesset and was {{a turning point in the}} history of the conflict. The Egyptian leader created a new psychological climate in the Middle East in which peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours seemed possible. Sadat recognized Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> and established the basis for direct negotiations between Egypt and Israel. Following Sadat's visit, 350 Yom Kippur War veterans organized the Peace Now movement to encourage Israeli governments to make peace with the Arabs.|$|E
25|$|In the Palestinian {{parliamentary}} elections held on 25 January 2006, Hamas won {{a plurality of}} 42.9% of the total vote and 74 out of 132 total seats (56%). When Hamas assumed power the next month, Israel, the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations demanded that Hamas accept all previous agreements, recognize Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> and renounce violence; when Hamas refused, they cut off direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, although some aid money was redirected to humanitarian organizations not affiliated with the government. The resulting political disorder and economic stagnation led to many Palestinians emigrating from the Gaza Strip.|$|E

5000|$|The {{subsequent}} Liberal government led by Malcolm Fraser, {{elected in}} 1975, expressed [...] "support for United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242, 338 and 339 as providing {{the basis for}} a peaceful settlement". Fraser later said that Australia should [...] "make more plain our commitment to the survival of Israel". In 1980, Andrew Peacock, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that [...] "peace should be based … upon Israel’s <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> within secure and recognised boundaries; and upon recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to a homeland alongside Israel". Peacock's statement was echoed by Fraser in 1982, who said [...] "the legitimate rights of the Palestinians include a homeland alongside Israel".|$|R
25|$|Hamas won the Palestinian {{legislative}} election, 2006, {{the first}} and only genuinely free Palestinian elections. Hamas' leaders rejected all agreements signed with Israel, refused to recognize Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> refused to abandon terror, and occasionally claimed the Holocaust was a Jewish conspiracy. The withdrawal and Hamas victory left the status of Gaza unclear, Israel claimed it was no longer an occupying power but continued to control air and sea access to Gaza although it did not exercise sovereignty on the ground. Egypt insisted that it was still occupied and refused to open border crossings with Gaza, although it was free to do so.|$|E
25|$|Obama had not {{specified}} what his approach would be, {{although it was}} considered likely that he would appoint a high-level Middle East envoy, in part to free his Secretary of State so that other matters can also be addressed. Hamas expressed a willingness to talk to Obama, who {{has said that he}} will reciprocate only if it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> and agrees to abide by past agreements. The Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, has said the Hamas government would accept a Palestinian state that followed the Green Line and would offer Israel a long-term truce if Israel recognises the Palestinians' national rights.|$|E
25|$|On September 28, 1995, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO {{chairman}} Yasser Arafat {{signed the}} Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in Washington. the agreement marked {{the conclusion of}} the first stage of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The agreement allowed the PLO leadership to relocate to the occupied territories and granted autonomy to the Palestinians with talks to follow regarding final status. In return the Palestinians recognized Israel's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> and promised to abstain from use of terror. However the agreement was opposed by the Hamas and other Palestinian factions, whom at this point were already committing suicide bomber attacks throughout Israel.|$|E
