40|$|TND 416 /D Abstract: This paper {{highlights}} the system requirements and operating conditions of automatic air recirculation valves and reviews compatibility of existing actuator types with these requirements. When comparing the available technologies, {{it becomes clear}} that air <b>recirculation</b> <b>flap</b> actuators containing a bipolar stepper motor offer key advantages over actuators with other motor types. It is shown how specific bipolar stepper motor drive techniques can contribute to the overall system performance while the total system cost is minimized. The paper elaborates on availability and key features of motor driver integrated circuits that allow advanced control of these novel actuators. 1...|$|E
40|$|The California Air Resource Board (CARB) {{recently}} reported {{that due to}} exposure to particle emissions, 9, 000 people die annually in California alone [11]. A method for quantifying the exposure during a daily commute as well as reducing the exposure for the passengers has been developed. A fractional recirculation of cabin air was proposed and studied to improve cabin air quality by reducing cabin particle concentrations. Vehicle tests were run with differing number of passengers (1, 2, 3, and 4), four fan speed settings and at 15, 40, and 70 mph. A manual control was installed for the <b>recirculation</b> <b>flap</b> door so different ratios of fresh air to recirculated air could be used. Full recirculation is the most efficient setting in terms of thermal management and particle concentration reduction, but this causes elevated CO 2 levels in the cabin [5]. The study demonstrated cabin CO 2 concentrations could be controlled below a target level of 2000 ppm at various driving conditions and fan speeds with more than 85 % of recirculation. Additionally, some energy saving is also expected with the air conditioning system. More recirculation means less energy is required to cool the cabin air, as opposed to cooling 100 % outside air under hot weather conditions. The proposed fractional air recirculation method is a simple yet innovative way of improving cabin air quality...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of wall on the flow pattern of a {{submerged}} turbulent water jet in narrow channels, the flow field was visualized by a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) system at different Reynolds numbers. Those images showed that flow motion in a narrow channel {{is different from that}} of a turbulent plane jet without narrow channels. There are three flow patterns in narrow channels: stable impinging, stable jet with <b>recirculation</b> vortices and <b>flapping</b> turbulent jet...|$|R
