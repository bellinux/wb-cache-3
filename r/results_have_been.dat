5|$|A minor {{excavation}} {{was undertaken}} by George Marçais in the 1920s. Slimane Mostafa Zbiss conducted {{a more thorough}} excavation in the 1950s of the palace in the southeast quadrant of the city. Further excavations by a Franco-Tunisian team were made around the southeast palace in the late 1970s, ending in 1982. Few <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> published from these earlier excavations, and no records were made of the stratigraphic locations of the stucco fragments that were found.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its highly}} touted lineup, Michigan entered the tournament as the sixth {{youngest}} {{team in the}} country and the youngest team in the field of 68 teams according to Sports Illustrated, based on weighted minutes played. The game marked Michigan's first NCAA Championship Monday appearance since 1989. Some sources claim 1993 as the school's last appearance, but those <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> vacated by the NCAA due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research {{conducted}} {{a search for}} natural hassium. This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays, but no <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> released, strongly implying that no natural hassium was found. The possible extent of primordial hassium on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, mendelevium is located {{to the right}} of the actinide fermium, to the left of the actinide nobelium, and below the lanthanide thulium. Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and bulk preparation is currently impossible. Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done regarding its properties.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{varieties}} of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult {{to grow in the}} wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|Several {{risk factors}} have been {{proposed}} and {{are the subject of}} ongoing research. Due to characteristic early onset many studies have focused on parental factors around conception and during gestation. Factors investigated have included occupation (i.e. exposure to chemicals in specific industries), smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medicinal drugs during pregnancy and birth factors; however, <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo {{track and}} field program has had several successes {{throughout}} its history. The Buffaloes won the state championship in 1945 and 1946, but in more recent years <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> variable. In 2003, Eric Babb won the long jump state title {{for the first time}} in the school's history. The track & field program finished runner-up in the 2006 state championship, falling to Lawrence High School by 1/2 of a point. Garden City has also produced several notable athletes, including 1995 Kansas Track and Field Gatorade Athlete of the Year, high-jumper Jason Archibald.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{attracting}} American fans through television {{has long been}} a goal of the CFL although the <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> intermittent. As early as 1954, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (forerunner of the CFL's East Division) struck a deal with NBC that lasted a year and featured 13 games. The infamous Fog Bowl of 1962 was—at least until play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks picked up an assortment of games.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E
5|$|Changing clocks and DST rules has {{a direct}} {{economic}} cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500million to $1billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. Although {{it has been argued}} that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{viewed as}} a special case of linear programming, where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices. The study of von Neumann's model of an {{expanding}} economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics. This paper {{has been called the}} greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, linear inequalities, complementary slackness, and saddlepoint duality. In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself.|$|E

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in the chemical literature is now only of historical significance.

25|$|Some <b>results</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{consistently}} reported. Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, oils, dairy products, sugar, cereals, {{and flour}} all {{have little to}} no salicylates.
