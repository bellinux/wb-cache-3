40|$|International audienceAlthough most of {{the people}} in good health {{questioned}} about the subject said they would like to die at home, in the western world between 60 and 80 % of deaths occur in hospital. Most authors consider that the indispensable conditions for a <b>return</b> <b>home</b> are the patient's desire and presence of the family and caregivers with the appropriate skills. The assessment of other factors predictive of a <b>return</b> <b>home</b> is inadequate. The aim of this study is to clarify how the <b>return</b> <b>home</b> is influenced by the vulnerability of the patient at the end of life, and by that of the family and caregivers. We carried out a multicentric, observational, prospective, exhaustive and longitudinal epidemiological study (three months follow-up), including 146 patients hospitalized at the end of their life and desiring to <b>return</b> <b>home.</b> For these patients the caregivers respected their freedom to choose to die at home in over half the cases (56 %). Their overall vulnerability (personal, family context and caregivers) had a significant influence on the <b>return</b> <b>home.</b> This overall vulnerability was in fact identified as applying in 40 % of the clinical situations, and made the possibility of a <b>return</b> <b>home</b> 50 % less likely...|$|R
