40|$|Few {{studies have}} quantitatively {{examined}} whether the intended beneficiaries of temporary labor migration – typically children and spouses migrants leave behind – experience improved socioeconomic outcomes beyond {{higher levels of}} consumption. In this analysis, I {{examine the impact of}} labor migration on children’s educational attainment. Although <b>remitted</b> <b>earnings</b> are significantly higher than earnings from domestic employment in rural communities, labor migration produces conflicting and often negative influences on children’s educational progress. I apply event history analysis to match household and personal characteristics across years in which Mexican children attended school to see how international and internal migration within the household affects the likelihood they leave school. The data come from randomly selected household surveys in three distinct communities in a migrant-sending Mexican state. I specifically isolate the financial impact of U. S. migration and also consider the impact of migrant destination, sibling versus household head migration, recent trips versus accumulated migration experience, and children’s own experience in the U. S. during schooling...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for analyzing international-income taxation. The standard approach, involving the user cost of capital, is extended to incorporate the role of tax policy implemented by the home country. Tax provisions of home countries vary significantly. Of particular relevance are: (a) whether <b>remitted</b> <b>earnings</b> are taxed at home; (b) if so, whether they receive any unilateral tax relief, that is, deduction or foreign tax credit; (c) whether the home country accepts tax sparing; and (d) the scope and extent of deductible expenses, which generally {{differ from those of}} the host. Also of interest to the host are firms'international tax planning opportunities. Thailand has sought and achieved double-taxation agreement with most of its trading partners. It has attracted substantial foreign investments and collected the attendant revenue. Its tax policy remains vulnerable in many areas, however. There are, for example, inadequate safeguards against excessive leverage, transfer pricing, and treaty shopping. Its strategy concerning tax incentives could also be strengthened to remove the barriers for extending the treaty network and enhancing regional coordination.

This concern has also {{captured the attention of}} government officials, who appear more eager to promote more efficient and safe transfers of emigrant’s earnings given the potential that remittances hold for increasing resources at the disposal of receiving nations. This paper uses data from mexican immigrants who have resided in the United States to examine the various factors that shape migrants’ use of the various methods to <b>remit</b> <b>earnings</b> to Mexico. The analysis reveals that accessibility factors and migrants’ awareness of alternative remitting methods {{play a key role in}} explaining their use of the various money transfer mechanisms.

30|$|The {{family of}} origin may {{encourage}} the emigration of many of its members {{in order to increase}} their chances of receiving funds from abroad. Indeed, in the context of pure altruism model, a possible higher number of migrants linked to the family would appreciably decrease their remittance amounts. Our results show that the migration of many people from the same family negatively influences the likelihood of sending remittances and the amount of remittances. With a {{rise in the number of}} migrants abroad, the amounts of remittances decline, and migrants are significantly less likely to <b>remit</b> <b>earnings</b> to their family. Note that a positive correlation between the number of international migrants and their remittances means that these migrants are facing competition from other migrants and remit more in order to maintain favor with their parents. The aspiration to inherit could be the origin of remittances.|$|R

40|$|Undocumented Mexican {{immigrants}} provide {{cheap labor}} for U. S. restaurants. In this paper, I deliver an ethnographic description of Mexican immigrant restaurant workers currently living clandestinely in the San Francisco Bay Area. Based on {{a sample of}} 29 informants (each arriving less than ten years ago), I explore {{the economic and social}} dynamics of Mexico-to-California immigration through: open-ended interviews, participant observation in work and social settings, a focus group discussion, and a two-year case study of remittances to Mexico. This paper looks at the push and pull factors in transnational migration and the initial process of cross-border migration and settlement in the host society. It is also an exploration of how access to U. S. labor is acquired and maintained, how social networks function, and how identity is negotiated in a diasporic community. The major findings from this study suggest that repeat migration is inevitable, and thus support the circular migration theory. These findings are: 1) The earnings of immigrant restaurant employees working in the U. S. are at least double than their earning potential in Mexico. 2) Immigrant social status in Mexican households is positively affected by U. S. <b>earnings</b> <b>remitted</b> to Mexico. 3) Social networks absorb financial and work responsibilities for members who plan to visit Mexico and re-enter the U. S...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, labour {{migration}} has been increasingly feminized in East and Southeast (hereafter E/SE) Asia. By {{the beginning of}} the twenty-first century, more than two million women were estimated to be working in the region, accounting for one third of its migrant population. Most female migrants are in reproductive occupations such as domestic work and sex services, in private households and informal commercial sectors. Despite the great need to protect their welfare and human rights, governments of their destination countries view migrants as merely a workforce to meet labour shortages, and ignore protective measures and gender-sensitive policies. Under pressure to increase foreign revenues, labour-source countries encourage their women to migrate and <b>remit</b> their <b>earnings</b> from aborad, but in the face of global competition, governments of source countries have shown little interest in their migrant women's welfare. In the context of the E/SE Asian countries' bleak records of human rights practices, non-state actors have assumed increasing importance in advocating migrants' rights, which they have done through local and transnational networks. Feminized, and therefore gendered, migration in E/SE Asia {{has its roots in the}} region's rapid but uneven economic development, which is characterized by the inequality and conflict that differences of gender, class and nationality produce. The transfer of foreign women within the region from the low-income economies (the Philippines, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Pakistan, Bangladesh among others) to the high-income ones (Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China (Taiwan Province), the Republic of Korea and Japan) intensifies existing gender inequality, economic injustice and ethnic discrimination. International migration is, however, a contradictory process that, while providing migrant women with opportunities for social mobility, also subjects them to abuses and exploitation. The majority of Asia's migrant women are independent contract workers seeking employment abroad in order to augment family incomes and personal savings. Empowerment results from their everyday resistance to existing power structures, and from the opportunity to accumulate individual and collective resources. An analysis of Asia's immigration policies and women's migration patterns reveals six widely recognized and designated categories and characteristics of the women involved: domestic workers 7 entertainers (sex workers) 7 unauthorized workers 7 immigrant wives 7 Skilled workers 7 workers who share an ethnic heritage with that of the host population (such as Japanes-Brazilians in Japan and Korean-Chinese in the Republic of Korea) [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of the impact of a migratory wage-labour system on relations of production and of distribution in rural Lesotho. Some 200 000 of that country's 1, 25 million people are oscillating labour migrants to South Africa, most of them men. Their <b>earnings,</b> <b>remitted</b> to their rural home communities, provide the primary means of subsistence for their families and others left behind. The study focusses on the diffusion of remittances and the rural differentiation to which this is related. It is argued that such differentiation is closely associated with the cyclical process of domestic development in rural Lesotho. Data is presented to demonstrate how differentials in wealth correspond, to a large extent, with phases in the domestic developmental cycle. The strategies of homestead building, a clear indicator of domestic development, are described in order to point to the correspondence between differentiation and the developmental cycle. The more general process of regional class formation is also recognized. The interconnectedness of the local elite and the national bureaucracy, which together form an incipient petty bourgeoisie, demonstrates the effect of class formation at the local level. Remittances are seen to form the basis for economic activity which occurs in rural Lesotho communities. Agriculture, for example, is found to have as much a distributive function as a productive one insofar as co-operation provides an avenue for the diffusion of wage-earnings derived from outside productive activity. The material means of reproduction thus come primarily from involvement in the southern African industrial economy. It is concluded, therefore, that the process of incorporation has reached a point at which the people of Lesotho form a stratum of the regional working class, and it is suggested that this may also be the case for the residents of other peripheral labour exporting areas in southern Africa...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} the taxation of U. S. multinational firms and specifically at the taxation of dividend payments from foreign affiliates to their U. S. parent companies. The United States has an increasingly unusual tax system compared to other countries in that repatriating income earned abroad generally has tax consequences. This dissertation examines how taxes on intrafirm dividend payments affect multinational firm's intrafirm dividend policies and what effect firms' dividend payments have on their domestic investment. I {{first look at the}} previous literature on the taxation of intrafirm dividend payments. Hartman (1985) {{is one of the major}} theoretical papers on intrafirm dividend taxation. In the Hartman model, with the assumptions that repatriation taxes are constant and unavoidable, repatriation taxes do not affect intrafirm dividend payments. However, all empirical evidence points to the fact that dividend payments do respond to the dividend tax rate. I discuss the research that has tried to reconcile the theory with the empirical evidence by investigating ways in which firms avoid dividend taxes and whether firms respond to temporary changes in the tax rate more than the permanent tax level. I also discuss research that {{looks at the}} effects of a tax holiday on intrafirm dividends in 2005 that was meant to encourage firms to <b>remit</b> their foreign <b>earnings</b> and increase their U. S. investment. Research suggests that the repatriations induced by the tax holiday were used to increase distributions to shareholders and were not used to expand domestic operations. The next chapter examines how intrafirm dividend payments respond to a particular component of the tax rate [...] that caused by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the currency of the foreign affiliate and the U. S. dollar. Since this component of the tax rate changes over time, it allows me to test if firms attempt to time their dividend payments to take advantage of temporary swings in the repatriation tax rate. I find that firms respond to this temporary component of the tax rate more than they do to the tax rate as a whole. I also find that the response to the exchange-rate component of the tax rate is concentrated among firms with the most resources to devote to tax planning and those firms with the most flexibility in timing their dividend payments. The dividend payments of large firms, firms with tax haven affiliates, and financially unconstrained firms are sensitive to the exchange-rate component of the repatriation tax rate while small firms, firms that do not own tax haven affiliates, and financially constrained firms are not. Therefore, I find evidence that certain, more sophisticated types of firms time their dividend payments to minimize their tax bill, but not all firms appear to engage in this tax timing behavior. The final chapter investigates how firms' domestic investment responds to exogenous changes in firms' incentives to repatriate. The link between the availability of internal funds and investment has long been noted, and changes in the amount of foreign earnings firms repatriate may change the amount of financing available for domestic investment. This chapter looks particularly at whether there is a difference between financially constrained and unconstrained firms in the response of their domestic investment to repatriations, since the investment of financially constrained firms is generally assumed to be more sensitive to internal funds than that of financially unconstrained firms. I find suggestive evidence that the domestic investment of financially constrained firms responds to repatriations while the domestic investment of unconstrained firms does not, although the responses are not precisely estimated. This dissertation sheds some light on multinational firms' responses to repatriation taxes and what effect repatriations have on firms' domestic operations, and it highlights that multinational firms exhibit a range of behaviors that depend on their size and financial constraints. Since repatriation payments from large firms make up a large portion of total repatriations, total repatriations and any financial and investment outcomes influenced by repatriation taxes will be most affected by what large firms do. However, when thinking about how tax policy affects individual firms' behavior, it is necessary to consider multinational firms' heterogenous responses...|$|R
