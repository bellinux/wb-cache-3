50|$|The lords of Nussdorf named {{themselves}} {{after the}} settlement from the 12th century onwards, but their line died {{out in the}} 14th century.

Viticulture was the source of Nussdorf's prosperity, but Nussdorf also profited from the F√§hrrecht, i.e. the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> goods and people over the Danube. The settlement Urfar arose for this reason {{on the bank of the}} Danube, but never consisted of more than a few huts, which served primarily to accommodate the ferrymen or travellers.

50|$|American fur trader John Jacob Astor sent a ship in 1810 to present-day Alaska {{with the}} {{intention}} of supplying New Archangel. The supplies were welcomed by Baranov, and he hired the ship to transport furs to Guangzhou. Upon learning of the pressing issue of American sales of firearms, Astor conceived of plan beneficial to both his American Fur Company and the RAC. In return for a monopoly to supply Russian stations through his subsidiary Pacific Fur Company and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> RAC furs to the Qing Empire, Astor promised to refrain from selling firearms to Alaskan natives. The Russian Minister to the United States, Count Fyodor Palen, was informed of the proposal. He contacted the Imperial government, noting that the deal would likely be more effective at ending the firearm sales than through diplomatic channels with the United States. Astor's son-in-law, Adrian B. Benton, traveled to Saint Petersburg in 1811 to negotiate with company and government officials.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Louisiana was a pawn on the {{chessboard}} of European politics. It was controlled by the French, who had a few small settlements along the Mississippi and other main rivers. Following French defeat in the Seven Years' War, Spain gained control of the territory west of the Mississippi. The United States controlled the area east of the Mississippi and north of New Orleans. The main issue for the Americans was free transit of the Mississippi to the sea. As the lands were being gradually settled by a few American migrants, many Americans, including Jefferson, assumed that the territory would be acquired [...] "piece by piece." [...] The risk of another power taking it from a weakened Spain made a [...] "profound reconsideration" [...] of this policy necessary. [...] New Orleans was already important for shipping agricultural goods to and from the areas of the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains. Pinckney's Treaty, signed with Spain on October 27, 1795, gave American merchants [...] "right of deposit" [...] in New Orleans, granting them use of the port to store goods for export. Americans used this <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> products such as flour, tobacco, pork, bacon, lard, feathers, cider, butter, and cheese. The treaty also recognized American rights to navigate the entire Mississippi, which had become vital to the growing trade of the western territories.|$|E
5000|$|The Dutch Republic had, after {{a period}} of strife {{during the second half of}} the seventeenth century, become a steadfast ally of the Kingdom of Great Britain, {{initially}} (after the Glorious Revolution of 1688) as the senior partner in the alliance, but later in the eighteenth century as the increasingly junior partner. It was bound to Britain by a number of treaties of military alliance (notably those of 1678, 1689 and 1716) which arguably obliged it to offer armed support. On the other hand, it had obtained in the Treaty of Breda and its offshoot, the Commercial Treaty of 1668 (confirmed in the Treaty of Westminster) an important concession from England: the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> non-contraband goods in its ships to countries with which Britain was at war, without these goods being subject to seizure by Britain even if they were owned by subjects of belligerent powers (this was usually referred to as the principle of [...] "free ship, free goods"). The concept [...] "contraband" [...] was narrowly defined in these treaties as [...] "arms and munitions." [...] So-called [...] "naval stores" [...] (by which were commonly understood: ship's timbers, masts and spars, rope, canvas, tar and pitch) were not to be considered contraband. [...] This right became important during wars in which Britain was a participant, but the Republic remained neutral, like the Seven Years' War and after 1778 the American Revolutionary War, in which Britain opposed the rebelling American Colonies and their allies, France and Spain. Arguably it exempted Dutch bottoms from inspection by the Royal Navy (or at least from confiscation of the goods in British prize courts), thereby undermining Britain's ability to maintain an effective embargo on the trade of her enemies, especially because Dutch shipping at the time still played a major role in the European carrying trade.|$|E

In this paper, we create an economic model of this mechanism, and characterize the equilibrium under generic assumptions about the costs distributions of the network operators. Furthermore, the equilibrium is explicitly derived under more specific assumptions about the model; that is, two network operators and costs drawn from uniform distributions. In this case, we also characterize the expected prices the subscriber has to pay depending on their preferences about the service; for example, trading off quality for a lower price.

40|$|URL] {{observable}} {{modifications in}} cities and on the individuals' way of life have impacts on the mobility practices, on the citizens' social conditions and on the capacity to reach activities. These evolutions can create, reduce or amplify chance inequalities to access activities between the different social groups. It leads to considering in the French decision-making processes, {{some aspects of the}} social dimension of sustainability, reduced to chances equalities and to the social implications of accessibility. The accessibility to urban amenities is based on the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> as a necessary condition for chance inequalities for all. In this context, we analyze whether an urban transportation system could reduce the population's chance inequalities in terms of social access to a basket of goods. We propose, on the Lyons conurbation, for the year 1999, to quantify the accessibility, by car or by public transport, of the rich or poor districts' inhabitants. Then, we explore the effects of an increase of public transport supply, based on the Urban Travel Plan for the Lyons conurbation. Does now provide improved accessibility and to reduce the inequalities between the richest and the poorest districts...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} how a social citizenship {{for people with disabilities}} is shaped bythe normative structures in the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian law governing their right to transportin everyday life. The thesis deals with three types of transport provided by the public to private individuals: transport services, car allowances, and cash benefits for reimbursing transport costs forpeople with disabilities. For each provision, the focus of the study is directed by the followingquestions: ‚Äì Is there a rights/duties relationship between the public and the individual? Who is eligible forprovision? How does public funding impact entitlement? Who is obliged to provide? What are thelegal guarantees for entitlement? Despite objectives within Nordic law and policy that people with disabilities should be compensated for their impairments, and allowed to lead independent and autonomous lives, the results from the thesis show that the various transport provisions do not fully realize this. The legal relations between the public and those with needs for transport in their everyday lives are characterized by control, scrutiny and questioning. In order to protect the public budgets from costs, the eligibility criteria in the law are so constructed as to ensure that only certain needs for transport, and only some impairments, can meet them. The national, regional and municipal governments, and the administrative courts, subject people with disabilities to intrusive inquiries regarding personal details and other circumstances in their lives, {{in order to be able}} to judge which needs for transport are to be considered legitimate and which are not. The thesis shows that the individual rights to, especially, Swedish and Norwegian transport provisions are poorly protected against political decisions to cut funding. Local and regional self-governance isan interest that always competes with individual legal rights and make them weaker, irrespective of whether these rights can be appealed in administrative courts. The conclusion in the thesis highlights how a social citizenship is shaped in the law governing the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>transport</b> for people with disabilities, and that this social citizenship does not reinforce independence and individual autonomy for those who are dependent on the various provisions tomeet their needs for transport in their everyday lives...|$|E
