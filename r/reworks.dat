5|$|Undead Nightmare is a {{modified}} {{expansion of the}} 2010 video game Red Dead Redemption, an open world Western action-adventure in which the former outlaw John Marston is coerced {{by the federal government}} to capture former members of his gang in exchange for his family's freedom. Undead Nightmare is an alternate timeline expansion that adds a new full-length story in a zombie horror theme and <b>reworks</b> the base game's environment to appear dark and spooky. As corpses begin to rise from the dead to become flesh-eating zombies, some of the living go into hiding and others become hostile. Marston seeks to find the plague's cause and its cure for his wife and son. The game's story lasts about six hours and includes new cutscenes, voice acting, and music. It is accessed separately from the main game menu with its own save files. It does not share play progress and items from the main game, nor does it require the base game in any form.|$|E

He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and <b>reworks</b> the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to the nursing home.|$|E

25|$|Indium {{lowers the}} melting point and {{improves}} ductility. In presence of lead {{it forms a}} ternary compound that undergoes phase change at 114°C. Very high cost (several times of silver), low availability. Easily oxidizes, which causes problems for repairs and <b>reworks,</b> especially when oxide-removing flux cannot be used, e.g. during GaAs die attachment. Indium alloys are used for cryogenic applications, and for soldering gold as gold dissolves in indium much less than in tin. Indium can also solder many nonmetals (e.g. glass, mica, alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia, porcelain, brick, concrete, and marble). Prone to diffusion into semiconductors and cause undesired doping. At elevated temperatures easily diffuses through metals. Low vapor pressure, suitable for use in vacuum systems. Forms brittle intermetallics with gold; indium-rich solders on thick gold are unreliable. Indium-based solders are prone to corrosion, especially in presence of chloride ions.|$|E
40|$|Legislation {{against the}} use of lead in {{electronics}} has been {{the driving force behind the}} use of lead-free solders, surface finishes, and component lead finishes. The major concern in using lead-free solders in the assembly and <b>rework</b> Chip Scale Packages (CSPs) is the relatively high temperatures that the components and the boards experience. Fine-pitch CSPs have very low standoff heights following assembly making inspection and <b>rework</b> of these components more difficult. One other concern pertinent to <b>rework</b> is the temperature of the neighboring components during <b>rework.</b> These issues, coupled with the limitations of <b>rework</b> equipment to handle lead-free reflow temperatures, make the task of <b>reworking</b> lead-free assemblies more challenging. In this research endeavor, lead-free CSPs with tin-silver and tin-silver-copper solder balls were assembled and <b>reworked.</b> In addition, tin-lead CSPs were assembled and <b>reworked</b> as a baseline for comparison. Different <b>rework</b> sequences, redressing and fluxing techniques were evaluated.

40|$|<b>Rework</b> in {{construction}} projects {{is referred to}} as the unnecessary effort of redoing a process or activity that was incorrectly implemented in the first instance. In construction projects, <b>rework</b> can result from an array of factors such as errors, omissions, failures, changes, poor communication and poor coordination. <b>Rework</b> could adversely affect the performance and productivity and ultimately the profit margins as well. For example, some previous studies identified that costs of <b>rework</b> could add around 10 % to the total project costs. However, the literature also suggests that <b>rework</b> is mostly unnecessary and avoidable. A pilot study is being conducted in Hong Kong to explore the <b>rework</b> occurrences in the local construction industry.

40|$|<b>Rework</b> is {{described}} as the transformation of production rejects into re-usable products of the same or lower quality. <b>Rework</b> can be very profitable, especially if disposal costs are high and if materials are expensive and limited in availability. Furthermore, <b>rework</b> can contribute to a ‘green image’. Although {{there is quite a}} lot of literature on logistic planning and control of <b>rework,</b> up to now no {{attention has been paid to}} <b>rework</b> of production rejects that deteriorate while waiting to be <b>reworked.</b> Such situations occur, for example, in the food industry. This paper deals with the above in a production line that is dedicated to a single product and that uses the same facilities for production and <b>rework.</b> Produced lots may be non-defective, reworkable defective or non-reworkable defective. Reworkable defective lots deteriorate over time, which effects the <b>rework</b> time and the <b>rework</b> cost. We consider a disposal strategy and two types of <b>rework</b> strategies.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{cooperative}} planning and uncertainty affect {{the magnitude of}} <b>rework</b> in concurrent engineering projects with upstream and downstream operations, and explore the impact of such <b>rework</b> on project delays. Using survey data from a sample of 120 business process (BP) redesign and related information technology (IT) development projects in healthcare and telecommunications, our results indicate that upstream (BP) <b>rework</b> and downstream (IT) <b>rework</b> is mediated and mitigated by cooperative planning through upstream/downstream strategy coupling and cross-functional involvement. In addition, uncertainty related {{to a lack of}} firm or industry experience with such projects increases the magnitude of upstream <b>rework</b> but not downstream <b>rework</b> or the amount of cooperative planning. After accounting for project scope, implementation horizon and whether delays are anticipated, we find that project delay is primarily influenced by the magnitude of downstream <b>rework</b> and downstream delay: the magnitude of both upstream and downstream <b>rework</b> significantly increases downstream delay, which significantly increases project delay. However, the magnitude of upstream <b>rework</b> does not directly affect project delay. These results suggest that project delay is under managerial control as cooperative planning is a managerial function that reduces downstream <b>rework,</b> while uncertainty from a lack of experience with the design affecting upstream <b>rework</b> is not directly under managerial control. concurrent design, uncertainty, coordination, cooperative planning, concurrent engineering, project management, delay, process redesign, <b>rework...</b>|$|R

[...] These changes included taking lines of dialogue from one play and inserting them into scenes from another. Specific changes include a scene {{near the end of}} the film in which Hal pardons an imprisoned street rabble-rouser just before his expedition to invade France; Welles slightly altered this scene from Henry V, Act 2, Scene 2. In the film it is stated that this man is Falstaff, and that the incident he is pardoning is Falstaff's disturbance of Hal's coronation. Although both the pardoned prisoner and Falstaff are said to drink wine, Shakespeare does not imply that the pardoned prisoner is Falstaff. In both Chimes at Midnight and in Henry V, this scene is followed by Falstaff's death. The film contains no true soliloquies, since characters are never alone and do not speak directly to the audience during their speeches.

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry is fast paced {{and on the}} cutting edge of technology, resulting in very short life spans of semiconductor products. In order to stay competitive, manufacturers must be able to quickly adapt to produce new products, and they must achieve a high level of productivity. Two major operational components of semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) that effect productivity are dispatching rules and <b>rework</b> strategies. Although prior research has been conducted independently on these two issues, the hypothesis is that the interrelationship between the dispatching rules and <b>rework</b> strategies has a significant effect on the productivity of the fab. Moreover, the goal is to determine which combination of widely-used dispatching rules and new and existing <b>rework</b> strategies results in the highest level of fab productivity. To test this hypothesis, the significance of <b>rework</b> is evalutated, and a four-factor experiment is conducted to determine the effect of dispatching rules, <b>rework</b> strategies, fab types, and <b>rework</b> levels on key fab performance measures.
