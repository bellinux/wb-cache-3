40|$|Context Several key {{performance}} indicators of macro-economic conditions and public finances show a positive evolution or a sustained above-EU-average performance in recent years, such as for the budget deficit and unemployment. Other structural trends are confirmed, such as the declining share of industry in value added and the high importance of SME’s in the economy. In terms of integration in global value chains, Belgium has seen a light improvement {{in recent years in}} its world export shares in goods and services. Productivity has grown and is comparable (or better) than in many other EU countries. For its political and regulatory environment, Belgium keeps reporting good but not leading scores. For its digital economy, Belgium is part of the ‘lagging ahead’ cluster of countries. The use of information and communication technologies to deliver government services is increasing, as reflected in Belgium’s position on e-government rankings. R&I Actors - summary Belgium is characterized by a well-developed Triple Helix. Besides 17 federal scientific institutes, many regional research centers and collaborative platforms {{play a key role in}} the innovation ecosystem, such as the strategic research centers (Flanders), the competitiveness poles (Wallonia), the Bridge platforms (Brussels) and the collective centers (both in Flanders and Wallonia). The major part of the scientific output is delivered by the universities, while more than half of domestic expenditures on R&D in Belgium is financed by the business sector. R&I Challenges Any assessment of the R&I system in Belgium should take into account that, while Belgian research and innovation performance is not at the top in the EU, the country has managed to consolidate its position of a strong innovator over many years. In line with this observation, the policy mix and focus of policy effort have not changed dramatically over the last five years or even, it could be argued, over a decade. While most of R&D&I policy is devised and implemented at the level of the regions and communities, the innovation challenges are formulated at the echelon of the entire country. In other words, they constitute a common denominator of the challenges at the subnational level. Challenge 1 : Promote fast growing enterprises in innovative sectors With a share of employment in high-growth enterprises of only 5. 9 %, Belgium is well under the EU average of 9. 1 %, ranking 23 rd in the EU. In addition, many fast-growing Belgian firms do not operate in innovative sectors, but in sectors such as construction and transport. Given the growth challenge facing Belgium – and Europe as a whole – and the pivotal role of high-growth, innovative SMEs, increasing their prevalence is a key policy challenge. In Wallonia, the Marshall Plan 4. 0 envisages fomenting the creation of enterprises through the "entrepreneurial generations 2015 - 2020 " project, the further development of competitive clusters based on the ‘Competitiveness Poles’, and new instruments that foster the creation of innovative enterprises. An example of the latter is W. IN. G, an equity platform for financing the growth of digital start-ups. The Walloon Small Business Act is a comprehensive plan to stimulate the creation and growth of SMEs, amongst other by improving access to finance, with the "charte bancaire" as an example of a concrete initiative. In Flanders, an important strategic decision that is expected to strengthen the creation of innovative start-ups, is the merger of two strategic research centres (imec and iMinds), combing top research in microelectronics with expertise in software and business incubation. Other measures addressing the challenge include the “SME growth subsidy”, which was created in 2016. In the Brussels Capital Region, knowledge transfer from academia to business is supported, amongst others through the Bridge programme. Enabling mechanisms are also further developed, such as financing of innovative companies through the Brussels <b>Regional</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Company</b> (S. R. I. B.) and hosting and incubation structures provided by Citydev. At federal level, various tax incentives for R&D are in place to create an attractive fical climate for R&d intensive companies, including start-ups. A key measure is the partial exemption of the wage withholding for researchers, which strengthens the demand for highly qualified staff, tying it to the 2 nd innovation challenge. Challenge 2 : Addressing the expected shortage of human resources for R&I While the labour force in Belgium is generally well-qualified, the share of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduates is low at 15. 7 % compared to the EU 28 average of 25. 4 %. Although the share of STEM students in total inflow in higher education has shown an increasing trend in recent years, demand exceeds the number of graduates. Shortages in these fields are considered as a potential major barrier for future innovation and economic growth and are already emerging for certain functions, such as ICT experts. More generally, there is a skill mismatch in the labour market, which is mainly related to an undersupply of highly-skilled job-seekers and to an over-representation of low-skilled job seekers. The Country Specific Recommendations for Belgium of June 2016 highlight the continued importance of human capital policy to boost the capacity to innovate. This challenge is closely intertwined with the first one, since the presence of fast-growing firms in innovative sectors crucially depends on highly qualified human capital in the domains of IT, biotech, material science, etc. As mentioned in the 1 st challenge, the federal government's influence over this policy domain is only indirect, but nonetheless important. Through fiscal measures it exerts a substantial influence on the demand for highly skilled workers, in particular through the policy of a reduced wage withholding tax for researchers, which will be continued in the coming years. The Marshall Plan 4. 0 in Wallonia aims to better align the supply of graduates in Wallonia to business needs, amongst others through the set-up of an inventory of "professions of the future". In order to attract external talent, the region has also introduced mechanisms like the "Beware Fellowships" to attract foreign talent. In Flanders, joint efforts involving the policy domains of science and innovation on the one hand, and education and training on the other, have been launched to increase the number of secondary students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM subjects) and encourage them to opt for a career in exact sciences or technology. The "STEM Action Plan 2012 - 2020 " has, among others, resulted in the STEM Monitor, an indicator dashboard that systematically tracks inflow into, and successful completion of, STEM studies at various levels of education. The "STEM Charter" is rolled out on a large scale and already brings together more than 50 companies and organisations which have indicated that they lend their full support to the STEM initiative. Finally, policy attention in all regions has also increasingly turned towards attracting foreign researchers or researchers from the own Community that are active abroad, through schemes like Odysseus and Pegasus 2 (Flanders), Ulysse (Wallonia) and Attract (Brussels). status: accepte...|$|E
