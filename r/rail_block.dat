The main British force assembled at Togblekove and [...] "I" [...] Company was sent forward by road to Agbeluvhoe, {{followed by the}} main body on 15 August. When the main force reached Dawie, civilians reported that a train full of Germans had shot up the station at Tsevie earlier that morning. At Tsevie the British found that the train had steamed north and hurried on to support [...] "I" [...] Company. [...] "I" [...] Company had heard the train run south at [...] while halted on the road near Ekuni.

A local civilian guided the section to the railway, where Lieutenant Collins and his men piled stones and a heavy iron plate on the tracks, about [...] north of the bridge at Ekuni, a village about [...] south of Agbeluvhoe and then set an ambush. A second train, carrying Captain Georg Pfähler, commander of the German forces in Togoland, {{stopped in front of the}} obstacle and managed to reverse before the ambushers reached it. The rest of [...] "I" [...] Company had heard the train pass, set another ambush and riddled the engine with bullets as it travelled past at full steam. The British parties rendezvoused and advanced to Agbeluvhoe, where another road and <b>rail</b> <b>block</b> was established.

The position at Agbeluvhoe had been attacked several times from the south and more attacks overnight were repulsed. As the main British force drew close, the Germans retired on their train and eventually surrendered.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: One {{of a pair}} {{of blocks}} that allowed the railway line to be blocked quickly by {{inserting}} a barrier such as a section of rail. The <b>rail</b> <b>block</b> was intended to stop enemy tracked vehicles from travelling along the railway route. The mass of concrete stands on a foundation and is about [...] high.|$|E
30|$|Naming for {{the blocks}} is {{incorporated}} into the model as a static function, while occupation is handled as a dynamic function. As {{the states of the}} signals vary depending on the opened routes and the occupation of the <b>rail</b> <b>blocks,</b> they are depicted as static functions.|$|R
3000|$|The system {{elements}} are assigned a {{value based on}} the interlocking table. For instance, if a train requires the route R 1 and if the requirements {{for the opening of}} the route have been fulfilled, (which means the <b>rail</b> <b>blocks</b> are available and no counter route is locked), then that particular route is locked. After having the route locked, points are arranged and locked. Afterwards, the signal state changes according to the interlocking table. Also, the motion of the train is determined based on the signal and point states and the moving direction. [...] Open image in new window [...]...|$|R

5000|$|The 111th Brigade, now {{commanded}} by John Masters, tried to establish another road and <b>rail</b> <b>block</b> codenamed [...] "Blackpool" [...] near Hopin, but {{were forced to}} retreat after 17 days of battle. The monsoon had broken, making movement difficult and preventing the other Chindit formations reinforcing Masters's brigade. Calvert's 77th Brigade captured Mogaung after a siege which ended on 27 June, but {{at the cost of}} 50 percent casualties.|$|E
5000|$|The Victoria Cross citation, {{published}} in the London Gazette reads: The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the posthumous award of the VICTORIA CROSS to:— Lieutenant George Albert CAIRNS (198186), The Somerset Light Infantry, attd. South Staffordshire Regiment. On 5 March 1944, 77 Independent Infantry Brigade, of which the 1st South Staffordshire Regiment formed a part, landed by glider at Broadway (Burma). On 12 March 1944, columns from the South Staffordshire Regiment and 3/6 Gurkha Rifles established a road and <b>rail</b> <b>block</b> across the Japanese lines of communication at Henu Block. The Japanese counter-attacked this position heavily {{in the early morning}} of 13 March 1944, and the South Staffordshire Regiment was ordered to attack a hill-top which formed the basis of the Japanese attack. During this action, in which Lieutenant CAIRNS took a foremost part, he was attacked by a Japanese officer, who, with his sword, hacked off Lieutenant CAIRNS [...] left arm. Lieutenant CAIRNS killed this Officer; picked up the sword and continued to lead his men in the attack and slashing left and right with the captured sword killed and wounded several Japanese before he himself fell to the ground. Lieutenant CAIRNS subsequently died from his wounds. His action so inspired all his comrades that, later the Japanese were completely routed, a very rare occurrence at that time.|$|E

50|$|During the Second World War Hornsea was {{fortified}} {{with numerous}} anti-invasion structures, {{designed to prevent}} a beachhead being established at Hornsea by invading forces - beach defences consisted of pillboxes flanking the promenade, whilst the beach was protected by anti-tank cubes and mines; at South Cliff 4.7-inch guns were installed. Beyond the beach any potential invasion was protected against by road and <b>rail</b> <b>blocks,</b> further pillboxes, and minefields, limiting routes through the town to three roads and the railway line - the road access was narrowed {{by the use of}} concrete blocks and protected by pillboxes - the fortification was intended to hold up or delay any invasion force landing at Hornsea.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, {{neighbors of}} the killed cleric were transported to Canning from Kolkata in trucks. A local school {{principal}} reportedly incited the mob into violence. At around 10 a.m., a heavily armed mob {{of at least}} 10,000 began an attack upon Naliakhali. They ed and looted the homes of Bengali Hindus as the residents fled for their lives. The rioters hurled bombs, doused the houses with petrol and set them on fire. Violence and arson spread to nearby locations such as Dhopar More and Bangalpara. Hindu homes and places of business were ed in Gopalpur, Goladogra and Herobhanga. The crowd blocked the road at Bhangankhali, Priyor More, Hospital More and Natunhat. Protesters also staged a <b>rail</b> <b>blocked</b> at Ghutiari Sharif station in the Sealdah-Canning section of the Eastern Railway.|$|R

30|$|Collision of trains {{simply means}} that two trains {{are on the}} same <b>rail</b> <b>block</b> at the same time. As {{can be seen from the}} above ASM or NuSMV code, {{although}} Route 1 and Route 9 are counter routes, and not defined in the interlocking system, it has been able to lock Route 9, while Route 1 is already locked. This error has resulted with the case that trains can be on the same <b>rail</b> <b>block</b> in State 1.5.|$|E

During that work, the valley side abutment was underpinned by a bell-shaped concrete block, which was clad with Hunziker stones, and reinforced with <b>rails.</b> The <b>block</b> had a diameter of 14 m and a height of 9 m. Additionally, a new foundation base was laid some 21 m below the previous ground level.|$|R

5000|$|His next {{start in}} the Dwyer Stakes on July 10 proved far more demanding. The colt John P. Grier, who had {{challenged}} Man o' War in the Belmont Futurity at age two, had matured into the second best three-year-old in the country. Under {{the conditions of the}} Dwyer, Man o' War was assigned 126 pounds while John P. Grier carried only 108. The two colts scared away all rivals, turning the Dwyer into a match race. They raced side by side down the backstretch, with Man o' War on the <b>rail</b> <b>blocking</b> John P. Grier from the view of the spectators. The two horses ran the race as a sprint, completing the first [...] of a mile in 1:09 2/5 - an American record. As they entered the turn, Man o' War started to open up an advantage but John P. Grier rallied and got back on even turns. They completed the mile together in a time of 1:35 3/5, breaking Man o' War's American record set in the Withers. John P. Grier made another surge and for a moment the spectators believed that he would win the race. Kummer then hit Man o' War with the whip and Man o' War made a final surge, open up a lead of two lengths in the final fifty yards. The final time was 1:49 1/5, a new world record for [...] miles.|$|R
60|$|The train {{contained}} ninety Dublin Fusiliers, eighty Durban Volunteers, and ten sailors, with a naval 7-pounder gun. Captain Haldane of the Gordons, Lieutenant Frankland (Dublin Fusiliers), and Winston Churchill, {{the well-known}} correspondent, accompanied the expedition. What {{might have been}} foreseen occurred. The train steamed into the advancing Boer army, was fired upon, tried to escape, found the <b>rails</b> <b>blocked</b> behind it, and upset. Dublins and Durbans were shot helplessly out of their trucks, under a heavy fire. A railway accident is a nervous thing, and so is an ambuscade, but {{the combination of the}} two must be appalling. Yet there were brave hearts which rose to the occasion. Haldane and Frankland rallied the troops, and Churchill the engine-driver. The engine was disentangled and sent on with its cab full of wounded. Churchill, who had escaped upon it, came gallantly back to share the fate of his comrades. The dazed shaken soldiers continued a futile resistance for some time, but there was neither help nor escape and nothing for them but surrender. The most Spartan military critic cannot blame them. A few slipped away besides those who escaped upon the engine. Our losses were two killed, twenty wounded, and about eighty taken. It is remarkable that of the three leaders both Haldane and Churchill succeeded in escaping from Pretoria.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accident}} happened approximately [...] {{east of the}} Little Falls {{train station}} where the tracks run parallel to {{the north shore of}} the Mohawk River, on the Gulf Curve, the sharpest curve in the New York Central system, a six to seven degree bend. After negotiating approximately 75% of the curve, the engine derailed and crossed two of the parallel tracks and went down an embankment landing on its side. The first baggage car also went over the embankment. The tender and second baggage car derailed but remained on the <b>rail</b> right-of-way, <b>blocking</b> the other tracks. The last car remained on its track.|$|R
50|$|Grainger and Miller {{designed}} the railway {{as a single}} line with passing places every 600 yards (550 metres) or so; this was their custom at the time, based on horse-drawn waggonways with no fixed timetable.

50|$|Labour's 1981 GLC {{manifesto}} {{commitment was}} to subsidise fares on all London Buses, London Underground and British Rail services in Greater London. This {{would cause a}} reduction in fares of approximately a third and cause a corresponding increase in the transport costs of the GLC. The funding for the change was planned {{to come from a}} 5% increase in local government rates. The subsidy to British <b>Rail</b> was <b>blocked</b> by central government, which restricted the policy to the buses and the London Underground. This also had the effect of restricting the GLC subsidy in many of London's 32 boroughs that were not served by the London Underground.|$|R
