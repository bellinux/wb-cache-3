40|$|Executive Summary Triangle Transit {{seeks to}} answer two related questions: •	Are lower-income riders {{more likely than}} other riders to use a less {{efficient}} payment method that contributes to overpayment? •	What policies can Triangle Transit adopt to address potential inequities between payments by lower- and higher-income riders? Findings 1. 	Triangle Transit’s poorer riders {{are more likely to}} pay with a pass than with cash. Regression analysis that controls for other factors affecting payment type confirms this finding. 2. 	Overpayment is a persistent problem among Triangle Transit users, but particularly among cash users. 3. 	Though access to alternative transportation (cars) is important to employment prospects, it is not a statistically significant predictor <b>of</b> <b>overpayment.</b> However, employment status is closely linked to the likelihood a user pays with a pass or cash. 4. 	Descriptive statistics suggest that income, payment type, and transfers are predictors <b>of</b> <b>overpayment.</b> Lower income, cash use, and higher transfer rates are positive predictors <b>of</b> <b>overpayment.</b> Regression analysis also confirms that income and transfer are large and statistically significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>overpayment.</b> Recommendations 1. 	Triangle Transit should increase visibility of 30 -day passes at highly-travelled stops. 2. 	Triangle Transit should move to an electronic “Smart Card” system. As part of this transition, Triangle Transit should reduce transfer fees for customers paying with a “Smart Card. ” 3. 	Triangle Transit should ask a series of new questions in the next round of its rider survey, particularly related to payment decisions. 4. 	Reduce cash fares by 25 percent...|$|R

50|$|Jonathan Parker J held Collins had overpaid Davis and Satterfield {{and he was}} {{entitled}} to set future royalties off against half of the sums overpaid. He said the overpayment was a mistake of fact, because Collins thought they had played in all 15 tracks. Collins was not estopped from maintaining there was <b>overpayment</b> <b>of</b> royalties because {{there was never any}} assumption between the parties that Davis and Satterfield would get royalties for all 15 tracks and there was no acquiescence in the assumption. Overpayment was not acquiescence. There was no evidence Davis and Satterfield ever thought they were entitled. The overpayments did not amount to representations that they were (so no estoppel by representation). But the fact <b>of</b> <b>overpayment</b> did result in a general change of position on Davis and Satterfield’s part. It increased their level of outgoings. However, the defence of change of position was not an “all or nothing” doctrine and, in this case, it would be fair to allow the defence to cover one half <b>of</b> the <b>overpayments</b> (Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd 1991 2 AC 548 applied). Finally, if Collins had made a claim to recover the overpayments his claim would have been statute barred under the Limitation Act 1980, s.5 because it was six years. But here it was not a return <b>of</b> <b>overpayments,</b> only an equitable set off against future royalties.|$|R

In December 2001, Congress amended Title 31 of the United States Code to require a federal agency with contracts totaling over $ 500 million in a fiscal year to have a cost-effective program for identifying payment errors and for recovering amounts erroneously paid to contractors. DOD contractors' responses to GAO's survey indicate that they have millions <b>of</b> dollars <b>of</b> <b>overpayments</b> on their records {{and that they are}} continuing to refund overpayments [...] about $ 488 million in fiscal year 2001. DOD has taken actions to address problems with contractor overpayments.

The questions for this study involved inquiries into processes and procedures that were developed for improving payment accuracy of SSI claims. Data analysis was performed by comparing the change in overpayment amounts to the implementation of different technological and operational procedures for the SSI program over time using time series analysis. The results of this study suggested that technology that allows sharing communications between federal and state governmental organizations improved overpayment detection and collection for the SSI program.
