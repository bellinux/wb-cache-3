40|$|Thus, at present, a {{large amount}} of rubber waste cannot be higher {{harnessed}} due to recovery technologies used. Also, the requirements for new products of rubber worldwide are greater than the production capacity and the availability of raw materials. To offset this balance is necessary to improve technologies for recycling waste rubber so to can get <b>regenerated</b> <b>rubber</b> with the best mechanical physical characteristics. The main technology for obtaining the <b>regenerated</b> <b>rubber</b> is based on the rubber waste shredding and making the powder, {{so that it can be}} carried out de-vulcanization in autoclave. All the time it was monitored as the de-vulcanization process to be as economical and less polluting, and this requires that the sizes of the crumb rubber to be optimal. Thus, in the conducted researches was aimed to establish the particle size of crumb rubber from waste rubber so as to obtain an economical de-vulcanization, but also a reclaimed rubber with superior physical and mechanical characteristics. The organization of researches was made so that crumb of rubber waste was divided into 5 groups, bowing from crumb rubber with particle’s size of 1000 μm (RPS 1), and reaching up to crumb rubber with particle’s size of 200 μm (RPS 5) ...|$|E
40|$|Biomass is {{an organic}} {{material}} and important to utilize its chemical extraction {{as a source}} for renewable energy. In the present research, imidazolium-based ionic liquid as pretreatment solvent for extraction of the valuable chemical from rubber biomass was investigated. The conditions optimization was carried out by using different types of anions of imidazolium-based ionic liquids, temperature, various particle sizes of rubber biomass, rubber biomass loading in ionic liquids and different modes of heating (conventional and microwave). The effects of pretreatment parameter were studied on the chemical composition, cellulose crystallinity, surface morphology and enzymatic hydrolysis of the <b>regenerated</b> <b>rubber</b> biomass. The type of ionic liquids was found to have impacts on the dissolution yield of the rubber biomass. The results show that the mass regenerated yield of 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim] [OAc]) is 95...|$|E
40|$|Microwave devulcanization {{is known}} to be a {{promising}} and an efficient rubber recycling method which makes possible for the rubber to regain its fluidity, and makes it capable of being remolded and revulcanized. The focus of this work is to understand the physical and chemical changes that occur in the ground tire rubber after different microwave exposure periods. For this purpose chemical, thermal, rheological and morphological analyses were performed on the tire rubber, which contains natural rubber (NR) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) as polymeric material. The results showed that the microwave treatment promoted the breaking of sulfur cross-links and consequently increased the rubber fluidity. However, long periods of exposure led to degradation and modification of some properties. At nanoscale, the deformation of the devulcanized NR domain under stress was observed, and the morphology obtained appears to be a droplet dispersion morphology. The most exposed samples presented only one glass transition temperature, and from this it was concluded that the treatment may have {{played an important role in}} the compatibilization of the elastomeric blend. Based on the results, it is required to control the microwave exposure time and polymeric degradation in order to achieve a <b>regenerated</b> <b>rubber</b> with satisfactory properties...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{deforestation}} in Sumatra, Indonesia {{is presently}} occurring {{due to the}} expansion of palm oil and rubber production, fueled by an increasing global demand. Our study aimed to assess changes in soil-N cycling rates with conversion of forest to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations. In Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia, we selected two soil landscapes - loam and clay Acrisol soils - each with four land-use types: lowland forest and forest with <b>regenerating</b> <b>rubber</b> (hereafter, "jungle rubber") as reference land uses, and rubber and oil palm as converted land uses. Gross soil-N cycling rates were measured using the 15 N pool dilution technique with in-situ incubation of soil cores. In the loam Acrisol soil, where fertility was low, microbial biomass, gross N mineralization and NH 4 + immobilization were also low and no significant changes were detected with land-use conversion. The clay Acrisol soil which had higher initial fertility based on the reference land uses (i. e. higher pH, organic C, total N, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) and base saturation) (P≤ 0. 05 - 0. 09) had larger microbial biomass and NH 4 + transformation rates (P≤ 0. 05) compared to the loam Acrisol soil. Conversion of forest and jungle rubber to rubber and oil palm in the clay Acrisol soil decreased soil fertility which, in turn, reduced microbial biomass and consequently decreased NH 4 + transformation rates (P≤ 0. 05 - 0. 09). This was further attested by the correlation of gross N mineralization and microbial biomass N with ECEC, organic C, total N (R= 0. 51 - 0. 76; P≤ 0. 05) and C:N ratio (R=- 0. 71 - - 0. 75, P≤ 0. 05). Our findings suggest that the larger the initial soil fertility and N availability, the larger the reductions upon land-use conversion. Because soil N availability was dependent on microbial biomass, management practices in converted oil palm and rubber plantations should focus on enriching microbial biomass...|$|R
40|$|Expansion of {{palm oil}} and rubber production, for which global demand is increasing, causes rapid {{deforestation}} in Sumatra, Indonesia, {{and is expected}} to continue in the next decades. Our study aimed to (1) quantify changes in soil CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes with land-use change and (2) determine their controlling factors. In Jambi Province, Sumatra, we selected two landscapes on heavily weathered soils that differ mainly in texture: loam and clay Acrisol soils. In each landscape, we investigated the reference land-use types (forest and secondary forest with <b>regenerating</b> <b>rubber)</b> and the converted land-use types (rubber, 7 – 17 years old, and oil palm plantations, 9 – 16 years old). We measured soil CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes monthly from December 2012 to December 2013. Annual soil CO 2 fluxes from the reference land-use types were correlated with soil fertility: low extractable phosphorus (P) coincided with high annual CO 2 fluxes from the loam Acrisol soil that had lower fertility than the clay Acrisol soil (P < 0. 05). Soil CO 2 fluxes from the oil palm (107. 2 to 115. 7 mg C m − 2 h − 1) decreased compared to the other land-use types (between 178. 7 and 195. 9 mg C m − 2 h − 1; P < 0. 01). Across land-use types, annual CO 2 fluxes were positively correlated with soil organic carbon (C) and negatively correlated with 15 N signatures, extractable P and base saturation. This suggests that the reduced soil CO 2 fluxes from oil palm were the result of strongly decomposed soil organic matter and reduced soil C stocks due to reduced litter input as well as being due to a possible reduction in C allocation to roots due to improved soil fertility from liming and P fertilization in these plantations. Soil CH 4 uptake in the reference land-use types was negatively correlated with net nitrogen (N) mineralization and soil mineral N, suggesting N limitation of CH 4 uptake, and positively correlated with exchangeable aluminum (Al), indicating a decrease in methanotrophic activity at high Al saturation. Reduction in soil CH 4 uptake in the converted land-use types (ranging from − 3. 0 to − 14. 9 μg C m − 2 h − 1) compared to the reference land-use types (ranging from − 20. 8 to − 40. 3 μg C m − 2 h − 1; P < 0. 01) was due to a decrease in soil N availability in the converted land-use types. Our study shows {{for the first time that}} differences in soil fertility control the soil–atmosphere exchange of CO 2 and CH 4 in a tropical landscape, a mechanism that we were able to detect by conducting this study on the landscape scale...|$|R
40|$|For both {{environmental}} and economic reasons, there is broad interest in recycling rubber and in the continued development of recycling technologies. The use of postindustrial materials is a fairly well-established and documented business. Much effort {{over the past decade}} has been put into dealing with of end-of-life tires from landfills and vacant fields. It is only {{in the last few years}} that more business opportunities for recycled rubber have come to the forefront. Reclaiming rubber has gained increasing interest, more so in Europe than in North America. In those areas, much work has been done to refine the processes used. The major form of recycled rubber is still ground rubber. This is produced either by cryogenic, ambient, or wet grinding. The material is then used neat with sulfur/curatives, binders, or cements. The binders are normally moisture curable urethanes, liquid polybutadienes, or latex to produce items such as mats, floor tiles, and carpet undercushion. Recycled rubber is still used as tire derived fuel, but less so than 10 years ago. Another outlet is as an additive to asphalt. Recycled rubber can be used in the plastics industry, for which much development is being done. Large particle size ground rubber or chips are used in civil engineering applications, landscaping, or artificial turf. In terms of applications, most use is outside of the conventional rubber industry. Cost factors are still addressed in the tire industry. As of 2012, approximately 8 – 10 % recycled material is used in tires. The biggest obstacles to further adaption are safety factors and property loss. Better methods are needed for treating or modifying the rubber surface and for <b>regenerating</b> the <b>rubber</b> through devulcanization. Devulcanization gives the highest quality recycled material in terms of processing and properties. However, shortcomings to devulcanization are reduced process safety and odorous chemicals that are required at present...|$|R
