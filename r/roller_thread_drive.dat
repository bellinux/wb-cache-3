40|$|Based on the {{differential}} principle of thread transmission, an analytical model considering helical directions between screw and <b>roller</b> <b>threads</b> in planetary <b>roller</b> screw mechanism (PRSM) {{is presented in}} this work. The model is critical {{for the design of}} PRSM with a smaller lead and a bigger pitch to realize a higher transmission accuracy. The kinematic principle of planetary transmission is employed to analyze the PRSM with different screw <b>thread</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> directions. In order to investigate the differences with different screw <b>thread</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> directions, the numerical model is developed by using the software Adams to validate the analytical solutions calculated by the presented model. The results indicate, when the helical direction of screw thread is identical with the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>thread,</b> that the lead of PRSM is unaffected regardless of whether sliding between screw and rollers occurs or not. Only when the direction of screw thread is reverse to the direction of <b>roller</b> <b>thread,</b> the design of PRSM with a smaller lead can be realized under a bigger pitch. The presented models and numerical simulation method can be used to research the transmission accuracy of PRSM...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in development of machine engineering is to improve load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also relevant to the most promising items so far, i. e. orbital roller drives (ORD), which are the rotational-to-progressive motion converters widely used in vehicles. The previously published article suggested increasing a load capacity (by about 15 %) through reducing a thread turn section angle of the threaded ORD components and change of the radius of <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> turn section outline. Due to such ORD modification, a number {{of the most}} critical ORD parameters are to be changed thereby demanding further research. Further, the article published suggests a method considering the abovementioned changes to calculate the dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges. Though this method being not complete as the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing in relation to its rated value, required for assembly, is unknown; and to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment, outer diameters of the <b>roller</b> and screw <b>threads</b> are to be known. Hence, these two methods are interconnected. This article presents the numerical calculation method, mathematical support and method to determine the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing and initial contact point of the mating <b>roller</b> and screw <b>thread</b> turns. Due to considerable scope of calculations, the method was turned into the software. Similar calculation methods and techniques were developed to a particular case, where the thread turn section angle of the threaded components was of 90 °, and the <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> turn section outline was a circular arc centered to the roller axis. Hence the developed numerical calculation method, mathematical support and technique refer to the general case which is to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment and initial contact point of the mating <b>roller</b> and screw <b>thread</b> turns. Taking this into account, the calculations for a particular case were performed as test calculations during the software development. The results obtained matched the calculation results for a particular case published in several papers. Using a developed calculation technique, the calculation method to determine dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges may be completed for a general case considering the arbitrary turn section angle of threaded ORD components and radius of <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> turn section outline. </p...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} {{trend in the}} development of aerospace industry is to increase load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies, and parts without increasing their size and weight. The above is also true for widely used in aircrafts and the most promising up to date Epicyclic Roller-Screw Mechanisms (ERSM) that convert rotational movement into translational one. Previously (in the article), it was proposed to increase the load capacity (approximately by 15 %) through reduction of included angle of ERSM threaded parts from 90 ° to 70 °. However, such improvement of ERSM will change dimensions of the mechanism parts and its parameters and characteristics (efficiency factor, position of initial point of contact of the conjugated thread turns and parameters of their contact interaction, as well as kinematic parameters), which will require additional studies. If we take into account the priority of these studies, then surely we must begin with development of technique to determine dimensions of the ERSM main parts and their tolerance zones because we need drawings to manufacture and test the upgraded ERSM. We have developed a technique to calculate dimensions of the main parts of ERSM and associated tolerance zones that takes in to account the change of included angle of threaded parts of the mechanism and radius of circular arc according to which <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> profile has been fulfilled. So the proposed technique is the general one in comparison with the previous ones. This technique uses various conditions and equations to determine dimensions of parts and associated tolerance zones. For example, a nut encircles a screw with rollers, and their dimensions form a closed dimension chain, in which the dimensions and associated tolerances must be such as to ensure ERSM assembling, on the one hand, and, on the other hand the backlash of the mechanism should be minimal to ensure high load capacity, kinematic accuracy, and rigidity of ERSM. We used the following conditions: a lack of sharp thread turns on the screw, <b>rollers</b> and nut; <b>thread</b> turn of <b>roller</b> with minimal thickness is in the root of nut with maximal width; <b>thread</b> turn of <b>roller</b> with minimal thickness is in the root of screw with maximal width, taking into consideration the ERSM design features.

Pressurized operation is envisioned for large-scale hydrogen production plants, yielding higher overall efficiencies when the hydrogen product is to be delivered at elevated pressure for tank storage or pipelines. Pressurized operation also supports higher mass flow rates of the process gases with smaller components. The test stand can accommodate cell dimensions up to 8. 5 cm x 8. 5 cm and stacks of up to 25 cells. The pressure boundary for these tests is a water-cooled spool-piece pressure vessel designed for operation up to 5 MPa. The stack is internally manifolded and operates in cross-flow with an inverted-U flow pattern. Feed-throughs for gas inlets/outlets, power, and instrumentation are all located in the bottom flange. The entire spool piece, {{with the exception of}} the bottom flange, can be lifted to allow access to the internal furnace and test fixture. Lifting is accomplished with a motorized <b>threaded</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism attached to a rigid structural frame. Stack mechanical compression is accomplished using springs that are located inside of the pressure boundary, but outside of the hot zone. Initial stack heatup and performance characterization occurs at ambient pressure followed by lowering and sealing of the pressure vessel and subsequent pressurization. Pressure equalization between the anode and cathode sides of the cells and the stack surroundings is ensured by combining all of the process gases downstream of the stack. Steady pressure is maintained by means of a backpressure regulator and a digital pressure controller. A full description of the pressurized test apparatus is provided in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Today roller-screw {{mechanisms}} (RSM) are {{the most}} prospective motion converters from rotary to linear type. RSM manufacturers have suggested their design in the way, similar to the rolling bearings, in static and dynamic load ratings. The latter means that during long operations the main criterion of the RSM working capacity is fatigue spalling. However, this approach does not permit to consider temporal changes {{of the most critical}} performance parameters of the RSM (such as the axial play, the efficiency factor, the axial stiffness, the accuracy, the starting torque force for zero lash RSMs, etc.) through calculations. The abovementioned method was not perfect, because the choice of the main criterion of RSM working capacity was wrong. The article proves that wear-resistance is the main criterion of RSM working capacity. The proof is the RSM efficiency factor equal to 80 - 88 % on the average. The power loss occurs because of overcoming a sliding friction between multiple (from 300 to 1000) interfacing turns of thread on the screw and the rollers {{as well as on the}} rollers and the nut. That is why the RSMs are the screwtype rolling mechanisms with an essential portion of sliding friction. High-accuracy measurements taken using the device called a form-tracer for threaded pieces permitted to determine the essential changes on the profiles of turns of <b>threads</b> on the <b>rollers</b> (a straight-line portion appeared on the radial profile); these changes could emerge only from wear. Besides, the length of this portion increased with the increasing RSM operation time. The JSC “Moskvich” has examined the RSMs, which have been put out of operation after completing their service life as parts of robot welding machines. There were no traces of fatigue spalling found on the threaded surfaces of the RSM parts, while the sizes of the straight-line portions on the turns of the <b>roller</b> <b>threads</b> were much bigger than they were during the measurements after the initial period of operation. Therefore, it is relevant to conduct a research for developing the RSM wear-resistance calculation methods. The aim and objectives of such a research have been established, and the initial object – a non-nut type roller-screw mechanism of simple design and kinematics – has been chosen. By now a whole range of theoretical studies have been conducted entirely, or partially, a test rig has been designed and manufactured, and the metrological examination methods have been developed for threaded surfaces of the RSM parts...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in mechanical engineering development is the constant improvement of load capacity of machines, mechanisms, units and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also true for today’s most prospective planetary rollerscrew mechanisms (PRSM) converting motion from rotary to linear type. The problem of PRSM load capacity improvement deserves more attention, because these mechanisms have very high performance characteristics, which leads to problems in the choice of support devices for these mechanisms. However, for many mechanical engineering industries it is important to decrease the PRSMs weight and dimensions, or to improve their reliability and durability. This has led to finding the reserves for improving the PRSM load capacity by decreasing the thread turn profile angle, α, of PRSM threaded parts, as compared to α = 90 ° in traditional mechanisms. When PRSM calculation methods were developed, it was decided to use α = 90 ° for transforming the mechanism parts into a physical model and a design pattern. It allowed us to reduce the PRSM designing to well-known roller bearing designing based on very extensive experimental data. Proposed PRSM designs do not contradict to accepted physical models and design patterns – they just have different basic characteristics of PRSM, i. e. static and dynamic load ratings. Proposed PRSM designs with a thread turn profile angle α= 70 ° on their parts allow to increase the load capacity by 15 %, as compared to traditional PRSMs, which have threaded parts with a thread turn profile angle α = 90 °. There are two factors, which can improve the PRSM load capacity. The first one is the decrease of normal force between mating thread turns of a screw and a roller with the same operational axial force. The second one is the increase of the radius of the shaped profile of a <b>roller</b> <b>thread</b> turn resulting in the expansion of the contact area pattern between the mating thread turns of a screw and a roller. The first factor dominates here. For implementing the proposed PRSM designs into production, one has to explore additionally the effect of α-angle on linkage parameters, process requirements and specific features of the initial contact between the mating thread turns of a screw and a roller. </p...|$|R

In injection moulding, using hydraulic motor to drive gears and cores with thread for automatically taking plastic-injected parts with thread off from the cores is a common method for thread demoulding. The thread demoulding is completed by two movements. One of them is realized by {{the rotation of the}} <b>threaded</b> cores <b>driven</b> by hydraulic motor; the other is to stop the injected plastic part from turning and meanwhile push it out by a pushing plate. The pushing plate is usually driven by springs which give forces that vary with the distance the plate travels. Because of this, the displacement of the pushing plate might be different from that of displacement of the core thread goes along the core axis. Thus the parts moulded may be damaged at the thread area on the part when the automatic thread demoulding is proceeding. This technique needs much to be improved hereon in injection moulding. In this study, the author brings up a solution that the hydraulic motor is replaced by a step motor and the pushing plate is driven by a servo motor. And there is a programmable logic controller to synchronize the two movements driven by the motors. Through the improvement the mechanism is substantially enhanced compared with the spring-driven pushing demoulding system...|$|R

In recent years, the use of Grids, Utility and Cloud Computing, shows that these are approaches with growing interest and applicability, as well as scientific and also commer-cial impact. This work presents the design and implementation issues of a cooperative VM for a distributed execution environment that is resource-aware and policy-driven.

We propose A 2 -VM, a cooperative cluster-enabled virtual execution environment for Java, to be deployed on Grid sites and Cloud data-centers that usually comprise a number of federated clusters. This cooperative VM {{has the ability to}} monitor base mechanisms (e. g. thread scheduling, garbage collection, memory or net-work consumptions) to assess application’s performance and reconfigure these mechanisms in run-time according to previously defined resource allocation policies.

Therefore, considered as advanced are mechanical transducers of rotary motion to translational one, where rolling friction is mainly realized. They include planetary roller-screw mechanisms (PRSM). PRSM has a large variety of features. The design feature of PRSM is multiple starts of screw and nut <b>thread.</b> <b>Rollers,</b> as a rule, are made single-threaded. Number of screw thread starts which equals to a number of nut thread starts, has an effect on almost all performance characteristics of PRSM. This article covers comprehensively enough the influence of screw thread starts quantity on: kinematical parameters of PRSM, transfer function, mechanism radial dimensions, efficiency, power values, required characteristics of electric motor. As a result of investigations the graphs of dimensionless parameters vs. number of screw thread starts have been plotted, which are demonstrative and common. Being high enough the PRSM efficiency can vary within 20 … 25 % and more. It depends on a variety of mechanism part parameters; primarily on geometrical ones, as well as on a number of screw thread starts. Previously the methods of PRSM design calculation consisted in determination of the main geometric parameters of mechanism parts, then in determination of mechanism efficiency. At that, it was not always possible to design the economically feasible PRSM structure. Introduction of a dimensionless value – a relation of PRSM part thread pitch to average screw thread diameter – contributed to successive plotting of the assemblage of curves for relation of efficiency to the indicated ratio and a number of screw thread starts. By taking this assemblage of curves as a basis, the method of economically feasible PRSM structures calculation and design was proposed.   The essence of the developed method lies in that selection or definition of a number of screw thread starts helps to determine the relation of PRSM parts thread pitch to average diameter of screw thread which provides the maximum possible efficiency. Given further are check calculations confirming the operation capability of the selected PRSM design. </p...|$|R

This is accomplished {{through the use of a}} minimalistic Timber Run-Time system, TinyTimber. The TinyTimber kernel ensures state integrity, and performs scheduling of events based on given time-bounds in compliance with the Timber semantics. In this way, we avoid the volatile task of explicitly coding parallelism in terms of traditional processes/threads/semaphores/monitors, and side-step the delicate task to encode time-bounds into process/thread priorities. Moreover, a simulation environment is developed that enables the behaviour of a heterogeous distributed system, consisting of both the hardware and the Timber based embedded software to be observed under a model of the environment. Furthermore, pedagogic issues of reactive objects have been studied in the context of higher education. First results indicate that the use of TinyTimber give students an increased ability to understand and solve embedded programming assignments. Finally, the TinyTimber kernel implementation is discussed. Performance metrics are given for a number of representative platforms, showing the applicability of TinyTimber to small embedded systems. A comparison to a traditional system tick <b>driven,</b> <b>thread</b> based, real-time kernel shows that TinyTimber provides tighter timing and a simpler (yet comprehensive) API. In conclution we find that the use of Reactive Objects in C, realized through TinyTimber is a viable alternative for Embedded Real-Time Programming.

50|$|Lux Aeterna Theater has no {{stationary}} location and operates internationally; {{it can be}} easily assembled on various sites. The premises must include a projection surface (planetarium, dome hemisphere, panoramic projection screen, etc.), seats, and an optical pad behind the seats, projectors, and remote control. The optical pad is a metal plate with drilled holes in the grid and with <b>threaded</b> openings. The <b>drives</b> are positioning the optical elements into the beam or slow-acting control beam {{with a set of}} lines. Each line of the laser creates a separate image. The method, resulting in interference patterns on flat surfaces, is based on the use of accidental phase modulation, which occurs when a laser beam passing through optically heterogeneous mediums is refracted at different points and angles along its way, resulting in interference patterns projected on a screen that change in contour and texture with each change in medium. The medium is made of solid transparent matter (e.g. moving plates of non-uniform structure -usually round discs mounted in a revolving cassette. And as a result, a wide selection of visual character, image, shapes, effect appears on a screen. Or/and an additional lens is used to concentrate the light field. Or/and transfocators are mounted at the beam's point of exit. These form-building methods can be used in the same cassettes (to increase image possibilities) with diffraction gratings, curvilinear reflectors or a large moving lens (for the deformation of light imago). Lighting plot involves complex abstract light ductile movements. The projection tool allows receiving on-screen a very complex dynamics of light colorful shapes, to create a light accompaniment by colorful, graphic, structural visualization of thematic development, to unite music, musical sounds, and musical noises with light content. It also allows the spatial separation and motion of different audio content, voices, melody and musical instruments.|$|R
40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, <b>thread</b> <b>rollers</b> and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces male thread pitch diameter control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male screw and roller pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces male thread control. In the long term while reexamination of the All-Union state standard 2475 - 88 it is required to enlarge the range of smooth wires with new ones intended for RS advanced concepts pieces male thread pitch diameter control...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} reasons behind these {{improvements}} in epilayer quality of the step-grade structure. Since the dislocations from the substrate are extremely {{much lower than the}} dislocation generated from other sources, the MDs are considered as the main source of TDs. In case of without graded structure the most of the MDs are generated near the film–substrate interface due to large mismatch and lower critical thickness. Therefore, the TDs that glided in the upper layers could not be blocked by the MDs. On the other hand, the MDs’ generations in the step-graded structure spread throughout the entire layer instead of being concentrated in a single interface. As a result, the TDs that glided out from the first interlayer could be blocked by MDs generated in the second interlayer or TDs from second layer may be blocked by MDs in upper layer and so on. Therefore, the TD reduction in step-graded structure can be enhanced by the MD blocking. Moreover, as the strain inside the thin film <b>drives</b> <b>threading</b> dislocations to incline at each interface and react with each other, the introduction of an intentionally strained layer can be used to facilitate the TDs reduction process. This is the basic of TD reduction mechanism in step-graded layer. Bending of dislocations in without graded structure only occurs very close to the In x Ga 1 -xN/GaN interface, whereas dislocation bending can be noticed at each interface between InGaN interlayers of different composition in step-graded structure [52]. Moreover, due to large misfit dislocation density a strong interaction force among them prohibits the glide motion of the dislocation and further relaxation in without graded layer. Therefore, it requires further dislocation nucleation to relax the strain resulting higher TD densities in epilayer. On the other hand, lower MD densities offers week interaction force with easy gliding of TDs. A well-designed graded layer should relax the misfit strain mostly through the glide motion of existing threading dislocations instead of nucleation of new dislocation. Furthermore, as observed in various experimental works most nucleation sites for TDs are MDs which are extremely lower in step-graded structure than the without graded.|$|R
