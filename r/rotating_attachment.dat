40|$|The receptors that mediate {{monocyte}} adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial monolayers {{were assessed}} using a nonstatic (<b>rotating)</b> cell- <b>attachment</b> assay. In this system, leukocyte adhesion molecule- 1 (LAM- 1) (L-selectin) mediated {{a major portion}} (87 +/- 15 % at 37 degrees C) of monocyte attachment to activated endothelium. mAb blocking of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule- 1 (41 % inhibition), CD 18 (36 %), and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (25 %) function had lesser effects on attachment. These results suggest that LAM- 1 may serve {{an important role in}} monocyte attachment to endothelium at sites of inflammation...|$|R
40|$|The {{most recent}} {{efforts on the}} {{stability}} and transition of three-dimensional flows are reviewed. These include flows over swept wings, <b>rotating</b> disks, and <b>attachment</b> lines. The generic similarities of their stability behavior is discussed. It is shown that the breakdown process if very complex, often leading to contradictory results. Particular {{attention is paid to}} opposing observations of stationary and traveling wave distances...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into parameter sensitivity of a mathematical model of the human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The model ACL comprised a continuous array of fibres mapped between part-elliptical attachment areas on the femur and tibia. Relative motion of the two bones was controlled by a planar four-bar linkage. Parameter modifications were: (a) an alternative set of values for the coordinates of the four-bar linkage joints; (b) rotation of the attachment areas of the ligament by +/- 30 degrees; and (c) variation of some mechanical properties. The alternative four-bar linkage parameter set produced extremely large changes in ACL force values, up to 130 per cent. <b>Rotating</b> the tibial <b>attachment</b> changed forces by less than 20 per cent, whereas <b>rotating</b> the femoral <b>attachment</b> changed forces by up to 100 per cent. Altering the mechanical parameters produced the smallest differences in force, under 15 per cent. These results highlight the importance, when using a theoretical model, of establishing the values of the parameters defining the model as accurately as possible and of carrying out a parameter sensitivity study. From a clinical viewpoint, they also suggest that, when reconstructing a ruptured ACL, {{one of the most important}} considerations must be to position the femoral attachment of the graft as accurately as is feasible...|$|R
50|$|The boost {{engines are}} held {{together}} as a single assembly by a metal ring {{at the rear of}} the missile. Each motor has a small hook on the ring as well as similar one at the front holding it to the missile body. After firing, when the thrust of the rockets falls below the thrust of the now-lit ramjets, the boosters slide rearward until the front hook disengages from the missile body. The boosters are then free to <b>rotate</b> around their <b>attachment</b> to the metal ring, and are designed to rotate outward, away from the fuselage. In action, they fold open like the petals on a flower, greatly increasing drag and pulling the entire four-booster assembly away from the missile body.|$|R
5000|$|The Sybian has {{a weight}} of 22 lb, and {{measures}} 13.25 in wide, 12.5 in long, and 8.5 in tall excluding the 2 in rubber attachment with an 8 ft power cord. The unit {{is designed to}} work {{with or without a}} penetration attachment. When in operation, the Sybian distributes powerful vibrations externally along the user's entire pelvic floor, including clitoris, vulva and anus. The optional penetration <b>attachments</b> <b>rotate</b> using a 20:1 ratio gearmotor providing [...] that can vary from 0 to 120 rpm and vibration is produced using a [...] electric motor that may be controlled from 0 to 6500 rpm. Both power and vibration/rotation are controlled through a remote control. The Sybian is able to hold over 1000 lb of weight. It has a padded cover made out of naugahyde and the casing has built in finger grips for carrying.|$|R
40|$|The {{flail mower}} {{is a piece}} of {{agricultural}} equipment that uses bladed <b>attachments</b> <b>rotating</b> around a drum to cut down bushes and grassy terrain. One major drawback to the flail mower is the rapid wear that happens almost immediately when any sort of rocks, gravel, or rough terrain are encountered. The goal of this project was to design and manufacture a prototype of a machine that could level rough terrain through repeating impacts as opposed to cutting with blades. The final design was a chain flail mower, a piece of equipment designed to level rough terrain that uses chains to repeatedly bludgeon rocks, gravel, and debris. The designed chain flail mower was assembled into an existing commercially available snow blower for testing. by Aaron Flores. Thesis: S.

5000|$|High-tip buckets are {{suitable}} for light materials such as chip, peat and light gravel and when the bucket is emptied from a height.Unlike backhoes or standard tractors fitted with a front bucket, many large loaders do not use automotive steering mechanisms. Instead, they steer by a hydraulically actuated pivot point set exactly between {{the front and rear}} axles. This is referred to as [...] "articulated steering" [...] and allows the front axle to be solid, allowing it to carry greater weight. Articulated steering provides better maneuverability for a given wheelbase. Since the front wheels and <b>attachment</b> <b>rotate</b> on the same axis, the operator is able to [...] "steer" [...] his load in an arc after positioning the machine, which can be useful. The tradeoff is that when the machine is [...] "twisted" [...] to one side and a heavy load is lifted high, it has a greater risk of turning over to the [...] "wide" [...] side.|$|R
5000|$|Chameleons, {{frogs and}} some lungless {{salamanders}} have tongues that {{act like a}} tethered projectile. In frogs, the tongue is attached {{at the front of}} the mouth and <b>rotates</b> about this <b>attachment</b> as it flips out (thus the top of the tongue at rest becomes the bottom when extended). In chameleons, the tongue contracts against a tapered hyoid bone, eventually slipping off and projecting forward at very high speed. Lungless salamanders use a similar method, however, both the tongue and underlying hyoid bone project (in contrast to chameleons, whose hyoid remains fixed while the fleshy portion of the tongue projects). [...] In both salamanders and chameleons, the movement is too fast and requires too much mechanical power for muscle alone to provide - instead, muscles slowly pre-load elastic elements such as connective tissue, which can then recoil and release the stored energy at a much higher rate. [...] In order to retract their tongues over such great distances, the tongue muscles of chameleons have perforated Z-disks, allowing each sarcomere to shorten far greater distances than those of other vertebrates.|$|R
40|$|DC motors {{are used}} indispensably in {{industrial}} applications {{because they provide}} such advantages as small size, high speed, low construction cost, and safe operation. A major area of research in DC motors is to determine a better method to measure the torque of motor shaft. The traditional way to measure the mechanical torque of a <b>rotating</b> shaft is <b>attachment</b> a torque transducer in the transmission system between the driving motor and the load. However, this technique requires additional parts for the transmission system, which makes the design more complicated, time consuming, costly in construction, {{and in many cases}} impossible to achieve. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a new method for estimating the load torque of a DC motor shaft by using a novel modelling method based on an adaptive control technique, named as online tuning grey fuzzy PID (OTGFPID). A test rig using a DC motor is setup to investigate the torque behaviour as well as to evaluate the developed estimator. Firstly, mathematical model is developed for the motor. Secondly, the experimental speed-torque data and the optimized motor model is used to optimize the torque estimator. Then the optimized estimator is used to estimate accurately the load torque. Finally, the capability of the optimized torque estimator has been validated with the practical experiments in comparison with a typical estimation method...|$|R
