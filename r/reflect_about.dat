5|$|In 2001, Ed Harris {{directed}} Connelly in the biopic Pollock {{in which}} she played Ruth Kligman, Jackson Pollock's mistress. In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film, Requiem for a Dream, directed by Darren Aronofsky {{and based on the}} novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. Connelly played Marion Silver, the girlfriend of Harry, played by Jared Leto; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn. Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop. She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution. Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived. During her time in the apartment, Connelly isolated herself, painted, listened to music that she considered that her character would, designed clothes, and used the time to <b>reflect</b> <b>about</b> addictions and their origin. Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery. Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation. Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives.|$|E
500|$|Venusian {{clouds are}} thick and are {{composed}} mainly (75-96%) of sulfuric acid droplets. [...] These clouds obscure {{the surface of}} Venus from optical imaging, and <b>reflect</b> <b>about</b> 75% of the sunlight that falls on them. The geometric albedo, a common measure of reflectivity, is the highest of any planet in the Solar System. This high reflectivity potentially enables any probe exploring the cloud tops sufficient solar energy such that solar cells can be fitted anywhere on the craft. The density of the clouds is highly variable with the densest layer at about 48.5km, reaching 0.1 g/m3 similar to the lower range of cumulonimbus storm clouds on Earth.|$|E

Although he has doubts due to their enormous age difference, he also realizes that he loves her even more than he thought (unheard of {{between a man and a}} mistress) and he wants to be with her. He proposes an arrangement to Madame Alvarez and Aunt Alicia for Gigi to become his mistress. They are overjoyed. Gigi, wisely, is not.|$|E
60|$|Adrian {{reached the}} Witte Poort, and paused {{on this side}} of the moat to <b>reflect</b> <b>about</b> things in general. Like most young men of his time and blood, as has been said, he had {{military}} leanings, and was convinced that, given the opportunity, he might become one of the foremost generals of his age. Now he was engaged in imagining himself besieging Leyden at the head of a great army, and in fancy disposing his forces after such fashion as would bring about its fall in the shortest possible time. Little did he guess that within some few years this very question was to exercise the brain of Valdez and other great Spanish captains.|$|E

60|$|It {{is truly}} {{incredible}} how Alvina became blooming and bouncing at this time. Nothing shocked her, nothing upset her. She was always ready with her hard, nurse's laugh and her nurse's quips. No one {{was better than}} she at double-entendres. No one could better give the nurse's leer. She had it all in a fortnight. And never once did she feel anything but exhilarated and in full swing. It seemed to her she had not a moment's time to brood or <b>reflect</b> <b>about</b> things--she was {{too much in the}} swing. Every moment, in the swing, living, or active in full swing. When she got into bed she went to sleep. When she awoke, it was morning, and she got up. As soon as she was up and dressed she had somebody to answer, something to say, something to do. Time passed like an express train--and she seemed to have known no other life than this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Harry, [...] "there it goes; {{we shall}} be done at last." [...] For he {{saw that he was}} being outflanked by the {{advancing}} flames. But still they worked, drawing lines of fire here and there, and still they hoped that there might be ground for hope. Nokes had been seen; but, pregnant as the theme might be with words, it was almost impossible to talk. Questions could not be asked and answered without stopping in their toil. There were questions which Harry longed to ask. Could Medlicot swear to the man? Did the man know that he had been seen? If he knew that he had been watched while he lit the grass, he would soon be far away from Medlicot's Mill and Gangoil. Harry felt {{that it would be a}} consolation to him in his trouble if he could get hold of this man, and keep him, and prosecute him--and have him hung. Even in the tumult of the moment he was able to <b>reflect</b> <b>about</b> it, and to think that he remembered that the crime of arson was capital in the colony of Queensland. He had endeavored to be good to the men with whom he had dealings. He had not stinted their food, or cut them short in their wages, or been hard in exacting work from them. And this was his return! Ideas as to the excellence of absolute dominion and power flitted across his brain--such power as Abraham, no doubt, exercised. In Abraham's time the people were submissive, and the world was happy. Harry Heathcote, at least, had never heard that it was not happy. But as he thought of all this he worked away with his bush and his matches, extinguishing the flames here and lighting them there, striving to make a cordon of black bare ground between Boolabong and Gangoil. Surely Abraham had never been called on to work like this! ...|$|E
6000|$|Mirah {{could not}} ask herself another question--could not do {{anything}} else than put her cold trembling hands in her pocket for her portemonnaie and hold it out. Lapidoth grasped it at once, pressed her fingers the while, said, [...] "Good-bye, my little girl--to-morrow then!" [...] and left her. He had not taken many steps before he looked carefully into all {{the folds of the}} purse, found two half-sovereigns and odd silver, and, pasted against the folding cover, a bit of paper on which Ezra had inscribed, in a beautiful Hebrew character, the name of his mother, the days of her birth, marriage, and death, and the prayer, [...] "May Mirah be delivered from evil." [...] It was Mirah's liking to have this little inscription on many articles that she used. The father read it, and had a quick vision of his marriage day, and the bright, unblamed young fellow he was at that time; teaching many things, but expecting by-and-by to get money more easily by writing; and very fond of his beautiful bride Sara--crying when she expected him to cry, and reflecting every phase of her feeling with mimetic susceptibility. Lapidoth had traveled a long way from that young self, and thought of all that this inscription signified with an unemotional memory, which was like the ocular perception of a touch to one who has lost the sense of touch, or like morsels on an untasting palate, having shape and grain, but no flavor. Among the things we may gamble away in a lazy selfish life is the capacity for ruth, compunction, or any unselfish regret--which we may come to long for as one in slow death longs to feel laceration, rather than be conscious of a widening margin where consciousness once was. Mirah's purse was a handsome one--a gift to her, which she had been unable to <b>reflect</b> <b>about</b> giving away--and Lapidoth presently found himself outside of his reverie, considering what the purse would fetch in addition to the sum it contained, and what prospect there was of his being able to get more from his daughter without submitting to adopt a penitential form of life under the eyes of that formidable son. On such a subject his susceptibilities were still lively.|$|E

6000|$|I wrote you a scrabbly {{note from}} Ravenna {{a few days}} since--but I must follow it up, without delay, with {{something}} better. I came on here an hour afterwards, and shall remain till June 1st or 2nd. I find Rome deliriously cool and empty, and still very pleasing {{in spite of the}} [...] "ruining" [...] which has been going on so long and of which one has heard so much, i.e., the redemption and cockneyfication of the ruins. This [...] "changes" [...] immensely--as everyone says; but I find myself, I am afraid, so much more changed--since I first knew and rhapsodized over it, that I am bound in justice to hold Rome the less criminal of the two. I am thinking a little about going down--if the coolness lasts--for three or four days to Naples; but I haven't decided. I feel rather hard and heartless to be prattling about these touristries to you, with the sad picture I have had these last weeks of your--William's--state of suffering. But it is only a way of saying that that state makes one feel it to be the greater duty for me to be as well as I can. Absit omen! Your so interesting letter of the 6th dictated to Alice speaks of the possibility of your abscess continuing not to heal--but I trust the event has long ere this reassured, comforted and liberated you. Meanwhile may Alice have smoothed your pillow as even she has never smoothed it before.... As regards the life, the power, the temper, the humour and beauty and expressiveness of the Diary in itself--these things were partly [...] "discounted" [...] to me in advance by so much of Alice's talk during her last years--and my constant association with her--which led me often to <b>reflect</b> <b>about</b> her extraordinary force of mind and character, her whole way of taking life--and death--in very much {{the manner in which the}} book does. I find in its pages, for instance, many things I heard her say. None the less I have been immensely impressed with the thing as a revelation of a moral and personal picture. It is heroic in its individuality, its independence--its face-to-face with the universe for and by herself--and the beauty and eloquence with which she often expresses this, let alone the rich irony and humour, constitute (I wholly agree with you) a new claim for the family renown. This last element--her style, her power to write--are indeed to me a delight--for I have had many letters from her. Also it brings back to me all sorts of things I am glad to keep--I mean things that happened, hours, occasions, conversations--brings them back with a strange, living richness. But it also puts before me what I was tremendously conscious of in her life-time--that the extraordinary intensity of her will and personality really would have made the equal, the reciprocal, life of a [...] "well" [...] person--in the usual world--almost impossible to her--so that her disastrous, her tragic health was in a manner the only solution for her of the practical problem of life--as it suppressed the element of equality, reciprocity, etc. The violence of her reaction against her British ambiente, against everything English, engenders some of her most admirable and delightful passages--but I feel in reading them, as I always felt in talking with her, that inevitably she simplified too much, shut up in her sick room, exercised her wondrous vigour of judgment on too small a scrap of what really surrounded her. It would have been modified in many ways if she had lived with them (the English) more--seen more of the men, etc. But doubtless it is fortunate for the fun and humour of the thing that it wasn't modified--as surely the critical emotion (about them,) the essence of much of their nature, was never more beautifully expressed. As for her allusions to H.--they fill me with tears and cover me with blushes.... I find an immense eloquence in her passionate [...] "radicalism"--her most distinguishing feature almost--which, in her, was absolutely direct and original (like everything that was in her,) unreflected, uncaught from entourage or example. It would really have made her, had she lived in the world, a feminine [...] "political force." [...] But had she lived in the world and seen things nearer she would have had disgusts and disillusions. However, what comes out in the book--as it came out to me in fact--is that she was really an Irishwoman; transplanted, transfigured--yet none the less fundamentally national--in spite of her so much larger and finer than Irish intelligence. She felt the Home Rule question absolutely as only an Irishwoman (not anglicised) could. It was a tremendous emotion with her--inexplicable in any other way--but perfectly explicable by [...] "atavism." [...] What a pity she wasn't born there--and had her health for it. She would have been (if, always, she had not fallen a victim to disgust--a large [...] "if") a national glory! But I am writing too much and my late hindrances have left me with tremendous arrears of correspondence. I thank you, dear Alice, caramente, for your sweet letter received two or three weeks before William's. I crudely hope you won't let your house--so as to have it to go to in the summer. Otherwise what will become of you. I dig my nose into the fleshiest parts of the young Francis. Tell Peggy I cling to her--and to Harry too, and Billy not less.... I haven't sent you [...] "The Yellow Book"--on purpose; and indeed I have been weeks and weeks receiving a copy of it myself. I say on purpose because although my little tale which ushers it in ("The Death of the Lion") appears to have had, for a thing of mine, an unusual success, I hate too much the horrid aspect and company of the whole publication. And yet I am again to be intimately, conspicuously associated with the 2d number. It is for gold and to oblige the worshipful Harland (the editor). Wait and read the two tales in a volume--with 2 or 3 others. Above all be debout and forgive the long reticence of your affectionate ...|$|E
