40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years, migrations flows into Southern Europe have {{increased}} considerably. Up to the late 1980 s, Southern Europe was largely a transient country for African, Asian, Polish and Yugoslav migrants whose final destinations were the USA, Canada and, to a lesser degree, Western Europe. Since then, a growing proportion of migrants have sought to stay. Thus, Southern Europe has undergone something of a transition “from a <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> en route to Northern Europe, to a ‘waiting room ’ pending a move further northwards, and then into a ‘terminus ’ or destination desirable {{in its own right}} ” (King, et al. 2000, p. 14). For Italy and Greece mostly, in-migration has been very closely connected to the collapse of the regimes in Eastern Europe. Migrants from North-Africa, on the other hand, have headed to-wards Spain and beyond. In all, the total number of migrants in Southern Europe today is estimated at five million people. Migrants in rural Southern Europe The employment of migrants in European agriculture has also increased significantly over the past fifteen years (European Commission, 2000), particularl...|$|E

40|$|Nuclear-encoded {{precursors}} of chloroplast proteins are synthesized with an amino-terminal cleavable transit sequence, {{which contains}} the information for chloroplastic targeting. To determine which <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transit</b> sequence {{are most important}} for its function, the chloroplast uptake and processing of a full-length ferredoxin precursor and four mutants with deletions in adjacent <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transit</b> sequence were analyzed. Arabidopsis {{was used as an}} experimental system for both in vitro and in vivo import. The full-length wild-type precursor translocated efficiently into isolated Arabidopsis chloroplasts, and upon expression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants only mature-sized protein was detected, which was localized inside the chloroplast. None of the deletion mutants was imported in vitro. By analyzing transgenic plants, more subtle effects on import were observed. The most N-terminal deletion resulted in a fully defective transit sequence. Two deletions in the middle <b>region</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transit</b> sequence allowed translocation into the chloroplast, although with reduced efficiencies. One deletion in this region strongly reduced mature protein accumulation in older plants. The most C-terminal deletion was translocated but resulted in defective processing. These results allow the dissection <b>of</b> the <b>transit</b> sequence into separate functional regions and give an in vivo basis for a domain-like structure <b>of</b> the ferredoxin <b>transit</b> sequence...|$|R

40|$|The amino {{terminal}} of {{the transport}} intermediate of the 23 -kDa protein of PSII, which was generated by stromal processing, {{was determined by}} radiosequencing {{in order to identify}} the site of processing of its precursor. The site was located in the central <b>region</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transit</b> peptide. The primary structure of the processing site included a motif that is common to the processing sites <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> peptides <b>of</b> various stromal proteins. This common motif was also found in the <b>transit</b> pep-tides <b>of</b> other thylakoid luminal proteins, an indication of its conservation among higher plants. A common secondary structure, /taurn//?-sheet/ct-helix, was predicted from the amino acid se-quence around the consensus motif. This structural similarity between stromal and thylakoid luminal proteins suggests that the sequences are under a common selective pressure to maintain these sites of cleavage by a stromal processing peptidase.

40|$|We studied {{transport}} and binding to intact chloroplasts of 10 mutants in three <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transit</b> peptide <b>of</b> {{a precursor to}} the small subunit of ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase [3 -phospho-D-glycerate carboxy-lyase (transphosphorylating), E. C. 4. 1. 1. 39]. Transport was assayed in a reconstituted system using isolated pea chloroplasts and radioactively labeled precursor. Binding to the chloroplast envelope was assayed {{in a similar manner}} using chloroplasts pretreated with nigericin. Most mutants showed a dramatically decreased capacity of binding, although some of them transported relatively well. The accumulation of the mutant proteins inside the chloroplast as a function of time was examined. Although the authentic small subunit precursor was imported rapidly, uptake of most mutant precursors was considerably slower and continued until the last time point examined. In terms of assigning functions to individual regions, we found that at least the middle <b>region</b> and parts <b>of</b> the amino and the carboxyl termini <b>of</b> the <b>transit</b> peptide are more important for receptor binding than for translocation. A two-step processing mechanism has been postulated for the maturation of the small subunit precursor. This model predicts the occurrence of processing intermediates. When precursors carrying carboxyl-terminal deletions were presented to the chloroplast, no defined intermediates could be detected. Instead, a number of proteins, probably resulting from aberrant processing, accumulated simultaneously inside the chloroplasts...|$|R
40|$|A chloroplastic outer {{envelope}} {{membrane protein}} of 75 kDa (OEP 75) was identified previously {{as a component}} of the protein import machinery. Here we provide additional evidence that OEP 75 is a component of protein import, present the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding this protein, briefly describe its developmental expression and tissue specificity, and characterize its insertion into the outer envelope membrane. OEP 75 was synthesized as a higher molecular weight precursor (prOEP 75) which bound to isolated chloroplasts in an in vitro import assay and subsequently was processed to the mature form (mOEP 75). During this import assay, two proteins intermediate in size between prOEP 75 and mOEP 75 were detected. One of these intermediates was also detected in chloroplast envelopes isolated from young pea leaves. Binding and processing of prOEP 75 required ATP and one or more surface-exposed proteinaceous components, and was competed by prSSU, a stromal-targeted protein. We propose that the N-terminus of the prOEP 75 transit peptide acts as a stromal-targeting domain and a central, hydrophobic <b>region</b> <b>of</b> this <b>transit</b> peptide acts as a stop-transfer domain. A complex route of insertion and processing of prOEP 75 may exist to ensure high fidelity targeting of this import component...|$|R
30|$|Typically, ASL {{provides}} CBF as {{a single}} measure of perfusion. However, ASL techniques can be modified to acquire CBF images at multiple post-labelling delays. This offers {{more information about the}} labelled bolus and its arrival to the tissue, providing more comprehensive haemodynamic parameters [14, 15]. One of these techniques is the quantitative signal targeting with alternating radiofrequency labelling <b>of</b> arterial <b>regions</b> (QUASAR) [16]. In addition to CBF maps, QUASAR acquires several other ancillary parametric maps in the same resolution and space as the ASL CBF image [14, 16]. First, R 1 maps are derived from the Look-Locker multi-inversion time scheme, representing the longitudinal relaxation rate of the brain tissue. It has contrast similar to a T 1 -weighted image and, therefore, carries relatively detailed anatomical information. Arterial blood volume (aBV) maps are similar to low-resolution angiography maps, whereas arterial transit time (ATT) maps show the time necessary for the labelled blood to flow from the labelling slab to the vascular compartment of the imaging voxel. ATT maps can be useful to demonstrate the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> prolonged <b>transit</b> time such as in steno-occlusive diseases [17]. In the normal brain, boundaries between the territories of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries (watershed areas) have longer ATT than the core of these perfusion territories, thereby delineating areas prone to borderzone or watershed stroke [17].|$|R

The purpose of this report is to describe the computer designed, constructed and used at NRAO.

This was arbitrarily chosen as the maximum per-missible reduction in response, and hence IF delay switching occurs every 32 fringes, (In fact, the choice of 32 fringes was not quite arbitrary, since a pulse is developed for every fringe, and the computer uses a chain of binary counters).

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{optimised}} design of a distribution network taking into account the variability of the final customer demand. In particular we study the design of a one-to-many distribution system, considering the product flows from the hub to the different transit points, as well as the reverse flows. The optimization procedure consists of two main steps: the first step is the determination of the total number <b>of</b> the <b>transit</b> points and the second step is the positioning, within the considered <b>regions,</b> <b>of</b> the different <b>transit</b> points with respect to the position of the main hub. The fluctuating demand over the different regions modifies the optimal solution at the different evaluation times. The goal is the definition of the network configuration that minimizes the total costs considering the uncertainty of the customer demand. We have identified two possible strategies to face such uncertainty: a robust and a stable, where the former produces the minimum expected total cost while the latter determines the minimum variability of the different cost components over the different scenarios. The problem has been inspired by a real industrial case in the food distribution sector that has been reported to show the applicability of the proposed model...|$|R

Using a three-year sample of archived automatic vehicle location (AVL) and hydrologic data the relationships between ridership, travel time, delay, and rainfall were investigated. The analysis of daily ridership and rainfall resulted in no statistically significant results, however, the results are supported by the existing research in this field. There was a generally negative trend in ridership with respect to rainfall. The analysis of travel time and rainfall did not result in the expected outcome. It was hypothesized that travel time would vary with rainfall, but that was not always the case. During many rainfall events the travel time remained average. The analysis of delay and rainfall shows that the impact of rainfall on delay is more complex than assumed. The delay during dry trips was different than the delay during light and moderate rain, but during heavy rain the statistical different disappeared. These results, implications for transit operators, and future research opportunities are discussed...|$|R
