5|$|<b>Research</b> <b>at</b> Simla {{formally}} {{began in}} 1950. Beebe's <b>research</b> <b>at</b> Simla combined elements {{of many different}} earlier stages of his research, including observations of the life cycles of the area's birds, detailed analyses of every plant and animal in small areas of forest, and studies of insect behavior. Insects were {{the focus of the}} scientific papers he produced during this period, marking a transition from his past areas of study into the field of entomology. Local children periodically brought animal specimens to Beebe at Simla and asked him to classify them. Remembering the early studies of his own childhood, in which he had brought specimens to the American Museum of Natural History, he was happy working with them.|$|E
