These kernel estimators are based on some inverse Gaussian and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>inverse</b> Gaussian probability density functions used as kernels. We show that they share the same properties as those of gamma kernel estimators : they are free of boundary bias, always non-negative, and achieve the optimal rate of convergence for the mean integrated squared error.

The paper investigates the asymptotic and finite-sample properties of the asymmetric kernel Nadaraya-Watson, local linear, and re-weighted Nadaraya-Watson estimators. Pointwise weak consistency, rates of convergence and asymptotic normality are established for each of these estimators. As an important economic application of asymmetric kernel regression estimators, we reexamine the problem of estimating scalar diffusion processes. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe self-adjointness of the semigroup {{generator}} of {{one dimensional}} diffusions implies a spectral representation (see [33, 50]) which has found many useful applications, for {{example for the}} prediction of second order stationary sequences (see [18]) and in mathematical finance (see [47]). However, on noncompact state spaces the spectrum of the generator will typically include both a discrete and a continuous part, with the latter starting at a spectral cutoff point related to the nonexistence of stationary moments. The significance of this fact for statistical estimation is not yet fully understood. We consider here the problem of spectral representation of transition density for an interesting class of examples: the hypergeometric diffusions with heavytailed Pearson type invariant distribution of a) <b>reciprocal</b> (<b>inverse)</b> gamma, b) Fisher-Snedecor, or c) skew-Student type. As opposed to the "classic" hypergeometric diffusions (Ornstein-Uhlebeck, Gamma/CIR, Beta/Jacobi), these diffusions have a continuum spectrum, whose spectral cutoff and transition density we present in this paper. © Polymat, Moscow 2013...|$|E

40|$|This study {{employed}} in vitro seed culture {{to determine how}} C and N supply influence the growth (i. e. starch accumulation) and protein composition of maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm. Immature kernels were grown to maturity on liquid medium containing various concentrations of C (sucrose at 234 millimolar [low] and 468 millimolar [high]) and N (amino acid mixture ranging in N from 0 to 144 millimolar). Low C supply limited starch, but not N, accumulation in the endosperm. With high C, endosperm starch and protein content increased concomitantly as N supply increased from 0 to 13. 4 millimolar. Endosperm growth was unaffected by additional N until concentrations exceeding approximately 72 millimolar reduced starch accumulation. A similar inhibition of starch deposition occurred with lower N concentrations when kernels were grown with low C. Endosperm total N content reached a point of saturation with approximately 36 millimolar N in the medium, regardless of C supply. Zein synthesis in the endosperm responded positively across all N levels, while glutelin content remained static and albumin/globulin proteins were reduced in amount when N supply was greater than 36 millimolar. A <b>reciprocal,</b> <b>inverse</b> relationship was observed in mature endosperm tissue between the concentrations of free amino acids and soluble sugars.
