40|$|The <b>reliability</b> <b>function</b> of variable-rate Slepian-Wolf coding {{is linked}} to the <b>reliability</b> <b>function</b> of channel coding with {{constant}} composition codes, through which computable lower and upper bounds are derived. The bounds coincide at rates close to the Slepian-Wolf limit, yielding a complete characterization of the <b>reliability</b> <b>function</b> in that rate regime. It is shown that variable-rate Slepian-Wolf codes can significantly outperform fixed-rate Slepian-Wolf codes in terms of rate-error tradeoff. The <b>reliability</b> <b>function</b> of variable-rate Slepian-Wolf coding with rate below the Slepian-Wolf limit is determined. In sharp contrast with fixed-rate Slepian-Wolf codes for which the correct decoding probability decays to zero exponentially fast if the rate is below the Slepian-Wolf limit, the correct decoding probability of variable-rate Slepian-Wolf codes can be bounded away from zero.
