50|$|This {{problem is}} named after the postman and his {{challenge}} to deliver mail in any order he may choose, but minimizing his costs such as time or travel distance.

If the whole network must be mapped, the <b>route</b> <b>that</b> maps the entire network is called a covering tour. In the case where only certain edges need to be mapped, the problem aims to solve the <b>route</b> <b>that</b> optimizes the demands, crossing over into non-required routes a minimal number of times.|$|R

The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, <b>routes</b> <b>that</b> formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E
