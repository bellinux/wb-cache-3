40|$|A perturbed {{black hole}} emits {{gravitational}} radiation, usually termed the <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal,</b> whose frequency and time-constant {{depends on the}} mass and spin of the black hole. I investigate {{the case of a}} binary black hole merger resulting from two initially non-spinning black holes of various mass ratios, in quasi-circular orbits. The observed <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal</b> will be determined, among other things, by the black hole's spin-axis orientation with respect to Earth, its sky position and polarization angle - parameters which can take any values in a particular observation. I have carried out a statistical analysis of the effect of these variables, focusing on detection and measurement of the multimode <b>ringdown</b> <b>signals</b> using the reformulated European LISA mission, Next Gravitational-Wave Observatory, NGO, the third generation ground-based observatory, Einstein Telescope and the advanced era detector, aLIGO.

40|$|The ongoing {{observations}} of merging black holes by {{the instruments of}} the fledging gravitational wave astronomy has {{opened the way for}} testing the general relativistic Kerr black hole metric and, at the same time, for probing the existence of more speculative horizonless ultracompact objects.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{believed that the}} <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal</b> from a binary coalescence provides a conclusive proof {{for the formation of}} an event horizon after the merger. This expectation {{is based on the assumption}} that the ringdown waveform at intermediate times is dominated by the quasinormal modes of the final object. We point out that this assumption should be taken with great care, and that very compact objects with a light ring will display a similar ringdown stage, even when their quasinormal-mode spectrum is completely different from that of a black hole. In other words, universal ringdown waveforms indicate the presence of light rings, rather than of horizons. Only precision observations of the late-time <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal,</b> where the differences in the quasinormal-mode spectrum eventually show up, can be used to rule out exotic alternatives to black holes and to test quantum effects at the horizon scale.

40|$|We study an {{improved}} method for detecting gravitational wave (GW) signals from perturbed black holes by earth-based detectors {{in the quest}} for searching for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Such <b>signals,</b> called <b>ringdowns,</b> are damped sinusoids whose frequency and damping constant can be used to measure a black hole's mass and spin.

The statistic addresses the non-Gaussianity of the data without the use of an additional signal-based waveform consistency test. We also develop coherent network statistics to check for consistency of signal amplitudes and phases in the different detectors with their different orientations and signal arrival times. We find that the detection efficiency can be improved at least by a few tens of percent by applying these multi-detector statistics primarily because of the ineffectiveness of single-detector based discriminators of non-stationary noise, such as the chi-square test, in the case of <b>ringdown</b> <b>signals</b> studied here...|$|R

We explore the phenomenology of the measurement accuracies for binaries with total masses between 50 and 500 M_ and mass ratios between 0. 1 and 1. We find that (i) at total masses below 200 M_, where the signal-to-noise-ratio is dominated by the inspiral portion of the signal, the chirp mass parameter can be accurately measured; (ii) at higher masses, the information content is dominated by the ringdown, and total mass is measured more accurately; (iii) the mass of the lower-mass companion is poorly estimated, especially at high total mass and more extreme mass ratios; (iv) spin cannot be accurately measured for our injection set with non-spinning components. Most importantly, we find that for binaries with non-spinning components at all values of the mass ratio in the considered range and at network signal-to-noise ratio of 15, analyzed with spin-aligned templates, the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole with mass > 100 M_ can be confirmed with 95...|$|R
40|$|General relativity's no-hair theorem {{states that}} {{isolated}} astrophysical black holes are described by only two numbers: mass and spin. As a consequence, there are strict {{relationships between the}} frequency and damping time of the different modes of a perturbed Kerr black hole. Testing the no-hair theorem has been a longstanding goal of gravitational-wave astronomy. The recent detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers would seem to make such tests imminent. We investigate how constraints on black hole ringdown parameters scale with the loudness of the <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal</b> [...] -subject to the constraint that the post-merger remnant {{must be allowed to}} settle into a perturbative, Kerr-like state. In particular, we require that [...] -for a given detector [...] -the gravitational waveform predicted by numerical relativity is indistinguishable from an exponentially damped sine after time t^cut. By requiring the post-merger remnant to settle into such a perturbative state, we find that confidence intervals for ringdown parameters do not necessarily shrink with louder signals. In at least some cases, more sensitive measurements probe later times without necessarily providing tighter constraints on ringdown frequencies and damping times. Preliminary investigations are unable to explain this result in terms of a numerical relativity artifact. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{interferometric}} LIGO detectors {{have recently}} measured the first direct gravitational-wave signal from {{what has been}} interpreted as the inspiral, merger and ringdown of a binary system of black holes. The signal-to-noise ratio of the measured signal {{is large enough to}} leave little doubt that it does refer to the inspiral of two massive and ultracompact objects, whose merger yields a rotating black hole. Yet, the quality of the data is such that some room is left for alternative interpretations that do not involve black holes, but other objects that, within classical general relativity, can be equally massive and compact, namely, gravastars. We here consider the hypothesis that the merging objects were indeed gravastars and explore whether the merged object could therefore be not a black hole but a rotating gravastar. After comparing the real and imaginary parts of the <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal</b> of GW 150914 with the corresponding quantities for a variety of gravastars, and notwithstanding the very limited knowledge of the perturbative response of rotating gravastars, we conclude {{it is not possible to}} model the measured ringdown of GW 150914 as due to a rotating gravastar.

The SQUID is shunted with a capacitor forming a nonlinear oscillator with resonance frequency in the range of several GHz. The resonance frequency is varied by tuning the Josephson inductance of the SQUID with on-chip flux lines. We report measurements of decaying oscillations in the time domain following a brief excitation with a microwave pulse. The nonlinearity of the SQUID oscillator is probed by observing the ringdown response for different excitation amplitudes while the SQUID potential is varied by adjusting the flux bias. Simulations are performed on a model circuit by numerically solving the corresponding Langevin equations incorporating the SQUID potential at the experimental temperature and using parameters obtained from separate measurements characterizing the SQUID oscillator. Simulations are in good agreement with the experimental observations of the ringdowns as a function of applied magnetic flux and pulse amplitude. We observe a crossover between the occurrence of ringdowns close to resonance and adiabatic following at larger detuning from the resonance. We also discuss the occurrence of phase jumps at large amplitude drive.

40|$|The {{ringdown}} phase {{following a}} {{binary black hole}} merger is usually assumed to be well described by a linear superposition of complex exponentials (quasinormal modes). In the strong-field conditions typical of a binary black hole merger, non-linear effects may produce mode coupling. Artificial mode coupling can also be induced by the black hole's rotation, if the radiation field is expanded in terms of spin-weighted spherical (rather than spheroidal) harmonics. Observing deviations from linear black hole perturbation theory requires optimal fitting techniques to extract ringdown parameters from numerical waveforms, which are inevitably affected by errors. So far, non-linear least-squares fitting methods {{have been used as}} the standard workhorse to extract frequencies from ringdown waveforms. These methods are known not to be optimal for estimating parameters of complex exponentials. Furthermore, different fitting methods have different performance in the presence of noise. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce the gravitational wave community to modern variations of a linear parameter estimation technique first devised in 1795 by Prony: the Kumaresan-Tufts and matrix pencil methods. Using "test" damped sinusoidal signals in Gaussian white noise we illustrate the advantages of these methods, showing that they have variance and bias at least comparable to standard non-linear least-squares techniques. Then we compare the performance of different methods on unequal-mass binary black hole merger waveforms.

We {{focus on a}} configuration with non spinning objects and within the most likely range of mass ratio for neutron star-black hole systems (q= 6). In this region of the parameter space, the neutron star is not tidally disrupted prior to merger, and we show that {{the two types of}} mergers appear remarkably similar. The effect of the presence of a neutron star on the gravitational wave signal is not only undetectable by the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, but also too small to be measured in the numerical simulations: even the plunge, merger and <b>ringdown</b> <b>signals</b> appear in perfect agreement for both types of binaries. The characteristics of the post-merger remnants are equally similar, with the masses of the final black holes agreeing within dM< 5 10 ^{- 4 }M_BH and their spins within da< 10 ^{- 3 }M_BH. The rate of periastron advance in the mixed binary agrees with previously published binary black hole results, and we use the inspiral waveforms to place constraints on the accuracy of our numerical simulations independent of algorithmic choices made for each type of binary. Overall, our results indicate that non-disrupting neutron star-black hole mergers are exceptionally well modeled by black hole-black hole mergers, and that given the absence of mass ejection, accretion disk formation, or differences in the gravitational wave signals, only electromagnetic precursors could prove the presence of a neutron star in low-spin systems of total mass ~ 10 Msun, at least until the advent of gravitational wave detectors with a sensitivity comparable to that of the proposed Einstein Telescope.

The resonator quality factor, Q_r ≃ 23, is dominated by the coupling to the feedline and limits the detection bandwidth to on the order of 1 MHz. When operated in KID mode, the detectors are AC biased with tones at their resonant frequencies of 45. 85 and 91. 81 MHz. In the low-bias, standard KID mode, a single photon produces a hot spot that does not turn an entire section of the line normal but only increases the kinetic inductance. In the high-bias, critical KID mode, a photon event turns a section of the line normal and the resonance is destroyed until the normal region is dissipated. When operated as an SPD in Geiger mode, the resonators are DC biased through cryogenic bias tees and each photon produces a sharp voltage step followed by a <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal</b> at the resonant frequency of the detector which is converted to a standard pulse with an envelop detector. We show that AC biasing in the critical KID mode is inferior to the sensitivity achieved in DC-biased SPD mode due to the small fraction of time spent near the critical current with an AC bias.

40|$|The LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave {{observatories}} {{are complex}} and extremely sensitive strain detectors {{that can be used}} to search for a wide variety of gravitational waves from astrophysical and cosmological sources. In this thesis, I motivate the search for the gravitational wave signals from coalescing black hole binary systems with total mass between 25 and 100 solar masses. The mechanisms for formation of such systems are not well-understood, and we do not have many observational constraints on the parameters that guide the formation scenarios. Detection of gravitational waves from such systems — or, in the absence of detection, the tightening of upper limits on the rate of such coalescences — will provide valuable information that can inform the astrophysics of the formation of these systems. I review the search for these systems and place upper limits on the rate of black hole binary coalescences with total mass between 25 and 100 solar masses. I then show how the sensitivity of this search can be improved by up to 40 % by the the application of the multivariate statistical classifier known as a random forest of bagged decision trees to more effectively discriminate between signal and non-Gaussian instrumental noise. I also discuss the use of this classifier in the search for the <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal</b> from the merger of two black holes with total mass between 50 and 450 solar masses and present upper limits. I also apply multivariate statistical classifiers to the problem of quantifying the non-Gaussianity of LIGO data. Despite these improvements, no gravitational-wave signals have been detected in LIGO data so far. However, the use of multivariate statistical classification can significantly improve the sensitivity of the Advanced LIGO detectors to such signals...|$|R
50|$|More importantly, {{the signal}} {{observed}} by LIGO also included {{the start of}} the post-merger <b>ringdown,</b> the <b>signal</b> produced as the newly formed compact object settles down to a stationary state. Arguably, the ringdown is the most direct way of observing a black hole. From the LIGO signal it is possible to extract the frequency and damping time of the dominant mode of the ringdown. From these it is possible to infer the mass and angular momentum of the final object, which match independent predictions from numerical simulations of the merger. The frequency and decay time of the dominant mode are determined by the geometry of the photon sphere. Hence, observation of this mode confirms the presence of a photon sphere, however it cannot exclude possible exotic alternatives to black holes that are compact enough to have a photon sphere.|$|R
30|$|In general, the {{analysis}} of mode shape properties can be accomplished using two basic approaches: the eigenanalysis of a small signal model [1], or as shown in this article, signal processing of the time-synchronized measurements. One important advantage of the signal-based method is that the identification {{is dependent on the}} large, complex system model. In this category, the Prony method [2, 3] and the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm [4, 5] are widely used. However, their applications are generally limited only for <b>ringdown</b> <b>signals,</b> which are relatively few in actual power grids. Ambient signals, caused by low-level stochastic disturbances, are more frequently and easily collected in real systems. Some publications have offered algorithms for identifying the modal frequency and damping ratio from ambient data [6 – 9], which fully demonstrate that this kind of signal includes abundant information about the system. Only recently the mode shape has been considered [10 – 14]. Based on the relationship between the cross- and power spectral densities and mode shapes, an approach for estimating the mode shapes using spectral method is presented in [10]. Liu and Venkarasubramanian [11] applied the frequency domain decomposition method to the mode shape identification. Then, the channel matching method was introduced in [12] and refined in [13], in which a narrowband bandpass filter must firstly be used to extract one single mode from multiple modes. In this case, the changes of operation modes in actual power system would inevitably cause the ineffectiveness of the prefixed filter, and influence the estimation accuracy. In [14], the transfer function method was proposed which showed that mode shape could be calculated by evaluating a transfer function, constructed between a pair of system outputs, at the mode of interest. However, as the key factors of transfer function, the selection of model order are not taken into account in these articles, this will directly affect the accuracy of the mode shape analysis results.|$|R
40|$|Oscillations {{in power}} systems are {{triggered}} by {{a wide variety of}} events. The system damps most of the oscillations, but a few undamped oscillations may remain which may lead to system collapse. Therefore low frequency oscillations inspection is necessary in the context of recent power system operation and control. Ringdown portion of the signal provides rich information of the low frequency oscillatory modes which has been taken into analysis. This paper provides a practical case study in which seven signal processing based techniques i. e. Prony Analysis (PA), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), S-Transform (ST), Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD), Estimation of Signal Parameters by Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT), Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) and Matrix Pencil Method (MPM) were presented for estimating the low frequency modes in a given <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal.</b> Preprocessing of the signal is done by detrending. The application of the signal processing techniques is illustrated using actual wide area measurement systems (WAMS) data collected from four different Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) i. e. Dadri, Vindyachal, Kanpur and Moga which are located near the recent disturbance event at the Northern Grid of India. Simulation results show that the seven signal processing technique (FFT, PA, ST, WVD, ESPRIT, HHT and MPM) estimates two common oscillatory frequency modes (0. 2, 0. 5) from the raw signal. Thus, these seven techniques provide satisfactory performance in determining small frequency modes of the signal without losing its valuable property. Also a comparative study of the seven signal processing techniques has been carried out in order to find the best one. It was found that FFT and ESPRIT gives exact frequency modes as compared to other techniques, so they are recommended for estimation of low frequency modes. Further investigations were also carried out to estimate low frequency oscillatory mode with another case study of Eastern Interconnect Phasor Project (EIPP) data with the seven signal processing techniques (FFT, PA, ST, WVD, ESPRIT, HHT and MPM). It was found from the simulation results of EIPP data that two low frequency oscillatory mode (0. 51  Hz, 0. 2  Hz) exist...|$|R
40|$|Standing to mathematics, time {{evolution}} of slightly perturbed black holes {{could be described}} by a superposition of exponentially damped oscillations. Frequencies and damping times shall depend only on {{the parameters of the}} back hole, mass and spin angular momentum, as told by the no-hair theorem. In this work oscillation modes are calculated in the case of perturbed Schwarzschild black holes, i. e. in the spherically symmetric case and without angular momentum. Calculations bring to a wave equation with an effecive potential, whoose analitic can be sketched out by setting boundary conditions. Due to these conditions, these modes are called Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs). An analytic solution is though prohibitive. Other numeric or semi-analytic methods are therefore illustrated, in particular te WKB method is in detail exposed. Finally a solution for the lower order modes is obtained, and the mode's frequencies and damping times depend only on the black hole's mass, and not by the type of perturbation. The analysis is then extended to Kerr black holes with nonnull angular momentum. In this case frequencies depend only on the black hole's mass and angular momentum. By accurately measuring more than one mode, this modes can be compared, and if it turned out that they depend only on two parameters, the no-hair theorem would be verified. Subsequently comparison is done with the results of the GW 150914 event, i. e. the gravitational inspiral-merger-ringdown signal emitted by two black holes and detected by the LIGO interferometers in the states one year ago. The merger of this binary sistem generated a perturbed black hole, and the capted <b>ringdown</b> <b>signal</b> is analysed in search of the dominant quasi-normal modes. Unfortunately GW 150914 does not give strong evidence of this modes, since on the ringdown was observed for a very short lapse of time. Finally, one could ask himself what would be necessary to gain more evidence of these modes. To have more stringent tests, experiments would need a higher signal noise-ratio, and a more massive binary black hole sysyem to merge...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new, powerful method to constrain properties of neutron stars (NSs). We {{show that the}} total mass of GW 170817 provides a reliable constraint on the stellar radius if the merger {{did not result in}} a prompt collapse as suggested by the interpretation of associated electromagnetic emission. The radius R_ 1. 6 of nonrotating NSs with a mass of 1. 6 M_sun can be constrained to be larger than 10. 68 _{- 0. 04 }^{+ 0. 15 } km, and the radius R_max of the nonrotating maximum mass configuration must be larger than 9. 60 _{- 0. 03 }^{+ 0. 14 } km. We point out that detections of future events will further improve these constraints. Moreover, we show that a future event with a signature of a prompt collapse of the merger remnant will establish even stronger constraints on the NS radius from above and the maximum mass M_max of NSs from above. These constraints are particularly robust because they only require a measurement of the chirp mass and a distinction between prompt and delayed collapse of the merger remnant, which may be inferred from the electromagnetic signal or even from the presence/absence of a <b>ringdown</b> gravitational-wave (GW) <b>signal.</b> This prospect strengthens the case of our novel method of constraining NS properties, which is directly applicable to future GW events with accompanying electromagnetic counterpart observations. We emphasize that this procedure is a new way of constraining NS radii from GW detections independent of existing efforts to infer radius information from the late inspiral phase or postmerger oscillations, and it does not require particularly loud GW events.
