5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Tack for Game Informer {{rated the}} game with an 8/10, {{comparing}} it to games such as Dwarf Fortress and Towns, but more accessible and with improved graphics. IGN 's Rowan Kaiser awarded an 8.3/10 score, noting that Banished suffered when the gameplay difficulty was lower, while also making the same comparison to Dwarf Fortress as Game Informer. Kaiser praised Banished for creating difficulty through {{the lack of a}} money resource, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> money as the primary source of difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Martin Wolf, an {{economics}} leader writer with the Financial Times, suggested {{there may be}} advantages in western economies taking a more confrontational approach against China, which in recent years had been {{by far the biggest}} practitioner of competitive devaluation. Though he advised that <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> protectionist measures which may spark a trade war, a better tactic would be to use targeted capital controls against China to prevent them buying foreign assets in order to further devalue the yuan, as previously suggested by Daniel Gros, Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.|$|E

5|$|Most {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} {{did not differ from}} the previous two titles. Wipeout is based on a futuristic anti-gravity setting where pilots would race against each other or computer-controlled AI opponents to finish in the highest position possible. Wipeout gameplay takes inspiration from Formula One parallels; <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force.|$|E
5|$|Planning was {{underway}} for {{the extension of}} SR75 east to the then-proposed SR125 by 1963. The California Highway Commission endorsed the routing for SR75 in 1965 along Otay Mesa Road, away from future residential developments. There were plans as early as 1970 to have a highway heading southwest to a new border crossing that would bypass the Tijuana area. The next year, James Moe, the state public works director, subsequently asked the California State Legislature to lengthen SR75 to connect to this new crossing, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> I-5 to make the connection.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> a turn-based battle {{system like}} {{contemporaneous}} role-playing games, Secret of Mana features real-time battles {{with a power}} bar mechanic. The game has a unique Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions {{in the middle of}} battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop {{in and out of the}} game at any time. Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.|$|E

In his mission {{to create a new}} canon, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest {{was created}} by Yuji Horii, who took {{inspiration}} from previous role-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to a wide audience {{of people who were}} unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general. He tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, as well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre to the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama produced the game's artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music. The North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed RAM save games (<b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> a password save system), modified character sprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.|$|E

In 1094, he performed the same service for Battle Abbey. After the accession of King Henry I of England, John received a confirmation of the grant {{of the city of}} Bath, paying 500 pounds of silver for the verification. In 1102, John secured from King Henry the right to hold fairs at Bath on the feast day of the cathedral's patron saint, Saint Peter. He gave an extensive library to the cathedral at Bath, and eventually the monks there became reconciled to him. John, however, continued to hold most of the old abbey's manors himself, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> them for the support of the monks.|$|E
5|$|In the dry season, {{the gray}} mouse lemur faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to ﬁnd food resources {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and that they seem to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.|$|E
5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure was created by a {{different}} third-party developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, but <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews {{of the first two}} games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles {{completed}} a final {{mix of the}} song on 21 April 1967. Due to the difficulty in getting the two 4-track machines to play {{at exactly the same}} time, only a mono mix was attempted. In October 1968, while preparing the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album for release, EMI's engineers created a mock-stereo (duophonic) mix from this mono mix, instead of returning to the master tapes. For the monaural version of the album, originally available only in the UK, the engineers combined the two channels from the duophonic mix, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> the April 1967 mono mix.|$|E
5|$|The Prince of Egypt was {{released}} on DVD and VHS on September 14, 1999.

However, both the DVD release and the streaming versions used a 35mm print of the film, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> the original files to encode the movie directly to digital.|$|E
5|$|This {{ability of}} Clostridium to metabolize sugars directly, or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs, {{suggests}} that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol-oxidizers like Acetobacter. However, Clostridium bacteria are less acid-tolerant than Acetobacter. Even the most acid-tolerant Clostridium strains can produce vinegar in concentrations {{of only a few}} per cent, compared to Acetobacter strains that can produce vinegar in concentrations up to 20%. At present, it remains more cost-effective to produce vinegar using Acetobacter, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>using</b> Clostridium and concentrating it. As a result, although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940, their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications.|$|E
