5000|$|A <b>Riser</b> <b>clamp</b> is {{a device}} used by {{mechanical}} building trades to support vertical runs of piping at each floor level. The devices are placed around the pipe and integral fasteners are then tightened to clamp {{them onto the}} pipe. The friction between the pipe and riser transfers {{the weight of the}} pipe through the riser to the building structure. Risers are generally located at floor penetrations, particularly for continuous floor slabs such as concrete. They may also be located at some other interval as dictated by local building codes or at intermediate intervals to support plumbing which has been altered or repaired. Heavier piping types such as cast iron require more frequent support. Ordinarily, riser clamps are made of carbon steel and individually sized to fit certain pipe sizes. The term [...] "riser" [...] is typically used to refer to vertical runs of pipes, electrical conduit and tubes.|$|E
40|$|Corrosion in {{pipe work}} is a major problem. While most plants have {{reliable}} information on most equipment, the least data available is always {{with respect to their}} piping. Significant portions of plant piping and pipelines are insulated or buried and hence, even external corrosion cannot be readily observed. Ultrasonic guided waves in the pipe wall provide an attractive solution as the waves are excited from one location of the pipe and travel meters of distance, with the returning echoes indicating the presence of corrosion or other pipe features. The Wavemaker Pipe Screening System (WPSS) developed by Guided Ultrasonics Limited exploits this benefit of Ultrasonic Guided Waves and has been deployed successfully {{on a wide range of}} application for screening of pipes for corrosion. An offshore operator had got Escon to inspect several risers and tests were conducted on a mock-up sample prior to the commencement of field inspection. The initial focus was the assessment of the inaccessible region under the <b>riser</b> <b>clamp.</b> The inspection subsequently focused not only on the <b>riser</b> <b>clamp</b> region but at the whole length of the riser with several defects found at welds, supports, interfaces etc. This paper provides an overview of the technique, the methodology adopted to implement the tool at actual conditions offshore & other proven applications for the technique...|$|E
40|$|When an {{offshore}} oil field completed {{and put into}} production, new subsea pipelines and the new cable need to be established. Cable protection pipe clamp is used to fix cable protection pipe on the jacket. In {{order to avoid the}} problem of traditional steel structure clamp splice, counterpoint, fastening difficulty when installed cable protection pipe under water, reduce the risk and workload of under water, This paper develop a new type of portable connecting <b>riser</b> <b>clamp</b> -“backpack clamp” which solve the riser cable protection pipe difficult underwater installation problem. The main structure of backpack clamp used three valves type structure. The load characteristic of a clamping device was determined by the Morison equation which was a classical theory. Clamp device underwater mechanics analysis model was established. The minimum tension pre-tightening force was determined. The results show that the strength of the base meets the requirements after strength analysis with finite element analysis method, stability and strength experiments, which means the clamp based on resin matrix composite is feasible...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThis master {{thesis is}} {{written on the}} University of Stavanger spring 2011 in {{collaboration}} with Subsea 7. When transporting hydrocarbons from seabed to top side on a jacket platform {{there is always the}} need of a riser. Risers are attached to the platform leg or bracing by means of riser clamps. The riser loads together with environmental forces transfers large stresses to the clamps. To ensure that the clamps can withstand these loads over the design life, several analyses have to be performed. This thesis covers the design methodology and the most important analyses using a FE (Finite Element) tool, on one of the clamps designed by Subsea 7 for the Ekofisk 2 / 4 -B platform. Basically three analyses are performed; ULS (Ultimate Limit State) stress check and FLS (Fatigue Limit State) check for the clamp and the bolts, in addition to a non-linear slippage analysis. The action loads from the riser are given by the jacket operator. The environmental forces on the riser and the clamps are calculated to find the largest load combination in the horizontal- and vertical direction. For the various analyses different load- and material factors are applied to the forces. The worst load combination is applied in the analysis which is conducted in ANSYS, FE tool. The linear FE analysis has to be setup correctly to obtain good results. The results for the ULS stress check are in general within allowable limits, i. e. below design yield. There is however some peak stresses in local areas that are above design yield. Common practice is to conduct a non-linear analysis and check if the peak stresses are due to secondary effects. To disregard the secondary effects the plastic strain obtained in the non-linear analysis have to be insignificant. The results obtained indicate that the peak stresses are due to secondary effects, hence the clamp meets the requirements for the ULS criteria. In the FLS check three hot spots is checked including a weld. Stress ranges are obtained from the cyclical loads and the number of cycles during the design life calculated. The fatigue damage factor found shall not exceed the fatigue utilization factor calculated for the clamp. This ensures that the clamp will avoid fatigue damage in the design life. It is shown that welds are more fragile to fatigue than plated structures. Regardless all the hot spots are within allowable limits. The slippage analysis is performed to find out if there is enough statically friction force in the <b>riser</b> <b>clamp</b> to avoid the clamp from sliding. The clamping force is depended of the bolt pre-tension. Too much tension can cause to high pressure on the jacket leg causing it to buckle and too low tension can cause the clamp to slip. The results show that there are sufficient sticking elements in the clamp to avoid slippage. Subsea...|$|E
