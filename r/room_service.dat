5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, <b>Room</b> <b>Service,</b> significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made {{it a lot easier}} to record the album.

Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses against the windows, and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E
5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} bragged about dating three women on the bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified that her father had talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for <b>room</b> <b>service.</b> She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{received}} no {{support from the}} Lakers front office, aside from a single call {{the day after the}} fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of hate mail filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order <b>room</b> <b>service</b> when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son {{at the time of the}} punch. His wife recalls her and the children being treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife, and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act.

5|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor of the west wing housed the dining <b>room,</b> <b>service</b> areas and led through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The service area was fitted with a {{mezzanine}} floor to provide sleeping facilities for male servants; the sleeping quarters for female servants were {{on the top floor of}} the mansion to keep the two sexes a good distance away from each other. On the same level, the east wing had a study with ante-room set in the northwest corner, a boudoir, two drawing rooms and a billiard room. An expansive library, divided into sections by pillars, was between the boudoir and study, beside the large bay window. The first floor, accessed via the main staircase positioned within the entrance hall, had all the family bedrooms, and featured balconies. Hip baths were carried to the bedrooms each evening as no bathrooms were incorporated. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where the majority of the mansion's furnishings and fittings were crafted from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top floor beside the female servant accommodation. Around thirty rooms made up the basement, among them a smoking room where editions of Punch and The Illustrated London News were supplied as reading material. The remaining rooms on the basement level were workshops, wine cellars and individual parlours for the butler, housekeeper and other principal servants, together with general storerooms.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{has started}} {{spending}} more time with Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) because Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) keeps trying to rope Jim into having an affair. During the night at the hotel, Cathy asks to hang out for a while in Jim's room under the pretext that the heat in her room is malfunctioning. She repeatedly makes seductive signals, making Jim uncomfortable, so he calls Dwight saying he has bed bugs. Dwight arrives and forces Cathy off Jim's bed so he can lure out the bed bugs with his nearly naked body. This fails to sufficiently disgust Cathy, who merely steps into the bathroom to take a shower until Dwight leaves. Cathy gets out of the shower wearing only a bath robe. After ordering some desserts from <b>room</b> <b>service</b> and asking Jim to touch her legs, he finally comes out saying that he is happily married, and {{does not want to be}} with her. Cathy gets defensive and insists that she did not have any romantic intentions whatsoever, so Jim relents, but Cathy immediately resumes her seductive technique. After Jim goes to the bathroom, he comes out to find her in only her underwear under his blanket. Fed up, he demands that she leave and lets Dwight, armed with spray chemicals, into the room. Jim claims to see a bed bug near Cathy, making her flee from Dwight's spraying. However, because of the chemicals, Dwight suggests Jim sleep in Cathy's room. Jim instead spends the night with Dwight in his room, eating Cathy's desserts and watching TV, while a drunken Nellie is outside, trying unsuccessfully to get in.|$|E
