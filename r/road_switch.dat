50|$|Shortly {{following}} {{creation of}} the Seaboard System railroad from the Family Lines conglomerate, the tracks between Elba and Clintonville were abandoned. The last train movement over {{this portion of the}} branch line occurred in 1984. By 1985, the abandoned portion was removed from SBD timetables. As a result of this abandonment and corporate reorganization, the subdivision was placed under the Jacksonville division in 1985, with the remainder of the branch being designated the Enterprise subdivision as Elba was no longer served by the railroad. Under the Seaboard System, the northbound local was numbered 742, with the return trip to Dothan via Waterford numbered 743. The Seaboard System designated the branch as an industrial spur, protected by a derail at Waterford. This exempted the local train operating the line from timetable and train order authority while on the branch and allowed free movement to work various industries along the subdivision. A local <b>road</b> <b>switch</b> engine was maintained at Enterprise through much of the 1980s in order to service local industries within the city limits and to lighten the workload for the daily local turn that operated over the branch.|$|E
50|$|While LRT {{requires}} a simple rail <b>road</b> <b>switch,</b> monorail {{requires a}} complicated switching system. Vuchic (2007) finds the switching issue on monorail {{as one of}} the main limitations. Other than extremely higher costs ranging to 15 times of a regular switch, he suggest that large areas are required compared to a regular switch, which shows that the urban foot print advantage for monorails is not constant for all systems. He further reason out that the switching issues are the reasons monorails operate as single lines and that it is very complex to plan for network of monorails.further it creates an operational concern as it is essential a segments of concrete beams that are mechanically moved into place, which takes 15-25 seconds in contrasts to 0.6 second switch time for conventional rail which will escalate the cost of construction while such complex switching process is not needed in a LRT System. More the number of lines interconnecting more the switching will be complex and the associated cost where as in the proposed system in locations such as Fort, Maradana and Borella will have more than 3 lines interconnecting.|$|E
