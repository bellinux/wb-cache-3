5000|$|Another {{important}} {{advantage is}} that the sequencing reactions are non-progressive; after each reading of the probe, the probe and anchor are removed and a new anchor and probe set are added.

[...] It also reduces the use of expensive probes, since DNA nanoball sequencing does not necessitate the probe ligation reaction to be run to completion.|$|E

50|$|There are {{limitations}} to measuring power with inexpensive wattmeters, or indeed with any meters {{not designed for}} low-power measurements. This particularly affects low power (e.g. under 10 watts), as used in standby; readings may be so inaccurate as to be useless (although they do confirm that standby power is low, rather than high). The difficulty {{is largely due to}} difficulty in accurate measurement of the alternating current, rather than voltage, and the relatively little need for low-power measurements. The specification for the meter should specify the <b>reading</b> <b>error</b> for different situations. For a typical plug-in meter the error in wattage is stated as ±5% of measured value ±10 W (e.g., a measured value of 100W may be wrong by 5% of 100 W plus 10 W, i.e., ±15 W, or 85-115 W); and the error in kW·h is stated as ±5% of measured value ±0.1 kW·h. If a laptop computer in sleep mode consumes 5 W, the meter may read anything from 0 to 15.25 W, without taking into account errors due to non-sinusoidal waveform. In practice accuracy can be improved by connecting a fixed load such as an incandescent light bulb, adding the device in standby, and using the difference in power consumption. This moves the measurement out of the problematic low-power zone.|$|E

40|$|For both {{clinical}} and research purposes, biopsies {{are used to}} classify liver damage known as fibrosis on an ordinal multi-state scale ranging from no damage to cirrhosis. Misclassification can arise from <b>reading</b> <b>error</b> (misreading of a specimen) or sampling error (the specimen does not accurately represent the liver). Studies of biopsy accuracy have not attempted to synthesize these two sources of error or to estimate actual misclassification rates from either source. Using data from two studies of <b>reading</b> <b>error</b> and two of sampling error, we find surprisingly large possible misclassification rates, including a greater than 50 % chance of misclassification for one intermediate stage of fibrosis. We find that some readers tend to misclassify consistently low or consistently high, and some specimens tend to be misclassified low while others tend to be misclassified high. Non-invasive measures of liver fibrosis have generally been evaluated by comparison to simultaneous biopsy results, but biopsy appears to be too unreliable {{to be considered a}} gold standard. Non-invasive measures may therefore be more useful than such comparisons suggest. Both stochastic uncertainty and uncertainty about our model assumptions appear to be substantial. Improved studies of biopsy accuracy would include large numbers of both readers and specimens, greater effort to reduce or eliminate <b>reading</b> <b>error</b> in studies of sampling error, and careful estimation of misclassification rates rather than less useful quantities such as kappa statistics. ...|$|E

This study evaluated {{the use of a}} novel app for tablets (MD_evReader) developed as a reading aid for individuals with a central field loss resulting from macular degeneration. The MD_evReader app scrolls text as single lines (similar to a news ticker) and is intended to enhance reading performance using the eccentric viewing technique by both reducing the demands on the eye movement system and minimising the deleterious effects of perceptual crowding. Reading performance with scrolling text was compared with reading static sentences, also presented on a tablet computer. Methods: Twenty-six people with low vision (diagnosis of macular degeneration) read static or dynamic text (scrolled from right to left), presented as a single line at high contrast on a tablet device. <b>Reading</b> <b>error</b> rates and comprehension were recorded for both text formats, and the participant’s subjective experience of reading with the app was assessed using a simple questionnaire. Results: The average reading speed for static and dynamic text was not significantly different and equal to or greater than 85 words per minute. The comprehension scores for both text formats were also similar, equal to approximately 95 % correct. However, <b>reading</b> <b>error</b> rates were significantly (p= 0. 02) less for dynamic text than for static text. The participants’ questionnaire ratings of their reading experience with the MD_evReader were highly positive and indicated a preference for reading with this app compared with their usual method. Conclusions: Our data show that reading performance with scrolling text is at least equal to that achieved with static text and in some respects (<b>reading</b> <b>error</b> rate) is better than static text. Bespoke apps informed by an understanding of the underlying sensorimotor processes involved in a cognitive task such as reading have excellent potential as aids for people with visual impairments...|$|E
