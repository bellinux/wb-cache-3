5000|$|Promoters, {{such as a}} Roth IRA broker of a self-directed IRA LLC, {{or small}} {{business}} financing, aggressively market IRS ROBS arrangements to prospective entrepreneurs and business owners for funding for a business as small business financing. In the case of most ROBS facilitators, {{there is a very}} close relationship between the promoter/facilitator and the franchise industry, seeking to sell and promote business [...] "opportunities" [...] and seeking funding sources for these sales and promotions. Most ROBS [...] "promoters" [...] and facilitators pay substantial <b>referral</b> <b>fees</b> to the franchise brokers who refer business to the promoters. Rarely are these fees disclosed to the entrepreneur. Fees charged by most [...] "promoters," [...] consequently, are in excess of the fees that would be charged by attorneys and accountants for the same services who are prohibited from paying <b>referral</b> <b>fees.</b> Some companies offering ROBS plans do not pay <b>referral</b> <b>fees</b> to brokers, and charge lower fees as a result. There remains a substantial question whether such <b>referral</b> <b>fees</b> are illegal under ERISA and the U.S. Criminal Code: Offer, Acceptance, or Solicitation to Influence Operations of Employee Benefit Plan (18 U.S.C. Section 1954).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the controversial issue of <b>referral</b> <b>fees</b> for personal injury claims. It {{looks at the}} function of <b>referral</b> <b>fees</b> in the civil justice system, {{their relationship to the}} guarantees of access to court and the right to seek legal assistance in ECHR Art 6, and the debate about promoting access to justice or a litigious society. It {{examines the}} experience of the <b>referral</b> <b>fees</b> market in England and Wales, where the costs of referrals have risen dramatically and there is concern that referrers are auctioning their customers to the highest bidder rather than helping them find competent lawyers. Sir Rupert Jackson recommended banning <b>referral</b> <b>fees</b> in his report on the costs of civil litigation, and the Government has announced it will implement this recommendation. The paper considers the potential effects of a ban on competition in the legal services market and its compatibility with UK and EU competition law. The paper argues that a combination of better regulation of the industry and proper regulation of costs rules is a better and more proportionate way of controlling legal costs and the quality of legal services than an outright ban. While <b>referral</b> <b>fees</b> have not delivered all the benefits one would expect from a for-profit independent referrals service, they can help people obtain information about their legal rights, and competent lawyers to enforce them. This service is particularly valuable given that the state has substantially cut public funding of the civil justice system in recent years. © 2011 The Author.

50|$|VWS sells {{furniture}} from several independent Vermont woodworking businesses, {{as well as}} from larger wholesale companies. The company seeks to promote Vermont's custom furniture industry by unifying marketing efforts for its producers.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a dynamic model of network marketing in a small-world network structure artificially constructed similarly to the Watts-Strogatz network model. Different {{from the traditional}} marketing, consumers can also {{play the role of}} the manufacturer's selling agents in network marketing, which is stimulated by the <b>referral</b> <b>fee</b> the manufacturer offers. As the wiring probability α is increased from zero to unity, the network changes from the one-dimensional regular directed network to the star network where all but one player are connected to one consumer. The price p of the product and the <b>referral</b> <b>fee</b> r are used as free parameters to maximize the profit of the manufacturer. It is observed that at α= 0 the maximized profit is constant independent of the network size N while at α≠ 0, it increases linearly with N. This is in parallel to the small-world transition. It is also revealed that while the optimal value of p stays at an almost constant level in a broad range of α, that of r is sensitive to a change in the network structure. The consumer surplus is also studied and discussed. Comment: 12 pages, to appear in Physica...|$|E
