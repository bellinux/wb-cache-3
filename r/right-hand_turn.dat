5|$|Following {{the course}} of the {{enlarged}} South Drain, a lock raised the level of the canal at Shapwick, while the Drain turned off to run parallel to the canal but to its north. The railway ran between the two waterways, crossing to {{the south side of the}} canal immediately after the single arched aqueduct and syphon over the South Drain. The remains of the three-arched aqueduct and syphon over the River Brue are still visible, near the old railway bridge, and from there the canal headed towards Glastonbury, passing the Ham Wall and Street Heath nature reserves and making a sharp <b>right-hand</b> <b>turn</b> just before its terminal basin, which was located near the old Glastonbury and Street railway station.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final <b>right-hand</b> <b>turn</b> that leads back into the station.|$|E
5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a <b>right-hand</b> <b>turn</b> as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E

25|$|An early downpour of rain {{saturated}} {{the road}} and made for dangerous conditions {{for many of the}} early riders. Reigning world time trial champion (and winner of the Prologue time trial) Fabian Cancellara had extreme difficulty negotiating a <b>right-hand</b> <b>turn</b> around the 30km mark and lost most of his speed, before eventually crashing and losing a great deal of time. Others also fell at this turn.|$|E
25|$|NY371 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY415 {{in the center}} of the village of Cohocton, located in a valley surrounding the Cohocton River. At this junction, southbound traffic continuing straight will proceed onto NY415 south while NY415 north is accessed by way of a <b>right-hand</b> <b>turn.</b> The route heads northeastward from NY415 as a two-lane highway, leaving Cohocton's central business district for a more residential area of the small village. After just one block, the homes give way to open, undeveloped areas as NY371 crosses over the Cohocton River and exits the village limits.|$|E
25|$|Palenville, a small hamlet at {{the eastern}} edge of the Catskill Escarpment, is marked by a traffic light at the {{northern}} end of NY32A, a connector that shortens the trip to the Hunter–Tannersville area for those coming south on the New York State Thruway (Interstate87). Just past the junction is Rowena Memorial School, a local landmark. Going further east, NY23A crosses much gentler but still largely undeveloped terrain as it traverses the town of Catskill. It reaches NY32 itself at an undeveloped intersection prior to crossing Kaaterskill Creek and the Thruway near the grades of an abandoned interchange. From the Thruway, it heads generally northeastward through a small valley to the western edge of the village of Catskill, where it ends at a junction with US9W. Southbound US9W is accessed by a <b>right-hand</b> <b>turn,</b> while northbound US9W is straight ahead.|$|E
50|$|The Parclo A4 {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular designs, as all {{movements}} from the arterial road to the entrance ramps are made by <b>right-hand</b> <b>turns,</b> providing for a safer entrance to the freeway by eliminating left-hand turns into opposing traffic (which require queues waiting to make such turns). This also makes logical sense since freeways have a higher capacity than arterials and right-turn ramps serve effectively to absorb capacity and reduce traffic on the arterial.|$|R
5000|$|Highway 26 between Owen Sound and Meaford in {{the west}} is not as highly {{traveled}} as the tourist areas to the east. It is also not a very straight route, as the highway makes four <b>right-hand</b> <b>turns</b> at signalled intersections, including the junction with Simcoe Road 27 (formerly Highway 27) north of Barrie (which is not signalled), the intersection with Simcoe Roads 91 and 42 in Stayner, Hume Street in eastern Collingwood, and High street in western Collingwood.|$|R

25|$|At 4:45 AM on 3 October, Flagship New England {{left the}} gate and was {{initially}} cleared to depart from runway 30; however, apparently unfavorable wind conditions prompted Stephenville Air Traffic Control to clear it for runway 07 instead. Overcast skies blocked out light from the moon and stars, rendering the terrain ahead unlit. Flights departing from runway 07 were supposed to make a <b>right-hand</b> <b>turn</b> immediately after take-off {{so as to avoid}} hilly terrain in line with the runway. However, the pilots of Flagship New England instead allowed the aircraft to continue going straight ahead after lifting off. At about 5:03 AM, some seven miles {{from the end of the}} runway, the aircraft hit a ridge at an elevation of about 1,160 feet and crashed, killing everyone on board. The investigation into the accident indicated the pilots' failure to change course, which led the aircraft across terrain over which sufficient clearance could not be gained, led to the crash.|$|E

500|$|The final loop of {{the race}} {{followed}} the same roads as before, east out of Huy and then south-west to the Côte d'Ereffe, climbed with [...] remaining. After this climb, however, the route turned north {{to take a more}} direct route to Huy, though some of the same roads were used. Within the town, the riders were faced with a slightly different route and a climb new to the 2015 edition {{of the race}}, the Côte de Cherave. The roads before the climb were narrow and twisting, with a level crossing {{at the foot of the}} climb. The hill itself was [...] in length with an average gradient of 8.1%; the steepest section came in the first part.

The train then descends [...] down the first drop into the first inversion, a {{right-handed}} corkscrew. The train then navigates a right-handed, 270-degree downward helix that features 90 degree banking. Then the train rises up into the second inversion, a zero-g roll, where riders experience the feeling of weightlessness. It then makes a 180-degree right-handed stall turn into the third inversion, a vertical loop. After a left stall turn the train enters the second corkscrew. The train then passes through an underground tunnel, and through one more 180-degree turn, before being stopped by the brake run and returning to the station.|$|E
500|$|The Mexico City ePrix was {{confirmed}} {{as part of}} Formula E's 2016–17 series schedule in September 2016 by the FIA World Motor Sport Council. It was the fourth of twelve scheduled single-seater electric car races of the 2016–17 season, the second running of the event, and was held on 1 April 2017 at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez. The event was contested by ten teams of two drivers each. The teams were e.Dams-Renault, Audi Sport ABT, Virgin, Dragon, Mahindra, Venturi, Andretti, Techeetah, NextEV and Jaguar. The ePrix was the only race of the season that took place on a permanent race track which consists of a mixture between the Grand Prix and oval layouts and is [...] long with 17 corners. The circuit underwent changes following the previous year's running of the race with the first corner altered to become a <b>right-hand</b> <b>turn</b> and the final chicane was modified to prevent drivers from short-cutting the corner {{in order to gain}} an advantage.|$|E

40|$|Complex animals display bilaterally {{asymmetric}} motor behavior, or "motor handedness," often {{revealed by}} preferential use of limbs on one side. For example, use of right limbs is dominant {{in a strong}} majority of humans. While the mechanisms that establish bilateral asymmetry in motor function are unknown in humans, {{they appear to be}} distinct from those for other handedness asymmetries, including bilateral visceral organ asymmetry, brain laterality, and ocular dominance. We report here that a simple, genetically homogeneous animal comprised of only ~ 1000 somatic cells, the nematode C. elegans, also shows a distinct motor handedness preference: on a population basis, males show a pronounced <b>right-hand</b> <b>turning</b> bias during mating. The handedness bias persists through much of adult lifespan, suggesting that, as in more complex animals, it is an intrinsic trait of each individual, which can differ from the population mean. Our observations imply that the laterality of motor handedness preference in C. elegans is driven by epigenetic factors rather than by genetic variation. The preference for <b>right-hand</b> <b>turns</b> is also seen in animals with mirror-reversed anatomical handedness and is not attributable to stochastic asymmetric loss of male sensory rays that occurs by programmed cell death. As with C. elegans, we also observed a substantial handedness bias, though not necessarily the same preference in direction, in several gonochoristic Caenorhabditis species. These findings indicate that the independence of bilaterally asymmetric motor dominance from overall anatomical asymmetry, and a population-level tendency away from ambidexterity, occur even in simple invertebrates, suggesting that these may be common features of bilaterian metazoans...|$|R
500|$|Landing was {{originally}} planned on the [...] Runway 31. Difficulties in controlling the aircraft made lining up almost impossible.

When they came out they were instead lined up with the shorter (6,888ft) and closed Runway 22, and had little capacity to maneuver. Fire trucks had been placed on Runway 22, anticipating a landing on nearby Runway 31, so all the vehicles were quickly moved out of the way before the plane touched down. Runway 22 had been permanently closed a year earlier in 1988.|$|R
