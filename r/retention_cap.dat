Nevertheless, wildlife management lacks both a carefully developed and tested translocation guide and methods. We evaluated conditions of release method (time of release and retention of animals) that affect short-term settlement of translocated ground squirrels in the central region of Hungary. In a field experiment, we translocated 117 individuals from an international airport to a protected site in 2000. We found that release time should precede the animals' natural, daily activity peak. The use of <b>retention</b> <b>caps</b> combined with artificial burrows instead of complex acclimation cages works successfully to prevent animals from dispersing from the release site...|$|R

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar e comparar a capacidade retentiva entre dois sistemas O-ring e O-SO (Grupo I) e dois sistemas ERA - cápsulas de retenção cinza e brancas - (Grupo II), em função simulada, com ciclos de inserção e remoção, do início, 6 meses, 1, 2, 3, 4 e 5 anos depois. Dois implantes do tipo Brånemark foram fixados em duas bases metálicas trapezoidais, sendo os testes de inserção e remoção feitos numa máquina de costura ajustada para este propósito, usando um sistema de correias e polias, movendo um virabrequim. Uma platina de delineador foi usada para fixação dos corpos de prova às bases metálicas na máquina de costura. Os testes de resistência ao movimento axial das cápsulas por tensão foram feitos numa máquina de ensaios {{universal}} em períodos de tempo pré-estabelecidos, antes e após o término do ciclo na máquina de costura. Baseado nos resultados, esse estudo pôde concluir que houve perda de retenção de todos os sistemas testados, porém o sistema ERA apresentou, desde o início, maior retenção quando comparado aos outros sistemas e a cápsula cinza mostrou o melhor resultado no final da simulação. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate and compare the retentive capacity between two O-ring and O-SO system (Group I), and two ERA system types - white and gray <b>retention</b> <b>caps</b> - (Group II), respectively, in simulated function in database, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years later, with insertion and removal cycles. Two Brånemark implants were fixed in two trapezoidal metallic bases for the tests. Removal and insertion tests were done in a sewing machine, adjusted for this purpose using a belt and a pulley system, moving a steel crankshaft. A delineator platinum hold was used for body trial fixation to the metallic base of the sewing machine. Resistance test to axial movement of the caps by tension was done in a Universal test machine in an established period of time, before and after the cycle accomplishments in the adapted sewing machine. Based on the results, this study concludes that all the attachment systems tested showed retention loss during the experiment; the ERA system showed, since the beginning, higher retention compared to the other systems and the gray colored attachment showed the best result in the end of the simulated use test...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the silicon cap layer thickness on channel carrier confinement in silicon/strained silicon-germanium (Si/SiGe) MOS structures. The thickness of the silicon cap layer is controlled using etching in a moderated RCA self-terminating chemical oxide followed by rapid thermal oxidation. The resulting cap layer thickness is measured using cross-section TEM. The threshold voltages for inversion of carriers at the SiO 2 /Si and at the Si/SiGe interface are extracted as a function of Si cap thickness. The transition from dual to single channel operation in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices at room temperature with thinning of the silicon cap layer is observed with capacitance-voltage measurements in accumulation. Our analysis suggests that about 1 nm of silicon <b>cap</b> <b>retention</b> is integral for minimising the gate induced parasitic channel and de-coupling of the oxide interface trap influence on the channel carriers in the SiGe. 1...|$|R
40|$|Mating {{success in}} plants {{depends largely on}} the {{efficiency}} of pollen dispersal. For hermaphrodite plants, self-pollination, either within or among flowers, can reduce mating opportunities because of pollen and ovule discounting and inbreeding depression. Self-pollination may be particularly detrimental in plants such as orchids and asclepiads that package each flower’s pollen into one or more pollinia which, together with accessory structures, comprise a pollinarium. Darwin proposed that physical reconfiguration of pollinaria serves as a mechanism for reducing the likelihood of self-pollination. To be effective, the time taken for pollinarium reconfiguration would need to exceed that spent by a pollinator on a plant. We investigated pollinarium reconfiguration (including pollinarium bending, pollinium shrinking and anther <b>cap</b> <b>retention)</b> in 19 species and found a strong positive relationship between reconfiguration time and the duration of pollinator visits. Reconfiguration times were also consistently longer than pollinator visit times. These results provide strong support for Darwin’s idea that this mechanism promotes cross-pollination. Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of suspended {{dust in the}} Martian atmosphere, and its return to the planet's surface, is implicated {{in the formation of}} the polar layered terrain and the dichotomy in perennial CO 2 polar <b>cap</b> <b>retention</b> in the two hemispheres. A three dimensional model was used to study Martian global dust storms. The model accounts for the interactive feedbacks between the atmospheric thermal and dynamical states and an evolving radiatively active suspended dust load. Results from dust storm experiments, as well as from simulations in which there is interest in identifying the conditions under which surface dust lifting occurs at various locations and times, indicate that dust transport due to atmospheric eddy motions is likely to be important in the arrival of suspended dust at polar latitudes. The layered terrain in both polar regions of Mars is interpreted as the reality of cyclical episodes of volatile (CO 2, H 2 O) and dust deposition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the {{pollination}} biology of the large (c. 230 species) African orchid genus, Eulophia. Here we report the discovery of pollination by flower chafer beetles (Cetoniinae; Scarabaeidae) in two color forms of E. ensata and in E. welwitschii. Both species have congested, capitate inflorescences, traits that are generally associated with pollination by flower chafer beetles in Eulophia and other plant genera. Pollinarium reconfiguration, including pollinarium bending and anther <b>cap</b> <b>retention,</b> in these beetle-pollinated species is slow. Such slow reconfiguration is predicted by Darwin's hypothesis to be a mechanism that limits geitonogamous self-pollination by slow moving beetles. A breeding system experiment conducted on E. welwitschii showed that this species, like most others in the genus, is self-compatible, but is dependent on pollinators for fruit set. As all Eulophia species are non-rewarding, the basis of attraction of beetles to flowers of the study species seems to be the generalized resemblance of their inflorescence in terms of flower arrangement and color to the capitula of sympatric rewarding Asteraceae that are utilized as food or rendezvous sites (or both) by flower chafer beetles...|$|R
40|$|Calcium phosphate–induced renal {{epithelial}} {{injury and}} stone formation: Involvement of reactive oxygen species. BackgroundCrystal formation and retention are critical events {{for the formation}} of kidney stones. Oxalate and calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals are injurious to renal epithelium, and membranes of injured cells promote crystal adherence and <b>retention.</b> Calcium phosphate (<b>CaP)</b> is the most common crystal in both urine and stones, most likely to form in the early segments of the nephron and can nucleate CaOx in a metastable solution. We hypothesized that CaP can also injure the renal epithelial cells. MethodsWe exposed proximal tubular origin line derived from pig proximal tubules (LLC-PK 1), and collecting duct origin Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines to various concentrations of Brushite (Br) crystals and investigated staining with Trypan Blue and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium as an indicator of injury. In order to determine the involvement of reactive oxygen species, we also measured LDH release in the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and 8 -isoprostane (8 -IP) {{in the presence of the}} catalase. ResultsExposure to Br crystals was associated with LDH release by both cell types, induced the production of H 2 O 2 and 8 -IP. Presence of SOD and catalase reduced LDH release as well as staining with trypan blue. Catalase was also associated with reduced production of H 2 O 2 and 8 -IP. ConclusionBrushite crystals are injurious to cells of both the proximal tubules as well as collecting ducts. Injury is mediated by reactive oxygen species. We propose that CaP crystals can independently interact with renal epithelium, promote sites for crystal attachment, and then either grow into mature CaP stones or create sites for CaOx crystal nucleation, retention, and stone development...|$|R
40|$|Hydrophobic organic {{contaminants}} (HOCs) often {{reside in}} sediments sorbed to particles, most tightly to particles with high content of organic carbon. If persistent, such pollutants can accumulate in the sediment {{for many years}} and constitute a contamination risk for sediment-living organisms and organisms at higher trophic levels, including humans. Since traditional remediation techniques are associated with complications (e. g. release of contaminants during dredging operations, disturbance of benthic faunal communities), or constraints (handling of large amounts of contaminated sediment and water, limitations due to depth and size of the area, high costs), {{there is a need for}} new alternative methods. In situ remediation through thin-layer capping (a few centimeter cover) with a sorbing material such as activated carbon (AC) has been proposed as an alternative remediation method. Compared to traditional remediation techniques, AC amendment in a thin layer means less material handling and lower costs and is assumed to be less disruptive to benthic communities. The objectives of this thesis were to investigate the ecological effects from thin layer capping as well as the efficiency in contaminant <b>retention.</b> Thin layer <b>capping</b> amended with AC proved to reduce availability of HOCs to the tested organisms, the gastropod Nassarius nitidus (Paper II), the clam Abra nitida (Paper III) and to polychaete worms  (Paper II and III). The remediation technique also decreased the sediment-to-water fluxes of the contaminants (Paper II and III). However, AC amended thin-layer capping was also found to cause negative biological effects. In laboratory studies with only a few species the negative effects were minor, or difficult to discern with the endpoints used (Paper II and III). In a larger multi-species mesocosm (boxcore) study, on the other hand, the negative effects were more prominent (Paper I) and in a large scale field study the benthic community was found to be profoundly disturbed by the AC amendment, with the effects persisting or even worsening ca one year (14 months) post amendment (Paper IV). At the time of the doctoral defence the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Manuscript; Paper 4 : Manuscript. CarbocapOpticapThin...|$|R
40|$|The {{orchid family}} is {{renowned for its}} {{enormous}} diversity of pollination mechanisms and unusually high occurrence of non-rewarding flowers compared to other plant families. We investigated the pollination biology of Cymbidium lancifolium during 2005 and 2006 in the Yachang Nature Reserve, Guangxi Province, SW China. Our observations showed that Apis cerana cerana (Hymenopterous, Apidae) was the only pollinator. The bee directly landed on the mid-lobe, then adjusted its direction and entered into the flower. When it found no rewards in the flower, it would exit from the flower with the hind legs forcibly grasping the mid-lobe. The pollinaria together with the anther cap adhered to the thorax by the viscidium during the retreating process of the bees. The pollinator stayed for 8 – 71 s in the flower {{with an average of}} 18. 3 s (N = 11). It is likely that C. lancifolium attracted the bee by the purplish chestnut spots on the labellum (false nectar guides) exploiting the foraging preference of bees. The anther cap that remained {{on the back of the}} pollinator blocked the pollinaria from being received by the subsequently visited flower. The height of the anther cap (0. 154 ± 0. 032 cm) (N = 10) together with thorax of the pollinator (2005 : 0. 37 ± 0. 03 cm (N = 10), 2006 : 0. 35 ± 0. 04 cm (N = 7)) was higher than the entrance of the flower (0. 29 ± 0. 04 cm) (N = 21), suggesting a possibility of anther <b>cap</b> <b>retention</b> for geitonogamy. The reproductive success in the population was respectively 21. 13 % and 21. 28 % in 2005 and 2006. Breeding experiments showed that C. lancifolium was self-compatible and there was no significant difference in reproductive success between self-pollination and cross-pollination. There was neither apomixes nor spontaneous autogamy. The pollination success of this species was dependent on pollinators. The viability of seed by TTC was estimated as 85. 78 % (N = 11), and it was not considered to be the key limiting factor for seed germination. Therefore, it is suggested that other factors, such as the density of the pollinators and their pollination frequency, influence the fruit set and maintenance of the populationof C. lancifolium...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Orchids {{provide a}} model system for {{addressing}} evolutionary and ecological questions {{both because of}} their species diversity, and because the packaging of their pollen into pollinia facilitates the estimation {{of male and female}} pollination success. This thesis focuses on the ecology and evolution of pollination systems in the African orchid genus Eulophia, with an emphasis on deceptive pollination, mechanisms promoting cross-pollination, and pollinatordriven speciation. Pollination in the deceptive species E. zeyheriana is shown to depend on flower colour and proximity to the rewarding model species, Wahlenbergia cuspidata (Campanulacae). This study demonstrates the functional importance of colour matching between model and mimic in a floral Batesian mimicry system, as well as the importance of facilitation by the rewarding model [chapter 2]. The pollinaria of the vast majority of Eulophia and Acrolophia species undergo reconfiguration following removal by pollinators, similar to the phenomena first described by Darwin in some European orchids and which he hypothesised to be adaptations to limit pollinator mediated self-pollination. In chapter 3, a less common mechanism – anther <b>cap</b> <b>retention</b> – is described for E. foliosa. Observations of reconfiguration times were compared to the respective visit times by pollinators in a number of orchids (including Eulophia and Acrolophia) and asclepiads. In 18 of 19 species, pollinarium reconfiguration times exceed the average visit times, providing empirical support for Darwin’s cross-pollination hypothesis [chapter 4]. All of the 25 species of Eulophia examined are deceptive, but two of the three species in the small, closely related Cape genus Acrolophia examined in chapter 5 are rewarding. This translates into very high levels of pollen transfer efficiency in the rewarding A. cochlearis relative to the deceptive A. capensis and species of Eulophia. In addition, A. cochlearis exhibits high rates of pollinator-mediated self-pollination, as quantified using a novel method based on levels of inbreeding depression during embryo development. In chapter 6 the evolutionary divergence of long- and short-spurred forms of E. parviflora in response to different pollinators is investigated. This shows that divergence has occurred in floral morphology, scent chemistry and flowering phenology and that this can be attributed to adaptations to the respective bee and beetle pollinators of each form. This thesis also includes case histories of bee pollination in an additional five Eulophia species, and beetle-pollination in two other species of Eulophia with dense inflorescences and slow pollinarium reconfiguration [chapter 7]. In addition, four taxa were found to undergo auto-pollination [chapter 8]. The main conclusions of this thesis are that pollination of food-deceptive species can be enhanced by spatial proximity to, and floral colour matching with, sympatric rewarding species; that selection strongly favours traits that promote cross-pollination; that pollinatorshifts can drive speciation; and that floral adaptations for bee-, beetle-, and auto-pollination are found in South African representatives of Eulophia...|$|R
40|$|Les procédés membranaires hybrides (PMH) allient la {{filtration}} membranaire basse pression à l’usage du charbon actif en poudre (CAP). Afin de diminuer les coûts opérationnels du procédé, il a été proposé de laisser vieillir le CAP dans le PMH et donc de minimiser le dosage de CAP frais. Peu d’information est disponible quant à la capacité résiduelle d’adsorption de suspensions de CAP âgées. L’importance relative de l’adsorption et de la biodégradation dans les réacteurs à CAP âgés sur le traitement des composés dissous est inconnue, ce qui empêche notamment l’optimisation du procédé. Le principal objectif de ce projet de recherche est de décrire la performance du contacteur à CAP du PMH pour l’enlèvement de l’azote ammoniacal, du carbone organique dissous (COD), du COD biodégradable (CODB) et des micropolluants. Dans ce projet, l’emphase est placée sur l’opération du PMH avec de hauts temps de <b>rétention</b> de <b>CAP.</b> La première phase de ce projet a consisté en une série de développements méthodologiques, base nécessaire à l’étude du CAP âgé. Des méthodes permettant la quantification de la biomasse hétérotrophe et nitrifiante colonisant le CAP âgé ont mis en évidence des densités de biomasse similaires à celle du charbon actif en grain en surface de filtre biologiques. L’irradiation aux rayons gamma a été démontrée comme une méthode adéquate pour produire des témoins abiotiques à partir de CAP de 10 et de 60 jours. La seconde partie de cette étude s’est concentrée sur la démonstration de l’efficacité du PMH pour l’enlèvement de l’azote ammoniacal, du COD, ainsi que d’un mélange de micropolluants. Les cinétiques d’enlèvements ayant lieu au sein de des contacteurs à CAP ont été simulées en laboratoire sous diverses conditions (température, concentration en CAP, âge de CAP, matrice d’eau variable, temps de contact). Deux modèles cinétiques prédisant l’enlèvement de l’azote ammoniacal et du COD dans le PMH ont été développés sur base des simulations en laboratoire suivies sur CAP neuf, colonisé et abiotique. De manière générale, les travaux réalisés au cours de ce doctorat ont mis en évidence le rôle majeur de l’adsorption résiduelle sur l’enlèvement de la contamination dissoute. Alors que l’enlèvement d’azote ammoniacal a majoritairement eu lieu par nitrification, le COD et les micropollutants sont principalement adsorbés sur le CAP colonisé. Il a aussi été montré que la capacité d’adsorption résiduelle des suspensions de CAP âgées peut agir en tampon, {{permettant de}} faire face à une augmentation soudaine de la concentration en azote ammoniacal, en COD ou en micropolluants. Le suivi des cinétiques d’enlèvement a permis de démontrer que la concentration, l’âge de CAP et le temps de rétention hydraulique (TRH) sont trois paramètres clefs pour l’optimisation du procédé. D’un point de vue économique, un TRH inférieur à 15 min est néanmoins désiré pour limiter les coûts du procédé. Par ailleurs, l’intérêt économique associé à l’augmentation de l’âge du CAP peut-être atténué par le besoin d’augmenter la concentration en CAP si l’adsorption est le mécanisme visé. De façon générale, ce projet démontre qu’une optimisation à l’échelle pilote du procédé est nécessaire car les objectifs de traitement, la qualité de l’eau à traiter et le fait que les 3 paramètres d’opération soient inter-reliés complexifient l’optimisation du PMH. Étant donné l’impact du TRH sur le coût du PMH, de futures recherches devraient viser à l’optimisation du mélange. Hybrid membrane processes (HMPs) couple membrane filtration with powdered activated carbon (PAC). In HMPs, low-pressure membranes ensure an efficient particle removal, including protozoan parasites such as Cryptosporidium, while the PAC contactor {{is devoted to}} the removal of dissolved compounds. Such processes are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional treatment chains, which no longer allow the drinking water facilities to comply with increasingly stringent regulations on the treated water quality. To decrease the operating costs associated with virgin PAC consumption, it was suggested to let the PAC age in the PAC contactor of the process. Until now, the potential of using aged PAC in HMPs has been demonstrated for ammonia and DOC removal, but the potential to remove micropollutants remains unknown. It is suggested that the biological activity in aged PAC contactors contributes significantly to the removal of the dissolved compounds. Yet, neither the extent of the biomass on the aged PAC, nor the residual adsorption capacity, was quantified. No study focused on discriminating the mechanisms responsible for the treatment when using aged PAC suspensions. Most of the data published on HMPs using aged PAC were gathered at pilot scale under warm water conditions, yet the efficiency of the process is most likely sensitive to temperature changes. There is currently little information available on the efficiency of HMPs under cold water conditions. This lack of information hinders the optimization of the HMP, leading to sub-optimal usage of aged PAC. The main objective of this research project is to describe the performance of the PAC contactor of HMPs in removing ammonia, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), biodegradable DOC (BDOC) and micropollutants. In particular, emphasis was placed on the operation of the HMP under high PAC residence times. On a more detailed level, the objectives of this project were (1) to develop and compare methods to quantify the biomass developed on aged PAC, (2) to develop a method to produce an abiotic control for aged PAC, (3) to characterize the removal kinetics of ammonia, DOC, BDOC and micropollutants occurring in the carbon contactor of an HMP, (4) to evaluate the impact of water temperature on the performance of the carbon contactor of an HMP, (5) to discriminate the relative importance of adsorption versus biological oxidation as mechanisms responsible for ammonia, DOC and micropollutants removal in the PAC contactor of an HMP, and finally (6) to differentiate the relative importance of the hydraulic retention time (HRT), the PAC age and the PAC concentration as key operating parameters on the optimization of the performance of the PAC contactor of an HMP. To set the basis on the study of aged PACs, {{the first part of this}} research project consisted in methodological developments i) to quantify the heterotrophic and nitrifying biomass colonizing aged PAC, and ii) to create a reliable abiotic control of the colonized PAC, which is required for discriminating the mechanisms occurring on aged PAC. Heterotrophic and nitrifying biomass quantifying methods developed for colonized granular activated carbon (GAC) were successfully adapted to the aged PAC. The preferred methods were the potential 14 C-glucose respiration (PGR) rate and the potential nitrifying activity (PNA), as they quantify the active heterotrophic and nitrifying biomass, which is most likely responsible for the depletion of BDOC and ammonia. An alternative method to the PGR, the potential acetate uptake (PAU) rate, was developed to alleviate the logistical and budgetary issues associated with the utilization of radio-labeled glucose. The densities (per gram of dry PAC) of both active heterotrophic and nitrifying biomasses were found comparable to that of the GAC sampled from the surface of a biological GAC filter. The gamma-irradiation was demonstrated as a reliable method to produce abiotic samples from soils, and was therefore chosen to produce abiotic colonized PAC samples in this project. In order to determine the optimized dosage of gamma-rays, increased doses were applied on PAC samples. Heterotrophic plate counts and methylene blue adsorption kinetics were used to determine respectively the lowest gamma ray dose required to inhibit the bacterial activity, and the highest dose that could be applied without affecting the aged PAC adsorption capacity and kinetics. Refractory DOC (RDOC) adsorption kinetics confirmed the accuracy of the dose chosen as the adsorptive behavior of the aged PAC was not affected. PGR rates were decreased 83 % at the optimized dose. The gamma-irradiation method was therefore proven efficient and used in the following work phases of this research. The second part of this study focused on the removal of ammonia, DOC and a mixture of micropollutants. Firstly, the PAC contactor of an HMP was simulated at lab-scale to monitor ammonia removal kinetics. Three PAC concentrations (approximately 1 - 5 - 10 g/L) of three PAC ages (0 - 10 - 60 days) were tested at two temperatures (7 - 22 °C), in settled water with ambient influent condition (100 µg N–NH 4 /L) as well as under a simulated peak pollution scenario (1000 µg N–NH 4 /L). The kinetics evidenced that ammonia flux at pilot scale limited biomass growth (HRT = 67 min). In contrast, PAC colonization was not limited by the available surface and thus, PAC concentration was not a key operating parameter under the colonizing conditions tested (5 - 10 g/L). Ammonia adsorption was significant onto virgin PAC but the ammonia nitrification was crucial to reach complete ammonia removal at 22 °C. When using colonized PAC, the 60 -d PAC offered a better resilience to temperature decreases (78 % at 7 °C) as well as lower operating costs than the 10 -d PAC (DOC, BDOC and RDOC removals occurring in the PAC contactor of an HMP were also simulated at lab-scale. Similar conditions to that of the ammonia removal kinetics were tested. The initial ammonia concentration remained untouched in the water matrices (settled water and raw water) but the BDOC-to-DOC ratio was altered by pre-ozonation (0 to 1. 5 g O 3 /g C). The 10 -d and 60 -d abiotic controls were used to discriminate DOC adsorption from biodegradation. DOC biodegradation contributed marginally to DOC removal in the investigated conditions and DOC adsorption was increased at higher temperature. An original model integrating the PAC age distribution was developed to predict DOC removal in aged PAC contactors operated at steady-state. At a mean PAC residence time of 60 -d, the younger PAC fraction (25 -d and less) was primarily responsible for DOC adsorption (> 80 %). This fraction represents 34 % of the mass of PAC in the contactor. When using a water matrix with a higher initial DOC concentration (raw water) or a lower affinity for PAC (pre-ozonated settled water), the residual adsorption capacity of that older fraction was proven useful. Lastly, a mixture of micropollutants (atrazine, deethylatrazine (DEA), linuron, microcystin, caffeine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac, progesterone and medroxyprogesterone) was spiked at environmentally relevant concentrations (from 130 ng/L to 33 µg/L) in settled water (0 and 0. 85 gO 3 /gC). The micropollutants concentration depletion was monitored over a period of 7 h to 48 h on 1 g/L of 0 -d, 10 -d, 60 -d PAC and gamma-irradiated 60 -d PAC. Even in presence of NOM, the spiked micropollutants were rapidly adsorbed on aged PAC. No biodegradation was observed. Removals superior to 95 % were reached within 5 minutes, and direct competition with NOM did not impact the efficiency of the process when micropollutants were spiked at environmentally relevant concentrations. Therefore, HMPs operated to remove DOC and ammonia can control transient micropollutant pollution and comply with the World health Organization recommendations for atrazine (2 µg/L) and microcystin (1 µg/L). However, the stricter European regulations for atrazine and DEA (0. 1 µg/L) could not be met with 10 -d and 60 -d PAC under the operating conditions tested. Reaching such strict treatment objective would require a specific optimization of the process. In general, this PhD research evidenced the role of the residual adsorption of aged PAC suspensions for the treatment of dissolved compounds. From the results obtained in this project, the potential of HMPs using aged PAC to remove micropollutants was evidenced. Additional research is however required to validate this potential under varied operating conditions. The modeling work improved the understanding of aged PACs. Finally, this research work provides original information on the optimization of HMPs. The optimization of the operating parameters will vary with the water quality targeted and the quality of the influent water. The PAC concentration, PAC age and HRT are inter-related. Therefore, it is recommended to optimize the operation of HMPs at pilot scale. Seasonal variations should be accounted for. An HRT of at least 15 min is required when the biological activity is mandatory to reach the water quality objectives. Lower HRT might be applied if adsorption is favored. Finally, as the HRT has a strong impact on the total cost of the process (capital and operational expenditure), PAC contactors’ hydraulic should be the point of focus of future research. &Doctorat en Sciences agronomiques et ingénierie biologiqueinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
