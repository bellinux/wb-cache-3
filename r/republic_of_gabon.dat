5000|$|The Iboga tree is {{the central}} pillar of the Bwiti spiritual {{practice}} in West-Central Africa, mainly Gabon, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo, which uses the alkaloid-containing roots of the plant {{in a number of}} ceremonies. Iboga is taken in massive doses by initiates of this spiritual practice, and on a more regular basis is eaten in smaller doses in connection with rituals and tribal dances, which are usually performed at night. Bwitists have been subject to persecution by Catholic missionaries, who to this day are thoroughly opposed to the growing spiritual practice of Bwiti. [...] Léon M'ba, before becoming the first President of Gabon in 1960, defended the Bwiti religion and the use of iboga in French colonial courts.

40|$|International audienceThe {{oxygen content}} of Earth's {{atmosphere}} has varied greatly through time, progressing from exceptionally low levels before about 2. 3 billion years ago, to much higher levels afterward. In {{the absence of}} better information, we usually view the progress in Earth's oxygenation {{as a series of}} steps followed by periods of relative stasis. In contrast to this view, and as reported here, a dynamic evolution of Earth's oxygenation is recorded in ancient sediments from the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gabon</b> from between about 2, 150 and 2, 080 million years ago. The oldest sediments in this sequence were deposited in well-oxygenated deep waters whereas the youngest were deposited in euxinic waters, which were globally extensive. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the comings and goings of the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion, the longest-lived positive delta C- 13 excursion in Earth history, generating a huge oxygen source to the atmosphere. As the Lomagundi event waned, the oxygen source became a net oxygen sink as Lomagundi organic matter became oxidized, driving oxygen to low levels; this state may have persisted for 200 million years...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUnderstanding of the {{environmental}} behavior of Ra is important {{from the viewpoint of}} the long-termed repository safety of radioactive waste, but investigation of Ra behavior in natural environment is difficult to detect. We found isotopic evidence of Ra transportation and its selective uptake into clay minerals from Pb isotopic analyses. Illite grains found in calcite veins included in sandstone near the Oklo uranium deposit, <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gabon,</b> show extremely low 207 Pb/ 206 Pb (∼ 0. 0158) isotopic ratios. Although the Pb isotopic ratios of calcite and quartz coexisting with illite indicate the formation age of each component, those of illite do not. In addition, illite grains having low 207 Pb/ 206 Pb isotopic ratios contain a strongly large amount of Ba (1230 to 6010 ppm) in contrast with low contents of Ba in calcite and quartz (b 0. 26 ppm). Considering the chemical similarity between Ba and Ra, the 207 Pb/ 206 Pb isotopic data suggest an excess of 206 Pb due to selective adsorption of 226 Ra (and also Ba) into illite grains. This is a very rare example to show evidence of the selective adsorption behavior of Ra from the isotopic excesses of 206 Pb, although the adsorption ability of Ra itself in nature was largely reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasive}} {{black rat}} Rattus rattus has established commensal populations in most {{cities of the}} world. Known as a reservoir of numerous zoonotic diseases, this species is considered as an urban pest and may have major consequences on human health. However, {{little is known about}} the genetic structure of urban populations, although it could help to design the scale of appropriate control strategies (at the city or at the district level). In this study, we characterize the genetic structure of R. rattus within Franceville (<b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gabon),</b> an African tropical city that has undergone a recent growth, like many other cities of the developing countries. Sampling was conducted in six different districts of the city, chosen to represent variable levels of connectivity and building aggregation. Genetic structure was assessed using 16 microsatellite markers. Our results suggest the occurrence of a large population of R. rattus that is continuously distributed at the scale of the city, with no impact of urban characteristics or putative barriers on genetic differentiation. Isolation by distance analyses show that effective dispersal of R. rattus is, however, spatially limited to a few hundred meters. Regarding management strategies, our results suggest that rodent control should be envisaged at the scale of the city. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
