5000|$|Many people {{consider}} the Hobie 18 the quintessential “beachcat.” The Hobie 18 {{was designed to}} be not only fast but also rugged. It is designed to be sailed by a crew of two, but can easily carry four passengers when cruising. Experienced sailors can sail the Hobie 18 solo. Unlike the smaller Hobie 14 and 16, the Hobie 18 uses a symmetrical hull design. Although this design gives the 18 a speed advantage, it requires the use of daggerboards when sailing close-hauled or reaching to prevent slipping. The typical configuration for the Hobie 18 is with both a main sail and a jib. The jib on the 18 is set up on a rolling/furling system that wraps the jib around the forestay when it isn’t needed. A double trapeze system is also standard equipment on the Hobie 18. Optionally the Hobie 18 may be equipped with wing seats (similar to the 17). Wings were available on the Hobie 18 in two fashions. The shorter wing [...] "spanned" [...] from the front to <b>rear</b> <b>crossbar</b> on the Hobie 18 Magnum, while the Hobie 18SX sported even longer wings. These wings reached aft to the stern and forward approximately 20 inches ahead of the front crossbar. Additionally, the SX model had a mast approximately 19 inches taller and high aspect mylar sails. Wings of both types, magnum and SX, are in much demand today due to the added comfort and space provided. They add about 40 pounds. Much to the dismay of many Hobie enthusiasts, the Hobie 18 is currently no longer produced.|$|E
50|$|The C2SS was {{designed}} for the street scrambler, a road machine powered by a single cylinder, two stroke, rotary disc valve engine with displacement of 115cc. It was street legal having headlight, taillight, and license plate bracket. It had chrome fenders front and <b>rear,</b> a <b>crossbar</b> on the handlebars, universal tires, an upswept right side chrome exhaust system, and apparent good ground clearance. The bike was available in either red, blue, or silver with the fuel tank having rubber knee grips.|$|R
50|$|American {{football}} goalposts {{consist of}} two vertical posts 18.5 ft apart (24 ft {{in high school}} football) rising from a horizontal crossbar mounted on single (usually) post raising it 10 ft off the ground (resulting in a combined Y-shape of sorts). The single vertical support is offset to the <b>rear</b> from the <b>crossbar</b> to remove {{it as far as}} possible from the field of play; it is also usually padded to help keep players that run into it from being injured. The goalposts in American football used to be on the goal line and H-shaped, but the end line and then offset design were developed to reduce injuries that occurred when players ran into the base poles (Canadian football still has H-shaped goal posts on the goal line).|$|R
