5|$|Heins recounts how the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) {{advocated}} for its associated organizations to add Parental Advisory warnings on labels of music albums {{as a way}} to advise parents about possible offensive content. She describes how the Parents Music <b>Resource</b> <b>Center,</b> co-founded by Tipper Gore, and hearings held by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, which included Senator Al Gore, led to attempts at censorship by lawmakers in eight individual states. Heins suggests that this subsequently led to the industry's self-regulation, which the author sees as self-censorship, and blacklisting of certain albums by music stores.|$|E

40|$|Cultural <b>resource</b> <b>centers</b> {{have been}} an ongoing and {{integral}} component to creating a more welcoming campus climate for Students of Color since its establishment in the 1960 s. While the racial dynamics may have changed, many of the challenges Students of Color faced on predominantly White campuses have not. Interestingly, cultural <b>resource</b> <b>centers</b> as safe spaces and advocacy spaces have evolved and expanded their missions beyond their traditional student populations. This study utilizes the Multi-contextual Model of Diverse Learning Environments (MMDLE) and organizational behavior theories to understand how cultural <b>resource</b> <b>centers</b> shape and are shaped by their current campus climates. Through an embedded case study design combining survey data, interviews, and document analyses, this study identifies the missions and organizational structures of cultural <b>resource</b> <b>centers,</b> {{as well as its}} interactions with the climate. Major findings include centers converging around an educational mission for a broad population with variations by center type in their areas of emphases. A categorization of institutional models emerged from the study resulting in the Taxonomy of Cultural <b>Resource</b> <b>Centers</b> in Higher Education, serving as a basic model to consider of multicultural, intercultural, and race-specific centers. The case studies revealed the importance of understanding institutional models within their context and the interplay of climate dimensions that serve to either support or hinder their ability to meet their missions. Cultural <b>resource</b> <b>centers</b> have evolved from serving their traditional populations yet the organizational structures to support their missions have not necessarily evolved with them. The case studies indicated a variety of approaches including institutions looking at the cultural <b>resource</b> <b>centers</b> in isolation and those that tried to fit the cultural <b>resource</b> <b>centers</b> within an organizational structure to support campus diversity efforts. The organizational behaviors of the institutions reflected the institutional context and approach to overall diversity efforts as well as highlighted the interplay between the dimensions of the climate. Strategizing for the future within conflicting notions of valuing diversity and rendering race invisible thus needs {{to take into account the}} evolving cultural <b>resource</b> <b>centers</b> as sites of expertise, education, and empowerment...|$|R
