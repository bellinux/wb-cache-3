50|$|For Aristotle, {{matter is}} the basis of all that exists; it {{comprises}} <b>the</b> <b>potentiality</b> of everything, but of itself is not actually anything. A determinate thing only comes into being when <b>the</b> <b>potentiality</b> in matter is converted into actuality. This is achieved by form, the idea existent not as one outside the many, but as one in the many, the completion of <b>the</b> <b>potentiality</b> latent in <b>the</b> matter.|$|R

40|$|Once {{a product}} has been {{evaluated}} for use, the circumstances can change {{and it must}} be reevaluated for use at a different time. Four experiments investigated processes underlying these reevaluations. Participants received information about a product that had implications for both desirability and the feasibility of using it, while anticipating either its immediate or future use. They were later asked to <b>reevaluate</b> <b>the</b> product for use at either the same or a different point in time. Participants who <b>reevaluated</b> <b>the</b> product for future use based their judgments on desirability considerations regardless of when they had considered using it initially. However, participants who <b>reevaluated</b> <b>the</b> product for immediate use also based their judgments on desirability considerations unless they had initially considered immediate use as well. These results were consistent with a conceptualization of consumer judgment processes that incorporated implications of research on construal level theory and on person memory and judgments.

40|$|In {{applying}} the stationary phase approximation to coherent state path integrals a difficulty occurs; {{there are no}} classical paths that satisfy the boundary conditions of the path integral. Others have gotten around this problem by <b>reevaluating</b> <b>the</b> action. In this work it is shown {{that it is not}} necessary to <b>reevaluate</b> <b>the</b> action because the stationary phase approximation is applicable so long as the path, about which the expansion is performed, satisfies the associated Lagrange's equations of motion. It is not necessary for this path to satisfy the boundary conditions in order to apply the stationary phase approximation. Comment: 10 pages, RevTeX...|$|R
