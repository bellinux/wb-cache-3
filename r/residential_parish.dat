It was only in 1921 that the priest of Lila had a <b>residential</b> <b>parish.</b> The church and the convent built then were only made of light materials.|$|E

It was developed from farming land during the 1990s and early 21st century, and sits within the historic village of Mangotsfield and near Downend.

50|$|There {{has been}} only minimal {{building}} development in the village {{in recent years and}} no immediate prospect of the surrounding farming land being given over to <b>residential</b> expansion. The <b>Parish</b> Council are keen to retain this status quo but are concerned that eventually the green belt will be lost by the growth of Hemel Hempstead where the gap is now down to little more than a mile from the boundary at Hempstead Lane.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background A {{number of}} child/parental {{factors have been}} shown to be {{significant}} predictors of childhood overweight, although a better understanding of possible contextual influences of neighbourhood-level characteristics might provide new insights leading to tailored, targeted interventions. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of neighbourhood purchasing power and its relationship with other known risk factors related to childhood overweight in a prospective birth cohort. Methods A prospective, population-based, birth-cohort study was conducted in south-western Sweden, comprising 2, 666 infants born in 2007 – 2008. Childhood overweight was assessed by body mass index (BMI) data from follow-up examinations at four years of age (n[*]=[*] 2, 026) and overweight defined according to the International Obesity Task Force. Using logistic regression analysis, the influential child/parental predictors were identified from the candidate predictors, viz. child’s gender, as well as birth weight adjusted for gestational age and parental factors at recruitment, including maternal smoking status, maternal BMI (before pregnancy), paternal BMI and parental educational level. The children’s <b>residential</b> <b>parishes</b> at follow-up were stratified by parish-level household purchasing power (< 10  %, 10 – 19. 9  %, 20 – 29. 9  % and ≥ 30  % of all resident families with low purchasing power) and the “contextual” influence was analysed. In each such neighbourhood stratum, the adjusted overweight ratio (AOR), i. e. the ratio between the observed number of overweight children and the expected number, taking account of the influential child/parental predictors, was estimated. Results The prevalence of overweight at four years of age was 11. 9  %. In the economically strongest neighbourhoods (i. e. < 10  % of resident families with low purchasing power), the AOR was 0. 60 (95  % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 34 – 0. 98). The corresponding empirically Bayes-adjusted AOR was 0. 73 (95  % CI: 0. 46 – 1. 02; 97  % posterior probability of AOR[*]< 1). In the other neighbourhood strata, the statistical evidence of a deviant AOR was weaker. Conclusion The economically strongest neighbourhoods had a lower prevalence than expected of overweight at four years of age. This finding should prompt studies to acquire more knowledge of potentially modifiable factors that differ between neighbourhoods and are related to childhood overweight, providing a basis for tailored, targeted interventions...|$|R
50|$|Cummertrees is rural, {{primarily}} <b>residential</b> village; the <b>parish</b> includes Powfoot and Trailtrow and is {{bounded by}} St Mungo and Hoddam, Annan, the Solway Firth, and Ruthwell and Dalton. A Public hall was erected at Cummertrees in 1893. The river Annan {{is at the}} northern boundary. It has a wide area of level sand swept by the Solway 'bore' which can move at around ten {{miles an hour and}} can often be heard throughout the parish. The seaboard is low and sandy and features in Walter Scott's novel Redgauntlet. The ground rises a little inland, to 350 feet on Repentance Hill.|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The main aim {{of the project was}} to examine the inter-relations between politics and economics in Sandwich. The intention was to trace the voting history of each voter, and to associate any changes with external circumstances (e. g. change of occupation, change of residence, etc.) and to identify patterns of change among the voters' political preferences. Main Topics : This data collection consists of a transcription of the poll books for the parliamentary constituency of Sandwich, Kent for the nine general elections and four by-elections between 1831 and 1868. Each voter is identified by name, occupation and qualifying property (where appropriate and available) and details are given of the way his two votes were cast. Where the vote was split, or was a plumper vote, details are given as to which candidates were supported. Non-voters who appear on the electoral roll and not in the poll books are included, but voters enfranchised {{under the terms of the}} 1867 Act are not included. The main variables are: surname; forenames; voter type (freeman or elector); votes cast; occupation; electors' <b>residential</b> qualification; freemen's <b>parish</b> of residence...|$|R
