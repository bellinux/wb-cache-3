40|$|We {{report the}} first calorimetric {{detection}} of individual He 2 * excimers within a bath of superfluid 4 He. The detector {{used in this}} work is a single superconducting titanium transition edge sensor (TES) with an energy resolution of ~ 1 eV, immersed directly in the helium bath. He 2 * excimers are produced in the surrounding bath using an external gamma-ray source. These excimers exist either as short-lived singlet or long-lived triplet states. We demonstrate detection of both states: in the singlet case the <b>calorimeter</b> <b>records</b> the absorption of a prompt 15 eV photon, and in the triplet case the <b>calorimeter</b> <b>records</b> a direct interaction of the molecule with the TES surface, which deposits a distinct fraction of the 15 eV, released upon decay, into the surface. We also briefly discuss the detector fabrication and characterization. Comment: 7 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

50|$|In {{particle}} detectors {{built at}} high-energy particle accelerators, a device called a <b>calorimeter</b> <b>records</b> {{the energy of}} particles by causing them to produce a shower and then measuring the energy deposited as a result.

40|$|In ATLAS, {{all of the}} {{electromagnetic}} calorimetry {{and part of the}} hadronic calorimetry is performed by a calorimeter system using liquid argon as the active material, together with various types of absorbers. The liquid argon calorimeter consists of four subsystems: {{the electromagnetic}} barrel and endcap accordion calorimeters; the hadronic endcap calorimeters, and the forward calorimeters. A very accurate geometrical description of these calorimeters is used as input to the Geant 4 -based ATLAS simulation, and a careful modelling of the signal development is applied in the generation of hits. Certain types of Monte Carlo truth information ("Calibration Hits") may, additionally, be <b>recorded</b> for <b>calorimeter</b> cells as well as for dead material. This note is a comprehensive reference describing the simulation of the four liquid argon calorimeteter components...|$|R
40|$|Polyurethane foams {{are widely}} used in many {{industrial}} applications: automotive, upholstered furniture and mattresses, insulating panels for building, etc. By its chemical nature, polyurethane is very flammable and the flammability of polyurethane foams is an important industry issue. Depending on the final application, many test methods are in place to characterise foam combustion and legislation exists to ensure that foams comply with specific standards. This paper deals with the fire properties of flexible polyurethane foams. It provides basic correlations between some existing fire test methods and the data <b>recorded</b> under cone <b>calorimeter</b> conditions. The long term target of such an investigation is to predict the burning behavior of foams under specific test conditions from the data of the cone calorimeter.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{plans for}} a search for long-lived particles which will become stopped by the CMS detector. We will look for the subsequent decay of these particles during time intervals {{where there are no}} pp collisions in CMS: during gaps between crossings in the LHC beam structure, and during inter-fill periods between the beam being dumped and re-injection. Such long living particles decays will be <b>recorded</b> with dedicated <b>calorimeter</b> triggers. For models predicting these particles, such as split-susy gluinos, the large cross-section combined with good stopping power of CMS, yields a significant number of triggerable decays. If LHC instantaneous luminosity approaches 1032 cm− 2 s− 1 in 2009 - 10, 5 σ significance can be established in a matter of days, since these decays occur on top of a negligible background. Due to limited size, this paper concentrates on main idea and expected results. More details are available i...|$|R
40|$|Exclusive dimuon pairs with {{invariant}} mass M_μμ > 10 GeV {{have been}} measured in ultra-peripheral lead-lead collisions at √(s_NN) = 5. 02 TeV, using an integrated luminosity of 515 μb^- 1 {{taken with the}} ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015. These very low-multiplicity interactions were recorded using an experimental trigger requiring a muon, low total transverse energy <b>recorded</b> in the <b>calorimeter</b> system, gaps at forward angles, and a reconstructed track. Events are selected to have no-other final state particles than a pair of opposite-sign dimuons. The cross section for dimuon pairs in Pb+Pb collisions {{is presented as a}} function of pair mass (M_μμ) and pair rapidity (Y_μμ) and is well-described by calculations of Pb+Pb→Pb^(*) +Pb^(*) +μ^+ + μ^- using STARLIGHT 1. 1 calculations.

40|$|The barrel {{calorimeter}} {{is part of}} the new spectrometer {{installed in}} Hall D at Jefferson Lab for the GlueX experiment. The calorimeter was installed in 2013, commissioned in 2014 and has been operating routinely since early 2015. The detector configuration, associated Monte Carlo simulations, calibration and operational performance are described herein. The <b>calorimeter</b> <b>records</b> the time and energy deposited by charged and neutral particles created by a multi-GeV photon beam. It is constructed as a lead and scintillating-fiber calorimeter and read out with 3840 large-area silicon photomultiplier arrays. Particles impinge on the detector over a wide range of angles, from normal incidence at 90 degrees down to 10 degrees, which defines a geometry that is fairly unique among calorimeters. The response of the calorimeter has been measured during a running experiment and is shown to perform as expected for electromagnetic showers between 0. 05 and 2. 5 GeV, with a fractional energy resolution of 5. 2 %/√(E(GeV)) ⊕ 3. 6 % and timing resolution of σ = 150 ps at 1 GeV.

40|$|Jets {{produced}} in high transverse energy proton-nucleus collisions at 400 GeV/c were <b>recorded</b> in a <b>calorimeter</b> study at Fermilab. The jets were identified with two different jet-finding algorithms; {{the results from}} the two algorithms agree. For the eight nuclear targets with atomic number, A, ranging from 1 to 207 (H 2, He, Be, C, Al, Cu, Sn and Pb), the cross section increases as A 1. 35 ± 0. 01 over mean jet pair transverse momentum of 4 to 8 GeV/c. The enhancement, however, depends on the class of jets selected; for example the cross section increases as A 1 for highly planar high-transverse-momentum jet events and as A 1. 65 for non-planar high-transverse-momentum events. Jet properties were studied as a function of jet transverse momentum and A. In general as A increases, the number of particles in the jets increases while their collimation and coplanarity decrease. Also with increasing A, the proton transfers more of its energy into the target fragmentation region instead of the forward or central regions. Multiple scattering models describe nuclear enhancement, however fits to our data require negative coefficients in the higher order terms of the expansion, presenting a challenge to simple multiple scattering models...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGlasses {{based on}} Sb 2 O 3 {{make one of}} the major classes of heavy metal oxide glasses. This paper {{concerns}} two antimonite glasses, 88 Sb 2 O 3 - 10 Na 2 O- 2 Bi 2 O 3 (SNB 2) and 60 Sb 2 O 3 - 20 WO 3 - 19 Na 2 O- 1 Bi 2 O 3 (SWNB 1), doped with 0. 25  mol% Er 2 O 3. Bulk samples have been prepared and their absorption and fluorescence spectra have been <b>recorded.</b> Differential scanning <b>calorimeter</b> (DSC) measurements emphasize a thermal stability range ΔT >  100  °C that expresses a good stability against devitrification. Both FTIR and Raman spectra provide information on the structural organization of the glasses. The maximum phonon energies are 700  cm− 1 and 920  cm− 1 for SNB 2 and SWNB 1 glasses, respectively. The spectroscopic analysis of the absorption and emission properties of the Er 3 + ions in the SNB 2 and SWNB 1 glasses has been performed. The Judd-Ofelt theory has been applied to interpret the local environment of the Er 3 + ion site and covalency of the Er[sbnd]O bond, but also to determine the radiative lifetime (τr) for 4 I 13 / 2  →  4 I 15 / 2 emission transition. The emission cross-sections for the 4 I 13 / 2  →  4 I 15 / 2 transition (1528  nm) were calculated using McCumber and Füchtbauer-Ladenburg theories. We discuss the potential application of these glasses. © 2016 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{descriptive}} article {{illustrates the}} application of Global Positioning System (GPS) professional receivers {{in the field of}} locomotion studies. The technological challenge was to assess the external mechanical work in outdoor walking. METHODS: Five subjects walked five times during 5 min on an athletic track at different imposed stride frequency (from 70 - 130 steps x min(- 1)). A differential GPS system (carrier phase analysis) measured the variation of the position of the trunk at 5 Hz. A portable indirect <b>calorimeter</b> <b>recorded</b> breath-by-breath energy expenditure. RESULTS: For a walking speed of 1. 05 +/- 0. 11 m x s(- 1), the vertical lift of the trunk (43 +/- 14 mm) induced a power of 46. 0 +/- 20. 4 W. The average speed variation per step (0. 15 +/- 0. 03 m x s(- 1)) produced a kinetic power of 16. 9 +/- 7. 2 W. As compared with commonly admitted values, the energy exchange (recovery) between the two energy components was low (39. 1 +/- 10. 0 %), which induced an overestimated mechanical power (38. 9 +/- 18. 3 W or 0. 60 W x kg(- 1) body mass) and a high net mechanical efficiency (26. 9 +/- 5. 8 %). CONCLUSION: We assumed that the cause of the overestimation was an unwanted oscillation of the GPS antenna. It is concluded that GPS (in phase mode) is now able to record small body movements during human locomotion, and constitutes a promising tool for gait analysis of outdoor unrestrained walking. However, the design of the receiver and the antenna must be adapted to human experiments and a thorough validation study remains to be conducted...|$|R
