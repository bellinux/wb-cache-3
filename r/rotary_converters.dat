5|$|In 1904, the Met {{opened a}} 10.5MW {{coal-fired}} power station at Neasden, which supplied 11kV 33.3Hz current to five substations that converted this to 600VDC using <b>rotary</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Production of {{electricity}} in the station ceased in 1919, ushered in by the completion of an extension to generating equipment at Newburn Steelworks. The building was retained and continued {{to be used to}} supply power to the tram route by housing a sub-station, which used <b>rotary</b> <b>converters.</b> The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed. The station's chimney was demolished in 1949, along with remaining structures of the Tyne Iron Works, which had stood next to the power station throughout its operation.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> over the discrete motor-generator set is that the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> avoids converting all of the power flow into mechanical energy and then back into electrical energy; some of the electrical energy instead flows directly from input to output, allowing the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> to be much smaller and lighter than a motor-generator set of an equivalent power-handling capability. The advantages of a motor-generator set include adjustable voltage regulation which can compensate for voltage drop in the supply network; it also provided complete power isolation, harmonics isolation, greater surge and transient protection, and sag (brownout) protection through increased momentum.|$|R
25|$|Since {{utilities}} supply high-voltage AC, DC railways use converter {{stations to}} produce relatively low-voltage DC (usually 3000 volts or less). Originally they used <b>rotary</b> <b>converters,</b> {{a few of}} which are even still in operation, but most were supplanted first by mercury arc rectifiers and then by semiconductor rectifiers.|$|E
25|$|An {{electrical}} substation {{was also}} erected {{to the south}} of the yard, to feed power into the overhead wires. Of 18,000 kilowatt capacity, it was fitted with four 4500 kilowatt <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> and was the largest substation on the network until demolished in the early 1970s {{to make room for the}} City Loop portals for the Caulfield Group. Additional sidings were also provided in the triangle formed by the lines bound for Richmond and Jolimont. Located on the site of the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, the ground was acquired by the Victorian Railways and the Essendon Football Club played their final season there in 1921.|$|E
2500|$|General Electric {{installed}} <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> in [...] B's powerhouse near Mt. Royal Station, {{having a}} combined capacity of 5,000 kW to convert 13,200-volt, 3 phase, 25-cycle AC to 675 volts DC. In 1936, these <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> {{were replaced by}} mercury arc rectifiers.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{envision}} {{what is happening}} in an AC-to-DC <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> is to imagine a rotary reversing switch that is being driven at a speed that is synchronous with the power line. Such a switch could rectify the AC input waveform with no magnetic components at all save those driving the switch. The <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> is somewhat more complex than this trivial case because it delivers near-DC rather than the pulsating DC that would result from just the reversing switch, but the analogy may be helpful in understanding how the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> avoids transforming all of the energy from electrical to mechanical and back to electrical.|$|R
50|$|At each facility, {{power from}} an AC power grid was {{converted}} to DC to feed into an overhead line or a third rail of a railway. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converter</b> plants {{were also used}} for coupling power grids of different frequencies and operation modes. The former Neuhof Substation {{was an example of}} the latter. Former machinery transmitters like the Alexanderson alternator were, strictly speaking, <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> plants.|$|R
50|$|The Paddington {{substation}} was automatic, {{equipped with}} an 1100 KVA transformer, a British-Thomson-Houston 1000 kW <b>rotary</b> <b>converter,</b> switchgear, support services, and an overhead crane (designed by the Tramways Department). The substation received 11000 volts AC electricity from the New Farm Power station, via an underground feeder cable. The transformer reduced this supply, which the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> then converted to 600 volts DC for the tramways network.|$|R
2500|$|HVDC {{converters}} {{can take}} several different forms. Early HVDC systems, built until the 1930s, were effectively <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> and used electromechanical conversion with motor-generator sets connected in {{series on the}} DC side and in parallel on the AC side. [...] However, all HVDC systems built since the 1940s have used electronic (static) converters.|$|E
2500|$|Grand Central Terminal's [...] basements {{are among}} {{the largest in the}} city. This {{includes}} M42, a [...] "secret" [...] sub-basement under the terminal that contains the AC to DC converters used to supply DC traction current to the tracks. The exact location of M42 is a closely guarded secret and does not appear on maps, though it has been shown on the History Channel program Cities of the Underworld and a National Geographic special. Two of the original <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> were not removed in the late 20th century when solid-state ones took over their job, and they remain as a historical record. During World War II, this facility was closely guarded because its sabotage would have impaired troop movement on the Eastern Seaboard. It is said that any unauthorized person entering the facility during the war risked being shot on sight; the <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> could have easily been crippled by a bucket of sand. Abwehr (a German espionage service) sent two spies to sabotage it; they were arrested by the FBI before they could strike.|$|E
2500|$|In 1896, Oerlikon {{installed}} {{the first commercial}} example of the system on the Lugano Tramway. [...] Each 30-tonne locomotive had two [...] motors run by three-phase 750V 40Hz fed from double overhead lines. Three-phase motors run at constant speed and provide regenerative braking, and are well suited to steeply graded routes, and the first main-line three-phase locomotives were supplied by Brown (by then in partnership with Walter Boveri) in 1899 on the 40km Burgdorfâ€”Thun line, Switzerland. The first implementation of industrial frequency single-phase AC supply for locomotives came from Oerlikon in 1901, using the designs of [...] and installation on the Seebach-Wettingen line of the Swiss Federal Railways was completed in 1904. The 15kV, 50Hz , 48tonne locomotives used transformers and <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> to power DC traction motors.|$|E
50|$|Other {{electromagnetic}} machines {{include the}} Amplidyne, Synchro, Metadyne, Eddy current clutch, Eddy current brake, Eddy current dynamometer, Hysteresis dynamometer, <b>Rotary</b> <b>converter,</b> and Ward Leonard set.

2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of steam prime movers in converting the heat energy of fuel into mechanical work {{was a critical}} factor in the economic operation of steam central generating stations. [...] Early projects used reciprocating steam engines, operating at relatively low speeds. The introduction of the steam turbine fundamentally changed the economics of central station operations. Steam turbines could be made in larger ratings than reciprocating engines, and generally had higher efficiency. The speed of steam turbines did not fluctuate cyclically during each revolution; making parallel operation of AC generators feasible, and improved the stability of <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> for production of direct current for traction and industrial uses. [...] Steam turbines ran at higher speed than reciprocating engines, not being limited by the allowable speed of a piston in a cylinder. This made them more compatible with AC generators with only two or four poles; no [...] gearbox or belted speed increaser was needed between the engine and the generator. It was costly and ultimately impossible to provide a belt-drive between a low-speed engine and a high-speed generator in the very large ratings required for central station service.|$|E

50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> {{plant is}} a {{facility}} at which {{one form of}} electricity is converted into another form of electricity by {{using a combination of}} an electric motor and an electric generator. The installed combinations of motors and generators at a plant determine the possible type(s) of conversion. Such facilities also allow the setting of voltages and frequencies, if appropriate equipment is installed. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converter</b> plants were commonplace in railway electrification before the invention of mercury arc rectifiers in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, 25 Hz power was much more readily available from commercial electrical utilities. The vast majority of urban subway systems used 25 Hz power to supply their lineside <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> used to generate the DC voltage supplied to the trains. Since <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> work more efficiently with lower frequency supplies, 25 Hz was a common supply frequency for these machines. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converters</b> have been steadily replaced over the past 70 years with, at first, mercury arc rectifiers and more lately solid-state rectifiers. Thus, the need for special frequency power for urban traction has disappeared, along with the financial motivation for utilities to operate generators at these frequencies.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the initial}} 600 volt direct current (DC) installation, Ultimo Power Station {{supplied}} three phase alternating current (AC) at 6600 volts, 25 cycles per second. Originally, this current was not stepped up for transmission. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converters</b> {{were used to}} convert the three phase AC to 600 volts DC for the tram supply. The 1500 volt DC heavy rail electrification commenced operation in 1926 and also initially utilised high capacity <b>rotary</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> was replaced {{in the early}} 20th century by mercury-vapor rectifiers, which were smaller, did not produce vibration and noise, and required less maintenance. The same conversion tasks are now performed by solid state power semiconductor devices. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converters</b> remained in use in the West Side IRT subway in Manhattan into the late 1960s, and possibly some years later. They were powered by 25 Hz AC, and provided DC at 600 volts for the trains.|$|E
50|$|The Reading's {{system used}} {{catenary}} electrified at 12 kV 25 Hz like the competing Pennsylvania Railroad's 1915 initial electrification and 1930s mainline expansion. Unlike the PRR's system, which included multiple power sources and an extensive high-voltage transmission network, the Reading's electrification was supplied solely by the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> station at Wayne Junction. Although ownership {{and operation of}} the system has changed, the system has remained essentially unchanged {{with the exception of}} the replacement of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> station at Wayne Junction with a solid-state cycloconverter in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> can {{be thought}} of as a motor-generator, where the two {{machines}} share a single rotating armature and set of field coils. The basic construction of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> consists of a DC generator (dynamo) with a set of slip rings tapped into its rotor windings at evenly spaced intervals. When a dynamo is spun the electric currents in its rotor windings alternate as it rotates in the magnetic field of the stationary field windings. This alternating current is rectified by means of a commutator which allows DC current to be extracted from the rotor. This principle is taken advantage of by energizing the same rotor windings with AC power which causes the machine to act as a synchronous AC motor. The rotation of the energized coils excites the stationary field windings producing part of the DC current. The other part is AC current from the slip rings which is directly rectified into DC by the commutator. This makes the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> a hybrid dynamo and mechanical rectifier. When used in this way it is referred to as a synchronous <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> or simply a synchronous converter. The AC slip rings also allow the machine to act as an alternator.|$|R

5000|$|AC to DC {{synchronous}} <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> {{were made}} obsolete by mercury arc rectifiers in the 1930s {{and later on}} by semiconductor rectifiers in the 1960s. Some of the original New York City Subway substations using synchronous <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> operated until 1999. Compared to the rotary converter, the mercury arc and semiconductor rectifiers did not need daily maintenance, manual synchronizing for parallel operation, nor skilled personnel, and they provided clean DC power. This enabled the new substations to be unmanned, only requiring periodic visits from a technician for inspection and maintenance.|$|E

50|$|Motor-{{generators}} {{and steam}} turbine generators were the original power sources on the PRR traction power network.

Although the converting machines are frequently called 'rotary converters' or 'rotary frequency converters', they are not the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> used frequently by subways to convert low-frequency alternating current to DC power. The converters used are more precisely described as motor generators and consist of two synchronous AC machines on a common shaft with different ratios of poles; they are not electrically connected as in a true <b>rotary</b> <b>converter.</b>|$|R
