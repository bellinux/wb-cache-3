5|$|The film {{ends with}} Abraham's narration, {{examining}} {{the life that}} Silk has led, and he questions whether the consequences she faced from her actions were justified or not. He concludes by realizing that {{we will never know}} if her way of life was <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong,</b> or if we should judge her at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} compliance {{model is}} a regulatory framework or model known as dualistic, where the regulator reacts to an entity's behaviours {{depending on whether the}} behaviour is seen as either <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b> This is also known as a black and white response, and is often used for strict liability offences in law.|$|E
5|$|Less formally: Consider all {{possible}} (not actual) worlds {{in which you}} always choose the right. In all those, {{there will be a}} subpart of the world that says you were free to choose a certain <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> action, but does not say whether you chose it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then you'd chose the wrong.|$|E
60|$|Then {{of course}} there was more fighting, as every one knew would happen, except the British Colonial Office; indeed all Zululand ran with blood. For in England Cetewayo and his <b>rights,</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrongs,</b> had, like the Boers and their <b>rights,</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrongs,</b> become a matter of Party {{politics}} to which everything else must give way. Often I wonder whether Party politics will not in the end prove the ruin of the British Empire. Well, thank Heaven, I shall not live to learn.|$|R
40|$|To many, the <b>rights</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrongs</b> of the Gulf War semed a {{straightforward}} issue. To others, {{the war was}} fraught with moral dilemmas. ALR brought together federal Minister for Administrative Services Nick Bolkus and Democrats 2 ̆ 7 leader Janet Powell to debate the issues. The discussion was conducted in Canberra in Februar...|$|R
5000|$|Why {{exactly a}} {{criticism}} is [...] "unhealthy" [...] {{can be difficult}} to prove, nevermind its <b>rights</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrongs</b> - it could be subjective interpretation, a matter of personal likes and dislikes, or a matter of point of view. What is [...] "healthy" [...] or [...] "unhealthy" [...] might depend on the context, or on how it is understood.|$|R
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Conviction, {{the game}} {{would have no}} {{interactive}} torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and {{it was hoped that}} players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray and there are no <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.|$|E
5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain actions are <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b> Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XII, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} released by Square Enix in 2006, {{revolves around the}} attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the cadre of other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their stories were created by Yasumi Matsuno. The characters were designed to look and behave unlike any that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their stories were written to create a script where neither side was truly <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong,</b> but instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b> The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E

50|$|Taranauts {{combines}} many genres, including fantasy, {{adventure and}} science fiction, with elements of mystery and satire. Characters are not portrayed as intrinsically good or evil, but as having made the <b>right</b> - <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> - choices.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father was}} a cousin of mine--second cousin, I think. I fancy there was some row between your {{grandfather}} {{and the rest of}} the family. I don't know anything about the <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrongs</b> of it; for it was, of course, many years before we were born; and I never heard of your father's existence, until a fortnight before I left England. Then there were some inquiries made about the family, owing to various deaths that took place in it. Do you know that your father was related--distantly of course--to the Earl of Netherly?" ...|$|R
25|$|Interventions {{in primary}} schools were started during the '80s, {{with the basic}} {{objective}} of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> based upon what is and isn't allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told {{that they can have}} their own feelings about themselves, and informed on who to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{question}} rounds, Beat the Buzzer {{is open for}} all teams to answer. Simon Reeve reads out questions to all contestants, who buzz in to answer. This is the most competitive segment of the show as teams attempt to buzz in before other teams in order to score points (10 per correct question). Beat the Buzzer is a speed round lasting for 45 seconds. If the team answers a question after time is up, the team would not gain or lose 10 points regardless if it's <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} scholarly {{discussion of}} sati, {{whether it is}} <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong,</b> {{is found in the}} Sanskrit literature dated to 10th- to 12th-century. The earliest known commentary on sati by Medhatithi of Kashmir argues that sati is a form of suicide, which is prohibited by the Vedic tradition. Vijnanesvara, of the 12th-century Chalukya court, and the 13th-century Madhvacharya, argue that sati should not to be considered suicide, which was otherwise variously banned or discouraged in the scriptures. They offer a combination of reasons, both in favor and against sati.|$|E

2500|$|The {{series was}} criticised for {{not dealing with}} the <b>rights</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrongs</b> of British policy in Afghanistan, however Kemp stated [...] "we {{did not go to}} make a {{so-called}} traditional documentary, we tried to show was what the ordinary soldiers are facing" [...] and [...] "My documentary is about {{what it is like to}} be a British soldier in Afghanistan." [...] While the series was not to be a political piece according to Kemp, he did consider the Iraq invasion was [...] "a mistake", but believed the British involvement in Afghanistan to be a just war.|$|R
60|$|Because of {{this she}} felt angered now with every one quite indiscriminately. A {{few years ago}} her sense of justice would have caused her to sift this matter through, to test for herself the <b>rights</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrongs</b> of an {{obviously}} bitter quarrel; but lately this sense of justice had become blunted, through many affronts to her personal dignity as a Queen and as a wife. It had left her with a morbid egotistical regard for the majesty of her Court: this she felt had been attainted; and now she only longed to get away, and leave behind her all this vulgarity, these passions, these petty quarrels, which she so cordially abhorred.|$|R
25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.|$|E
25|$|The Charvaka {{epistemology}} holds perception as {{the primary}} and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> and therefore conditional or invalid. Perceptions are of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt. Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that is suspect – sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable {{means by which the}} efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established.|$|E
25|$|On July 26, 2006, {{after three}} days of deliberations, Yates was found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, as defined by the state of Texas. She was {{thereafter}} committed to the North Texas State Hospital–Vernon Campus. In January 2007, she was moved to a low security state mental hospital in Kerrville. Although psychiatrists for both Texas' state prosecutors and her defense lawyers agreed that she was severely mentally ill with one of several psychotic diseases at the time she killed her children, the state of Texas asserted that she was by legal definition aware enough to judge her actions as <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong</b> despite her mental defect. The prosecution further implied spousal revenge as motive for the killings, despite the conclusion of defense experts that there was no evidence to support such a motive. Although the original jury believed she was legally aware of her actions, they disagreed that her motive was spousal-revenge.|$|E
60|$|Now,--though I {{could not}} well say so to Zenobia,--I had not smiled from any unworthy {{estimate}} of woman, or in {{denial of the}} claims which she is beginning to put forth. What amused and puzzled me was the fact, that women, however intellectually superior, so seldom disquiet themselves about the <b>rights</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrongs</b> of their sex, unless their own individual affections chance to lie in idleness, or to be ill at ease. They are not natural reformers, but become such by the pressure of exceptional misfortune. I could measure Zenobia's inward trouble by the animosity with which she now took up the general quarrel of woman against man.|$|R
5000|$|McCluskey {{stated that}} he [...] "wasn't really {{politically}} motivated to write the song", which was informed by a fascination with World War II bombers. He hoped the track [...] "conveyed an ambivalence about {{whether it was the}} <b>right</b> <b>or</b> the <b>wrong</b> thing to do".|$|R

25|$|Later, Nina was {{approached}} by the CEO of Mishima Financial Empire, Jin Kazama who had already launched war around the world, to be his personal bodyguard and enters The King of Iron Fist Tournament 6 to intercept any possible threat to him, which Nina accepted. Meanwhile, Anna, who vows to take revenge at Nina becomes Kazuya Mishima's personal bodyguard, knowing she is bound to {{come face to face}} with Nina along the way. In the Scenario Campaign mode of the console version of Tekken 6, she served as one of the antagonist for the most part, assisting Jin at his scheme. After Jin sacrificed himself to kill Azazel at the end, she told Lars that she already knew Jin's plans about the world war since the beginning; so he can awaken Azazel's physical body, but she was unsure whether Jin's actions were <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b> She then left with a Mishima Zaibatsu helicopter, which may or may not signify that she became Mishima Zaibatsu's temporary new CEO during Jin's disappearance.|$|E

Andre Braugher doesn't judge Frank Pembleton about being <b>right</b> <b>or</b> <b>wrong.</b> It's {{a way for}} me to remain blessedly free of conscience. But for me the beauty of that scene was that we really dared to get into it. Typically in TV shows we skim over the edges of issues like water spiders, spouting platitudes and spouting unearned 'clarifying' emotions. But there were no violins strumming in 'Black and Blue'." ...|$|E
