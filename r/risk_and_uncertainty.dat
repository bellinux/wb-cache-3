25|$|In 1992, in the Journal of <b>Risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>Uncertainty,</b> Kahneman and Tversky {{gave their}} revised account of {{prospect}} theory that they called cumulative prospect theory. The new theory eliminated the editing phase in prospect theory and focused {{just on the}} evaluation phase. Its main feature was that it allowed for non-linear probability weighting in a cumulative manner, which was originally suggested in John Quiggin's rank dependent utility theory.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s {{cognitive}} psychology began to shed more {{light on the}} brain as an information processing device (in contrast to behaviorist models). Psychologists in this field, such as Ward Edwards, Amos Tversky, and Daniel Kahneman began to compare their cognitive models of decision-making under <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> to economic models of rational behavior. In mathematical psychology, there is a longstanding interest in the transitivity of preference {{and what kind of}} measurement scale utility constitutes.|$|E
25|$|A {{major reason}} why {{quantified}} models of utility are influential {{today is that}} <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory. Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies risk aversion. In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of prudence, which means convex marginal utility.|$|E

25|$|On 1 April 2013 a {{new system}} of {{business}} rates retention began in England. Before April 2013 all business rate income collected by councils formed a single, national pot, which was then distributed by government in the form of formula grant. Through the Local Government Finance Act 2012, and regulations that followed, the Government gave local authorities the power to keep up to half of business rate income and transfer half of it centrally, to central government. The central share is then distributed to councils in the form of Revenue Support Grant. The other half kept by local authorities are then subjected to tariff, levy, top up and safety payments depending on the financial position of the council. According to the government the change gives financial incentives to councils to grow their local economies and increase their income from business rates. At the same time the new scheme has resulted in more <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty.</b>|$|E

40|$|Rapid market changes {{aimed at}} {{sustainability}} {{have led to}} supply chain <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in the Taiwanese light-emitting diode industry.

30|$|StochPV is a {{computer}} programme enabling the <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> inherent in even-aged timber growing to be recognised through stochastic analysis. Most financial analyses of even-aged plantation or forest stands have used deterministic analyses, such that a single set of volumes, costs and prices yields a single answer for the present value. <b>Risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are ignored, even though well-recognised by practitioners. StochPV provides a probability distribution, not just a single value, for {{the present value of}} an even-aged stand, allowing practitioners to better gauge their decisions regarding the impact of <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> on silvicultural options and stand valuation. More generally, it will enable analysts to explore whether or when deterministic analyses are a reliable guide for such decisions.|$|R

Recovery plans need to consider both biologic and economic consequences in order to reduce <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> to ensure successful implementation of the plan.

2500|$|The Kyoto {{mechanism}} {{is the only}} internationally agreed mechanism for regulating carbon credit activities, [...] and, crucially, includes checks for additionality and overall effectiveness. Its supporting organisation, the UNFCCC, is the only organisation with a global mandate on the overall effectiveness of emission control systems, although enforcement of decisions relies on national co-operation. The Kyoto trading period only applies for five years between 2008 and 2012. The {{first phase of the}} EU ETS system started before then, and is expected to continue in a third phase afterwards, and may co-ordinate with whatever is internationally agreed at but there is general uncertainty as to what will be agreed in Post–Kyoto Protocol negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions. As business investment often operates over decades, this adds <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> to their plans. As several countries responsible for a large proportion of global emissions (notably USA, India, China) have avoided mandatory caps, this also means that businesses in capped countries may perceive themselves to be working at a competitive disadvantage against those in uncapped countries as they are now paying for their carbon costs directly.|$|E
6000|$|That the East India Company having thought {{proper to}} create the office of Advocate-General in Bengal, and to appoint Sir John Day to that office, it was {{resolved}} by a General Court of Proprietors that a salary of three thousand pounds a year {{should be allowed to}} the said Sir John Day, in full consideration of all demands and allowances whatsoever for his services to the Company at the Presidency of Fort William. That the said Warren Hastings, nevertheless, shortly after Sir John Day's arrival in Bengal, did increase the said Sir John Day's salary and allowances to six thousand pounds a year, in direct disobedience of the resolution of the Court of Proprietors, and of the order of the Court of Directors. That the Directors, {{as soon as they were}} informed of this proceeding, declared, [...] "that they held themselves bound by the resolution of the General Court, and that they could not allow it to be disregarded by the Company's servants in India," [...] and ordered that the increased allowances should be forthwith discontinued. That the said Warren Hastings, after having first thought it necessary, in obedience to the orders of the Court of Directors, to stop the extraordinary allowance which he had granted to Sir John Day, did afterwards resolve that the allowance which had been struck off should be repaid to him, upon his signing an obligation to refund the amount which he might receive, in case the Directors should confirm their former orders, already twice given. That in this transaction the said Warren Hastings trifled with the authority of the Company, eluded the repeated orders of the Directors, and exposed the Company to the <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of recovering, at a distant period, and perhaps by a process of law, a sum of money which they had positively ordered him not to pay.|$|E
