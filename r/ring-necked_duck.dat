40|$|The post-fledging {{period is}} one of the least studied {{portions}} of the annual cycle in waterfowl. Yet, recruitment into the breeding population requires that young birds have sufficient resources to survive this period. We used radio-telemetry and generalized estimating equations to examine support for four hypotheses regarding the drivers of landscape scale habitat use and movements made by juvenile <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks</b> between the pre-fledging period and departure for migration. Our response variables included the probability of movement, distances moved, and use of different lake types: brood-rearing lakes, staging lakes, and lakes with low potential for disturbance. Birds increased their use of staging areas and lakes with low potential for disturbance (i. e., without houses or boat accesses, > 100 m from roads, or big lakes with areas where birds could sit undisturbed) throughout the fall, but these changes began {{before the start of the}} hunting season and their trajectory was not changed by the onset of hunting. Males and females moved similar distances and had similar probabilities of movements each week. However, females were more likely than males to use brood-rearing lakes later in the fall. Our findings suggest juvenile <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks</b> require different lake types throughout the fall, and managing solely for breeding habitat will be insufficient for meeting needs during the post-fledging period. Maintaining areas with low potential for disturbance and areas suitable for staging will ensure that <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks</b> have access to habitat throughout the fall...|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} coots and gallinules have been {{recorded}} engaging in kleptoparasitism. American coots often feed {{in the company of}} other waterfowl species, and occasionally will rob diving ducks—including <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks,</b> redheads and canvasback—when they surface with food. Eurasian coots steal from conspecifics, as well as from diving and dabbling ducks, and swans. Allen's gallinules rob both conspecifics and African pygmy geese.|$|R
50|$|Located at the {{junction}} of the Madawaska, York and Little Mississippi Rivers south of the village of Combermere, it was named after Robert Conroy, an Ottawa Valley lumber baron who held timber harvesting rights in the area. The wetland includes sections of marsh, fen and swamp. Plants found here include wild rice and wild cranberries. Animals include bald eagles, ospreys, river otters and various <b>ducks</b> including <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a time budget from 220. 5 hours of observations of <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>Ducks</b> wintering on four wetlands in north central Florida. Foraging and resting were the dominant activities occupying 3040 % and 3942 % of the 24 -hour period, respectively. Most foraging {{occurred during the}} three hour periods following sunrise and preceding sunset. Maintenance behaviour composed 4 - 9 %, swimming 4 - 8 % and alert behaviour 4 - 7 % of diel activities. Other behaviours, including flying, aggression and courtship, were less than 1 %. No differences in behaviour partitioning were detected among years or months, or between sexes, but time budgets differed among time periods. Time males spent in alert behaviour was associated with wind direction and habitat type, and time males spent swimming was associated with habitat type. Two methods were used to estimate daily energy expenditure (DEE), which varied from 123 to 169 kcal/bird/day. <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>Ducks</b> would need to consume 3, 3704, 170 Hydrilla vertic illata tubers per day to meet these energy requirements...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to mallards and Canada geese the park attracts {{large numbers of}} northern shovelers, gadwall, as well as American and Eurasian wigeon, redhead, lesser and greater scaup, bufflehead, ruddy ducks, northern pintail, green-winged teal, hooded mergansers, <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks,</b> American black ducks, and other rarer duck species. And there are also pied-billed grebe, double-crested cormorants, American coots {{and other kinds of}} non-duck waterfowl. Many other birds may also be seen from warblers to raptors.|$|R
50|$|Migratory {{non-game birds}} like the {{northern}} harrier, American bittern and {{great blue heron}} depend on habitat around Umbagog Lake. Abundant fish populations and wetland habitat support {{one of the highest}} concentrations of nesting osprey in New Hampshire. The areas forested wetlands support good numbers of black <b>ducks,</b> <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks,</b> and goldeneye. Wood ducks, mallards, hooded and common mergansers also nest in the area. The lake provides habitat for migrating scaup, three varieties of scoters and Canada geese.|$|R

50|$|The birds {{reflect the}} landscape. Many birds use the {{deciduous}} forest to {{nest in the}} spring. These include rose-breasted grosbeaks, black-throated green warblers, ovenbirds, and great crested flycatchers. The wetlands provide migratory resting areas for large numbers of ducks, particularly wood ducks, hooded mergansers and <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks.</b> Wood ducks and hooded mergansers often nest. There are recorded nests of both heron and osprey, and for about a decade in the 1970s there was a heronry of more than thirty nests. There are also records of nesting turkey vultures. Owing {{in part to the}} quality of the forest, there are at least four species of woodpeckers: downy, hairy, yellow-bellied sapsucker, and pileated. Barred owls are regularly heard and seen.|$|R
50|$|The refuge's history {{centers around}} the 4500 acre Rice Lake which, for {{thousands}} of years, has supplied an abundant wild rice crop. Each fall, the bountiful rice attracts {{hundreds of thousands of}} waterfowl, as well as American Indians who harvest it using traditional methods. Rice Lake is known for its tremendous number of <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks.</b> Because of the high concentrations of migratory birds, Rice Lake Refuge has been designated as a Globally Important Bird Area by the American Birding Association.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{location}} in east-central Louisiana, {{this area is}} influenced by both the Mississippi and Central Flyways. These highways in the sky are the route for millions of duck and geese each spring and fall. Although mallards, gadwall and green-winged teal are the most abundant waterfowl species on the refuge; wood ducks, blue-winged teal, northern shovelers, northern pintails, and widgeon are also plentiful. Diving ducks such as scaup and <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks</b> use deeper refuge waters. Canada, snow and white-fronted geese can sometimes be observed feeding in harvested croplands.|$|R

50|$|The refuge {{encompasses}} backwater sloughs, shrub-steppe uplands, irrigated farmlands, river islands, delta mudflats, and riparian areas. Particularly {{important to}} Canada geese, mallards, and wigeons, {{as well as}} shorebirds and wading birds, the refuge also includes wetlands and shoreline bays that serve as an important nursery for developing fall chinook salmon. Other waterfowl species using the refuge include green-winged teal, shoveler, canvasback, <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks,</b> and lesser scaups. Birds, including bald eagles and peregrine falcons, are found here, as are thousands of colonial nesting water birds using river islands for safe nesting.|$|R
50|$|Winter {{residents}} include large {{flocks of}} ducks, geese, and swans {{winter in the}} Sound. In West Haven, Connecticut 8,000 scaup (also called broadbills or bluebills) were regularly counted in the 1970s. Greater scaup, black ducks, mallards, and Canada geese are the most abundant wintering birds. There are also significant populations of red-breasted mergansers, common goldeneyes, buffleheads, scoters, American wigeons (also sometimes called baldpate), canvasbacks, oldsquaws and mute swans. Others (less abundant) include gadwalls, northern pintails, green-winged teal, northern shovelers (also sometimes called broadbill), ruddy <b>ducks,</b> redheads, <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks,</b> snow geese, and brant.|$|R
50|$|Franz and Arthur lakes contain healthy {{stands of}} wapato (Sagittaria latifolia), which provide an {{important}} wintering habitat for tundra swans and other waterfowl. As many as 1,000 wintering tundra swans {{have been observed}} on Franz Lake. Other common waterfowl include western Canada geese, mallards, northern pintails, gadwalls, green-winged teal, northern shovelers, canvasbacks, <b>ring-necked</b> <b>ducks,</b> and American wigeon. The refuge also provides abundant habitat for wading birds such as great blue herons and rails, as well as songbirds that use grass/sedge meadows, cattail ponds, willow thickets, and riparian forests. Other wildlife commonly observed on the refuge include gulls, band-tailed pigeons, red-tailed hawks, crows, killdeer, western painted turtles, Pacific tree frogs, western toads, garter snakes, and California ground squirrels.|$|R
