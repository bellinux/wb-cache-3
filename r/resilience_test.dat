We assumed that, considering {{the specifics of the}} chosen profession, resilience in the psychology students would increase from the first year to the fourth. The research involved 67 students of 1 — 4 years with an average age of 19, 72 years. The data of the <b>resilience</b> <b>test</b> revealed the following: the second-year students displayed higher rates of general resilience as compared to the students of other years; the first-year students showed the lowest rates of resilience in the sample. The outcomes of our research may be used in the design of programmes of social psychological support for university students...|$|E

Quantifying this complexity is not an easy task. In this paper, we introduce the "Legislation Network" as a novel approach to address related problems. We have collected an extensive data set of a more than 60 -year old legislation corpus, as published in the Official Journal of the European Union, and we further analysed it as a complex network, thus gaining insight into its topological structure. Among other issues, we have performed a temporal analysis of the evolution of the Legislation Network, as well as a robust <b>resilience</b> <b>test</b> to assess its vulnerability under specific cases that may lead to possible breakdowns. Results are quite promising, showing that our approach can lead towards an enhanced explanation in respect to the structure and evolution of legislation properties...|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} study was undertaken and a field test section was constructed {{to study the}} rate of pavement deterioration which results when topsoil is used in construction of a subgrade. An extensive laboratory testing program showed that the Proctor density of topsoil was less than for parent material and results indicated that this difference may be approximated by a change in plastic limit. A <b>resilience</b> <b>test</b> was developed to compare the elastic properties of top­soil and parent material. A theoretical relationship between elastic properties and depth of cover over topsoil and thickness of the topsoil layer was developed and various combinations were calculated on a computer. The results were plotted on graphs which {{may be used in}} subgrade design. A topsoil test section was constructed to check the accuracy of the theoretical deflection increase. It was found that the predicted deflection increase compared closely to the actual measured deflection increase. The deflection increased as the depth of cover decreased and the thickness of the topsoil layer increased. The accuracy of the predicted deflection increase and the loss in riding qualities resulting from topsoil in the subgrade should be studied further in future test sections...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reflects}} on the perceptions of resilience of more than fifty early career secondary teachers and is intended as the initial stage of a longitudinal research inquiry. It focuses on how the resilience of new entrants to the teaching profession is challenged and eroded, but also sustained and nurtured, in the initial year of teacher training and as a newly qualified teacher. Drawing on bricolage, the inquiry is qualitative in approach, using a range of methods, including a <b>resilience</b> <b>test,</b> questionnaires, interviews {{and a range of}} creative writing approaches, to explore deeper insights into the experiences and perspectives of early career teachers. This thesis complements important work in the field, including Gu and Day (2013) and Johnson et al., (2015), by adopting a wide-ranging and creative approach to gathering evidence from a group of early career teachers. The honesty and vulnerability of the participants has inspired me to consider ways in which resilience may be fostered {{at the beginning of a}} career in teaching. Clear implications for a more holistic view of the individual teacher at the heart of initial teacher education are highlighted as a result. Recommendations are made for changes to provision in initial teacher education, including a stronger focus on the emotional aspects of the teacher’s role, and a re-thinking of reflective practice and mentoring as part of transformational learning in the teaching profession...|$|E

40|$|Resilience is an {{important}} trait, which enables people to successfully recover from difficulties and stress. For teachers, resilience is of vital importance, as it offers different ways and solutions to successfully cope with difficult and stressful situations they face on a daily basis. The way teachers experience and react to stress often affects their pupils, who are {{under a lot of}} stress as well. Teachers could help and teach them how to cope with stressful situations by spending some school time on the subject. To our best knowledge, the resilience of teachers in Slovenia is not well researched yet. The object of the present work is therefore to investigate the resilience of primary school teachers and determine what factors influence their readiness to encourage pupils to develop their own resilience. The research was made by surveying 103 teachers from 16 primary schools in Slovenia. The teachers filled out a <b>Resilience</b> <b>test</b> and a Questionnaire on their readiness to encourage pupils to develop their own resilience. The results have shown that teachers generally exhibit a high degree of resilience. According to the survey, they feel most resilient in their ability to control events. These were followed by factor related to the positive acceptance of change and secure relationships; teachers notion of personal competence, high standard and tenacity. Teachers feel less resilient at trusting themselves in dealing with difficulties and lastly at spirituality. We did not find any significant influence of age/years of service on resilience of teachers. There are several factors which influences on teacher's readiness to enhance children's resilience. The findings suggest that most teachers approve and support programs for developing pupil's resilience. Most teachers perceive school climate as supportive and think they have good conditions for the implementation of programs which promotes pupils resilience. While teachers are prepared to promote the socio-emotional development in pupils, they consider it less important than promoting the development of their thinking. Although most teachers are aware of their role in promoting the resilience of their pupils, some of them consider it a responsibility of parents and some do not consider themselves enough competent for the task. Based on our research we also discovered that the more resilient teachers are more keen on helping their pupils develop resilience as well...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{we present}} an {{evaluation}} of the performance and error robustness of RTP-based broadcast streaming of high-quality high-definition (HD) H. 264 /AVC video. Using a fully controlled IP test bed (Hillestad et al., 2005), we broadcast high-definition video over RTP/UDP, and use an IP network emulator to introduce a varying amount of randomly distributed packet loss. A high-performance network interface monitoring card is used to capture the video packets into a trace file. Purpose-built software parses the trace file, analyzes the RTP stream and assembles the correctly received NAL units into an H. 264 /AVC Annex B byte stream file, which is subsequently decoded by JVT JM 10. 1 reference software. The proposed measurement setup is a novel, practical and intuitive approach to perform error <b>resilience</b> <b>testing</b> of real-world H. 264 /AVC broadcast applications. Through a series of experiments, we evaluate some of the error resilience features of the H. 264 /AVC standard, and see how they perform at packet loss rates from 0. 01 % to 5 %. The results confirmed that an appropriate slice partitioning scheme is essential to have a graceful degradation in received quality in the case of packet loss. While flexible macroblock ordering reduces the compression efficiency about 1 dB for our test material, reconstructed video quality is improved for loss rates above 0. 25 %...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{qualitative}} study conducted in Nepal between 2007 and 2010 explored resilience among 33 war-affected and internally displaced widows in Nepal and probed how they conceptualized experiences of displacement and widowhood. With {{a mix of}} grounded-theory and phenomenology approaches, the thematic findings of these widows' emic perspectives provided insight into their context of vulnerability, their internal mechanism for capacity development, and their motivations for livelihood strategies and activities as they coped with or even thrived under adversities. The {{findings of this study}} offered clues that theorizing resilience needed to consider conceptual frameworks and models of resilience from psychosocial, ontological, and ecological perspectives. A post hoc literature review provided the basis for the development and proposal of the Integrative System Model of Resilience from the aforementioned perspectives and knowledge domains. This model acknowledges the systemic risk factors for less-resilient outcomes and the need to minimize their effects while assuming that adaptive change is possible without decreasing risk factors necessarily. Moreover, the model proposes {{that it is possible to}} influence and induce adaptive change in each individual and in clusters of individuals to lead to resilient outcomes. Results from focus groups and in-depth interviews among 33 widows suggested that this model could be a helpful tool to explain the adaptive cycle of individuals facing adversity. The narratives of 5 widows who demonstrated relatively high degrees of <b>resilience</b> <b>tested</b> the model. This model adds to the growing body of theoretical and empirical research on the concept of resilience. Additionally, the model may serve as a helpful framework for educational intervention strategies to help individuals develop resilience in settings of adversity.

Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) represent dense urban areas within cities where the temperature is recordedto be higher than the neighbouring areas or those located in suburbia. Mitigation of UHI effects can help diminish detriments of climate change. This paper sets out to establish UHI mitigation strategies, their effectiveness and resilience to help provide recommendations for application of such strategies in future. Existing literature suggest that UK is facing with growing problem of UHI effects and sustainable development at urban scale can be improved if proportionate measures are taken to mitigate those effects. The lack of guidance for designers and planners with regards to UHI mitigation is also indicated in the literature where trees, shrubs and grass (TSG), use of high albedo materials (HAM) in external building surfaces and urban inland water bodies (UIWB) are identified as effective measures to mitigate UHI.

This particular community was affected by a series of flood events in 2010 / 2011, one of which necessitated the total evacuation of the entire town. The results from the study highlighted concepts associated with community resilience including: social connectedness, optimistic acceptance, learning tolerance and patience, and learning from the past for the future.

The small dependence of resource-use efficiency on land-use diversity can be positive as well as negative. We conclude that diversification as a strategy to enhance farm resilience does not necessarily constrain resource-use efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Office {{work today}} {{has been found}} to be much more emotionally {{demanding}} than in the past. The current environment in which organizations operate is full of turbulence and competitive pressure, which influences the employees as well. Businesses are in constant search of different ways of making their staff more productive to increase the efficiency of their companies. Resilience, which stands for an ability to bounce back from adversity and stressful situations, is therefore called for in the positions of many office workers. This research aims at finding out what the role of the organization is in the resilience of its employees. Recognizing and utilizing the most effective ways of improving the staff’s resilience would presumably increase not only the level of performance of the staff but also of the entire company. In order to spot the different factors in an organization to affect the employees’ resilience, a mixed methods research was conducted in a case company. <b>Resilience</b> <b>tests</b> were first arranged in the company to collect quantitative data on the sample, but the emphasis of the study was on the semi-structured interviews that provided a qualitative approach on the matter. The focus of the study was on the group of professional and managerial staff, that consists of different kinds of knowledge workers and specialists. The results suggest that there are both positive and negative factors in an organization that affect the staff in terms of resilience. Increasing awareness of resilience and providing tools for improving it is one of the most important actions that a company’s management can take. However, it was also noticed that by buffering some of the negative factors in the business environment, the process can be further supported. Change proved out to be a highly negative factor in the company, which is why an increase in the flow of information, managerial support and visibility of management would be recommended. Resilience could also be utilized in recruiting for positions with a high risk of adversity and in team building to increase diversity and thus make more valuable teams...|$|R
40|$|Aim of paper: This is {{a report}} on the {{preliminary}} findings of an ongoing prospective, longitudinal study which aims {{to assess the impact of}} combining values-based recruitment and <b>resilience</b> <b>testing</b> on student performance and retention over a period of three years. Background: Student attrition rates have long been regarded as a major challenge for Higher Education Institutions (HEI) and cost the NHS approximately £ 99 million a year. Attrition affects students’ self-esteem as well as healthcare organisations challenged by nursing shortages. Some risk factors identified as contributing to high attrition include stress, course-related difficulties, loss of motivation and personal reasons. It has also been recognised that the students enrolled on nursing programmes differ from traditional university students and may therefore require different support to progress and complete successfully. Greater insight into the relationship between these factors is needed to enable HEIs to predict those most likely to struggle, develop tailored interventions and thereby reduce attrition. Methods: Participants in the current study are 63 nursing and midwifery students who commenced their programmes in 2013 / 14. Data were collected using a battery of tests at the beginning of the course (T 1) and one year into the studies (T 2). Data on academic performance, personal stressors such as financial hardship and sickness/absence during placement were also collected (T 2) using the Student Requirements Prediction Tool. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: At both T 1 and T 2, there was a positive correlation between resilience and empathy scores and negative correlation between perceived stress and resilience. The data on academic performance and the effects of sickness revealed a positive correlation with perceived stress but no correlation with empathy and resilience scores at T 2. Conclusions: The data for this sample indicate that students who perceive higher levels of stress require further support. Personal stressors may potentially be as damaging to successful progression as academic difficulties. Suitable interventions to address these issues will be further discussed...|$|R

40|$|Resilience is a {{relatively}} new concept in computer security that is continuing to evolve. The research community has not settled on an exact definition for resilience, but most agree that this security property should include resistence to attack, damage recovery, and the ability for a system to learn and better resist such an attack in the future. Much of the existing research has focused on resilience solely in terms of availability, or in defining metrics to describe and compare the resilience of systems. The goal of this dissertation is to not only explore the possibility of a more general framework for resilience, but to also analyze the effectiveness of methods and technologies {{that can be used to}} measure and provide resilience. The dissertation begins by covering common elements of computer security, providing exam- ples, addressing vulnerabilities and exploits, and suggesting potential solutions. In later sections, we examine the feasibility of the proposed solutions. Alternative solutions are compared in the context of a network’s priorities, abilities, and dependencies. Our work is inspired by the need for better security metrics in order to quantitatively evaluate and compare different systems and networks. A robust set of metrics that describe the security and recovery features of systems can provide a foundation for at least two key concepts: a network resilience communication protocol and a <b>resilience</b> <b>testing</b> framework. The communication protocol could help network administrators maintain and improve the resilience of their networks. It would facilitate communication between systems on the network so that potential threats can be quickly identified and so that changes can be made autonomously to reduce the impact of a threat without the need for human intervention. The testing framework can be used to <b>test</b> a system’s <b>resilience</b> to specific attacks, packaged as portable modules. Network administrators can use data and visualization results of this framework to make informed decisions about how to improve their resilience. The communication protocol may be able to analyze results from the testing framework to improve a network’s resilience. The goal of these two projects would be to develop solutions that can improve the resilience of networks in general, taking into account their size, security requirements, and critical functions...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study with samples from three countries (Germany, Russia, and China) is to extend findings on mental health (MH) and value orientations to broader MH indicators and two types of mediators, i. e. social support and resilience in accordance to a theory of values and modernization/postmodernization. The multisite study was conducted in the three countries. A path-model with traditional values predicting MH mediated by social support, and modern values predicting MH mediated by <b>resilience</b> was <b>tested</b> in all three countries. As expected, value orientations were for the most part strongest in China, followed by Russia and Germany. Structural equation modeling supported the assumption of mediated prediction of MH by value orientations by and large. The traditional value benevolence predicts social support whereas the modern value self-direction predicts resilience. Value orientations are a sensitive tool to empirically describe cross-cultural differences. The findings indicate that personal value orientations are meaningful predictors of MH. The analysis of personal values shows promise in linking public health, cross-cultural and modernization issues...|$|R
40|$|Resilience is a multi-faceted concept but, in {{the context}} of learning, it can best be thought of as an individual’s {{capacity}} to create and maximise opportunities as well as responding positively to setbacks and challenges. Developing students’ resilience is becoming increasingly important. Research has shown resilience links to attainment, retention, engagement and employability. However, very little work has examined what aspects of curricula enhance resilience and the particular role of active learning frameworks in achieving this. Here, we analyse the effects of optional real-world internship placements on eight measures of <b>resilience.</b> Psychometric <b>testing</b> was conducted twice per student – at the start of their second academic year and again at the end. Students choosing an internship had significantly higher challenge orientation and adaptability scores than other students in the same cohort. Adaptability of both interns and non-interns improved over the academic year, but improvement was significantly higher for interns. Scores for optimism, purposeful direction, and ingenuity significantly increased between start-of-year and end-of-year tests for interns versus a decline for non-interns. We conclude that facilitating student engagement with real-world issues and challenges through supported internships within an active learning framework is an important mechanism for increasing students’ resilience...|$|R
