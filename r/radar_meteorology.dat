50|$|Reichelderfer quickly {{grasped the}} {{importance}} of technological advances and soon pursued radar as a weather observation and forecast tool. He advanced the study of climatology by overseeing {{the production of a}} forty-year series of carefully analyzed surface maps that showed weather patterns dating back to 1899. These aided World War II forecasts and also served as research guides. During the war years he also established an Air Mass and Frontal Analysis Center, which served as a model for other nations' weather services in the years following the war.After the war, “Reich” continued pressing forward, {{always on the lookout for}} new methods and new ideas. Continuing advances in <b>radar</b> <b>meteorology,</b> the introduction of computerized numerical weather prediction, and the development of a research arm studying such diverse topics as cloud seeding, severe storms, and patterns of radioactive material dispersal all happened during “Reich’s reign” throughout the 1950s. So did the beginnings of hurricane research programs, the Aircraft Operations Center, the National Severe Storms Laboratory, and the Air Resources Laboratory. Perhaps the greatest of weather observation innovations, the meteorological satellite, was also introduced during his tenure with the launch of TIROS I on April 1, 1960.|$|E

5000|$|Partly {{because of}} its common use by {{television}} meteorologists in on-air weather reporting, the specific term [...] "Doppler Radar" [...] has erroneously become popularly synonymous {{with the type of}} <b>radar</b> used in <b>meteorology.</b> Most modern weather radars use the pulse-Doppler technique to examine the motion of precipitation, but it is only a part of the processing of their data. So, while these radars use a highly specialized form of Doppler radar, the term is much broader in its meaning and its applications.|$|R

5000|$|A Doppler radar is a {{specialized}} radar {{that uses the}} Doppler effect to produce velocity data about objects at a distance. It does this by bouncing a microwave signal off a desired target and analyzing how the object's motion has altered {{the frequency of the}} returned signal. This variation gives direct and highly accurate measurements of the [...] component of a target's velocity relative to the radar. Doppler radars are used in aviation, sounding satellites, <b>meteorology,</b> <b>radar</b> guns, radiology and healthcare (fall detection and risk assessment, nursing or clinic purpose), and bistatic radar (surface-to-air missiles).|$|R
