500|$|Likewise, Beatty said {{he enjoyed}} the actual filming of the episodes but hated the {{television}} business end of it, claiming, [...] "I can't think of anything I would less <b>rather</b> <b>do</b> than television at this moment." [...] He said the process left him [...] "pretty much burnt" [...] and said his enthusiasm for the show had [...] "eroded as time goes on". It was initially reported that Beatty would not return for the second Homicide season at all because he had accepted a starring role in The Boys, a CBS comedy series also featuring Christopher Meloni. Polito {{said he did not}} believe Beatty's departure would hurt the show because of the ensemble nature of the cast: [...] "I love Ned's work, but the show won't fall apart because of one character." [...] Beatty ended up appearing in both shows, and The Boys was canceled after six episodes.|$|E

500|$|Due to lack {{of funds}} at the time (the building's initial budget doubled, ending up at $325,000 ($ in modern dollars) {{including}} furnishings), Richardson devoted most of his efforts to the building's exterior. A report from the Times Union states, [...] "There wasn't enough money for Richardson {{to do the job}} as thoroughly as he would have liked. He said in his writing that if there wasn't sufficient money, he'd <b>rather</b> <b>do</b> it right on the outside and leave it to a future generation to finish the interior. The interior was finished by city architects a good 30 years after Richardson built it." [...] The interior was redesigned by Ogden and Gander in 1917. The mayor's office is {{on the first floor of}} the tower, the Council chamber and offices are on the building's second floor, and the city clerk's office is on the second floor of the tower. The mayor's office contains a painting of the city's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler.|$|E
500|$|Beatrice {{left home}} when Mills {{was nine years}} old, which left her, her older brother Shane, and her younger sister, Fiona, {{in the care of}} their father. Mills said that her father once threw her brother against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons. The window broke and her brother had to be taken to hospital, where their father {{explained}} that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: [...] "Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I'm not ashamed to say that we were forced to steal because when you are a young child, you'd <b>rather</b> <b>do</b> that than face a beating from your father". (Their father disputed his daughters' allegations that he was violent towards them, later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales, showing Mills playing happily.) ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Carey Wilber pitched [...] "Space Seed" [...] to Star Trek {{producers}} Roddenberry, Gene Coon, and Robert Justman with an 18-page outline dated August 29, 1966. In the outline, Wilber {{envisioned the}} crew of Botany Bay as criminals sent on a 1,500-year journey to make room on Earth for others. Khan was represented as a Nordic criminal with a [...] "magnificent" [...] body, Harald Ericsson. The producers suggested changes to the outline {{in a series of}} memos; in memos dated September 7 and 9, Coon suggested significant changes to Ericsson. [...] "I want to <b>rather</b> <b>do</b> more with him than you have indicated in the story outline,” he wrote. Believing that Ericsson (misspelled as Erickson in the memo) could be a worthy adversary for Kirk, Coon suggested that the character be “in fact very similar to James Kirk, our captain, except that our captain has made an adjustment to this world and this culture [...] In other words, Carey, build us a giant of a man." ...|$|E

500|$|On 26 February 1821, Portuguese troops {{stationed}} in Rio de Janeiro mutinied. Neither JoãoVI nor his government made any move against the mutinous units. Pedro decided {{to act on}} his own and rode to meet the rebels. He negotiated with them and convinced his father to accept their demands, which included naming a new cabinet and making an oath of obedience to the forthcoming Portuguese Constitution. On 21 April, the parish electors of Rio de Janeiro met at the Merchants' Exchange to elect their representatives to the Cortes. A small group of agitators seized the meeting and formed a revolutionary government. Again, JoãoVI and his ministers remained passive, and the monarch was about to accept the revolutionaries' demands when Pedro took the initiative and sent army troops to re-establish order. Under pressure from the Cortes, JoãoVI and his family departed for Portugal on 26 April, leaving behind Pedro and Maria Leopoldina. Two days before he embarked, the King warned his son: [...] "Pedro, if Brazil breaks away, let it <b>rather</b> <b>do</b> so for you, who will respect me, than for one of those adventurers." ...|$|E
500|$|In early August 2001, Björk {{confirmed}} {{the first set}} of dates for the Vespertine World Tour which would take place at opera houses, theatres, and small venues, with favourable acoustics for the concerts. She enlisted Matmos, Zeena Parkins, a choir of Inuit girls from Greenland, and conductor Simon Lee; the tour opened at the Grand Rex in Paris on 18 August. While in Paris, she held a press conference to discuss the album but gave no individual interviews saying that: [...] "she'd <b>rather</b> <b>do</b> music than talk about it." [...] While in France she also received the National Order of Merit at the Ministry of National Education in [...] Paris. Another press conference was held in Barcelona on 3 November 2001 while touring in Spain.

A DVD release featuring a behind-the-scenes look at the tour, titled Minuscule, was released at the end of 2003. Vespertine Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Vespertine World Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box; it also includes a live version of [...] "All Is Full of Love", a song from [...] Homogenic.|$|E

Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter.

500|$|In the New Testament, all Christians are {{referred}} to as saints. However, the use of [...] "saint" [...] as a title for an individual who had led a good and exemplary life or who had been martyred began to develop in Christianity. By the time of the Reformation, the use of [...] "saint" [...] was almost exclusively the restrictive, titular sense. [...] One {{of the effects of the}} Reformation was to eliminate the abuses of the cult of saints, and as a result, it is a common misconception that Lutherans do not have (or <b>rather,</b> <b>do</b> not venerate) saints. However, the confessional documents of the Lutheran Church, particularly the Augsburg Confession, accept both the general and particular use of the word saints. [...] In regards to the titular sense, the Augsburg Confession commends that [...] "it should be taught among us that saints should be kept in remembrance so that our faith may be strengthened when we see what grace they received and how they were sustained in faith. Moreover, their good works are to be an example for us, each of us in his own calling." [...] Article XXI of The Apology to the Augsburg Confession goes further to describe three types of honor which are due to the saints and acknowledgment that the saints pray for the Church. However, the Augsburg Confession opposes prayer to saints, stating, [...] "Scripture does not teach calling on the saints or pleading for help from them. For it sets before us Christ alone as mediator, atoning sacrifice, high priest, and intercessor." ...|$|E
