To explore the fast dynamics of activity <b>within</b> <b>each</b> region and the interaction between them, we used electrocorticography recordings from 16 neurosurgical subjects implanted with grids of electrodes over these two regions and tracked the activity within and between the regions as subjects performed three different numerical tasks. Although our results reconfirm the presence of math-selective hubs within the VTC and LPC, we report here a remarkable heterogeneity of neural <b>responses</b> <b>within</b> <b>each</b> region at both millimeter and millisecond scales.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates Vermont principals 2 ̆ 7 {{perceptions of}} leadership attributes {{linked to the}} role of the principal. It is guided by four research questions: (1) are there any clusters of participants who sorted the principal leadership attribute items similarly and differently; (2) how are the principal leadership attribute items <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>factor</b> ranked by the participants; (3) to what extent do the participants <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>factor</b> similarly describe the leadership attributes; and (4) to what extent do the participants <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>factor</b> find leadership attributes to be most/least characteristic of their roles? Consequently, thirty-five Vermont principals participated in Q-sort activities, which involved sorting forty-five leadership statements from the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire had been validated in previous studies. Participants 2 ̆ 7 sorts were subjected to factor analysis to identify similarities and differences among sorts. The analysis of the data revealed the presence of two factors. Factor A members consisted of eighteen subjects who placed high value on leadership items linked to collective mission, purpose, and goal. Factor B members consisted of sixteen subjects who ranked high leadership attributes linked to collegiality and collaboration. The qualitative data provided further insight into factors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of leadership attributes. Because of the ways the factors sorted and reacted to leadership attributes, the two Factor A members were assigned the name mission-oriented, and Factor B members were assigned the name collaboration-oriented. The findings of this investigation revealed the emergence of the mission-oriented collaborative leadership. Under the mission-oriented collaborative leadership, school leaders witness individuals in their schools engage in fluid, genuine, reverential, and open conversations about the organization and processes group members will use to achieve community, state, and federal accountability expectations. The mission-oriented collaborative leadership style provides a synergy for meeting both the needs of the organization and the individuals who provide the human capital. Future research studies should focus on the effects mission-oriented collaborative leadership approach has on teachers 2 ̆ 7 productivity, local reform efforts in the schools, and student achievement as measured by state accountability systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Lack of a {{standard}} methodology {{has been one of}} the major obstacles preventing advancement of behavior analytic research in verbal behavior.

The effects of contingencies of reinforcement on verbal operants <b>within</b> <b>each</b> category are made immediately visible to the researcher as changes in frequency of response. Incorporating frequency of <b>response</b> <b>within</b> <b>each</b> category as the unit of response allows both rate and probability of verbal response to be utilized as basic dependent variables.

40|$|Each of {{the four}} human IgG subclasses {{exhibits}} a unique profile of effector functions relevant to the clearance and elimination of infecting microorganisms.

An inability to produce antibody of the optimally protective isotype can result in a selective immunodeficiency state. This is particularly apparent for responses to certain bacterial carbohydrate antigens that are normally of IgG 2 isotype. A failure to produce the appropriate specific antibody response may result in recurrent upper and/or lower respiratory tract infection. Careful patient investigation can identify such deficiencies and suggest appropriate clinical management.

Methods An exploratory-descriptive study was performed with 72 nursing staff. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaire containing 24 statements about the Quality Program; and the degree of agreement of the participants was expressed in a Likert scale. The collected data were analyzed by factor analysis and Pearson&# 8217;s correlation coefficient. Results The analysis grouped the statements in six factors. The Pearson&# 8217;s correlation coefficient defined a scale of influence of the variables <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>factor,</b> whose variable with the greatest impact in <b>each</b> <b>factor</b> is the priority issue for improving worker opinion about the Quality Program. The priority variables were to believe the Quality Program contributes to the hospital; to understand the program orientations; interest in hospital quality direction; and do not feel exhausted due to the program.

Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using standardized stereotactic coordinates to report brain responses to food cues were identified using online databases. Studies were grouped by food-cue modality as: i) tastes (8 studies); ii) odors (8 studies); and, iii) images (11 studies).

We found that despite heterogeneous neural <b>responses</b> <b>within</b> <b>each</b> population, the proportions of BLA-NAc neurons excited by reward predictive cues and of BLA-CeA neurons excited by aversion predictive cues were higher than within the entire BLA.

40|$|Resolving how {{the early}} {{signaling}} events initiated by cell–cell interactions are transduced into diverse functional outcomes necessitates correlated measurements at various stages. Typical approaches {{that rely on}} bulk cocultures and population-wide correlations, however, only reveal these relationships broadly at the population level, not <b>within</b> <b>each</b> individual cell. Here, we present a microfluidics-based cell–cell interaction assay that enables longitudinal investigation of lymphocyte interactions at the single-cell level through microfluidic cell pairing, on-chip culture, and multiparameter assays, and allows recovery of desired cell pairs by micromanipulation for off-chip culture and analyses. Well-defined initiation of interactions enables probing cellular responses from the very onset, permitting single-cell correlation analyses between early signaling dynamics and later-stage functional outcomes within same cells. We demonstrate the utility of this microfluidic assay with natural killer cells interacting with tumor cells, and our findings suggest a possible role for the strength of early calcium signaling in selective coordination of subsequent cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production.
