Accordingly, female <b>reporters</b> became a larger part of the newsroom, but male and female <b>reporters</b> were not being treated equally. For example, female <b>reporters</b> were assigned news topics that included human interest and education, and male <b>reporters</b> were assigned stories dealing with war and politics. Past research has examined bylines of small, medium, and large newspapers and the news topics male and female <b>reporters</b> have covered. The present study is a content analysis examining the years 1965, 1975, 1985, 1995, and 2005 of the New York Times. The study examined male and female bylines, along with topics of news stories, sources used by male and female <b>reporters,</b> and collective sources.

However, male <b>reporters</b> are writing about "feminine topics," such as education, and human interest.
