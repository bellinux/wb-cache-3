25|$|The main {{residence}} at Ridgedale farm is a high-style Greek Revival structure. The three-story brick house {{stands on a}} brick foundation an has an L-shaped plan. The house has a hip roof with a central square cupola and a widow's walk. The cupola has a window on each side with a 4 over 4 double-hung sash, and brackets under the <b>roof</b> <b>edge.</b> On the roof are five chimneys, one at each corner {{and one in the}} back ell with a slightly flared edge of corbels at the top, and a recessed panel in the center face.|$|E
25|$|The school uses {{an early}} example of all-glass curtain walling called the Hill System. Rather than use the common opaque, blue {{spandrel}} panels on the façade, Cadbury-Brown chose instead to just use glass panels. The {{corners of the}} building are glazed whilst {{the top of the}} curtain wall at the <b>roof</b> <b>edge</b> is neatly finished without a projecting edge (although the final detail was realised in felt rather than as designed in steel). Although the fireproof cladding for the columns behind make the building frame less visible, the building has been compared to those by Mies van de Rohe. The design has been considered comparable to the Eames House and Hunstanton School by Alison and Peter Smithson.|$|E
25|$|The {{main house}} has a balloon-frame {{structure}} on a concrete foundation. The roof is flat with a parapet wall running along the <b>roof</b> <b>edge</b> to conceal the asphalt roof. There is a large overhanging eave on the northeast front and north sides of the building. The exterior is covered with spatter-dashed stucco. The living room picture windows are casement style, set at a 110 degree angle. The remaining windows are a two-over-two double-hung type with horizontal muntins. The original doors were replaced in the 1970s. Unfortunately, there are no photographs of the originals doors so an appropriate Streamline Moderne style door with a round port window was installed during the 1996 renovation. The street front façade has three wide horizontal bands set out from the main wall surface that emphasize the design’s horizontal orientation.|$|E

25|$|Attached to {{the nave}} are {{the north and}} south aisles. The early 15th-century north aisle is of string-coursed ashlar, buttressed, with four windows of same {{appearance}} and stylerectilinear with inset three lights of simple round head, diamond-pattern leaded clear glazing, and flattened hood moulds. Three windows are placed on the north wall, the fourth serves as the aisle west window. Between the two north wall western windows is a simply moulded and slightly pointed door opening with hood mould and label stops, and a carved finial above. Within is a face-hinged oak door. The north aisle parapet is deeply crenellated to the same style as the tower battlements. Above the windows runs a moulding, defining the <b>roof</b> <b>edge</b> {{at the base of the}} parapet, holding two gargoyles which drain the aisle roof. Two double-stepped angle buttresses support the aisle on its north wall, with a third diagonal buttress at the north-west corner.|$|E
50|$|In a {{roof prism}} without a phase-correcting coating, s-polarized and p-polarized light each acquire a {{different}} geometric phase {{as they pass}} through the upper prism. When the two polarized components are recombined, interference between the s-polarized and p-polarized light results in a different intensity distribution perpendicular to the <b>roof</b> <b>edge</b> as compared to that along the <b>roof</b> <b>edge.</b> This effect reduces contrast and resolution in the image perpendicular to the <b>roof</b> <b>edge,</b> producing an inferior image compared to that from a porro prism erecting system. This <b>roof</b> <b>edge</b> diffraction effect may {{also be seen as}} a diffraction spike perpendicular to the <b>roof</b> <b>edge</b> generated by bright points in the image.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT 2) <b>Roof</b> <b>edges</b> which {{indicate}} a discontinuity in surface nor- mal {{but not in}} depth. <b>Roof</b> <b>edges</b> could be further classified This paper presents a 3 -D multiple object reco~nition as either convex or COncave. technique using Hough clustering. The objects are modeled as polyhedra and the input image is a range image contain-ing instances of the modeled objects. The features used for matching are surface discontinuity features namely dihedral junctions. Qualitative reasoning based on qualitative attrib-utes assigned to scene features is shown {{to be an important}} aspect of the Hough clustering algorithm presented in this paper. The resulting algorithm is robust and well suited for multiple-object scenes with partial occlusion. 1...|$|R

50|$|Built with largely {{rectangular}} windows, {{the building}} features a small clock tower atop the two-story facade.

25|$|Designing for the {{movement}} of building components due to temperature, loads, and settlement {{is an important part}} of architectural detailing. Building expansion joints provide barriers to the exterior and cover spaces between components. Copper is an excellent material for expansion joints because it is easy to form and lasts a long time.

50|$|The castle has two lateral {{battlement}} or tower-like corners, with merlonated <b>roof</b> <b>edges.</b> It {{was completed}} by 1476 in the late-gothic style of land palaces in the Veneto, including the tall columns and ogival windows on the piano nobile.

50|$|While {{a single}} porro prism can be {{constructed}} to {{work as well as}} a roof prism, it is seldom used as such. Therefore, to reduce the cost of production for a porro prism, {{the edge of the roof}} is usually left out. Sometimes only one small window as entrance surface and one window as exit surface are polished. The distinction between a roof prism and a porro prism is that for the roof prism the <b>roof</b> <b>edge</b> lies in the same plane as entrance and exit beam, while for a porro prism the (left out) <b>roof</b> <b>edge</b> is orthogonal to the plane formed by the beams. Furthermore, the roof prism has no displacement and a deviation typically between 45° and 90°, while in a single porro prism the beam is typically deviated by 180° and displaced by a distance of at least one beam diameter.|$|E
50|$|The {{initial cost}} of copper was {{traditionally}} high, but its {{length of service}} more than compensated for the price. Copper could also be shaped to the bends and angles around chimneys and at <b>roof</b> <b>edges</b> and dormers. All nails, screws, bolts, and cleats used with sheet copper must be made of copper or a copper alloy, otherwise galvanic action between the dissimilar metals would occur, causing deterioration.|$|R

50|$|Although {{fireplaces}} with hoods {{have been}} found, most heating was by braziers burning charcoal or coal. Rarely, a central room was heated by hypocausts (under-floor hot air from fires beneath the house). The venting {{ran up the}} walls of the villa, emptying under the roof eaves. This source of venting made the home appear to be on fire because of the smoke billowing from the <b>roof</b> <b>edges</b> and walls.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{roof prism}} is the Amici roof prism, with other common roof prism designs being the Abbe-Koenig prism, the Schmidt-Pechan prism {{and probably the}} best known being the roof pentaprism pictured here. A porro prism is not a roof prism, contrary to popular notion, as the two 90° faces usually don't meet in a Porro prism and therefore don't form a <b>roof</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A Schmidt-Pechan prism {{is a type}} {{of optical}} prism used to rotate an image by 180°. These prisms are {{commonly}} used in binoculars as an image erecting system. The Schmidt-Pechan prism makes use of a roof prism section (from the German: [...] "Dachkante", lit. <b>roof</b> <b>edge).</b> A binocular using Schmidt-Pechan prisms can be constructed more compactly than one using Porro or Abbe-Koenig roof prisms.|$|E
5000|$|A {{roof prism}} (also called a Dach prism or Dachkanten prism, from the German: [...] "Dachkante", lit. <b>roof</b> <b>edge)</b> is a {{reflective}} optical prism containing a section where two faces {{meet at a}} 90° angle. These two 90° faces resemble {{the roof of a}} building, giving this prism type its name. Reflection from the two 90° faces returns an image that is flipped laterally across the axis where the faces meet.|$|E
