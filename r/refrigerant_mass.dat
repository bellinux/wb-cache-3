40|$|The {{off-cycle}} <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> migration has {{a direct}} influence on the on-cycle performance since compressor energy is necessary to redistribute the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass.</b> No studies, as of today, {{are available in the}} open literature which experimentally measured the lubricant migration within a refrigeration system during cycling or stop/start transients. Therefore, experimental procedures measuring the refrigerant and lubricant migration through the major components of a refrigeration system during stop/start transients were developed and implemented. Results identifying the underlying physics are presented. The refrigerant and lubricant migration of an R 134 a automotive A/C system-utilizing a fixed orifice tube, minichannel condenser, plate and fin evaporator, U-tube type accumulator and fixed displacement compressor-was measured across five sections divided by ball valves. Using the Quick-Closing Valve Technique (QCVT) combined with the Remove and Weigh Technique (RWT) using liquid nitrogen as the condensing agent resulted in a measurement uncertainty of 0. 4 percent regarding the total <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> in the system. The determination of the lubricant mass distribution was achieved by employing three different techniques-Remove and Weigh, Mix and Sample, and Flushing. To employ the Mix and Sample Technique a device-called the Mix and Sample Device-was built. A method to separate the refrigerant and lubricant was developed with an accuracy-after separation-of 0. 04 grams of refrigerant left in the lubricant. When applying the three techniques, the total amount of lubricant mass in the system was determined to within two percent. The combination of measurement results-infrared photography and high speed and real time videography-provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of refrigerant and lubricant migration during stop-start operation. During the compressor stop period, the primary <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> migration is caused by, and follows, the diminishing pressure difference across the expansion device. The secondary refrigerant migration is caused by a pressure gradient as a result of thermal nonequilibrium within the system and causes only vapor phase refrigerant migration. Lubricant migration is proportional to the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> during the primary <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> migration. During the secondary <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> migration lubricant is not migrating. The start-up <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> migration is caused by an imbalance of the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flow rates across the compressor and expansion device. The higher compressor <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flow rate was a result of the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator. The lubricant mass migration during the start-up was not proportional to the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> migration. The presence of water condensate on the evaporator affected the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> migration during the compressor stop period. Caused by an evaporative cooling effect the evaporator held 56 percent of the total <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> in the system after three minutes of compressor stop time-compared to 25 percent when no water condensate was present on the evaporator coil. Foam entrainment led to a faster lubricant and <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> migration out of the accumulator than liquid entrainment through the hole {{at the bottom of the}} U-tube. The latter was observed for when water condensate was present on the evaporator coil because-as a result of the higher amount of <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> in the evaporator before start-up-the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator ceased before the steady state <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> distribution was reached...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the comparative analysis of HFO 1234 ze(E) and HFC 134 a during vaporisation inside a 4 mm smooth tube. The experimental tests {{were carried out}} at three different saturation temperatures (10, 15, and 20 °C) at increasing vapour quality up to incipient dryout to evaluate the specific contribution of heat flux, <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flux, mean vapour quality, and saturation temperature (pressure). The heat transfer coefficients have a positive slope versus vapour quality and the slope increases with <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flux and decreases with heat flux. Saturation temperature (pressure), <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flux and mean vapour quality have a remarkable impact on the frictional pressure drop of both HFO 1234 ze(E) and HFC 134 a whereas the effect of heat flux appears marginal or negligible. Convective boiling {{seems to be the}} prevailing heat transfer regime in the present experimental tests. HFO 1234 ze(E) exhibits heat transfer coefficients similar to HFC 134 a and slightly higher frictional pressure drops...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop measured during HC- 600 a (Isobutane), HC- 290 (Propane) and HC- 1270 (Propylene) vaporisation inside a small brazed plate heat exchanger: {{the effects of}} heat flux, <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flux, saturation temperature (pressure), outlet conditions and fluid properties are investigated. The experimental tests include 172 vaporisation runs carried out at three different saturation temperatures: 10, 15 and 20 °C. The <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flux ranges from 6. 6 to 23. 9 kg/m 2 s and the heat flux from 4. 3 to 19. 6 kW/m 2. The heat transfer coefficients show great sensitivity to heat flux, outlet conditions and fluid properties and weak sensitivity to saturation temperature (pressure). The frictional pressure drop shows a linear dependence on the kinetic energy per unit volume of the refrigerant flow and therefore a quadratic dependence on <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flux.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of vapour super-heating on {{hydrocarbon}} refrigerant 600 a (Isobutane), 290 (Propane) and 1270 (Propylene) condensation inside a brazed plate heat exchanger. Vapour super-heating increases heat transfer coefficient with respect to saturated vapour, whereas no effect was observed on pressure drop. The super-heated vapour condensation data shows the same trend vs. <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flux as the saturated vapour condensation data, but with higher absolute values. A transition point between gravity controlled and forced convection condensation has been found for a <b>refrigerant</b> <b>mass</b> flux around 15 - 18 kg m- 2 s- 1 depending on refrigerant type. The super-heated vapour heat transfer coefficients are from 5 to 10...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} on in-tube flow {{boiling heat transfer}} of R- 134 a/R- 290 /R- 600 a (91 %/ 4. 068 %/ 4. 932 % by <b>mass)</b> <b>refrigerant</b> mixture {{has been carried out}} in a varied heat flux condition using a tube-in-tube counter-flow test section. The boiling heat transfer coefficients at temperatures between - 5 and 5 °C for mass flow rates varying from 3 to 5 g/s were experimentally arrived. Acetone is used as hot fluid, which flows in the outer tube of diameter 28. 57 mm, while the test fluid flows in the inner tube of diameter 9. 52 mm. By regulating the acetone flow rate and its entry temperature, different heat flux conditions between 2 and 8 kW/m 2 were maintained. The pressure of the refrigerant was maintained at 3. 5, 4, and 5 bar. Flow pattern maps constructed for the considered operating conditions indicated that the flow was predominantly stratified and stratified wavy. The heat transfer coefficient was found to vary between 500 and 2200 W/m 2 K. The effect of nucleate boiling prevailing even at high vapor quality in a low mass and heat flux application is high-lighted. The comparison of experimental results with the familiar correlations showed that the correlations over predict the heat transfer coefficients of this mixture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} system {{performance of a}} split-type air conditioner matching with different coiled adiabatic capillary tubes for HCFC 22 and HC 290. Experiments were carried out in a room-type calorimeter. The results have shown that (1) similar cooling effects {{can be achieved by}} matching various capillary tubes of different inner diameters; (2) parallel capillary tubes presented better system performance and flow stability with weaker inlet pressure fluctuations than the single capillary tube; (3) with the coil diameter of the capillary tube increasing from 40 Â mm to 120 Â mm, the mass flow rate tended to increase slightly. But the cooling capacity, input power and energy efficiency ratio (EER) did not show evident tendency of change; (4) the <b>refrigerant</b> charge and <b>mass</b> flow rate for HC 290 were only 44 % and 47 % of that for HCFC 22, respectively, due to the much lower density. And HC 290 had 4. 7 - 6. 7 % lower cooling capacity and 12. 1 - 12. 3 % lower input power with respect to HCFC 22. However, the EER of HC 290 can be 8. 5 % higher than that of HCFC 22, which exhibits the advantage of using HC 290. In addition, the experimental uncertainties were analyzed and some application concerns of HC 290 were discussed.

40|$|Measurements on R 600 a {{refrigerators}} {{have shown}} electricity savings over R 134 a and R 12 up to 20 %. We propose new parameters which are functions of well known refrigerant properties. These parameters show that R 600 a has half the leakage, pressure loss and condenser pressure and double the heat transfer coefcient of R 12 and R 134 a explaining the measurements. Use of R 600 a in small heat pumps and air conditioners is attractive but also requires design changes. 1 Refrigerant History Early refrigerants were toxic or ammable or both. Early refrigerators leaked re-frigerant rapidly, mainly through the seals on the compressor drive shaft, creating a re and health risk. A hermetic motor is sealed inside the refrigerant circuit {{so there is}} no shaft seal to leak. Except for car air-conditioning all small and most large compressors now have hermetic motors minimizing refrigerant risks. Thomas Midgley Jr proposed the use of chlorouorocarbons (CFCs) as refrig-erants in 1930. CFCs have two important advantages as <b>refrigerants,</b> high molec-ular <b>mass</b> and nonammability. Centrifugal compressors are simple, highly ef-cient and easy to drive with hermetic motors but they require refrigerants with high molecular mass to give useful temperature differentials. Centrifugal chillers for air-conditioning large buildings gave CFCs an initial market which could afford their high development cost. Enthusiastic marketing of nonammability allowed rapid expansion of CFC sales in applications where non-toxic but ammable refrigerants were already in use. Everyone was told that ammable refrigerants caused horric res and explo-sions. Ammonia, methyl chloride and hydrocarbons disappeared from domesti...|$|R
