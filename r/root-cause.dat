Classifying these curves in terms of unambiguous variability behavior is mandatory for obtaining an unbiased statistical view on their controlling <b>root-causes.</b> The present study {{provides an overview of}} semi-sinusoidal light curves observed by the CoRoT exo-field CCDs. We selected a sample of 4, 206 light curves presenting well-defined semi-sinusoidal signatures. The variability periods were computed based on Lomb-Scargle periodograms, harmonic fits, and visual inspection. Color-period diagrams for the present sample show the trend of an increase of the variability periods as long as the stars evolve. This evolutionary behavior is also noticed when comparing the period distribution in the Galactic center and anti-center directions. These aspects indicate a compatibility with stellar rotation, although more information is needed to confirm their <b>root-causes.</b> Considering this possibility, we identified a subset of three Sun-like candidates by their photometric period.

40|$|Abstract Background Research {{into social}} <b>root-causes</b> of poor health within {{segregated}} Roma communities in Central and Eastern Europe, i. e. research into how, why {{and by whom}} high health-endangering settings and exposures are maintained here, is lacking. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the local setup of health-endangering everyday settings and practices over the long-term in one such community. It is the initial part of a larger longitudinal study qualitatively exploring the social <b>root-causes</b> of poor Roma health status through the case of a particular settlement in Slovakia. Methods The study, spanning 10  years, comprised four methodologically distinct phases combining ethnography and applied medical-anthropological surveying. The acquired data consisted of field notes on participant observations and records of elicitations focusing on both the setup and the social <b>root-causes</b> of local everyday health-endangering settings and practices. To create the here-presented descriptive summary of the local setup, we performed a qualitative content analysis based on the latest World Health Organization classification of health exposures. Results Across all the examined dimensions – material circumstances, psychosocial factors, health-related behaviours, social cohesion and healthcare utilization – all the settlements’ residents faced a wide range of health-endangering settings and practices. How the residents engaged in some of these exposures and how these exposures affected residents’ health varied according to local social stratifications. Most of the patterns described prevailed over the 10 -year period. Some local health-endangering settings and practices were praised by most inhabitants using racialized ethnic terms constructed in contrast or in direct opposition to alleged non-Roma norms and ways. Conclusions Our summary provides a comprehensive and conveniently structured basis for grounded thinking about the intermediary social determinants of health within segregated Roma communities in Slovakia and beyond. It offers novel clues regarding how certain determinants might vary therein; how they might be contributing to health-deterioration; and how they might be causally inter-linked here. It also suggests racialized ethnically framed social counter-norms might be involved in the maintenance of analogous exposure setups...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. Professional Practice in Information Technology. Tshwane University of Technology, 2011. Service Oriented Architecture is touted {{to be the}} {{architecture}} that can provide organisations {{with the ability to}} respond more quickly to changes in their business environments than otherwise. This is because Service Oriented Architecture design principles encourage applications to be designed for dynamic reuse, communication and integration with other applications thereby reducing the time-to-market of applications that support new or changed business processes. One of the ways of using Service Oriented Architecture principles when developing applications is by using web-services. The web-services used in composing or building Service Oriented Architecture applications may be developed by different teams using different programming languages, may reside in geographically dispersed areas and be connected and communicate by using a variety of communications infrastructure. As a result, Service Oriented Architecture applications often have a dynamic, heterogeneous and distributed architecture. This architecture poses a difficult challenge with resolution of issues experienced with Service Oriented Architecture applications in operations environments. In this research, literature review is conducted to firstly, investigate challenges of Service Oriented Architecture applications in operations environments. Secondly, <b>root-causes</b> of these challenges are identified. Then a framework for management of challenges of Service Oriented Architecture applications in operations environments is developed based on the identified challenges and their <b>root-causes.</b> Elements of this framework are then compared with Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) processes to evaluate the extent to which Information Technology Infrastructure Library can be used to manage Service Oriented Architecture applications in operations environments...|$|R
40|$|Service processes, {{for example}} in transportation, {{telecommunications}} or the health sector, are the backbone of today's economies. Conceptual models of service processes enable operational analysis that supports, e. g., resource provisioning or delay prediction. In the presence of event logs containing recorded traces of process execution, such operational models can be mined automatically. In this work, we target the analysis of resource-driven, scheduled processes based on event logs. We focus on processes for which there exists a pre-defined assignment of activity instances to resources that execute activities. Specifically, we approach the questions of conformance checking (how to assess the conformance of the schedule and the actual process execution) and performance improvement (how to improve the operational process performance). The first question is addressed based on a queueing network for both the schedule and the actual process execution. Based on these models, we detect operational deviations and then apply statistical inference and similarity measures to validate the scheduling assumptions, thereby identifying <b>root-causes</b> for these deviations. These results are {{the starting point for}} our technique to improve the operational performance. It suggests adaptations of the scheduling policy of the service process to decrease the tardiness (non-punctuality) and lower the flow time. We demonstrate the value of our approach based on a real-world dataset comprising clinical pathways of an outpatient clinic that have been recorded by a real-time location system (RTLS). Our results indicate that the presented technique enables localization of operational bottlenecks along with their <b>root-causes,</b> while our improvement technique yields a decrease in median tardiness and flow time by more than 20 %...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} to design an event-based warning system {{as an alternative}} to the conventional variable-based alarm system. This study initially explores the options for grouping process variables for alarm allocation. Several grouping methods are discussed and an event-based grouping procedure is detailed. Selection of the key variables for a group is performed considering the information that the variables contain to distinguish between an abnormal and a normal condition. The information theory is used to quantify the information content of a variable about an event to select the key variables. The cross-correlation analysis between pairs of key variables is used to identify the redundant variables. Simulation study using the model of a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is used to demonstrate the methodology. The proposed event-based early warning system utilizing online measurements is detailed in the thesis. In this approach, warnings are assigned to plant abnormal events instead of individual variables. To assess the likelihoods of undesirable events, the Bayesian Network is used; the event likelihoods are estimated in real time utilizing online measurements. Diagnostic analysis is conducted to identify <b>root-causes</b> of events. By assigning warning to events, the methodology results in significantly lower number of warnings compared to traditional variable-based warning (alarms) system. It also enables early warning of a possible event along with an efficient diagnosis of the <b>root-causes</b> of the event. Experimental testing using a level control system is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Simulation study using the model of a CSTR is also presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. Both, experimental and simulation studies, have shown promising results...|$|R
