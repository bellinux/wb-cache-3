The former committee filed a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court to block the new roadway, and they were joined in their efforts by conservationist groups and the village of North Tarrytown. On June28, 1966, the case was heard by the court. Engineers with the New York State Department of Highways were accused of showing [...] "unprecedented pell-mell haste" [...] in working on a project with the Rockefellers before any injunctions could stop it. State Attorney General Joseph Romano countered that the state was not conspiring to provide anyone special benefits, saying that NY117 was dangerous for years and opponents to the project were [...] "thinking up little gimmicks, picayune arguments and ethereal ideas to mislead the court." ...|$|E

40|$|The Hartland Partnership Center is {{a program}} of University Neighborhood Partners (UNP), a University-community {{partnership}} and department of the University of Utah, located in Salt Lake City. It successfully brings together faculty, students, community agencies, and residents to co-design and implement programs with the families living in the surrounding area. A central element of the UNP/Hartland Partnership Center is the <b>Resident</b> <b>Committee.</b> This presentation will {{provide an overview of}} the <b>Resident</b> <b>Committee,</b> the processes to create the <b>Resident</b> <b>Committee,</b> and practices to engage <b>Committee</b> members. The <b>Resident</b> <b>Committee</b> is one way the community has broadened participation in transformation and knowledge creation. The purpose of the <b>Resident</b> <b>Committee</b> is to expand the number of community leaders and introduce University of Utah representatives, students, and community associates to West Salt Lake neighborhoods. The group broadly represents the diversity of the community, and efforts are made to ensure the different racial, ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic groups living the community are included. The <b>Resident</b> <b>Committee</b> provides the essential information used to educate the University groups and Hartland Partnership Center partners about the community. Committee members collect information from the residents that better identify the community’s resources, needs, and strengths. In addition to this, the <b>Resident</b> <b>Committee</b> provides cultural trainings for the larger service and educational community. Presentations emphasize bridging the cultural gap in education, criminal justice, and health care. Understanding the stories and cultures of community partners is critical to the work we do. Participants will be encouraged to share stories about their culture and draw themes from stories to develop plans for community growth. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the level and}} types of decision-making residents have in lo-level residential aged care facility (RACF) <b>resident</b> <b>committees</b> and whether this {{is in line with}} the level and types desired by the residents. Method: Fifteen South Australian low-level RACFs participated in the study, with a total of 107 <b>resident</b> <b>committee</b> members completing questionnaires. Results: Residents wanted to participate significantly more in decision-making than they currently were, particularly in the areas of deciding on new activities, planning menus and making policies on safety hazards. Conclusion: The existence of <b>resident</b> <b>committees</b> did not ensure that residents participated in decision-making {{to the extent that they}} wished. <b>Resident</b> <b>committees</b> would benefit from regular evaluation to determine whether residents are provided with opportunities to participate in decision-making in areas that are important to them and to the levels they desire.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjective: To investigate factors affecting the functioning of <b>resident</b> <b>committees</b> in South Australian low-level residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Methods: Observation of two consecutive <b>resident</b> <b>committee</b> meetings in 18 low-level RACFs. Results: Most meetings were informal. Only one-third had an agenda, and although all had minutes, only half provided them to residents. Most meetings were scheduled monthly, but because of postponements, meetings were held on average every 7 weeks. Many meeting rooms did not allow residents {{to see and hear}} comfortably. Most chairpersons were staff and only one chairperson had formal training in conducting meetings. Only 21 % of first meeting topics, which mostly focused on resident complaints, resulted in solutions at the second meeting. Resident dissatisfaction was evident with meeting environments, procedures and outcomes. Conclusion: There is considerable scope for improving a number of environmental and procedural factors affecting the functioning of <b>resident</b> <b>committees.</b> Leah Wilson and Neil Kirb...|$|R

A series of conflicts between <b>residents</b> <b>committees</b> and management concerning the rights and freedoms of residents and housing conditions (which can lead to eviction or even houses closures) brought the committees to hold a meeting on 2 and 3 March 1974 at the Maison des Arts et Métiers, to adopt a structure based on self-defense and mutual aid as imagined by Otmar Seul: the Coordination of <b>Residents</b> <b>Committees</b> of the CIUP. This transitory structure encouraged the head of the CIUP to integrate residents in the decision-making process at all levels of governance (formalization of an Assembly of delegates of Residents Committees; election by the Assembly of four administrators sitting at the CIUP Administration Council; possibility for the <b>residents</b> <b>committees</b> to participate in the administration council of their host houses).|$|R

30|$|FISC {{services}} {{overlap in}} part with those from the residents’ committee. Therefore, the sub-district office, as a service purchaser, wants to absorb FISC into its own power structure. However, the social service organizations aiming to take over FISCs are outsiders. In some sub-districts, such cooperation is smooth, while in others, conflicts occur. During the interview, {{the deputy director of}} the GD residents’ committee in BC sub-district showed complaints and criticism of FISC both through language and gestures. He thought that FISC did not cooperate well with the sub-district or with the residents’ committee and it only implemented a series of programs designed by itself without considering the actual effect of community service; FISC has intermediate effect, but the personnel are paid more than those in the residents’ committee (interview with HG, deputy director of the <b>residents</b> <b>committee</b> in GD community, BC Sub-district, 18 Dec. 2013). FISC is often confined to finish the tasks required in the contract, and the scope of services is limited to a small range of people. Usually, FISC requires the residents’ committees to provide information, but it does not cooperate with the residents’ committees to carry out the work (interview with Mr. Song, director in ZN <b>residents</b> <b>committee,</b> NST sub-district, 16 Feb. 2015).|$|E
