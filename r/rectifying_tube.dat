50|$|SoHo - 20 watt (2 x EL84) or 35 watt (4 x 7591), <b>Tube</b> <b>rectified,</b> EF86-12AX7 cathode follower. Released January 2007.|$|R
50|$|London - Handwired 18 watt, <b>tube</b> <b>rectified,</b> 2 x EL84 power section, 12AX7, EF86, tremolo. The London offers 2-amps-in-one. Released January, 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Stone Pony - 25 or 50 Watt (2x7591), <b>tube</b> <b>rectified,</b> EF86-12AX7 cathode follower. Employs an EF86 preamp {{tube feeding}} a 12AX7 phase inverter. Released January 2008 ...|$|R
50|$|Royal Albert-45 Watt (2xKT77), {{solid state}} or <b>tube</b> <b>rectified,</b> dual 12AX7. Powered by two KT77 or EL34 output tubes and runs in Class A/B. Released January 2007.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the length}} and noise of the locomotive, crews found {{difficulty}} in hearing warning detonators. To <b>rectify</b> the situation, <b>tubes</b> were fitted to convey the sound from the leading wheels to the cab. This mechanism can still be seen today on 6040 at the NSW Rail Museum.|$|R
5000|$|The noise values {{used for}} the {{encryption}} key were originally produced by large mercury-vapor <b>rectifying</b> vacuum <b>tubes</b> and stored on a phonograph record. The record was then duplicated, with the records being distributed to SIGSALY systems {{on both ends of}} a conversation. The records served as the SIGSALY [...] "one-time pad", and distribution was very strictly controlled (although if one had been seized, it would have been of little importance, since only one pair of each was ever produced). For testing and setup purposes, a pseudo-random number generating system made out of relays, known as the [...] "threshing machine", was used.|$|R
5000|$|Marquee Club - 35Watt (4 x EL84), <b>tube</b> <b>rectified,</b> 3 x 12 AX7, two channels. 65 Amps second model {{introduced}} {{after the}} London. One 12AX7 is in a [...] "cascode" [...] circuit {{instead of using}} an EF86 as {{was used in the}} London. It is a bigger sounding, louder version of the London in some respects, endowed with great headroom and presence.|$|R
5000|$|Many bass players {{believe that}} tube {{amplifiers}} produce a [...] "warmer" [...] or more [...] "natural" [...] sound than solid state amplifiers when lightly or moderately driven, and more pleasing distortion characteristics when overdriven. Some performers {{also believe that}} tube amps have a greater level of perceived loudness for a given amount of amplifier power. Even though tube amplifiers produce more heat than solid state amplifiers, few manufacturers of tube amplifiers include cooling fans in the amplifiers' chassis. Usually adequate cooling is provided by passive convection. Adequate airflow is needed to prevent excessive heat from shortening the tubes' lifespan or producing tonal inconsistencies. Tube amplifiers require more maintenance than solid state transistor amplifiers, such as replacing vacuum <b>tubes</b> or <b>rectifying</b> the <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
