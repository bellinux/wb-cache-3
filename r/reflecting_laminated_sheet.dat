40|$|The {{subject of}} {{improving}} the formability and fracture resistance of coated and <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets,</b> and sandwiches during forming and in service has received significant attention because these properties constitute an important design criterion for these composite materials. This paper reviews the mechanical and functional properties of these composite materials. A special {{emphasis is placed on}} the study of their forming and failure behaviour. Major failure mechanisms are identified in the <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> during forming and in sandwiched sheets when subjected to static and dynamic loading. Shape futability of coated and <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> after forming are also discussed in terms of the surface friction and shear deformation in the core layer.

40|$|<b>Laminated</b> steel <b>sheets</b> {{sandwiched}} with a polymer core {{are increasingly}} used for automotive applications to improve vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s vibration-damping performance without adding additional weight. It {{has been observed}} that the <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> are prone to wrinkling during stamping processes. Due to the significant difference in material properties between the polymer core and the skin steel, FEM prediction of the occurrence, the location, and the shapes of wrinkles in the forming of <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> is still a great challenge. In this paper, the Yoshida buckling test and wedge strip test of laminated steel and its steel skins were conducted. The information of local strains, buckling heights and global wrinkling patterns were obtained in order to study the initiation condition of wrinkling and the post-buckling behavior of the sheets, and to provide verification data for numerical predictions. Rectangular panel forming tests wore also conducted. The {{results showed that the}} 1. 0 mm <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet</b> employed has a wrinkling tendency similar to that of its 0. 5 mm skin panel and has a strain distribution similar to that of its 1. 0 mm solid counterpart.

30|$|Three-year-old Cizhu bamboo (Neosinocalamus affinis) was {{obtained}} from Yibin, Sichuan Province, China. The bamboo culm (about 900  mm longitudinally and about 42  ×  4.2  mm in cross section) were selected {{from the middle of}} the trunk. The bamboo material had an initial moisture content (MC) of about 65  %. For material preparation, bamboo tubes were first split into four pieces of approximately the same size. The bamboo nodes were removed using a hatchet. An untwisting machine was used to broom and roll the bamboo strips into a loosely <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet.</b> The untwisting machine was made up of drive unit, idler wheels, and an adjustment device (to regulate the pressure between the idler wheels). By adjusting the distance of the upper and lower pressure rollers, the teeth could realize different brooming and decongesting effects during the bamboo feeding process. The <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet</b> was cross-linked in the width direction with no fracture along the length direction and was nearly uniform in thickness, maintaining the original bamboo fiber arrangement.

40|$|Bio-adaptable 2 -layer polytetrafluoroethylene/polyethylene (PTFE/PE) <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> were {{prepared}} {{by a new}} adhesion method, a double-step treatment consisting of applying low dose (0. 43 MGy) homogeneous low energy electron beam irradiation (HLEBI) to the 2 -layer assembly where the HLEBI penetrates through the PTFE and PE layers, respectively, prior to hot-press under 5 MPa and 433 K. Although the adhesion of the PTFE/PE sheets cannot be observed without the new double-step treatment, bonding forces were created {{as evidenced by the}} mean adhesive forces of peeling resistance (oFp). The adhesion cannot be observed without HLEBI. On the other hand, application of a small dose of HLEBI (less than 0. 43 MGy) prior to hot-press lamination enhances the oFp at each Pp. The maximum oFp values at each Pp (0. 06, 0. 50 and 0. 94) of the <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet</b> irradiated at 0. 13, 0. 13, and 0. 22 MGy are 5. 44, 10. 7, and 19. 7 Nm 1, respectively. Based on the 3 -parameter Weibull equation, the lowest oFp value at Pp of zero (Fs) could be estimated. An increasing trend in Fs occurs by the double-step treatment applying HLEBI up to 0. 43 MGy reaching a maximum at 2. 66 Nm 1, improving the safety level without radiation damage of PTFE/PE. It was more than 6 times higher than that of PTFE/Polyurethane (PU) (0. 4 Nm 1). When HLEBI cuts the chemical bonds and generates dangling bonds with nonbonding electrons in PTFE and PE, the created adhesion between the <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> can be explained. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) surface analysis of the PTFE/PE <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> after the peeling tests, fluorine (F) was detected on the PE peeled surface, indicating both strong chemical and intermolecular bonds generated by the double-step treatment.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} flux leakage (MFL) technique is most commonly used for crack detection from iron bars, <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets,</b> and steel tubes of ferromagnetic nature.

An inductive coil sensor or a Hall effect sensor detects the leakage. Magnetic methods of nondestructive testing (NDT) depend on detecting this {{magnetic flux leakage}} field. The ferromagnetic specimen is magnetized by suitable methods, and flaws which break the surface or just the subsurface distort the magnetic field, causing local flux leakage fields.

The effects of temperature within the blank on formability and punch force are investigated. To study the <b>laminate</b> <b>sheet</b> behavior; three blank temperatures namely, 25 ̊ C, 100 ̊ C and 160 ̊ C are examined. In addition, the effect of grain size on punch force and material behavior for aluminum alloys 5052 and 1050 are studied. The aluminum sheets are annealed at 350 ̊ C 400 ̊ C and 450 ̊ C. The grain size effect, which strongly affects some properties such as formability parameters, stress, elongation and friction coefficient, is investigated. To measure the grain size the microstructure of Al 5052 and Al 1050 sheets is revealed by Polarized Light Microscope (PLM). In addition, to clarify the relative influences of grain size on the formability of Al 5052, some tensile tests on annealed specimen at 350 ̊ C, and 450 ̊ C are performed.

40|$|The {{migration}} of silica nanoparticles in the <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> of poly(butadiene) (BR) and poly(styrene-co-butadiene) (SBR) rubbers is investigated. <b>Laminated</b> rubber <b>sheets</b> {{are subjected to}} various annealing conditions beyond their glass transition temperatures. After separation, the surface morphologies of separated sheets are observed by scanning electron microscopy. The transfer of particles occurs from SBR to BR during annealing, but not from BR to SBR. Since SBR exhibits a higher viscosity than BR under the experimental conditions, the transfer direction is determined by interfacial tension. Silica particles without any surface modification prefer to reside in BR. The diffusion distance is predicted from the Stokes-Einstein equation. Differential scanning calorimetric measurements show that BR crystallization is enhanced by the silica particles immigrated from the SBR sheet, because of their favorable nucleating ability. This study allows the prediction of silica particle localization in BR and SBR blends...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} present {{research}} is to investigate the thickness distribution on the warm deep-drawing process of <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> consisting of aluminum alloy series 1050, 5052 and stainless steel 304 (SUS), experimentally. Individually for each layer, the influences of blank temperature and grain size on thinning behavior are clearly demonstrated. In order to survey the thinning behavior in <b>laminate</b> <b>sheet</b> behavior during warm deep-drawing process; three blank temperatures namely, 25 ° C, 100 ° C and 160 ° C are examined. Moreover, to obtain different grain sizes, the aluminium sheets are annealed at 350 ° C, 400 ° C and 450 ° C for 1 hour. Results indicate that increasing temperature and grain size lead to maximum thinning in all layers in Al 1050 /SUS and Al 5052 /SUS specimens increase. In addition, the most susceptible zone to fracture in aluminum sheets (Al 1050 and Al 5052) is punch profile radius region; nevertheless, for stainless steel sheets this zone switch to central zone of formed cup.
