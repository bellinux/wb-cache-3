5|$|Although rare, {{infection}} of humans by <b>rabies</b> from vampire bat bites has been documented; {{for example in}} 2010 four children in Peru died after being bitten. The highest occurrence of <b>rabies</b> in vampire bats occurs in the large populations found in South America. However, the risk of infection to the human population is less than to livestock exposed to bat bites. Only 0.5% of bats carry <b>rabies,</b> {{and those that do}} may be clumsy, disoriented, and unable to fly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rabies</b> {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of <b>rabies.</b> The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of <b>rabies.</b> The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include <b>rabies,</b> canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious <b>rabies</b> outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E
5|$|A few kennels {{breeding}} their ancestors, the St. John's water dog, were in England. At {{the same}} time, {{a combination of}} the sheep protection policy in Newfoundland and <b>rabies</b> quarantine in the United Kingdom, led to the gradual demise of the St. John's water dog in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Bat {{caregivers}} are {{not only}} specially trained in techniques to rescue and rehabilitate bats, {{but they are also}} vaccinated against <b>rabies.</b> Although the chance of contracting the rabies-like Australian bat lyssavirus is extremely small, bat caregivers are inoculated for their own protection.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against <b>rabies,</b> canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to <b>rabies</b> does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a <b>rabies</b> vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E
5|$|Vaccines {{have been}} made using animals since their {{discovery}} by Edward Jenner in the 18th century. He noted that inoculation with live cowpox afforded protection against the more dangerous smallpox. In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for <b>rabies.</b> In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases mumps and polio were developed using animal cells grown in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} cull {{vampire bat}} populations in areas where human-wildlife {{conflict}} is a concern. Vampire bats are captured with mist nets and coated {{with a combination of}} petroleum jelly and warfarin. The bat returns to its roost {{and other members of the}} roost become poisoned as well by ingesting the warfarin after reciprocal grooming. Suspected vampire bat roosts may also be coated in the warfarin solution, though this kills other bat species and remains in the environment for years. The efficacy of killing vampire bats to reduce <b>rabies</b> transmission is questionable, however; a study in Peru showed that culling programs did not lead to lower transmission rates of <b>rabies</b> to livestock and humans.|$|E
5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ <b>rabies,</b> although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes <b>rabies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including <b>rabies,</b> histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
5|$|Because Poe {{was found}} on the day of an election, it was {{suggested}} as early as 1872 that he was the victim of cooping. This was a ballot-box-stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied, drugged, and used as a pawn to vote for a political party at multiple locations. Cooping had become the standard explanation for Poe's death in most of his biographies for several decades, though his status in Baltimore may have made him too recognizable for this scam to have worked. More recently, analysis suggesting that Poe's death resulted from <b>rabies</b> has been presented.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include <b>rabies,</b> leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about {{the last few days}} of Poe's life comes from his attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility is questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, <b>rabies,</b> syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed.|$|E
5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} <b>rabies</b> and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} <b>rabies</b> vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|The Master {{spends most}} of his time {{drinking}} alcohol, and people begin trying to convince him to move into a nursing home, where no dogs are allowed. One summer, an outbreak of <b>rabies</b> spreads through the fox population. After one infected fox attacks a group of human children, the same people approach the Master and ask his help in killing the foxes. He uses traps and poison to try to kill as many foxes as possible; however, the poison also kills domestic animals. After a human child dies from eating it, the humans remove all of the poison, then the Master organizes a hunt in which large numbers of people line up and walk straight into the woods, flushing out foxes to be shot. The aging Tod escapes all three events, as well as an attempt at coursing him with greyhounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is one of}} the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with {{probably}} more books written about it than any other wildlife species. It {{has a long history of}} association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from <b>rabies.</b> Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.|$|E
5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of canine distemper, <b>rabies,</b> respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of the biology of M.escalerai. Females begin to form {{reproductive}} colonies in April and May, either small ones or larger aggregations that may also contain males. However, most males remain solitary in this period, although some also form colonies. The single young is born in June or July and becomes independent after some six weeks. Mating usually takes place in fall, but sometimes in winter. The formation of large reproductive colonies in caves, which may consist of several hundreds of individuals, distinguishes M.escalerai from M.nattereri as well as M.sp.A, which roost in smaller groups in tree holes. In Aragón, colonies contain 50 to 880 individuals, and Catalan colonies are known to contain over a hundred bats. Reproductive colonies may be formed {{in a variety of}} structures, including caves, mines, tree holes, and human-made structures such as bridges and houses. However, hibernation colonies need constant temperatures between , and are usually located in caves or basements. M.escalerai is considered a sedentary species, and does not usually migrate over long distances, although it does move between reproduction and hibernation colonies. <b>Rabies</b> has been identified in a Spanish specimen of M.escalerai.|$|E
5|$|Some golden jackals carry {{diseases}} and parasites harmful to human health. These include <b>rabies,</b> and Donovan's Leishmania that is harmless to jackals but may cause leishmaniasis in people. Jackals in southwestern Tajikistan can carry up to 16 species of parasitic cestodes (flatworm), roundworms, and acanthocephalans (thorny-headed worms), these being: Sparganum mansoni, Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, Taenia hydatigena, T.pisiformis, Taenia ovis, Hydatigera taeniaeformis, Dipylidium caninum, Mesocestoides lineatus, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Dioctophyma renale, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Dracunculus medinensis, Filariata and Macracanthorhynchus catulinum. Jackals infected with Dracunculus medinensis can infect {{bodies of water}} with their eggs, which cause dracunculiasis in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading coenurosis in sheep and cattle, and canine distemper in dogs. In Tajikistan, jackals carry at least 12 tick species (which include Ixodes, Rhipicephalus turanicus, R. leporis, R. rossicus, R. sanguineus, R. pumilio, R. schulzei, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. scupense and H. asiaticum), four flea species (Pulex irritans, Xenopsylla nesokiae, Ctenocephanlides canis and C. felis), and one species of louse (Trichodectes canis).|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together. They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species – in this case humans, and are said to have a narrow host range. Other viruses, such as <b>rabies</b> virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range. The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans. The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur {{was unable}} to find a causative agent for <b>rabies</b> and speculated about a {{pathogen}} too small to be detected using a microscope. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter (known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores smaller than bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium– this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus– agent of foot-and-mouth disease (aphthovirus)– through a similar filter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rabies</b> {{is caused}} by lyssaviruses, {{including}} the <b>rabies</b> virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. <b>Rabies</b> is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human. Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit <b>rabies</b> if the saliva comes {{into contact with the}} eyes, mouth, or nose. Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved. More than 99% of <b>rabies</b> cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites. In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of <b>rabies</b> infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs. Rodents are very rarely infected with <b>rabies.</b> The <b>rabies</b> virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves. The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{control and}} {{vaccination}} programs have decreased {{the risk of}} <b>rabies</b> from dogs {{in a number of}} regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where <b>rabies</b> is common. In people who have been exposed to <b>rabies,</b> the <b>rabies</b> vaccine and sometimes <b>rabies</b> immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of <b>rabies</b> symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a <b>rabies</b> infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rabies</b> (hydrophobia) is a fatal {{viral disease}} {{that can affect}} any mammal, {{although}} the close relationship of dogs with humans makes canine <b>rabies</b> a zoonotic concern. Vaccination of dogs for <b>rabies</b> is commonly required by law. Please see the article dog health for information on this disease in dogs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rabies,</b> 1953. He and {{his public}} health and welfare {{committee}} supported proposed legislation requiring all dogs to be vaccinated against <b>rabies.</b>|$|E
25|$|The year 1979 {{became a}} {{landmark}} year for Silliman when its Van Houweling Research Laboratory, then headed by Dr. George Beran, produced a dog vaccine that gave a three-year immunity from <b>rabies,</b> {{making it the}} first and only laboratory to produce a <b>rabies</b> vaccine with long-term immunity in the whole of Southeast Asia. The development of the vaccine resulted in the elimination of <b>rabies</b> {{in many parts of the}} Visayas and Mindanao Islands and was later on used by other countries in their fight against <b>rabies</b> conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organization.|$|E
25|$|Meister {{never showed}} any {{symptoms}} of <b>rabies,</b> but the vaccination {{has not been}} {{proved to be the}} reason. One source estimates the probability of Meister contracting <b>rabies</b> at 10%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rabies,</b> a fatal disease {{transmitted}} by {{the bite of}} an infected mammal. In the United States, cats make up 4.6% of reported cases of <b>rabies</b> infected animals.|$|E
25|$|The state started air {{drops of}} <b>rabies</b> bait for {{raccoons}} in 1997. Known <b>rabies</b> cases in raccoons peaked in 2007 at 165. The program is {{in cooperation with}} neighboring states and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Where <b>rabies</b> occurs, <b>rabies</b> {{vaccination}} of dogs may {{be required}} by law. Other canine vaccines include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, leptospirosis, bordatella, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease, among others.|$|E
25|$|The Center for Disease Control and Prevention {{has warned}} about the <b>rabies</b> risk {{associated}} with feral cats. With 16% of people infected with <b>rabies</b> from exposure to rabid cats, cats have been the primary animals responsible for transmission of the virus to humans in the United States since the efforts to control <b>rabies</b> in dogs in the 1970s. In 2010, there were 303 rabid cats reported within the United States. Although some colony management programs involve administering <b>rabies</b> vaccines, the need to revaccinate every few years makes this challenging to maintain. Furthermore, lack of documentation can mean that contact with vaccinated feral cats may still require post-exposure treatment.|$|E
25|$|Programs {{supporting}} regular vaccination of {{dogs have}} contributed {{both to the}} health of dogs and to the public health. In countries where routine <b>rabies</b> vaccination of dogs is practiced, for example, <b>rabies</b> in humans is reduced to a very rare event.|$|E
25|$|During lethal <b>rabies</b> {{infection}} of mice, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) {{does not allow}} anti-viral immune cells to enter the brain, the primary site of <b>rabies</b> virus replication. This aspect contributes to the pathogenicity of the virus and artificially increasing BBB permeability promotes viral clearance. Opening the BBB during <b>rabies</b> infection has been suggested as a possible novel approach to treating the disease, even though no attempts have yet been made {{to determine whether or}} not this treatment could be successful.|$|E
25|$|A tetanous booster {{is given}} to the person if It has been more than 5 years since their last tetanus shot. If a cat has bitten someone, and there is no {{evidence}} that the cat has been vaccinated against <b>rabies,</b> the person will be treated for <b>rabies</b> infection.|$|E
