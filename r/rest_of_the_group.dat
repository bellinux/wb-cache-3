5|$|In 1991, they {{released}} Who's Laughing Now, their first full-length studio album. Shortly after the album's release, Capra left {{the band and}} was replaced by someone named Corey (Russell). After this, Morrill quit the band, and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> set out to form the band Korn with two other people. Several of the band's former members have formed solo projects. In 1997, a compilation album consisting of fourteen tracks was released.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the characters, Nomura had wanted {{at least one}} female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around {{the same age as}} the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Episode 3: Aaron was cut {{because he}} could not {{physically}} catch up with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> speed. That caused him to pass out on the beach while exercising.|$|R
50|$|The 90th TCS {{stayed in}} the UK and {{operated}} from RAF Welford until <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> aircraft returned from Italy on 24 August.

5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} train, Sinclair's group are arrested by {{soldiers}} armed with archaic weapons and armor. They {{are taken to}} a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.|$|E
5|$|Cnidocytes {{can only}} fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when {{capturing}} a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes {{have to be}} replaced, which takes about 48hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.|$|E

30|$|In the pooled sample, {{coefficient}} of variation {{does not seem to}} vary between men, women, immigrants, and non-immigrants. However, wage dispersion is the highest in the youngest and oldest age subgroup, and it is decreasing with <b>the</b> decrease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> age in <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>The</b> same is true for D 9 /D 5 and D 5 /D 1. Additionally, D 5 /D 1 is slightly higher for men and immigrants than for women and non-immigrants.|$|R
5|$|Initial {{predictions}} of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves like the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> 4 elements.|$|E
5|$|Nibali {{attacked}} {{again just}} after the summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost colliding with a race motorbike at one point, he used his strong descending skills to gain an advantage over the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> He used the whole width {{of the road and}} coming very close to the crash barriers at various moments. Rosa, meanwhile, came {{to the head of the}} group in an attempt to slow the chase down. Nibali's lead at the foot of the descent was around 40 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Ronan {{meets with}} Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to Knowhere, a remote {{criminal}} outpost in space {{built in the}} giant severed head of a Celestial. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> meet Gamora's contact, the collector Taneleer Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing an Infinity Stone, an item of immeasurable power that destroys {{all but the most}} powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's tormented assistant Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive.|$|E
40|$|N-Methyl-N'-nitro-iV-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) {{dissolved}} in distilled water (5 g/ 1) was administered orally once by gastric tube at {{a dose of}} 0. 25 ml/ 10 g body weight to 5 -day-old or 28 -day-old Wistar Furth (W/Fu) or ACI rats. Gastric tumors in the glandular stomach were found in 58 % of 5 -day-old ACI rats, but none were found in <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups.</b> Forestomach tumors were found in both strains of rats at both age groups with incidences of 68 - 100 %. Lung tumors were induced in 64 % of 5 -day-old and 6 % of 28 -day-old W/Fu rats, but not in ACI rats. Besides the tumors, a high frequency of hepatic cysts was also noted in ACI rats. Intestinal metaplastic foci with alkaline phosphatase activity were found in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 5 -day-old ACI rats and none in <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>The</b> {{results showed that the}} incidences and <b>the</b> locations <b>of</b> tumors in rats induced by MNNG are greatly influenced by both strain and age...|$|R

50|$|An {{introductory}} phase {{where members}} strive to get acquainted or reacquainted with one another. During this phase, {{the basis for}} <b>the</b> <b>group</b> structure is established and is characterized by polite social interaction.

5|$|Shane arms the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> {{and they}} {{converge}} on the barn just as Hershel, Rick, {{and the other}} return with the snared walkers. Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog (IronE Singleton), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards them. Only Rick is able {{to step forward and}} shoot her.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of lithium shows several differences {{from that of}} the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> as the small Li+ cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character. Lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii, so that they show some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable nitride, a property common among all the alkaline earth metals (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals. In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character (e.g. LiMe and MgMe2).|$|E
5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E

5|$|As {{managing}} director of the UERL from 1910, Stanley led further transport consolidation with the UERL's take-over of London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) in 1912 and the CLR and the C on 1 January 1913. The LGOC was the dominant bus operator in the capital and its high profitability (it paid dividends of 18 per cent compared with Underground Group companies' dividends of 1 to 3 per cent) subsidised the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> Through the UERL's shareholding in the London and Suburban Traction Company (LSTC), which it owned jointly with British Electric Traction, the UERL took control in 1913 of the London United Tramways, the Metropolitan Electric Tramways and the South Metropolitan Electric Tramways. The UERL also took control of bus builder AEC. The much enlarged group became known as the Combine. Only the MR (and its subsidiaries the Great Northern & City Railway and the East London Railway) and the W (by then fully owned by the London and South Western Railway) remained outside of the Underground Group's control.|$|E
5|$|As the Moroccan {{facility}} was one node {{in a wider}} network, Bond and Swann return to London where they meet M, Bill Tanner, Q, and Moneypenny {{with the intention of}} arresting C and stopping Nine Eyes from being activated. Swann and Bond are abducted separately, while the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing the Nine Eyes from going online, a brief struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Meanwhile, Bond is taken to the ruins of the old MI6 building, which is scheduled for demolition after Raoul Silva's bombing. Moving throughout a ruined labyrinth, he encounters a disfigured Blofeld, who tells him that he has a choice between escaping the building before explosives are detonated or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and the two escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto Westminster Bridge. As Blofeld crawls away from the wreckage, Bond confronts him but leaves him to be arrested by M, before leaving the bridge with Swann.|$|E
5|$|At night, Evelyn {{takes the}} Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally {{awakening}} Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows {{them with the}} help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans one by one, and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

Once the tour ended, the band went on an unofficial hiatus, not playing as a group until the next January, when they played a show at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kansas to celebrate the band's tenth anniversary. The show was recorded and released the following May as the band's first live album, Live! @ The Granada Theater.|$|E
5|$|Best was {{studying}} at the Collegiate Grammar School {{when he decided}} he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks, who later played in The Casbah. Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.|$|E
5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen by the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded {{in the studio with}} drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks {{for the rest of the}} band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
