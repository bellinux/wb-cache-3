40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The main subject of the research in this thesis {{is the study of}} conjugate gradient methods for optimization and the development of improved algorithms. After an introductory first chapter, Chapter 2 contains a background of numerical methods for optimization in general and of conjugate gradient-type algorithms in particular. In Chapter 3 we study the convergence properties of conjugate gradient methods and discuss Powell's (1983) counter example that proves that there exist twice continuously differentiable functions with bounded level sets for which the Polak-Ribiere method fails to achieve global convergence whereas the Fletcher-Reeves method is shown to be globally convergent, despite the fact that in numerical computations the Polak-Ribiere method is far more efficient than that of Fletcher-Reeves. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the development of a number of new hybrid algorithms, three of which are shown to satisfy the descent property at every iteration and achieve global convergence regardless of whether exact or inexact line searches are used. A new <b>restarting</b> <b>procedure</b> for conjugate gradient methods is also given that ensures a descent property to hold and global convergence for any conjugate gradient method using a non negative update. The application of these hybrid algorithms and that of the new <b>restarting</b> <b>procedure</b> to a wide class of well-known test problems is given and discussed in the final Chapter "Discussions and Conclusions". The results obtained, given in the appendices, show that a considerable improvement is achieved by these hybrids and by methods using the new <b>restarting</b> <b>procedure</b> over the existing conjugate gradient methods and also over quasi-Newton methods...|$|R

50|$|Also {{beginning}} at Long Beach for all remaining road/street course events, {{cars that are}} not on the lead lap during an upcoming restart in the final 20 laps will peel off and drive through pit lane on the speed limiter and cycle back {{to the end of the}} line.

This is similar to NASCAR's <b>restart</b> <b>procedure,</b> where all lapped cars must move to the rear of the field.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Conjugate {{gradient}} methods {{constitute an}} excellent choice for efficiently training large neural networks since they don’t require {{the evaluation of the}} Hessian matrix neither the impractical storage of an approximation of it. Despite the theoretical and practical advantages of these methods their main drawback is the use of <b>restarting</b> <b>procedures</b> in order to guarantee convergence, abandoning second order derivative information [31]. In this work, we propose a neural network training algorithm which preserves the advantages of classi-cal conjugate gradient methods and simultaneously avoids the inefficient restarts. Encouraging numerical experiments verify that the presented algorithm provides fast, stable and reliable convergence.

50|$|At 13500 ft, {{the crew}} was {{approaching}} the altitude at which {{they would have to}} turn over the ocean and attempt a risky ditching. Although there were guidelines for the water landing procedure, no one had ever tried it in a Boeing 747. As they performed the engine <b>restart</b> <b>procedure,</b> engine number four finally started, and at 13:56 UTC (20:56 Jakarta time), Moody used its power to reduce the rate of descent. Shortly thereafter, engine three restarted, allowing him to climb slowly. Shortly after that, engines one and two successfully restarted as well. The crew subsequently requested and expedited an increase in altitude to clear the high mountains of Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|When {{all four}} main {{generators}} shut off {{due to the}} failure of all the engines, a momentary power interruption occurs when the flight instruments transfer to standby power. Standby power on the 747-400 is provided by two batteries and inverters. The captain performed the engine <b>restart</b> <b>procedure,</b> which failed on the first few attempts, and repeated it until restart was achieved. On some of the attempts, as one or more (but not all) engines started to operate, the main generator switched back on. This switching on and off caused repeated power transfer interruptions to the flight instruments. The temporary blanking of the instruments gave the appearance that standby power had failed. These power transfers were later verified from the flight data recorder.|$|E

They lost considerable altitude while continuing unsuccessfully to attempt to restart both the left engine (two times) and the right engine (two times) for over 14 minutes, using the emergency <b>restart</b> <b>procedure.</b> Despite their four auxiliary power-unit-assisted engine restart attempts, the pilots were unable to restart the engines because their cores had locked.

40|$|Abstract. The time {{required}} for a backtracking search procedure {{to solve a problem}} can be reduced by employing randomized <b>restart</b> <b>procedures.</b> To date, researchers designing restart policies have relied on the simplifying assumption that runs are probabilistically independent from one another. We relax the assumption of independence among runs and address the challenge of identifying an optimal restart policy for the case of dependent runs. We show how offline dynamic programming can be used to generate an ideal restart policy, and how the policy can be used in conjunction with real-time observations to control the timing of restarts. We present results of experiments on applying the methods to create ideal restart policies for several challenging problems using two different solvers...|$|R

The gas generator also incorporates dual heat exchanger that heat hydrogen gas and helium supplied from separate system to pressurize the hydrogen and oxygen tanks.

50|$|The {{anti-stall}} devices activated {{while they}} were at altitude, but the pilots overrode the automatic nose-down that would increase speed to prevent stall. After four overrides, both engines experienced flameout and shut down. The plane then stalled, and the pilots recovered from the stall at FL380 while still having no engines. At that altitude, there were six airports within reach for a forced landing. This led the pilots to pitch nose down {{in an attempt to}} restart the engines, which requires a dive sharp enough to attain the required 300 kn for a windmill restart to make the blades in the turbines windmill at 10% N2 (turbine rotational speed). The captain did not take the necessary steps to ensure that the first officer achieved the 300 kn or greater airspeed required for the windmill engine <b>restart</b> <b>procedure</b> and then did not demonstrate command authority by taking control of the airplane and accelerating it to at least that speed.|$|E

During its second phase, the algorithm tries to reduce the radius of the containing circle by applying (i) an intensified search, based on a reduction search interval, and (ii) a diversified search, based on the application of a number of layout techniques.
