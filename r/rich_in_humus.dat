5|$|Psilocybin {{is present}} in varying {{concentrations}} in over 200 species of Basidiomycota mushrooms which evolved to produce the compound from muscarine some 20 million years ago. In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of hallucinogenic mushrooms, Gastón Guzmán and colleagues considered these to be distributed amongst the following genera: Psilocybe (116species), Gymnopilus (14), Panaeolus (13), Copelandia (12), Hypholoma (6), Pluteus (6), Inocybe (6), Conocybe (4), Panaeolina (4), Gerronema (2) and Agrocybe, Galerina and Mycena (1species each). Guzmán increased his estimate {{of the number of}} psilocybin-containing Psilocybe to 144 species in a 2005 review. The majority of these are found in Mexico (53 species), with the remainder distributed in the US and Canada (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and associated islands (19). In general, psilocybin-containing species are dark-spored, gilled mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods of the subtropics and tropics, usually in soils <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> <b>humus</b> and plant debris. Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents, but the majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests. Psilocybe species commonly found in the tropics include P.cubensis and P.subcubensis. P.semilanceata — considered by Guzmán to be the world's most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom — is found in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, but is entirely absent from Mexico. Although {{the presence or absence of}} psilocybin is not of much use as a chemotaxonomical marker at the familial level or higher, it is used to classify taxa of lower taxonomic groups.|$|E

25|$|Most {{if not all}} Lepiota {{species are}} nitrophilic, with a {{preference}} for calcareous soils. They typically occur <b>in</b> <b>rich</b> <b>humus</b> <b>in</b> broadleaf or conifer woodland, in northern Europe often among nettles (Urtica dioica) or dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis). A few species are more frequently found in calcareous grassland or in dunes. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, but with a preference for warm areas, meaning there are fewer species in colder climates. Around 400 species are currently recognized worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} species are {{relatively}} easy to grow <b>in</b> <b>rich</b> <b>humus</b> compost with some sand.

50|$|It is a woody {{evergreen}} climbing shrub, {{which can}} grow {{in a range}} of conditions. It prefers well-drained or alkaline soils <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> nutrients and <b>humus</b> with good water provision, but is extremely tough and adaptable. Like many climbing plants, it prefers its roots in cool shade with its crown in full sun. It can live over 400 years, reaching heights of 30m where suitable surfaces (trees, cliffs, walls) are available. It climbs by means of aerial rootlets with matted pads that cling strongly to the substrate. Its favoured distribution is humid microclimates, such as cloud forest, stream valleys, and the mountain ranges on the Turkish coast of the Black Sea, Asia minor, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and some islands of the Red Sea.|$|R
