It won the contest over the Lublin R-XXI {{project and the}} PWS factory project, but factory trials showed that its performance was still not satisfactory. In 1937 two modified prototypes were built, designated RWD-14a, but both crashed during trials that year due to steering mechanism faults (the pilots survived). Finally, in early 1938 the fourth improved prototype, designated RWD-14b, was built. After successful trials it was ordered by the Polish Air Force, receiving the name Czapla (Polish: heron), but due to a long development process, it was regarded as only an interim model, to replace the R-XIII until {{the advent of the}} more modern LWS-3 Mewa. In return for <b>refunding</b> the development costs, the DWL gave the rights to produce the RWD-14b to the state factory LWS (Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów – Lublin Aircraft Works, a successor of the Plage i Laśkiewicz).|$|E

25|$|The General Ticketing Machines (GTMs) at each station which {{replaced}} the older ticketing machines, allow commuters to purchase additional credit {{to add to}} their EZ-Link cards or to purchase tickets for single trips. Fares for these single trip tickets are higher than those for EZ-Link cards. In addition, a S$1.00 refundable ticket deposit is charged for each Standard Ticket. This refund can be collected from any General Ticketing Machine {{so as long as}} the card is returned to the machine within 30 days of purchase. The card can also be deposited into a charity collection box, with the S$1 deposit going to charity. The rationale behind such a refundable deposit feature was that the smartcard technology contained within each Standard Ticket makes each one costly enough to necessitate the recycling of Standard Tickets. Since November 2007, external readers were installed on GTMs at stations operated by SMRT Corporation to address problems of card jamming in insert slots. The slots, however, remain in use for the purpose of <b>refunding</b> Standard Ticket deposits.|$|E

On a private region, the {{built-in}} land selling controls allow the landlord to sell land {{in the region to}} another Resident while still retaining some control. Residents purchasing, or renting, land from any other party than Linden Lab are not required to hold a Premium membership nor to necessarily pay a tier fee, although typically the landlord will require some form of upfront or monthly fee to compensate them for their liability to pay the land use fee charged by Linden Lab. However Linden Lab acknowledges only the landlord as the owner of the land, and will not intervene in disputes between Residents. This means, for example, that a landlord can withdraw a Resident's land from availability, without <b>refunding</b> their money, and Linden Lab will not arbitrate in the dispute unless it is a clear-cut matter of 'land fraud'. Users can report such matters to Linden Lab if they occur and they will look into it.|$|E

[...] He was a major figure in securing the transfer of resource rights from the federal government to the Alberta government.

[...] When Alberta became the only province to support the appellants in the [...] "Persons case", Lymburn was responsible for its submission. [...] He was also involved in scandal: {{the former head of the}} Liquor Investigation Bureau made allegations against him after Lymburn eliminated the Bureau to save money, though the charges had little effect either in the legal system or in the public eye. [...] During the John Brownlee sex scandal, in which Brownlee was sued for the seduction of a family friend, Lymburn became the focus of controversy after his department hired a private investigator to look into claims that a Liberal lawyer had offered a young woman money to [...] "put Mr. Brownlee in such a position that Mrs. Brownlee could get a divorce". [...] Taking the stand during the trial, Lymburn stated that the investigation had been initiated not to aid in the premier's defense, but because the alleged solicitation was a criminal offense.

50|$|According to the Internal Revenue Service, 77% of {{tax returns}} filed in 2004 {{received}} a <b>refund</b> check, {{with the average}} <b>refund</b> check being $2,100. In 2011, the average tax <b>refund</b> was $2,913. Taxpayers may choose to have their <b>refund</b> directly deposited into their bank account, have a check mailed to them, or have their <b>refund</b> applied to the following year's income tax. As of 2006, tax filers may now split their tax <b>refund</b> with direct deposit in up to three separate accounts with three different financial institutions. This has given taxpayers an opportunity to save and spend some of their <b>refund</b> (rather than only spend their <b>refund).</b> Every year, a number of U.S. taxpayers around the country get tax <b>refunds</b> even if they owe zero income tax. This is due to withholding calculations and {{the earned income tax}} credit.

500|$|When Parliament was {{dissolved}} in 1780, Thurlow ensured that Kenyon was returned as a Member of Parliament for Hindon. In April 1782, on {{the formation of}} the Rockingham government, Kenyon was made Attorney-General for England and Wales, despite having never sat in the lower office of Solicitor-General or spoken in Parliament. As Attorney General he spoke on only one subject, on 18 June 1782, in regards to the amount of money owed to the Exchequer by the Paymaster of the Forces. This provoked the opposition of Charles James Fox, whose father, Lord Holland, had profited greatly by that office; Kenyon's programme could have ruined Fox by making him liable for <b>refunding</b> his father's profits as Paymaster. On the death of Rockingham Kenyon continued in his post under the Shelburne Ministry, but left office in April 1783 when that government fell to the Fox-North Coalition. He instead allied himself with William Pitt the Younger, leading the opposition to the first Act of the new government and strongly supporting an opposition bill to reform the Exchequer. When the new government was dismissed on 19 December and Pitt took control, Kenyon was again made Attorney-General. He again took the lead {{on the issue of the}} Paymaster of the Forces, and commanded that Richard Rigby, Paymaster until 1782, [...] "do deliver to the House an account of the balance of all public money remaining in his hands on the 13th day of November last", something Rigby complained was against common practice.|$|E

40|$|Although {{previous}} research demonstrates {{the profitability of}} partial <b>refund</b> policies in a monopoly setting, {{there is a certain}} lack of ubiquity in practice about these <b>refunds</b> in competitive service markets. This raises the question of how a partial <b>refund</b> policy may work and whether it is even sustainable in a competitive environment. This study investigates how competition may influence the profitability and the equilibrium choice of <b>refund</b> policies. It is shown that partial <b>refunds</b> may endogenously change the nature of strategic interaction between service providers from local monopolies into a competition regime, which moderates the gains from exploiting the efficiency-enhancing effect of partial <b>refunds.</b> A whole range of pure-strategy equilibria can be obtained {{as a result of the}} interplay between the efficiency-improving and the competition-intensifying effects. When the capacity is small (large) such that the efficiency-improving (the competition-intensifying) effect is dominant, both firms in equilibrium follow identical partial (zero) <b>refund</b> policies. Moreover, interestingly, the symmetric firms may end up in an asymmetric equilibrium in which one firm follows a partial <b>refund</b> policy and the other adopts a zero <b>refund</b> policy. advance selling, cancellations, capacity constraint, competition, contingent contracts, <b>refunds,</b> reservations, services, uncertainty, yield management...|$|R
