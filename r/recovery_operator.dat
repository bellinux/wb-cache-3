40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a family of}} Galerkin finite element methods which are constructed via <b>recovery</b> <b>operators</b> over element-wise discontinuous approximation spaces.

Moreover, for special choices of <b>recovery</b> <b>operators,</b> R-FEM produces the same approximate solution as the classical conforming finite element method, while, trivially, one can recast (primal formulation) discontinuous Galerkin methods. A priori error bounds are shown for linear second order boundary value problems, verifying the optimality of the proposed method. Residual-type a posteriori bounds are also derived, highlighting the potential of R-FEM in the context of adaptive computations. Numerical experiments highlight the good approximation properties of the method in practice. A discussion on the potential use of R-FEM in various settings is also included.

40|$|Too high {{sampling}} rate is the bottleneck to wideband spectrum sensing for cognitive radio in mobile communication. Compressed sensing (CS) is introduced {{to transfer the}} sampling burden. The standard sparse signal recovery of CS does not consider the distortion in the analogue-to-information converter (AIC). To mitigate performance degeneration casued by the mismatch in least square distortionless constraint which doesn't consider the AIC distortion, we define the sparse signal with the sampling distortion as a bounded additive noise, and An anti-sampling-distortion constraint (ASDC) is deduced. Then we combine the ℓ 1 norm based sparse constraint with the ASDC to get a novel robust sparse signal <b>recovery</b> <b>operator</b> with sampling distortion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms standard sparse wideband spectrum sensing in accuracy, denoising ability, etc. Comment: 24 pages, 4 figures, 1 table; accepted by International Journal of Mobile Communication...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{gradient}} recovery {{schemes for}} data defined on discretized manifolds. The proposed method, parametric polynomial preserving recovery (PPPR), does {{not ask for}} the tangent spaces of the exact manifolds which have been assumed for some significant gradient recovery methods in the literature. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it removes the symmetric requirement from the existing methods for the superconvergence. These properties make it a prime method when meshes are arbitrarily structured or generated from high curvature surfaces. As an application, we show that the <b>recovery</b> <b>operator</b> is capable of constructing an asymptotically exact posteriori error estimator. Several numerical examples on 2 [...] dimensional surfaces are presented to support the theoretical results and make comparisons with methods {{in the state of}} the art, which show evidence that the PPPR method outperforms the existing methods...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} derive a posteriori error estimators of {{residual}} type for the finite element approximation of the p-Laplacian, {{and show that}} they are reliable, and efficient up to higher order terms. We then construct some a posteriori error estimators based on gradient recovery. We further compare the two types of a posteriori error estimators. It is found that there exist some relationships between the two types of estimators, which are similar to those held {{in the case of the}} Laplacian. It is shown that the a posteriori error estimators based on gradient recovery are equivalent to the discretization error in a quasi-norm provided the solution is sufficiently smooth and mesh is uniform. Under stronger conditions, superconvergnece properties have been established for the used gradient <b>recovery</b> <b>operator,</b> and then some of the gradient recovery based estimates are further shown to be asymptotically exact to the discretization error in a quasi-norm. Numerical results demonstrating these a posteriori estimates are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Quantum Error Correction will be {{necessary}} for preserving coherent states against noise and other unwanted interactions in quantum computation and communication. We develop a general theory of quantum error correction based on encoding states into larger Hilbert spaces subject to known interactions. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery of an encoded state after its degradation by an interaction. The conditions depend only {{on the behavior of}} the logical states. We use them to give a <b>recovery</b> <b>operator</b> independent definition of error-correcting codes. We relate this definition to four others: The existence of a left inverse of the interaction, an explicit representation of the error syndrome using tensor products, perfect recovery of the completely entangled state and an information theoretic identity. Two notions of fidelity and error for imperfect recovery are introduced, one for pure and the other for entangled states. The latter is more appropriate when using codes in a quantum memory or in applications of quantum teleportation to communication. We show that the error for entangled states is bounded linearly by the error for pure states. A formal definition of independent interactions for qubits is given. This leads to lower bounds on the number of qubits required to correct errors and a formal proof that the classical bounds on the probability of errorcorrecting codes applies to error correcting quantum codes, provided that the interaction is dominated by an identity component...|$|E
40|$|We study some {{theoretical}} {{aspects of}} P_NP_M schemes, {{which are a}} novel class of high order accurate reconstruction based discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws. The PNPM schemes store and evolve the discrete solution u_h under the form of piecewise polynomials of degree N, while piecewise polynomials w_h of degree M ≥ N are used for the computation of the volume and boundary fluxes. The piecewise polynomials w_h are obtained from u_h via a suitable reconstruction or <b>recovery</b> <b>operator.</b> The P_NP_M approach contains high order finite volume methods (N= 0) as well as classical DG schemes (N=M) as special cases of a more general framework. Furthermore, for N ≠ M and N> 0, it leads to a new intermediate class of methods, which can be denoted either as Hermite finite volume or as reconstructed DG methods. We show analytically why P_NP_M methods for N ≠ M are, in general, not L^ 2 -diminishing. To this end, we extend the well-known cell entropy inequality and the following L^ 2 stability result of Jiang and Shu for DG methods (i. e. for N=M) to the general P_NP_M case and identify which part in the reconstruction step may cause the instability. With this insight we design a flux limiter that enforces a cell square entropy inequality and thus an L^ 2 stability condition for P_NP_M schemes for scalar conservation laws in one space dimension. Furthermore, {{in this paper we}} prove existence and uniqueness of the solution of the P_NP_M reconstruction operator...|$|E
