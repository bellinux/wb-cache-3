40|$|The main {{research}} problem of this thesis {{is to find}} out the means of promoting the <b>recovery</b> of <b>packaging</b> waste generated in thefast food industry. The <b>recovery</b> of <b>packaging</b> waste generated in the fast food industry is demanded by the packaging waste legislation and expected by the public. The means are revealed by the general factors influencing the <b>recovery</b> of <b>packaging</b> waste, analysed by a multidisciplinary literature review and a case study focusing on the packaging waste managementof McDonald's Oy operating in Finland. The existing solid waste infrastructure does not promote the recovery ofpackaging waste generated in the fast food industry. The theoretical recovery rate of the packaging waste is high, 93 %, while the actual recovery rate is only 29 % consisting of secondary packaging manufactured from cardboard. The total <b>recovery</b> potential of <b>packaging</b> waste is 64 %, resulting in 1 230 tonnes ofrecoverable packaging waste. The achievable recovery potential of 33 %, equalling 647 tonnes of packaging waste could be recovered, but is not recovered mainly because of non-working waste management practises. The theoretical recovery potential of 31 %, equalling 583 tonnes of packaging waste can not be recovered by the existing solid waste infrastructure because of the obscure status of commecial waste, the improper operation ofproducer organisations, and the municipal autonomy. The sorting experiment indicated {{that it is possible to}} reach the achievable recovery potential inthe existing solid waste infrastructure. The achievement is promoted by waste producer -oriented waste management practises. The theoretical recovery potential can be reached by increasing the consistency of the solid waste infrastructure through governmental action...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{concern on}} {{packaging}} and packaging materials is growing worldwide, mainly related to waste management and waste treatment, {{but also with}} respect to resources and energy saving efforts. In Europe, a directive on packaging and packing waste issued by the European Community administration is currently being discussed and may be implemented within 1993 or 1994. The aim of this directive is the reduction of packaging waste by requiring - reusable <b>packaging</b> - <b>recovery</b> of <b>packaging</b> materials, - energy <b>recovery</b> from <b>packaging</b> waste to a certain, quantitativly defined extend. From the environmental point of view there are clear priorities on packaging: avoidance of waste by reuse, <b>recovery</b> of <b>packaging</b> waste by material recovery or at least by energy recovery, minimization of materials for final deposition. Methods to evaluate the environmental impact are life cycle analysis and assessment ("eco balance sheets") {{as well as the}} aim of a closed loop material economy. The European st andardization organization CEN is currently developping criteria for environmental conscious packaging, including terminology, life cycle analysis, material recovery, energy recovery, degradability and composting. Thus this standards will affect in future distribution technology, packaging materials development, e. g. biodegradable plastics, reusable and refillable packaging and also packaging testing relating to transportation loads...|$|R

40|$|In North America today, we {{are about}} to embark on a {{significant}} effort to repair, or even upgrade, many aspects of our infrastructure. Many of these efforts are linked to economic <b>recovery</b> <b>packages.</b> Others are based on sheer need. The challenge for decision makers and planners involves ensuring that scarce economic resources are put to their best use. Understanding the concept of fragility plays a pivotal part in reaching that understanding. Fragility, like many other systems—particularly Information Technology (IT) systems—works on the concept of subjects and objects. Subjects are those entities that seek to exploit the services (or capacity) offered by the object. Objects, on the other hand, are those entities that deliver some good or service to the overall system. Of course, something may act as the object in one pairing and the subject in another pairing—they are not exclusive in nature...|$|R
