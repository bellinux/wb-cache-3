5|$|Merit system: The {{earliest}} {{example of}} a merit system {{dates back to the}} Qin and Han dynasties. In order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials. Prospective officials could come from a <b>rural</b> <b>background</b> and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the civil service examinations, and education became the key for social mobility. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established during the Three Kingdoms period. The concept of a merit system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the contact}} hypothesis, I {{hypothesized}} that college students from <b>rural</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> {{who are less}} likely to have had contact with members of minority groups, {{will be more likely to}} hold stereotypic beliefs about and may hold more negative attitudes toward those groups than students from urban areas, who have had more opportunities for intergroup contact. Students from Ball State University completed a questionnaire assessing depth of contact with African-Americans, negative and positive stereotypes of African-Americans, affective prejudice toward African-Americans, symbolic racism, and perceived threat and perceived competitiveness toward African-Americans. Contrary to the hypothesis, there were no differences between students from urban and <b>rural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> on the indicators of prejudice. However, students from <b>rural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> did report having less contact with African-Americans and intergroup contact was negatively related to prejudice. These results suggest that personal experiences maybe better indicators of prejudice than demographic background...|$|R

After the revolution in 1952, which overthrew King Farouk and gave power to Gamal Abdel Nasser, many of the rich foreigners, as well as native landowners and businessmen, who had lived at the Yacoubian fled the country. Each vacated apartment was then occupied by a military officer and his family, who were often of a more <b>rural</b> <b>background</b> and lower social caste than the previous residents.|$|E
25|$|In many ways, however, Zamfirescu was a Realist, notably {{using the}} {{guidelines}} imposed by Junimea {{as a means}} to give an accurate portrayal of his characters' speech. Researcher Z. Ornea argued that the main disagreement between him and the literary society was over Maiorescu's view that the national values of Romania were mostly embodied by the peasants, with Zamfirescu arguing that these had also been preserved by the cultured groups of low-ranking boyars. As noted by Ornea, Zamfirescu's focus on the latter group and his nationalism came to contrast with his aesthetic guidelines, and, paradoxically, led to virtually all of his novels having a <b>rural</b> <b>background</b> and displaying a strong sympathy for the peasantry.|$|E

25|$|While Yeats and his {{followers}} wrote about an essentially aristocratic Gaelic Ireland, the reality was that the actual Ireland of the 1930s and 1940s was a society of small farmers and shopkeepers. Inevitably, a generation of poets who rebelled against the example of Yeats, but who were not Modernist by inclination, emerged from this environment. Patrick Kavanagh (19041967), who came from a small farm, wrote about the narrowness and frustrations of rural life. John Hewitt (19071987), whom many {{consider to be the}} founding father of Northern Irish poetry, also came from a <b>rural</b> <b>background</b> but lived in Belfast and was amongst the first Irish poets to write of the sense of alienation that many at this time felt from both their original rural and new urban homes. Louis MacNeice (19071963), another Northern Irish poet, was associated with the left-wing politics of Michael Roberts's anthology New Signatures but was much less political a poet than W. H. Auden or Stephen Spender, for example. MacNeice's poetry was informed by his immediate interests and surroundings and is more social than political. In the South, the Republic of Ireland, a post-modernist generation of poets and writers emerged from the late 1950s onwards. Prominent among these writers were the poets Antony Cronin, Pearse Hutchinson, John Jordan, Thomas Kinsella and John Montague, most of whom were based in Dublin in the 1960s and 1970s. In Dublin a number of new literary magazines were founded in the 1960s; Poetry Ireland, Arena, The Lace Curtain, and in the 1970s, Cyphers.|$|E
25|$|From the 1680s (army) {{and early}} 18th century (navy), all {{soldiers}} {{in a given}} company were required to have a unique name, {{to make it easier}} to give specific orders. This could be problematic when several soldiers had the same name (being usually from <b>rural</b> <b>background,</b> they generally had just a patronymic, and such were often very common, e.g. Andersson, Eriksson, Olsson or Persson), giving rise to the Swedish soldier names. When a soldier appeared before the military scribe, he was given a soldier's name (often, a rote's new soldier received his predecessor's name), which he kept during his service. Those surnames also tended to become hereditary, as the soldier often retained it when he was pensioned or left the service, and his children were also registered under it in census lists and church booksthis is the origin of many present-day Swedish surnames. The name was usually short, consisting of only one syllableto make it easy and rapid to say. The names could be taken from a trait, such as the surname Stolt ("Proud") or from military terms, such as Svärd ("Sword"), but were often related to the rote. A soldier from a rote located in the village of Sundby, for example, could be given the surname Sundin. This meant that surnames often stayed with the croft, rather than with the soldier. Common practice amongst discharged soldiers in the 18th century was to reassume their original name. This changed in the 19th century, and many soldiers kept their old soldier names, passing it on to their children. Each soldier in the regiment also had a unique number, between 1 and 1,200, the number of the rote and croft he belonged to (for example nummer 15 Stolt, number 15 Stolt).|$|E
