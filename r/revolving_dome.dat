25|$|Hartness’s {{interest}} in optics and astronomy {{led to his}} development of a telescope mount with the <b>revolving</b> <b>dome</b> on an equatorial plane. An additional feature of this telescope, which still stands at the former Hartness Mansion, was that the optics of the telescope passed through a lens in {{the wall of the}} dome. This allowed the observer to stay warm in winter. (Conventional telescopes were often contained within domes that opened an aperture for the telescope to gain exposure both to the sky and the ambient air.) The success of this patent led to more telescope activities and commissions. With Hartness's encouragement and financial support, Russell W. Porter initiated the Springfield Telescope Makers Club. The club still celebrates their annual Stellafane gathering in Springfield.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've done my work, {{and now you}} can do {{what you}} please.' He lay still, staring at the ceiling, the long-pent-up {{delirium}} of drink in his veins, his brain on fire with racing thoughts that would not stay to be considered, and his hands crisped and dry. He had just discovered that he was painting the face of the Melancolia on a <b>revolving</b> <b>dome</b> ribbed with millions of lights, and that all his wondrous thoughts stood embodied hundreds of feet below his tiny swinging plank, shouting together in his honour, when something cracked inside his temples like an overstrained bowstring, the glittering dome broke inward, and he was alone in the thick night.|$|E
5000|$|In 1848 Arthur Kett Barclay {{built his}} own astronomical {{observatory}} at Bury Hill, Dorking, Surrey. The <b>revolving</b> <b>dome</b> {{was made by}} Ransomes & May of Ipswich and the eight inch (203mm) aperture refracting telescope was by Troughton & Simms of London ...|$|E

Staley Manufacturing Company Administration Building, Decatur, Illinois (1930): mobile color floodlighting, {{first use}} of General Electric's Thyratron tube dimmer, plus <b>revolving</b> beacon on <b>dome.</b> Color display recreated in 1989 with a computer. Building design: Aschauer & Waggoner. Lighting design: F. D. Crowther, General Electric (1930); Lutron Co., Bodine Electric, and Staley Co. (1989).|$|R
2500|$|Celer and Severus {{also created}} an ingenious mechanism, cranked by slaves, that [...] made the ceiling {{underneath}} the <b>dome</b> <b>revolve</b> like the heavens, while perfume was sprayed and rose petals were {{dropped on the}} assembled diners. According to some accounts, perhaps embellished by Nero's political enemies, on one occasion such quantities of rose petals were dropped that one unlucky guest was asphyxiated (a similar story is told of the emperor Elagabalus).|$|R
40|$|Limit Analysis {{provides}} a conceptually simple and robust method {{to estimate the}} safety of structures and has been long applied {{to the analysis of}} the ultimate collapse state of two-dimensional masonry structures or structural elements. In <b>revolving</b> symmetric <b>domes,</b> the three-dimensional problem can be reduced to the two-dimensional case under appropriate hypotheses. The Vicoforte dome is the largest elliptical dome in the world, and its complex geometry makes this kind of analysis not straightforward. Starting from some basic assumptions, a method for analyzing the three-dimensional elliptical geometry and understand the behavior at collapse of the drum-dome system using limit analysis is proposed. The three dimensional collapse mechanism is found and the system behavior including the presence of tension rings at different levels is interpreted. The results are compared against a nonlinear finite element mode...|$|R
50|$|Planning for the {{observatory}} began in 1787 {{by the court}} astronomer Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, with the financing of Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. It was based upon the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford, England. The building was divided into five parts, with the central section holding a <b>revolving</b> <b>dome.</b> There were two wings to provide quarters for the staff.|$|E
5000|$|The {{material}} used in {{its construction}} is white sandstone from Lockport--sixty miles west--and, unlike many varieties {{of this kind}} of stone, is free from red oxide of iron. The tower is circular in form, with a diameter of thirty-one feet, outside measurement. Its <b>revolving</b> <b>dome</b> is, of course, of the same diameter. This dome embodies some novel features, and in the matter of economy of construction, lightness, ease of revolution and simplicity of the device for rotating, leaves little to be desired." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Detroit Observatory, {{located on}} the campus of the University of Michigan, is a two-story hip roof {{rectangular}} frame structure, 33 ft on a side, flanked by two one-story wings, each 19 ft by 29 ft. [...] The design is typical of observatories built in the 19th century. [...] The structure is constructed of solid brick clad with stucco painted to resemble granite blocks. It is capped with a large <b>revolving</b> <b>dome</b> built of wood and canvas, 21 ft in diameter. A small portico covers the front entrance.|$|E

50|$|The best-known part of Rock Ferry is Rock Park, on {{the banks}} of the River Mersey, an area of large Victorian villas of {{sandstone}} from Storeton quarry. In what was one of the first residential park developments in Britain, the houses were built between 1837 and 1850, and were the first early Victorian properties to be designated listed buildings. The lodge and nine other houses were demolished in the 1970s to make way for the New Ferry By-Pass (A41), including Hawthorne House, number 26, the former house of Nathaniel Hawthorne when he was consul to Liverpool in the 1850s. The property was subsequently owned by astronomer Isaac Roberts, who installed a seven-inch refracter in a <b>revolving</b> <b>dome</b> on the top floor. Immediately after the building of the bypass, the remainder of Rock Park was quickly designated a conservation area in 1979.|$|E
