40|$|Commonly, {{organizational}} members {{faced with}} giving negative feedback {{find themselves in}} an uncomfortable situation and fail to share negative information (e. g., Manzoni, 2002; Harvey et al., 2009). Unfortunately, the failure to communicate bad news or give negative feedback can have disastrous consequences. For instance, in airline crashes, the NTSB (2000) reports that {{a substantial number of}} accidents may occur, in part, due to <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>co-pilot</b> to speak-up when the captain has made an error. The August, 1997, Korean Air Flight 801 crash is attributed in part to <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>co-pilot</b> and engineer to speak up about their awareness of instrument and altitude problems. Pilot errors went unchallenged, and as a result, the crew was unable to correct the flight path in time (NTSB, 2000). However, not all instances of mum lead to such dire ends. Smith, Keil, and Depledge (2001) provide <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> a failed joint venture of Marriott, Hilton, and Budget Rent-a-Car where those operating the failing reservation system reported that important technical and performance problems had not been shared with all parties, thus creating both ethical and financial problems for all involved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) {{that ensures}} safety when traffic rules are respected by all road users. This concept, {{referred to as}} legal safety, is proposed as a basis that permits human and automated drivers to share the road infrastructure. It is illustrated for a Highly Automated driving System with speed keeping, distance keeping and lane changing functionalities on highways (HAS). The requirements legal safety places upon HAS components are presented, with a special focus on <b>the</b> <b>co-pilot</b> which calculates a safe trajectory for the vehicle based on perception of lanes and traffic signs and prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trajectories <b>of</b> objects in <b>the</b> environment. A lane coordinate system is proposed as a powerful reference for <b>the</b> trajectory calculations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>co-pilot.</b> <b>The</b> system controls the vehicle and communicates with the driver, according to an automation mode scheme inspired by the horse-rider metaphor (H-metaphor) ...|$|R
5000|$|Placing pilot error as a {{cause of}} an {{aviation}} accident has often been controversial. For example, the NTSB ruled that <b>the</b> crash <b>of</b> American Airlines Flight 587 was because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rudder, which was caused by [...] "unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs" [...] on <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>co-pilot</b> who was operating the aircraft at the time. Attorneys for <b>the</b> <b>co-pilot,</b> who was killed in the crash, argue that American Airlines' pilots had never been properly trained concerning extreme rudder inputs. The attorneys also claimed that the rudder failure was actually caused by a flaw in <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Airbus A300 aircraft and that <b>the</b> <b>co-pilot's</b> rudder inputs should not have caused the catastrophic rudder failure that led to the accident that killed 265 people.|$|R

50|$|During the {{approach}} to runway 14 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zurich airport, the pilot's ILS display gave false values due to a faulty receiver and showed about 1,000 feet of additional altitude and a centered glide slope, even though it flew much too low. <b>The</b> ILS receiver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>co-pilot</b> was working correctly and was showing the dangerously low approach. Despite this, the captain decided - without thoroughly examining which was the correct value - to ignore the second device. A go-around maneuver initiated by <b>the</b> <b>co-pilot</b> was aborted by the captain. Shortly afterwards, at 19:11 CET, the plane struck the Stadlerberg mountain at 1,660 ft.

The aircraft's intended altitude was reportedly changed three times from 38000 ft to 592 ft, the latter being below ground level, and the speed was manually adjusted as well.
