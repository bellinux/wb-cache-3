5000|$|Martin City was {{originally}} platted as Tilden in 1887 by E.L. Martin and John H. Lipscomb. It {{was named for}} Samuel Jones Tilden, a presidential candidate who was defeated by Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876. [...] The name was changed in 1895, because there was another town of Tilden in Dallas County. The name [...] "Martin City" [...] came from Edward Lowe Martin who came to Missouri in 1868 {{at the age of}} 26. Martin was famous for organizing the Kansas City Distilling Company, and E. L. Martin & Co. wholesale liquor, as well as serving as the mayor of Kansas City in 1873. During Prohibition, there was drugstore in Martin City where customers could purchase moonshine through a window {{in the back of the}} store.

5000|$|Ban This is a 1989 skateboarding {{documentary}} film featuring the Bones Brigade. It presents {{a commentary on}} how many people view skateboarders as delinquents or lawbreakers. The video starts with a scientist posing a question to the viewer, what is skateboarding? Then it cuts to a montage of the skaters in the video. As the video progresses it intercuts skits with the solo video parts of the skaters. These skits are meant to show how ludicrous peoples reactions to skateboarders are: in a crime ridden area with robbery, drugs, and prostitution, the one cop arrests a kid for skateboarding on the sidewalk. The skits also present the skaters in a [...] "classy" [...] scenario: Four skaters are {{in a parking lot}} dressed as golfers. They have caddies and golf bags with skateboards in them. The video is presented as a broadcast of a golf tournament with the quiet commentator marveling at the skill of the players. There are also interjections of a panel of people who oppose everything in the video, for example: saying,"That's not art," [...] following a section with the skaters painting on a ramp. The video ends with a scooter race downhill. The scooters are constructed like the old apple crate and <b>roller-skate</b> scooters of the late 1940s and 50s. The skaters in the video battle with each other as they fight their way to the finish. Lance Mountain is victorious and gets the prize and the girl. The video is known for the slow motion part of Tony Hawk demonstrating some of the most difficult tricks and maneuvers at the time.|$|E
