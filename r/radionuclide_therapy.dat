25|$|Systemic {{radioisotope}} therapy (RIT) {{is a form}} {{of targeted}} therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule or antibody to guide it to the target tissue. The radioisotopes are delivered through infusion (into the bloodstream) or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) to treat neuroblastoma, of oral iodine-131 to treat thyroid cancer or thyrotoxicosis, and of hormone-bound lutetium-177 and yttrium-90 to treat neuroendocrine tumors (peptide receptor <b>radionuclide</b> <b>therapy).</b>|$|E

30|$|We {{propose a}} 177 Lu {{dosimetry}} protocol based on two-time-point QSPECT imaging and the small-VOI sampling, which yields accurate dosimetry results, {{particularly for the}} kidney and the tumor, with a very high inter-observer reproducibility.

30|$|The {{clinical}} {{impact of}} truly quantitative SPECT/CT has as yet not been established {{and is also}} {{beyond the scope of}} this current study, mainly due to our lack of a gold standard. Expectations are that quantitative workups could prove beneficial when diagnosing diseases affecting tracer uptake in a diffuse rather than focal manner such as osteoporosis [17] or three-vessel coronary artery disease [30]. Other potential benefits include improved personalized dosimetry of <b>radionuclide</b> <b>therapies</b> and further the use of SPECT/CT for monitoring therapy, e.g., in neoplastic disease, analogously to PET [23].|$|R

50|$|For metastatic disease, peptide {{receptor}} <b>radionuclide</b> <b>therapy</b> (PRRT) can {{be highly}} effective.

30|$|With {{quantitative}} imaging, {{the physical}} quantity activity (i.e., Becquerel or Curie) of the isotope distributed in space is estimated. However, {{especially in the}} case of <b>radionuclide</b> <b>therapies,</b> the process of interest is not the activity per se, but rather the subsequent dose absorption by the surrounding tissue (in Gray), as a result of high energy particles (betas and photons) emitted in the process of decay. This process of dose absorption is what causes the tumor kill and constitutes a rather complex interaction, which depends both on the tissue and the specific emissions from the isotope.|$|R
30|$|In the {{relatively}} short time since entering the clinical arena, PSMA-targeted therapies have shown promising results and a further intensification of their use is to be expected. Due to {{the increasing number of}} <b>radionuclide</b> <b>therapies,</b> radiation protection issues must also be taken into account when optimizing therapy protocols. In the work presented here, we describe the results of some essential aspects of radiation protection in the context of 177 Lu-PSMA therapy, namely, the exposure of the general population by treated patients and the excretion of unbound or metabolized radioactive PSMA compounds.|$|R
30|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} role activity quantitation has to play is in the targeted <b>radionuclide</b> <b>therapies</b> (TRT) [5]. The assessment of tumor burden, prediction of potentially critical organs and normal tissue toxicities, and calculation of the radiation dose are all necessary elements of the personalized, image-based therapy planning as well as evaluation of patient’s response to this therapy. They all require accurate absolute quantification {{of the amount of}} the radioactive material that is localized in tumor(s) and critical organs and characterization of its changes over time (biokinetics) [6, 7].|$|R
