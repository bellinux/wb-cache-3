40|$|This report, "Study on Rents and Rent Flexibility " {{provides}} information on alternative methods for establishing rent policies in federal housing subsidy programs, including public housing and the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. The study is intended to help policymakers, local housing agencies and affordable housing advocates to assess potential changes to the current Brooke Amendment <b>rent</b> <b>structure,</b> under which assisted housing tenants pay 30 {{percent of their income}} for rent. The report assesses alternative rent structures, and their impact on HUD's target population, especially households making 0 - 15 % of Area Median Income, excluding elderly and disabled households.

The economic system consists of multiple cities interconnected by high-speed railway systems with each city consisting of one production sector as well as residential land use.

40|$|Standard {{economic}} theory on subsidies and labor supply raises an unappetizing prospect - that housing assistance {{may have a}} negative impact on self-sufficiency. Because of the <b>rent</b> <b>structure</b> in the public housing and Housing Choice Voucher programs, participants may treat program benefits as a substitute form of income and this may dampen their ambitions to increase their own earnings. According to a comprehensive literature review by Mark Shroder (2002), the evidence for these disincentive effects has been quite mixed. Moreover, the rigor and precision of various research efforts have been somewhat lacking. This study updates Shroder’s work by summarizing and critiquing a variety of recent additions to the literature on housing assistance and its effect upon residents’ progress toward self-sufficiency. These additions include five careful studies which have found that traditional assistance reduces employment and slows income growth. However, countervailing research continues to appear, suggesting that housing assistance, coupled with self- sufficiency programs, can have a positive effect on financial independence. So while it may be said that the totality of the evidence in this area remains mixed, those believing that public housing and vouchers have neutral or even positive effects on work and earnings now face a more onerous burden of proof. Existing research on the work disincentives of housing assistance hypothesized in standard labor-supply theory cannot easily be ignored. Much more encouraging are programs like Family Self Sufficiency and Jobs-Plus, which supplement housing assistance with a range of supportive services that promote self-sufficiency among recipients. If the disincentive hypothesis is in fact true, it now appears that well-designed enhancements to traditional housing assistance can counteract inherent negative employment and income effects...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the viability of an alternative method of measuring housing affordability stress (using the residual income method) to that of the ubiquitous 30 per cent benchmark method. The project will help devise rent-setting formulas for social housing that better correspond to need; improve the efficiency and equity of housing subsidy allocation; and better assess risks in home purchase.   Description The residual income method calculates how much is left over for housing rents or mortgage after relevant expenditure items for different household types have been taken into account. If there is insufficient income left for rents and mortgages after meeting this budget standard, a household is thought to have an affordability problem. For a broad measure of affordability across all households, the residual income method provides results not too dissimilar to the benchmark method for estimating housing affordability stress (i. e. the 30 / 40 rule).   However for the lowest 40 per cent of income earners and using the Low Cost Budget Standard, there is a much higher incidence of households with affordability problems (33. 6 %) compared to the 30 / 40 method (23. 9 %). Furthermore, the results are affected by the type of household and their different expenditures.   Using the residual income method, there are severe affordability problems among aged renters (84. 3 % of singles and 62. 2 % of couples), and families with young children under five (68 %). Modeling using the residual income measure shows that above a certain income point there is much greater capacity to purchase or rent than the much used 30 per cent rule would tell us. It also suggests that under the current <b>rent</b> <b>structure</b> in social housing those on very low incomes may be paying an excessive amount of income on rents while those on higher incomes generally have a greater margin to afford housing costs.   By contrast, modeling of income eligibility mechanisms of the National Rental Affordability Scheme (with its discounted rent) reveals that relatively few households experienced affordability problems. The residual income method is useful for more informed decision-making around affordability issues.   Policy makers should be concerned that for certain groups existing measures may be under-measuring the problem of affordability (especially old age and families, those on low incomes in public housing), but be reassured that for others (e. g. those on higher incomes purchasing a house) the problems of affordability may be overstated.

5000|$|Before the Civil War (1861-1865), black {{children}} in Missouri {{were not allowed}} an education.

In 1872, the school moved to a <b>rented</b> <b>structure,</b> until it burned down, after which the school moved back to the church until 1892, when a new elementary school was built. This school, the first public school in Webster Groves, was named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass.In 1898, three students graduated the 8th grade. For further education, tuition needed to be paid for the students to attend the nearest high school for black students, Sumner High School in St. Louis City. Seventy-five percent of the tuition for Webster students was paid by the school district, and the families covered the remaining twenty-five percent. This arrangement was affirmed in 1918, when the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that education should be [...] "separate but equal". In the 1920s, the School Board decided that the more cost-effective choice was just to found a new school, thus in 1925 Douglass Elementary School was expanded to include ninth grade, and over the next few years, additional grades were added until the school had a complete four-year high-school program.
