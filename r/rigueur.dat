One of his greatest early successes was Aline, reine de Golconde (3 September 1803), which was performed internationally. Later in his career he tried tragedy with Virginie, which was premiered by the Paris Opera at the Salle Le Peletier on 11 June 1823, and received a total of 39 performances.

40|$|Rescue operas {{developed}} along two {{somewhat different}} lines: “tyrant” operas and “humanitarian” operas within the general category of “opera semiseria,” or “opéra comique. ” The first type {{corresponds to the}} conservative British “loyalty gothic,” with its focus on the trials and tribulations of the aristocracy, while the second type draws upon the Sentimental “virtue in distress” or “woman in jeopardy” genre, with its focus on middle class characters or women as the captured or besieged. The first category emphasized political injustice or abstract questions of law and embodied the threat of tyranny in an evil man who imprisons unjustly a noble character. Etienne Méhul’s Euphrosine and H. -M. Berton’s Les <b>rigueurs</b> du cloître (both 1790) are typical examples of the genre. “Humanitarian” operas, on the other hand, do not depict a tyrant, but instead portray an individual—usually a woman or a worthy bourgeois—who sacrifices everything in order to correct an injustice or to obtain some person’s freedom. Dalayrac’s Raoul, Sire de Créqui (1789) or Bouilly’s and Cherubini’s Les deux journées (1800) are examples, along with Sedaine’s pre- 1789 works. But why, we might ask, were gothic dramas quickly transformed into gothic operas or what are known now as “rescue operas”? This essay examines {{the social and political}} ideologies that are explicit in the major gothic operatic adaptations of the most popular gothic novels of Britain, {{while at the same time}} examining British opera’s very close connections with French models as well as French adaptations of British cultural works...|$|R
40|$|The Presumption {{of innocence}} {{constitutes}} a procedural principle which organizes the penal lawsuit, by indicating {{which of the}} parts will have to support the burden of proof, and by sending back the defendant {{of the end of}} the proceedings as soon as there is a doubt. Devoted on the international level, and more recently, on the national level, by the laws of January 4 th, 1993, and June 15 th, 2000, this principe, closely related to the problem of the penal proof, went through a slow and difficult emergence. Indeed, the criminal Ordinance as well as the system of the penal proof which is consubstantial with the criminal Ordinance impose on the judge to condemn as soon as the proof is put together. The doubt cannot exist for a defendant who was supposed guilty. The Revolution was going however to register the Presumption of innocence in a Declaration of the Right of and of the Citizen, and who not only intended to release men from the obsolete framework of the Ancient Regime, but also to protect it from its rigours. When they voted the article 9 of this text, the Settiors were not aware of its procedural dimension. The consecration of the jury and of the intimate conviction, as well by the law of September 16 - 29 1791 as by the directive of the criminal code, maintains this blindness. In spite of the revival of the criminal law which is freed from the weight represented by the power of the civil law, the 19 th century stays almost quiet on this principe. We will have innocence. However, its reception remains imperfect. It is criticized in its application and the criminal law created presumptions of culpability. The recent legislative interventions do not enable to stop the erosion of this principle since they bring a confusion between the procedural principle and a principle contributing to the freedom of the defence and the rights of the person. The presumption of innocence then remains fragile in spite of its recognition. La Présomption d'innocence constitue un principe procédural qui organise le procès pénal, en désignant celle des parties qui aura à supporter la charge de la preuve, et en renvoyant l'accusé des fins de la poursuite dès lors qu'il existe un doute. Consacré sur le plan international, et plus récemment, au plan national, par les lois des 4 janvier 1993 et 15 juin 2000, ce principe, intimement lié au problème de la preuve pénale, connut une émergence lente et laborieuse. En effet, l'Ordonnance criminelle ainsi que le système de la preuve légale qui lui est consubstantiel imposent au juge de condamner dès que la preuve est réunie. Le doute ne peut exister pour un accusé que l'on supposait coupable. La Révolution allait cependant inscrire la présomption d'innocence, dans une Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen, et qui entendait libérer les hommes des cadres obsolètes de l'Ancien régime, mais aussi le protéger de ses <b>rigueurs.</b> Quand ils votèrent l'article 9 de ce texte, les Constituants en ignorèrent la dimension procédurale. La consécration du jury et de l'intime conviction, tant par la loi du 16 - 29 septembre 1791 que par le Code d'instruction criminelle, maintient cette cécité. Malgré le renouveau du droit pénal qui s'affranchit du poids représenté par la toute puissance du seul droit civil, le XIXème reste presque silencieux sur ce principe. Il faudra attendre le XXème pour voir clairement exposé le mécanisme procédural de la présomption d'innocence. Toutefois, sa réception demeure imparfaite. Il est critiqué dans son application et la loi pénale créa des présomptions de culpabilité. Les récentes interventions législatives ne permettent pas d'enrayer l'érosion de ce principe puisqu'elles installent une confusion entre le principe procédural et un principe concourant à la liberté de la défense et des droits de la personne. La présomption d'innocence reste donc d'une fragilité certaine malgré sa pleine reconnaissance...|$|R

2500|$|The more fulsome, cliche-ridden {{chapters}} in From Emperor To Citizen, dealing with Puyi's prison experiences, and written {{at the height}} of the Mao personality cult, give the impression of well-learned, regurgitated lessons.

These days, all Chinese historians recognize the appalling consequences of the [...] "Great Leap Forward", and deplore the repression that followed the [...] "Let a hundred flowers bloom" [...] movement. Neither is mentioned in Puyi's book, nor was it possible to begin doing so anywhere in China without risking arrest until the dark years of the Cultural Revolution and the 'Gang of Four' were over ... The younger generation of Chinese knows, even if their elders do not, that during those years vast areas of China become 'Potemkin villages' bearing no relationship with reality: Some of the farms and factories that Puyi visited during his final 'remoulding' years in prison may themselves have been 'Potemkin villages' ... but the after-effects of the Cultural Revolution are such that the kind of prose Puyi used to describe his experiences will never be believed wholeheartedly by post-Cultural Revolution readers. This form of skepticism will last until the last trace of Mao-worship gives way to a frank, realistic assessment of him in light of his appalling [...] "Let a hundred flowers bloom" [...] repression, his half-baked [...] "Great Leap Forward", and the ruthless destruction of his own Party apparatus during the Cultural Revolution ... By rights, as Simon Leys in The Burning Forest has pointed out, the much vilified Gang of Four which brought such chaos and misery to China should be called the Gang of Five, for without Mao it would never have established itself as a ruling group in the first place. Puyi, however, belongs to the era when the cosy, narrow Maoist line was still unquestioned, and not yet brought into terminal disrepute by the Red Guards and the Gang of Four.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, authors {{with strong}} {{political}} or philosophical points to make {{would no longer}} turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living. Prior to 1737, plays were de <b>rigueur</b> for authors who were not journalists. This {{had to do with}} the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was Gulliver's Travels or Collected Sermons, and would calculate his chances of making money off of sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make. [...] (For example, Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his Poems on Various Occasions, which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an author would see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists (Daniel Defoe), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)—all features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was Aphra Behn, who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her Oroonoko seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, and she could not have another play on the boards at the time. Her Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister, like Gulliver's Travels and Moll Flanders, was inappropriate for the stage. [...] However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors.|$|E
