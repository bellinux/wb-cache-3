40|$|Distribution {{warehouses}} {{are considered}} {{in this paper}} {{with the aim of}} scheduling the transportation of pallet and <b>roll</b> <b>pallet</b> loads from the storage area to the gates at which the trucks arrive. Transportation activities are carried out by forklift AGVs that can move freely along the warehouse's aisles (guide paths are not considered). In this paper, an optimization procedure is proposed, which is based on three sequential phases. In the first phase, the number of AGVs to be allocated to each arrived truck is determined; in the second phase, an AGV-to-truck assignment problem is solved; in the third phase, the single tasks are assigned to and sequenced on the AGVs. All phases are based on the formalization and solution of a specific mathematical programming problem, and a heuristic procedure is also proposed to solve a part of the third phase...|$|E
40|$|Automated {{distribution}} warehouses {{in which}} pallet and <b>roll</b> <b>pallet</b> loads are transported {{by means of}} forklift AGVs are considered in this work, {{with the objective of}} defining a mathematical model which accurately represents the behaviour of AGVs in the system. AGVs can move freely in the warehouse (an open path AGV system is adopted), and their transportation activities can be modelled as a sequence of elementary or basic actions. In the paper, a coloured Petri net (CPN) model is proposed. It allows representing any sequence of elementary actions of AGVs (including pick-up and drop-off activities), and accurately models the interactions among AGVs, in order to guarantee the safety during the execution of activities. The CPN model can be used to analyse and implement deadlock prevention and deadlock recovery strategies, and it has been adopted in the building of a discrete-event simulator which is employed to analyse the system's performance and to evaluate scheduling policies for transportation tasks...|$|E

50|$|Merchandising units {{represent}} {{another type}} of SRP solutions. They are used for secondary placement. Normally, promotional goods or fast-moving products are presented in a merchandising unit. An enormous number of products can be placed on a merchandising unit. Therefore, the merchandising unit serves as SRP. Secondary placements can trigger impulse purchases. Often, roll-up palettes, called dollies, are used {{as a base for}} merchandising units. <b>Rolling</b> <b>pallets</b> facilitate the handling of merchandising units and increase flexibility.|$|R
50|$|Structural {{pallet rack}} systems {{are very similar}} to <b>roll</b> formed <b>pallet</b> rack systems except the {{horizontal}} load beams are attached to the uprights with bolts and have much greater weight-bearing capacity. The bolt fixings make this a form of adjustable shelving - racks can be constructed, reconfigured, and dismantled and reused as necessary.|$|R

Also cold chain management (vaccines, fresh produce, cut flowers, etc.), whereby DASH7 is used for monitoring the in-transit temperature and other environmental factors that can impact the integrity of sensitive products.|$|R
3000|$|... (1) Preparation {{processes}} in the receiving area Are {{the starting point of}} related in-store logistics. When store deliveries arrive at the receiving area, they are unloaded and brought to a presorting area, where they are sorted by category prior to actual shelf replenishment, and finally brought to the showroom to a central category location (cf. Kotzab and Teller 2005). From there, the actual shelf replenishment starts. This implies that a <b>pallet,</b> <b>roll</b> cage or other means of transport is placed at this central category location, from which stock clerks take individual items and transport them to the shelves.|$|R
50|$|In the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War the Antelopes dropped {{parachute}} commandos into Indian {{territory in}} a night-time mission involving three C-130B transports.Just before the 1965 war started, the squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander Eric Gordan Hall, {{had the idea}} of making up for the PAF's deficiency in heavy bombers by modifying the Hercules to carry bombs. It was converted to carry 10,000 kg of bombs, which were <b>rolled</b> out on <b>pallets</b> from the rear ramp, and over 21 night-time bombing raids were flown against Indian forces approaching for the Battles of Chawinda and Pul Kanjari. Support missions for troops in the Northern Areas were continued after the war.|$|R
60|$|But I knowed better. I had it out {{of there}} before they was half-way down stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could {{get a chance to}} do better. I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I <b>rolled</b> off my <b>pallet</b> and laid with my chin {{at the top of my}} ladder, and waited to see if {{anything}} was going to happen. But nothing did.|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the relationship between interhandle distances and upper limb exertion during simply pushing and pulling of a cart with four swivel wheels, defined by a <b>roll</b> box <b>pallet</b> (RBP) in a Japanese industrial standard. Methods: Six healthy young male participants were asked to push and pull an RBP at a distance of 5. 2  m under six conditions corresponding to different interhandle distances (40  cm, 60  cm, and 80  cm) and weights (130  kg and 250  kg). The upper limb exertion was studied by shoulder abduction and flexion, and elbow flexion, as well as surface electromyogram (EMG) in shoulder extensor, and elbow flexor and extensor. Participants were required to provide subjective evaluations on operability after each trial. Results: Subjective operability indicated that a narrower interhandle distance had a better operability for pushing. Interhandle distance was also related to upper limb exertion especially for pushing. A narrow interhandle distance caused smaller shoulder adduction but larger elbow flexion. The normalized EMG data revealed that muscular activity became smaller with a narrow interhandle distance in shoulder extensor. During the pulling task, elbow flexion was smaller at a narrow interhandle distance, although subjective operability and normalized EMG were not significantly varied. Conclusion: A wider interhandle distance, such as 80  cm, was not suitable in the forwardbackward movement of the RBP. Therefore, this study concluded that an interhandle distance of 40  cm would be suitable for pushing and pulling an RBP to protect the workers' hands against the risk of injury by installing inner handles...|$|R
60|$|One chamber was {{allotted to}} the entire party and their single nurse. Being far up in the tower, it ventured to have two windows in the massive walls, so thick that five-and-twenty steps from the floor were needed to reach the narrow slips of glass in a frame that could be removed at will, either to admit the air or to be {{exchanged}} for solid wooden shutters to exclude storms by sea or arrows and bolts by land. The {{lower part of the}} walls was hung with very grim old tapestry, on which Holofernes' head, going into its bag, could just be detected; there were two great solid box-beds, two more <b>pallets</b> <b>rolled</b> up for the day, a chest or two, a rude table, a cross-legged chair, a few stools, and some deer and seal skins spread on the floor completed the furniture of this ladies' bower. There was, unusual luxury, a chimney with a hearth and peat fire, and a cauldron on it, with a silver and a copper basin beside it for washing purposes, never discarded by poor Queen Joanna and her old English nurse Ankaret, who had remained beside her through all the troubles of the stormy and barbarous country, and, though crippled by a fall and racked with rheumatism, was the chief comfort of the young children. She crouched at the hearth with her spinning and her beads, and exclaimed at the tossed hair and soiled hands and faces of her charges.|$|R
