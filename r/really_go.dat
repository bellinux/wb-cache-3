25|$|An {{early and}} {{influential}} {{book about the}} subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, was self-published in 1976 by Bill Kaysing. Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing, Kaysing, a former US Navy officer with a Bachelor of Arts in English, was hired as a senior technical writer in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company that built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket. He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked. The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, {{it would have been easier}} for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to <b>really</b> <b>go</b> there.|$|E

500|$|Praise for {{the song}} was not universal. Rob Harvilla of Village Voice wrote that the track offered [...] "nothing terribly earth-shattering" [...] and thought that [...] "the {{contrast}} between Thom's dolphin-soothing calm and lyrics like 'I've seen hell upon this earth/The next one will be chemical/But they will never learn' might just ruin your lunch." [...] David Malitz of The Washington Post complained: [...] "It's a little too Sigur Ros-y and doesn't <b>really</b> <b>go</b> anywhere" [...] but acknowledged it [...] "till kept my interest for five and half minutes".|$|E

500|$|Owing to {{the strange}} {{nature of the}} language, the Century 21 writers would brief Unwin on episode plots and then leave space in their scripts for the actor to draft all the Unwinese {{dialogue}} himself. Shane Rimmer, who scripted the episode [...] "Hole in One", remarked that [...] "A lot of [...] you had to leave to [...] You gave him a line of patter that's {{going to work with}} what he does.

500|$|Parker {{and casting}} {{director}} Juliet Taylor held open casting calls in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, New York City and Philadelphia. Matthew Modine originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Al Columbato, but Parker decided to cast him as Birdy, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "introverted honest quality" [...] that best suited the character. Modine said, [...] "I was flabbergasted because I hadn't auditioned for Birdy. I had never imagined playing the part of Birdy. So, I had to <b>really</b> <b>go</b> through an extraordinary transformation in my mind of trying to bring this remarkable character to life. It was an incredible experience making the film." ...|$|E

500|$|In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) he was Indiana Jones' greaser son Mutt Williams. His {{performance}} {{was met with}} mixed reviews with Todd Gilchrist of IGN commenting [...] "one can't quite help but wonder what Spielberg saw in the young actor that inspired him to cast LaBeouf". LaBeouf told the Los Angeles Times that he felt he as an actor [...] "dropped the ball" [...] on Jones' legacy, and [...] "there was a reason" [...] the film wasn't universally accepted. His next film was Eagle Eye, released on September 26. His performance received mixed reviews, with Josh Bell of Las Vegas Weekly saying he [...] "makes a credible bid for action-hero status, although his occasional stabs at emotional depth don't <b>really</b> <b>go</b> anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron Cook of Pitchfork Media honored Crime Cutz as [...] "a bright, tight, tense mini-epic, solidifying [...] {{as one of}} {{the pillars}} of the mid-'00s disco resurgence." [...] His only major {{criticism}} of the EP was its lack of stylistic variety: [...] "you spend a lot of the record hoping for something to take them even further over the edge, but they continue to pull back until the very end." [...] The group's lack of musical risk on the EP was also criticized in a more mixed review by Sackllah, spotlighting [...] "Compass Point" [...] as the set's only memorable track: [...] "At best, Crime Cutz is a decent release by a talented group that clearly has potential to make some great retro records. At its lowest points, it’s filled with clumsy lyrics and meandering tracks that never <b>really</b> <b>go</b> anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Later, Doug Herzog from Comedy Central saw the Jesus vs. Santa {{short and}} {{considered}} {{it to be}} [...] "literally the funniest thing 'd ever seen," [...] and requested Parker and Stone to develop a show for his network.

[...] The network's executives were receptive to the idea, which would be one of the main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.

500|$|Critical {{response}} was more guarded with Lennon's next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that [...] "it contains {{a substantial portion}} of good music" [...] but warned of the possibility that [...] "his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant". The album's title track would become an anthem for anti-war movements, while another, [...] "How Do You Sleep?", was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics from Ram that Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed, were directed at him and Ono. However, Lennon softened his stance in the mid-1970s and said he had written [...] "How Do You Sleep?" [...] about himself. He said in 1980: [...] "I used my resentment against Paul… to create a song… not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta I used my resentment and withdrawing from Paul and the Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write 'How Do You Sleep'. I don't <b>really</b> <b>go</b> 'round with those thoughts in my head all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Gerard Gilbert of The Independent, Jack Seale of Radio Times, Dessau and Owen all {{stressed}} that [...] "Last Gasp" [...] was weaker than the three previous episodes of Inside No. 9. Seale claimed {{that there were}} [...] "several sublime moments – but no knockout blow", while Dessau wrote that [...] "it doesn't <b>really</b> <b>go</b> anywhere and it resolves itself a little too simplistically", and Owen felt that the episode [...] "didn't manage to go anywhere very unexpected... and just sort of ended". All three suggested, however, that the episode still had its strengths; for Seale, it was as [...] "brilliantly acted and constructed as you'd expect", Dessau considered it watchable, and Owen felt it was enjoyable to watch {{with a number of}} funny moments. Shennan, writing for the Liverpool Echo, wrote that [...] "perhaps {{there had to be a}} dud – or, at least, disappointing – episode sooner or later", noting that you [...] "can't win 'em all".|$|E
500|$|Many factors {{went into}} the casting {{decisions}} of the season's guest stars. Linda Blair, famous {{for her role in}} the horror film The Exorcist, appeared in the episode [...] "The Usual Suspects". Though a fan of the show, Blair had turned down a guest appearance in the first season because {{she did not want to}} return to horror, having spent years getting a [...] "clean slate". This changed after the television series Extra aired a three-part profile on her acting career and work with animals. It attempted to find a series that would write a role for her as [...] "an actor's piece", rather than a cameo. Kripke, a fan of The Exorcist, offered to write an episode specifically for her, and she was [...] "really touched" [...] when he listened to her request to leave out demons in the storyline. During automated dialogue replacement, Jensen Ackles added in a reference to The Exorcist with the statement, [...] "I could <b>really</b> <b>go</b> for some pea soup." ...|$|E

500|$|MusicOMH called [...] "Teeth" [...] the album's [...] "biggest curveball" [...] {{and said}} in its review, [...] "It doesn't <b>really</b> <b>go</b> anywhere, the chorus getting {{mixed in with the}} verses, but it's still a compellingly dancey listen and may be {{indicative}} of where she's heading next". MuuMuse's Stern described the song as a [...] "stomping, hoot-and-holler-worthy chant-along" [...] that invites listeners to [...] "cut loose and...well, sink their teeth into the music". He added, [...] "It's an odd choice to end the album, though a surefire crowd pleaser for live shows if the addictive backing beat is anything to judge by". Popjustice rated the song six out of eight and said it [...] "foray into Black Betty territory". PopMatters Evan Sawdey called [...] "Teeth" [...] Gaga's [...] "most sonically adventurous song yet". Nick Hyman of Under the Rader said the song was the worst on the album. Vulture, an online blog associated with New York, included lyrics from [...] "Teeth" [...] in its [...] "Best Lines" [...] portal.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} mixed reviews from critics, with some arguing that Spears' body was digitally altered. The Daily Telegraph commented [...] "Britney – presumably {{with the help}} of some serious digital remastering – has turned back the clock, looking every part the young starlet that gave us 'Oops'". Dose said [...] "shockingly, it's not that bad. Well, not that bad for everyone's favourite panty protesting, deposition skipping, weave wearing pop-tard". On August 17, 2008, it was announced that the video was nominated for Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. The ceremony was held on September 7, 2008, and Spears won all three categories. On October 18, 2008, during a live interview with New York's Z100, she explained that she was shocked when she won, saying, [...] "It's a cool video, but I think by far I've done videos that are way better, so I was really shocked that it got [...] It was just inspiring, though, because now, going forward with the videos that I'm doing now, I can <b>really</b> <b>go</b> there and do something crazy and see what happens".|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with reporters on August 21, 2012, Daniels {{announced}} that this would be the final season of the series.

[...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming it for so long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E
