5|$|Research on {{leisure and}} {{hospitality}} situates Omaha {{in the same}} tier for tourists as the neighboring cities of Des Moines, Iowa; Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that investment of $1 million in cultural tourism generated approximately $83,000 {{in state and local}} taxes, and provided support for hundreds of jobs for the metropolitan area, which in turn led to additional tax revenue for government.|$|E
5|$|About 118tonnes of {{germanium}} {{was produced}} in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China (80 t), Russia (5 t) and United States (3 t). Germanium is recovered as a by-product from sphalerite zinc ores where it is concentrated in amounts as great as 0.3%, especially from low-temperature sediment-hosted, massive Zn–Pb–Cu(–Ba) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that at least 10,000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by Mississippi-Valley type deposits, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves. In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled germanium.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density {{was found to be}} highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E

5|$|The {{man-made}} chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) may be compromising {{the immune system}} of bottlenose dolphins. PFOS affects the immune system of male mice at a concentration of 91.5 ppb, while PFOS {{has been reported in}} bottlenose dolphins in excess of 1 ppm. High levels of metal contaminants have been measured in tissues {{in many areas of the}} globe. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> high levels of cadmium and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from South Australia, levels which were later found to be associated with kidney malformations, indicating possible health effects of high heavy metal concentrations in dolphins.|$|E
25|$|More recently, many {{different}} DNA {{studies have shown}} that many African Americans have European admixture, reflecting the long history in this country of the various populations. Proportions of European admixture in African-American DNA have been found in studies to be 17 % and between 10.6% and 22.5%. Another <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> the average to be 21.2%, with a standard error of 1.2%.|$|E
25|$|A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that lying {{takes longer}} than telling the truth, {{and thus the}} time to answer a {{question}} may be used as a method of lie detection. However, it has also been shown that instant-answers can be proof of a prepared lie. The only compromise is to try to surprise the victim and find a midway answer, not too quick, nor too long.|$|E

25|$|Sleeping {{reptiles}} do {{not seem}} to have PGO waves or the localized brain activation seen in mammalian REM. However they do exhibit sleep cycles with phases of REM-like electrical activity measurable by EEG. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> periodic eye movements in the central bearded dragon of Australia, leading its authors to speculate that the common ancestor of amniotes may therefore have manifested some precursor to REMS.|$|E
25|$|A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} five-planet Nice model has a {{statistically}} small likelihood of reproducing {{the orbits of}} the terrestrial planets. Although this implies that the instability occurred before {{the formation of the}} terrestrial planets and could not be the source of the Late Heavy Bombardment, the advantage of an early instability is reduced by the sizable jumps in the semi-major axis of Jupiter and Saturn required to preserve the asteroid belt.|$|E
25|$|A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that an {{especially}} massive tropical volcanic eruption in 1257, possibly of the now-extinct Mount Samalas near Mount Rinjani, both in Lombok, Indonesia, followed by three smaller eruptions in 1268, 1275, and 1284 {{did not allow}} the climate to recover. This may have caused the initial cooling, and the 1452–53 eruption of Kuwae in Vanuatu triggered a second pulse of cooling. The cold summers can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long after volcanic aerosols are removed.|$|E

25|$|A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> {{that adult}} rats with {{amblyopia}} improved visual acuity {{two weeks after}} being placed into an enriched environment. The same study showed that another two weeks after ending environmental enrichment, the rats retained their visual acuity improvement. Conversely, rats in a standard environment showed no improvement in visual acuity. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment reduces GABA inhibition and increases BDNF expression in the visual cortex. As a result, the growth and development of neurons and synapses in the visual cortex were much improved due to the enriched environment.|$|E
25|$|An {{unintended}} {{benefit of}} the round goby's introduction is that the Lake Erie watersnake, once listed as a threatened species, has found the goby to be a tasty addition to its diet. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> the introduced fish now accounts for up to 90% of the snake's diet. The new food supply means that the water snake is now staging a comeback. Round gobies also serve as food {{for a variety of}} predatory fishes in the Great Lakes, including bass, lake trout, lake whitefish, burbot, and walleye.|$|E
25|$|Interracial {{marriage}} in the United States has been fully legal in all U.S. states since the 1967 Supreme Court decision that deemed anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, with many states choosing to legalize interracial marriage at earlier dates. Multiracial Americans numbered 9.0 million in 2010, or 2.9% of the total population, but 5.6% of the population under age 18. The actual number is likely much higher, for example a study of college students identifying as white found that 30% had less than 90% European ancestry, and one <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that African Americans have an average of 21% European ancestry.|$|E

25|$|Proton pump {{inhibitor}} {{drugs have}} not been proven to prevent esophageal cancer. Laser treatment is used in severe dysplasia, while overt malignancy may require surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic chemotherapy. Additionally, a recent five-year random-controlled trial has shown that photodynamic therapy using photofrin is statistically more effective in eliminating dysplastic growth areas than sole use of a proton pump inhibitor. There is presently no reliable way to determine which patients with Barrett esophagus {{will go on to}} develop esophageal cancer, although a <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> the detection of three different genetic abnormalities was associated with as much as a 79% chance of developing cancer in six years.|$|E
25|$|All {{combined}} hormonal {{birth control}} products {{have a very}} small increased risk of serious or fatal thromboembolic events. There is ongoing research into the thromboembolic risks of Ortho Evra as compared to combined oral contraceptive pills. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that users of the contraceptive patch may have a twofold increased risk for non-fatal venous thromboembolic events compared with women who took a norgestimate-containing oral contraceptive with 35µg of estrogen. However, a different study concluded {{that the risk of}} nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for oral contraceptives containing 35µg of ethinylestradiol and norgestimate. The contradiction in findings between the two studies is not easily resolved, because the confidence intervals for the studies are overlapping.|$|E
25|$|Estimates for {{the number}} of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population, to as much as 90%. The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are {{practicing}} regularly or weekly at a church service. The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003. Muslim Argentines number about 500,000–600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni. Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A <b>recent</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.|$|E
