In other words, a comet at such a distance is superluminal in a geostatic, and therefore non-inertial, frame.|$|E

Because it utilizes permanent magnet flux biased magnetic bearing elements, the original laboratory model magnetic suspension system produced control limitations, and a new suspension system which used zero flux bias was designed and fabricated. Tests of the improved system show that a medium control loop bandwidth is required to achieve stability at low rim velocities, but at higher <b>rim</b> <b>speed</b> the bandwidth of the control loop interacts with bending modes of the rim and causes instability.

The {{design of}} a turbine s{age is {{considered}} {{on the basis of}} free vortex flow from the nozzles and blades and some of the factors which limit the {{design of a}}n efficient turbine stage are discussed. As the flow conditions {{at the root of the}} blades are of greater importance in limiting the design than those at the mean diameter, calculations of the stage performance are made for various values of nozzle angle, reaction and exhaust swirl at the inner diameter of the nozzles and blades. The results of these calculations are presented in the form of a series of curves which show how the design conditions, such as mass flow per unit annulus area, <b>rim</b> <b>speed</b> and Mach numbers relativeto the blades, vary with work output from the turbine stage.

To propel in an energy efficient manner, wheelchair users must learn to control bimanually applied forces onto the <b>rims,</b> preserving both <b>speed</b> and direction of locomotion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique during the initial stage of motor learning. Therefore, 70 naive able-bodied men received 12 -min uninstructed wheelchair practice, consisting of three 4 -min blocks separated by 2 min rest. Practice was performed on a motor-driven treadmill at a fixed belt speed and constant power output relative to body mass. Energy consumption and the kinetics of propulsion technique were continuously measured. Participants significantly increased their mechanical efficiency and changed their propulsion technique from a high frequency mode with a lot of negative work to a longer-slower movement pattern with less power losses. Furthermore a multi-level model showed propulsion technique to relate to mechanical efficiency. Finally improvers and non-improvers were identified. The non-improving group was already more efficient and had a better propulsion technique in the first block of practice (i. e., the fourth minute).

40|$|Effects of {{different}} hand rim diameters in wheelchair racing were studied {{with respect to}} physiological and technique parameters at five speed levels (N = 8 wheelchair sportsmen). In each of five subsequent 15 -min exercise tests on a treadmill, a different sized hand rim was mounted to the rear wheels (0. 3, 0. 35, 0. 38, 0. 47, 0. 56 m). In each test, speed increased with 0. 83 m. s- 1 every 3 min, starting at 0. 83 m. s- 1 and ranging up to 4. 17 m. s- 1 (slope: 0. 5 degrees). Cardiorespiratory responses (ventilation, oxygen cost, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, mechanical efficiency) and timing data (cycle time, push time, recovery time, push angle, and work per cycle) were obtained every 3 rd min, together with the movement pattern of trunk and arm segments. Clear effects of <b>rim</b> diameter and <b>speed</b> were seen for the physiological parameters (P less than 0. 05). In physiological terms, D 5 appeared the least beneficial, followed by D 4. Moreover, increasing rim diameter {{had a significant effect}} on movement pattern of the upper arm in the sagittal as well the frontal plane of motion. However, no timing effects were seen with changing rim diameter. On the other hand, timing parameters varied markedly with speed, whereas the segmental excursions of the upper limb did not show a "speed-effect". In general, small hand rims show lower cardiorespiratory responses. This {{may be related to the}} decreased segmental excursions of the upper limb and the lower linear hand velocity.

40|$|Background: To propel in an {{energy-efficient}} manner, handrim wheelchair users {{must learn}} to control the bimanually applied forces onto the <b>rims,</b> preserving both <b>speed</b> and direction of locomotion. Previous studies have found an increase in mechanical efficiency due to motor learning associated with changes in propulsion technique, but it is unclear in what way the propulsion technique impacts the load on the shoulder complex. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate mechanical efficiency, propulsion technique and load on the shoulder complex during the initial stage of motor learning. Methods: 15 naive able-bodied participants received 12 -minutes uninstructed wheelchair practice on a motor driven treadmill, consisting of three 4 -minute blocks separated by two minutes rest. Practice was performed at a fixed belt speed (v = 1. 1 m/s) and constant low-intensity power output (0. 2 W/ kg). Energy consumption, kinematics and kinetics of propulsion technique were continuously measured. The Delft Shoulder Model was used to calculate net joint moments, muscle activity and glenohumeral reaction force. Results: With practice mechanical efficiency increased and propulsion technique changed, reflected by a reduced push frequency and increased work per push, performed over a larger contact angle, with more tangentially applied force and reduced power losses before and after each push. Contrary to our expectations, the above mentioned propulsion technique changes were found together with an increased load on the shoulder complex reflected by higher net moments, a higher total muscle power and higher peak and mean glenohumeral reaction forces. Conclusions: It appears that the early stages of motor learning in handrim wheelchair propulsion are indeed associated with improved technique and efficiency due to optimization of the kinematics and dynamics of the upper extremity. This process goes at the cost of an increased muscular effort and mechanical loading of the shoulder complex. This seems to be associated with an unchanged stable function of the trunk and could be due to the early learning phase where participants still have to learn to effectively use the full movement amplitude available within the wheelchair-user combination.

40|$|Background: Handrim {{wheelchair}} propulsion is {{a complex}} bimanual motor task. The bimanually applied forces on the <b>rims</b> determine the <b>speed</b> and direction of locomotion. Measurements of forces and torques on the handrim are important to study status and change of propulsion technique (and consequently mechanical strain) due to processes of learning, training or the wheelchair configuration. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the simultaneous outcomes of two different measurement-wheels attached to the different sides of the wheelchair, to determine measurement consistency within and between these wheels given the expected inter- and intra-limb variability as a consequence of motor control. Methods. Nine able-bodied subjects received a three-week low-intensity handrim wheelchair practice intervention. They then performed three four-minute trials of wheelchair propulsion in an instrumented hand rim wheelchair on a motor-driven treadmill at a fixed belt speed. The two measurement-wheels on each side of the wheelchair measured forces and torques of one of the two upper limbs, which simultaneously perform the push action over time. The resulting data were compared as direct output using cross-correlation on the torque around the wheel-axle. Calculated push characteristics such as power production and speed were compared using an intra-class correlation. Results: Measured torque around the wheel axle of the two measurement-wheels had a high average cross-correlation of 0. 98 (std= 0. 01). Unilateral mean power output over a minute was found to have an intra-class correlation of 0. 89 between the wheels. Although the difference over the pushes between left and right power output had a high variability, the mean difference between the measurement-wheels was low at 0. 03 W (std= 1. 60). Other push characteristics showed even higher ICC's (> 0. 9). Conclusions: A good agreement between both measurement-wheels was found at the level of the power output. This indicates a high comparability of the measurement-wheels for the different propulsion parameters. Data from both wheels seem suitable to be used together or interchangeably in experiments on motor control and wheelchair propulsion performance. A high variability in forces and timing between the left and right side were found during the execution of this bimanual task, reflecting the human motor control process. © 2013 Vegter et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
