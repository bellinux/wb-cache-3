40|$|Two {{key issues}} in the Swedish {{construction}} industry are to increase productivity and improve safety. Productivity in the Swedish construction industry is considered low in comparison to other industries. Previous {{studies have shown that}} 30 - 35 % of buildings' total production cost can be categorized as waste, since the activities are non-value-adding for customers. The safety is important because the Swedish construction industry has twice as many serious work accidents than other industries. This combined with that many companies create products that are not based on customers' needs has {{led to the creation of}} a model named ‘Developed value stream mapping’. The models objective, which consists of four steps, is to generate product development suggestions based on a set of parameters (Customer needs, P 2, P 3, [...] ., Pn). The core of the model is to analyze the relation between product characteristics and the parameters. The researcher chose, depending on the study’s background, to analyze the relation between product characteristics, customer needs, waste at the construction site and safety for construction workers. The model was tested on the company BAC Såg och Hyvleri products; <b>roofing</b> <b>board</b> and the newly developed <b>roofing</b> <b>board</b> with an integrated membrane. After choosing products, a current state was identified through interviews with customers and two site observations, where one product was used at each site. This step is performed to gain understanding of the products purpose and how the product is being processed on site. Main findings in identifying customer needs were that roofing boards should stabilize the roof and be adapted after distances between roof trusses. It was also found that customers wanted the company to manufacture customized roofing boards for each project and develop products that reduce dangerous time on roofs for construction workers. A number of quality-related issues were observed at the second observation where <b>roofing</b> <b>board</b> with an integrated membrane were used, of which the largest problem was that membranes were not sealed in the splices. In terms of assembly time, <b>roofing</b> <b>board</b> with an integrated membrane, depending on roof characteristics, is approximately 2, 7 - 6, 0 % shorter than roofing with the traditional <b>roofing</b> <b>board.</b> The time saving only applies if membranes are sealed in splices, which was not the case in this study. In the third step product characteristics are analyzed against waste at the construction site, safety for construction workers and customer needs. Roofing boards with the standard dimension of 3600 x 540 mm weighs 23 kg and the newly developed product weighs 24, 6 kg, which means that managing roofing boards can lead to repetitive strain injuries in a short and long term perspective. Further, roofing boards' standard dimension results in that construction workers spend about 70 - 80 % of their working time on activities that are non-value-adding for customers. Waste at construction sites would with the customer proposal for customized roofing boards shorten the assembly time up to 50 %, increase customer satisfaction and reduce the risk of work-related injuries. Thus, BAC Såg och Hyvleri has great potential to improve efficiency in construction sites by developing roofing boards. The recommendation for the company is to stop the current development of roofing boards with an integrated membrane since it increase waste on construction sites. Product development suggestions are, amongst others to start producing customized roofing boards and improve <b>roofing</b> <b>board</b> fitting. Furthermore, the study shows that ‘Developed value stream mapping’ works since product development suggestions have been generated. Validerat; 20130212 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

When the brackets disintegrated, one would have to tear up the whole roof to renew all the rafters.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} public involvement {{for sustainable}} development, 3 D models simulating real or near future cities using 3 D Computer Graphics (CG) {{can be of}} great use. 3 D city models are important in environmentally friendly urban planning that will use solar photovoltaic (PV) generation. However, enormous time and labour has to be consumed to create these 3 D models using 3 D modelling software such as 3 ds Max or SketchUp. In order to automate laborious steps, this paper proposes a Geographic Information System (GIS) and CG integrated system that automatically generates 3 D building models based on building polygons or building footprints on digital maps, which show most building polygons’ edges meet at right angles (orthogonal polygon). A complicated orthogonal polygon can be partitioned into a set of rectangles. The proposed integrated system partitions orthogonal building polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and box-shaped building bodies onto these rectangles. In this paper, for placing solar panels on a hipped roof, the structure of an ordinary hipped roof that {{is made up of}} two triangular <b>roof</b> <b>boards</b> and two trapezoidal ones is clarified. To implement efficient PV generation, this paper proposes to automatically generate 3 D building models for buildings topped with double shed roofs with overlaid PV arrays. The sizes and positions, slopes of <b>roof</b> <b>boards</b> and main under roof constructions are made clear by presenting a top view and side view of a double shed roof house. For the applied example of the developed system, this papers presents a simulation of the solar photovoltaic generation change of a city block by performing land readjustment and changing the shape of buildings, ordinarily roofed houses or double shed roofed houses suitable for efficient PV generation. Our simulation reveals that double shed roofed houses have greatly improved solar photovoltaic generation...|$|R
