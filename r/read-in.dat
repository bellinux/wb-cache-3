50|$|A {{particular}} type of public demonstration almost exclusively used to support libraries, read-ins can take two different forms. The simplest one is when supporters of a library simply meet en masse and read their own books. Usually this type of <b>read-in</b> is held {{at or near the}} supported library or the targeted legislative body. Indianapolis library lovers organized a <b>read-in</b> during July 2010 to protest drastic budget cuts that would have closed 6 branches.|$|E
50|$|The {{other type}} of <b>read-in</b> {{involves}} volunteers reading aloud for a specified amount of time, usually 24 hours. These are also often held near the targeted legislative body or the supported library. Volunteers usually read books of their choice for their allotted time span, and then are replaced by another volunteer reading a different book. New York activists held this type of <b>read-in</b> June 2010 {{as part of their}} “We Will Not Be Shushed” campaign to stave off proposed budget cuts.|$|E

5000|$|In 1968, Vanriet started {{painting}} {{studies at}} the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. [...] As a young art student and a debuting poet, he became deeply involved in writers' actions against literary censorship in Belgium, actions that became very famous when he organised a Protest <b>Read-In</b> at the Majestic Theatre in Antwerp, with 40 authors on stage and an audience of over 1000. A second <b>Read-In</b> was organised at Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels (Bozar). It was here that he met his future wife, Simone Lenaerts.|$|E

5000|$|Benjamin [...] "Ben" [...] Whitehead is an English voice actor. He {{has been}} working on films with Aardman Animations since 2005. Along with voicing roles for characters, he is Aardman's <b>read-in</b> artist and is the {{official}} voice for Wallace after Peter Sallis' retirement and subsequent death.|$|E
50|$|A further {{method of}} {{filtering}} disturbances is multiple read of input registers. The <b>read-in</b> values are then checked for consistency. If the values are consistent, {{they can be}} considered valid. A definition of a value range and/or the calculation of a mean value can improve the results for some applications.|$|E
50|$|The Langston Hughes Library’s patrons include activists, students, tourists, dignitaries, scholars. Class visits are held, festivals are hosted and retreats are {{accommodated}} at the Haley Farm. Events {{such as the}} Langston Hughes Library Roundtable, Langston Hughes Children's Literature Festival and African American <b>Read-In</b> {{are regularly}} held at the Haley Farm.|$|E
50|$|GLSL shaders {{themselves}} are simply {{a set of}} strings that are passed to the hardware vendor's driver for compilation from within an application using the OpenGL API's entry points. Shaders can be created on the fly from within an application, or <b>read-in</b> as text files, but must {{be sent to the}} driver {{in the form of a}} string.|$|E
5000|$|The passage {{has been}} taken as {{confirmation}} of Jesus' ability to write (as opposed to <b>read—in</b> early societies, simple reading skills were more common than the ability to write), otherwise only suggested by implication in the Gospels, but the word [...] "εγραφεν" [...] in John 8:8 could mean [...] "draw" [...] as well as [...] "write".|$|E
50|$|Often, disk {{footprint}} {{is confused}} with memory footprint, since both include certain overlapping areas, such program executable, libraries, etc. Though {{this is true}} to a certain extent, their individual makeup contain areas that are not relevant or clearly correspond to anything in the other category. For example, runtime footprint of an application would include stack space, which is typically meaningless in the storage footprint paradigm. On the other hand, configuration files <b>read-in</b> by an application, at start up, are usually closed off, but their in-memory representation (such as a property tree or linked list of key-value pairs) maintained for its entire life-time, and hence, do not really correspond, in terms of relative sizing. Further, the configurations <b>read-in</b> from differing formats (say XML, JSON, CSVs, etc.), may contribute to differing disk sizing, but end up being represented as the same internal data structures, ending up in similar, if not identical, memory sizing requirements.|$|E
50|$|HEC-RAS {{can also}} be used in the GIS program ArcView (With 3-D analyst and Spatial Analyst extensions). ArcView can <b>read-in</b> AutoCAD {{drawings}} for backgrounds and can create a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). In a similar way to river CAD, Geo-RAS can be used to create cross sections and other geometric data for use in HEC-RAS and can be used to export water surface data from HEC-RAS back into ArcView to create flood maps with depths and extents of flooding.|$|E
50|$|The {{historian}} Robert Finlay {{has criticized}} Davis's conclusions, arguing that Bertrande was duped (as {{most of her}} contemporaries believed, including the trial judges) after her husband's long absence. He thought that Davis attempted to <b>read-in</b> a modern societal model of an independent woman making her own choices onto the historical account. He points to the improbability of Bertrande's charging her own accomplice with fraud, as she would {{run the risk of}} having to defend herself against charges of adultery or false accusation.|$|E
50|$|Some text editors can edit {{unusually large}} files such as log files or an entire {{database}} {{placed in a}} single file. Simpler text editors may just read files into the computer's main memory. With larger files, {{this may be a}} slow process, and the entire file may not fit. Some text editors do not let the user start editing until this <b>read-in</b> is complete. Editing performance also often suffers in nonspecialized editors, with the editor taking seconds or even minutes to respond to keystrokes or navigation commands. By only storing the visible portion of large files in memory, editing performance improves.|$|E
50|$|The John Steinbeck Library is {{a public}} library in Salinas, California. The library was named after writer John Steinbeck in 1969. The library held the Steinbeck {{archives}} until 1998 when they were transferred to the new National Steinbeck Center. The library made national headlines in 2004 and 2005 when it, along with the two other libraries in Salinas, {{were on the verge}} of closing because of insufficient funding. In 2005, a nationally covered <b>read-in</b> drew citizens as well as authors to the library to raise awareness about the potential closure. This national publicity, as well as private funding, saved the library. Had the libraries closed, Salinas would have been the largest city in the United States without a library.|$|E
50|$|Because Japanese {{integrated}} circuit manufacturers {{were not yet}} able to produce the high-density MOS LSI ICs which Sharp needed, Sharp sought help from U.S. semiconductor firms. Sharp eventually made an agreement with Rockwell, which manufactured the QT-8D's LSI ICs for Sharp based on Sharp's logic designs. Each of the four LSI ICs contains {{the equivalent of about}} 700 to 900 transistors, and the ICs are named based on their functions. The NRD 2256 handles numerical <b>read-in</b> and display, converting keyboard scancodes into digit values and activating the various display tube segments based on digit values. The DC 2266 does decimal-point control, performing the automatic floating-decimal logic and aligning decimal points for arithmetic operations. The AC 2261 controls the arithmetic and provides the registers, and the AU 2271 performs the arithmetic (using a digital adder) and controls input to the registers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{status quo}} {{is that none of}} the {{consequences}} of legal marriage is automatically conferred on an opposite-sex domestic partnership. There is, however, some statutory recognition in the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, and judicial recognition in the form of Volks v Robinson, which concerned {{a man and a woman}} who had lived together in a permanent life partnership. When he died, she lodged a claim for maintenance against his estate in terms of the Maintenance Act but was rejected by the executor. Having never married him, she did not fit the Act's definition of [...] "survivor." [...] It was requested of the court that it <b>read-in</b> partners in domestic partnerships or alternatively declare unconstitutional the relevant provision for its unjustifiable discrimination and its violation of the right to dignity. Handed down before the passage of the Civil Union Act, the majority judgment found that there had been no duty of support while the man had been alive, so there should be no duty for maintenance by his estate following his death.|$|E
5000|$|Though she is {{best known}} for her fiction, Howe is also an {{accomplished}} scholar. She has authored a book chapter on Choctaw history, contributed two important essays on her theory of [...] "tribalography", and collaborated on literary criticism projects with Craig Howe (no relation), Harvey Markowitz, and Dean Rader. Howe has been a visiting professor at Carleton College, Grinnell College, Sinte Gleska University in Mission, South Dakota, on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation, Wake Forest University, North Carolina, and at the University of Cincinnati in the Women's Studies Department. In 2003 she was the Louis D. Rubin Jr. Writer-in-Residence at Hollins University, Roanoke, Virginia. In 2006-07 she was the John and Renee Grisham’s Writer-in-Residence, University of Mississippi, Oxford, MS. In May 2008, Howe was awarded a Poetry Fellowship at Soul Mountain Retreat, sponsored by former Connecticut poet Laureate Marilyn Nelson in East Haddam, Connecticut. In March 2010, Miko Kings: An Indian Baseball Story was the 2009-10 <b>Read-in</b> Selection for Hampton University, Hampton VA. Hampton University also held a mini-literary conference on Miko Kings. In March 2011, Howe was awarded the Tulsa Library Trust’s “American Indian Author Award” at the Central Library, Tulsa Oklahoma.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the timely constraints, Nedelciu's {{original}} project {{may have}} called for Zodia Scafandrului {{to be the first}} section of a larger cycle, structured around the yearly cycle of months. Adina Diniţoiu calls attention to the book's [...] "unsettling biographical genre ... intensely vibrating the chord of a writing style completely lacking in formalism." [...] She ties it to a final development in Nedelciu's literary attitudes, that in which [...] "profundity" [...] was added to his branch of [...] "microrealism", producing [...] "an ethical and even soteriological connotation". In Lefter's view, the book [...] "may be and must be read—I insist: must be <b>read—in</b> various ways." [...] Its nature, he specifies, is that of a [...] "literary and sociocultural project ... attempting to reach the profound truths in Romania's 20th century universe", but also that of a memoir offering [...] "the sense to a life." [...] The text, having for its protagonist Nedelciu's alter ego Diogene [...] "Dio" [...] Sava, again speaks of its own genesis, notably by referencing a real-life encounter with Scarlat, a diver for the state commercial fleet Navrom and amateur novelist, who reveals to Nedelciu that writing itself may carry the symptoms of disease. Through the themes of diving and disease, the book filtrates satire of communist politics, as Nedelciu explained within the actual text: [...] "this free body of mine, Mediterranean as it is even through the idea of a healthy and harmonious body, perceives this adventure into the deep ... as an adventure into a much colder land. In short, the mind imagines the deep-sea diver's world and the body refuses it instinctively, viscerally. And for good reason too, given that, in fact, behind the Cousteauesque design, my mind encrypts the adversities (the chill, the frost) of this entire world I'm living in, this symbolic coldness of Romania's communist society in the year 1989, and the body naturally refuses this exile 'up North'." [...] According to Lefter, Nedelciu was actually reworking his notion of layered meanings into the diving metaphor, adapting an earlier interest in the techniques of art restoration (in turned provoked by his discussions with muralist Viorel Grimalschi).|$|E
40|$|As {{interior}} designers, we {{strive to}} design everything for our clients, from complex environments to the joinery of a chair. We rarely consider inviting our clients or the users {{to join us}} in finishing the space. <b>Read-In</b> workshop is not a school, but a kind of home, a home belonging to children, which provides the possibilities for children to play, to learn, to occupy, to personalize, and to share. An emotional space that will not limit the user, but keep inspiring them. It helps children notice, think, and grow. Half of the interior space will be a fixed design, designed and fabricated during the first construction phase. The other Half will be designed as a flexible and changeable “framework” space, which allow the users to reorganize, repaint, and refinish, depending on their evolving educational needs and aesthetic tastes. Therefore, this “incomplete” workshop will share control with children. The contents of the framework will be continuously updated by the children who participate in the <b>Read-In</b> arts programs...|$|E

All controllable parameters are calculated to implement <b>read-in</b> of information, and the durations of magnetic pulses are less than the dephasing time of quantum states in Mn 12.

We review our proposal of using electron spins in quantum confined structures as qubits and discuss the requirements for implementing a quantum computer. We describe several realizations of one- and two-qubit gates and of the <b>read-in</b> and read-out tasks. We discuss recently proposed schemes for using a single quantum dot as spin-filter and spin-memory device. Considering electronic EPR pairs needed for quantum communication we show that their spin entanglement can be detected in mesoscopic transport measurements using metallic as well as superconducting leads attached to the dots. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{measuring}} global poverty consistently is addressed using {{a family of}} bare bones consumption baskets (BBB). This methodology pinpoints equivalent levels of welfare, both internationally and intertemporally. Naturally, in calculating poverty rates the household consumption distributions are needed. However, those are not made available by the World Bank that collects them. To overcome this problem the python script from Dykstra et al 2014 has been updated to <b>read-in</b> a list of poverty lines and fetch the poverty rate on a per country/year combination. A later version of this script has now allowed for extracting the entire distribution from the World Bank and deals with the inconsistencies found in the dataset provided by Dykstra et al...|$|E

Such systems in the 1980 's may have 10 - 20 meter resolution and generate. 2 tecabits of data per day, with peak rates of 0. 8 gigabits per second based on the dominant requirements of agriculture. System alternatives are considered that will handle such data. Data relayed to the facility are recorded at high rates and then processed at lower speed by computer. Hardwired special digital logic computers may be used with an appropriate classification algorithm for crop recognition.

40|$|A novel {{mechanism}} is proposed for single and double qubit state manipulations in quantum computation with four-fold degenerate energy levels. The principle {{is based on}} starting with a four fold degeneracy, lifting it stepwise adiabatically {{by a set of}} control parameters and performing the quantum gate operations on non-degenerate states. A particular realization of the proposed {{mechanism is}} suggested by using inductively coupled rf-squid loops in the macroscopic quantum tunnelling regime where the energy eigen levels are directly connected with the measurable flux states. The one qubit and two qubit controlled operations are demonstrated explicitly. The appearance of the flux states also allows precise <b>read-in</b> and read-out operations by the measurement of flux.

40|$|Many quantum {{computations}} can {{be roughly}} broken down in-to two stages: <b>read-in</b> and processing of the input data; and processing and read-out of the solution. In {{the first phase}} the initial data is read in to a quantum register and processed with quantum gates. This produces a quantum state in which the solution is encoded. In the second phase the quantum state may be subjected to further processing followed by measure-ment, producing a classical data string containing the solu-tion. Even though quantum computers are currently limited to {{a small number of}} qubits, there is considerable interest in the small scale demonstration of quantum algorithms even if the size of the problems solved means that they remain eas-ily tractable with classical techniques.
