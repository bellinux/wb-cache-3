The car was first introduced as an export only model. The left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> manual transmission models had a column gear change, while <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drives</b> had a floor change by the door.

Although the inflationary scenario is quite appealing for the solution of the horizon and the flatness problem [2], it is difficult to formulate a particle physics model consistently.

50|$|Alvis {{contracted}} AP Metalcraft, a Coventry coachbuilder, {{to produce}} the two door open car body to fit on the TA 14 chassis. The car had heavily cut away door tops on the rear hinged doors and very long sweeping front wings and a fold down windscreen. The radiator grille was a controversial item being pear shaped with the bottom side bulges concealing the headlights which consequentially were {{a long way from}} the side of the car. The front sidelights were mounted in the bumpers. Both <b>right</b> and left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions were made.|$|R
25|$|Lancia's {{reputation}} was significantly undermined in 1980, when defective Lancia Beta models, suffering from significant suspension sub-frame corrosion problems, were purchased back from owners {{by the company}} in a highly publicised campaign. These cars were subsequently crushed. The brand never recovered from the damage inflicted during the Beta recall and, combined {{with a range of}} related factors (including poor residual values, which made their range uncompetitive), decided to withdraw from the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> market in February 1994. The last model be sold in the United Kingdom was the Delta, boosted by its rallying reputation, withdrawn from sale in 1995.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Ford of Brazil and Ford of Argentina merged their {{operations}} with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range. Sales figures and profitability were disappointing, and Autolatina was dissolved in 1995. With {{the advent of}} Mercosur, the regional common market, Ford {{was finally able to}} rationalize its product line-ups in those countries. Consequently, the Ford Fiesta and Ford EcoSport are built only in Brazil, and the Ford Focus only built in Argentina, with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries. Models like the Ford Mondeo from Europe could now be imported completely built up. Ford of Brazil produces a pick-up truck version of the Fiesta, the Courier, which is also produced in South Africa as the Ford Bantam in <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> versions.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to local}} {{assembly}} {{which began in}} late 1964, small numbers of RHD full imports were sourced through select Australian Ford dealers, and also by Ford of Australia for executive use. RHD wagons, convertibles and fastbacks, 2- and 4-door hardtops, XLs and LTDs were generally sourced as full imports from Ford of Canada until approx 1968. The fully imported 1959 to early 1963 models used a 1959 U.S. Fairlane dashboard and instruments. In late 1963, a 1959 Edsel Corsair-based dashboard was used, and for 1964, a 1959 Edsel Ranger-based dashboard was used. However, some RHD 1963s and 1964s have been photographed with the more attractive U.S.-style 1964 cluster. Australian assembled 1965–1968 models were sourced in CKD form from Ford of Canada. The 1965–1967 model Galaxies adopted the RHD dashboard based on the 1963 Lincoln Continental. The 1967 models got the U.S.-market safety steering wheel with its thickly padded center hub. This wheel was retained for 1968, and the 1968 Torino cluster replaced the Continental version. Some <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> 1967s have been seen with {{a mirror image of}} the US-style instrument panel for that year.|$|E

Those TR7 Sprints that are known were fitted with the 5-speed gearbox mated to the 3.89:1 rear axle that was standard on the 5-speed TR7s.

The Australian Javelins came with top trim and features that included the [...] V8 engine, three-speed [...] "Shift Command" [...] automatic transmission, and [...] "Twin Grip" [...] limited-slip rear differential.

The first/most common was the ACS South Paw Claw model, available in 16T. Later, a version of this hub was made with small metric BMX (30 mm x 1 mm) threads, left hand on one side and <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> on the other side. These hubs accepted either Left or right side drive freewheels in the smaller 13T-15T sizes.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was similarly updated with an all-new design and instrument panel featuring the first blow molded symmetrical instrument panel retainer structure. This instrument panel featured a unique cluster/airbag bracket invented by Peter Gruich {{that allowed the}} interchange of the two components {{in order for the}} vehicle to be sold in the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and left <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> markets with both driver and passenger airbags. A stiffer unibody frame brought improvements to noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) measurements. Also contributing to NVH improvements were new door seals that reduced wind noise at higher speeds.|$|R

The total production included six coupes, and two aluminum alloy-bodied cars. One of the cars was originally <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> drive: the rest were all left <b>hand</b> <b>drive.</b> One of the cars never received a body, and was used as a rolling chassis for auto shows.

A special one off Balboni was created by the Singapore distributor of Lamborghini (Eurosport) which had Superleggera seats and a full Reiter Engineering Super Trofeo Strada body derived directly from the Super Trofeo series cars. This one off Balboni was viewed as the predecessor to the Singapore Edition limited run LP550-2 (see below) which had a stripped out Superleggera interior, Superleggera side skirts, rear deck, rear diffuser and front bumper (sans Superleggera rear wing) but which critically was a 2wd car which catered to the enthusiast driver.

Since the ban came into effect in 2005, the proportion of RHD vehicles were plunged from 99  % to a 42  % in 2009 due to combined impacts of import ban and conversion of 15  % of RHD vehicles into LHD. Since there is no restriction on RHD vehicles in Burundi, the majority of vehicles in Burundi are still odd RHD vehicles.
