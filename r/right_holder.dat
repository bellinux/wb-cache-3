50|$|Under {{the theory}} of {{positive}} and negative rights, a negative right is a right not to be subjected to an action of another person or group—a government, for example—usually in the form of abuse or coercion. As such, negative rights exist unless someone acts to negate them. A positive right is a right to be subjected to an action of another person or group. In other words, for a positive right to be exercised, someone else's actions must be added to the equation. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the <b>right</b> <b>holder,</b> while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the <b>right</b> <b>holder.</b> In the framework of the Kantian categorical imperative, negative rights can be associated with perfect duties while positive rights can be connected to imperfect duties.|$|E

40|$|In declaratory {{judgment}} actions brought by alleged infringers against <b>rights</b> <b>holders,</b> such as actions for {{declaration of invalidity}} or non-infringement of intellectual property rights, U. S. courts have long maintained that sending a cease-and-desist letter alone, absent other acts in an alleged infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum, is not a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction over the <b>rights</b> <b>holder</b> who mailed them to the alleged infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum. Notwithstanding the similarities between cease-and-desist letters and notifications under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals recently decided that sending a notification alone does establish a basis for personal jurisdiction over the <b>rights</b> <b>holder.</b> Contrary to {{the decision of the}} Tenth Circuit, this article suggests that cease-and-desist letters and DMCA notifications should be treated similarly. First, as a matter of doctrine, the two instruments are similar enough to warrant application of the same rule. If a letter does not support the exercise of personal jurisdiction in {{declaratory judgment}} actions against the <b>rights</b> <b>holder,</b> neither should a notification. Second, as a matter of policy, maintaining the same approach to the two instruments would promote settlements. The Tenth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s approach defeats this pro-settlement policy because it discourages <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> from using notifications to achieve a speedy removal of allegedly infringing material from the Internet. To avoid personal jurisdiction in the infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum, <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> must refrain from using a notification and are thereby deprived of the option to stop further infringements immediately; without such an option {{they are less likely to}} seek settlement before filing a lawsuit. It is important to clarify whether notifications will be a basis of personal jurisdiction over a <b>rights</b> <b>holder</b> because the result will determine how practicable the use of notifications will be for <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> and therefore how effective the notification system will be...|$|R
40|$|In June 1993 the Namibian {{government}} announced the expiration of existing fishing {{rights and the}} application of a new fishing rights system starting in January 1994. Rights are now granted for seven, 10, 15 and 20 years on the basis of investment, Namibian participation and other requirements. Data are gathered by surveys on income and expenditure to fulfil the policy conditions. In this study, part of the data are used to test if there are any statistical relationships between various factors such as levels of investment, interest rates, fishing income and quota, and the length of fishing rights. A log-linear model is derived to analyse elements that influence investment. In addition, the relationship between social contribution and length of fishing rights is explored. The results indicate that the interest rate is insignificant, while quota and fishing income influence investment. In particular, short term <b>right</b> <b>holders</b> invest almost twice as much as long term <b>right</b> <b>holders.</b> The model indicated positive net (but declining gross) investment for long term <b>right</b> <b>holders.</b> Long term <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> also contribute more in terms of social activities than short term <b>rights</b> <b>holders.</b> Incentive...|$|R
