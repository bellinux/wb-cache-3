40|$|Abstract—To {{determine}} {{the potential of}} a low cost Irish engineered timber product to replace high cost solid timber for use in bending active structures such as gridshells a single Irish engineered timber product {{in the form of}} orientated strand board (OSB) was selected. A comparative study of OSB and solid timber was carried out to {{determine the}} optimum properties that make a material suitable for use in gridshells. Three parameters were identified to be relevant in the selection of a material for gridshells. These three parameters are the strength to stiffness ratio, the flexural stiffness of commercially available sections, and the variability of material and section properties. It is shown that when comparing OSB against solid timber, OSB is a more suitable material for use in gridshells that are at the smaller end of the scale and that have tight radii of curvature. Typically, for solid timber materials, stiffness is used as an indicator for strength and engineered timber is no different. Thus, low flexural stiffness would mean low flexural strength. However, when it comes to bending active gridshells, OSB offers a significant advantage. By the addition of multiple layers, an increased section size is created, thus endowing the structure with higher stiffness and higher strength from initial low stiffness and low strength materials while still maintaining tight radii of curvature. This allows OSB to compete with solid timber on large scale gridshells. Additionally, a preliminary sustainability study using a set of sustainability indicators was carried out to determine the relative sustainability of building a large-scale gridshell in Ireland with a primary focus on economic viability but a mention is also given to social and environmental aspects. For this, the Savill garden gridshell in the UK was used as the functional unit with the sustainability of the structural <b>roof</b> <b>skeleton</b> constructed from UK larch solid timber being compared with the same structure using Irish OSB. Albeit that the advantages of using commercially available OSB in a bending active gridshell are marginal and limited to specific gridshell applications, further study into an optimised engineered timber product is merited.

5000|$|.....is {{the quaint}} brand-new village of Gnadenau, {{where there are}} some twenty small farmers, who have built the queerest and most {{comfortable}} cheap houses ever seen in the West, and with {{the least amount of}} timber, being merely a <b>skeleton</b> <b>roof</b> built on the ground and thatched with prairie-grass. They serve for man and beast, being divided on the inside by a partition of adobe.|$|R
40|$|A {{newly built}} {{pharmaceutical}} plant {{has been investigated}} by measurements. Currents of 0. 3 kA were injected in the lightning protection grid on the roof. Inside the building, test cables of 100 m length followed a path typical for cables belonging to the installation. We measured induced cable currents and voltages. A reduced model of the building incorporated most of the designed current paths. Measurements and model showed that the <b>roof</b> steel <b>skeleton</b> carried about 80 % of the current and the intended lightning conductors 20 %. The calculated current through a cable support was larger than measured. This is explained by also considering a nearby nonintended conductor. For three types of cables, we determined the transfer impedances. The measurements and model have been combined and extrapolated to actual lightning...|$|R
