No false sentimentalities! It is preferable that 50 suspects are liquidated than one German soldier lose his life…If {{it is not possible}} to produce the people who have participated in any way in the insurrection or to seize them, <b>reprisal</b> <b>measures</b> of a general kind may be deemed advisable, for instance, the shooting to death of all male inhabitants from the nearest villages, according to a definite ratio (for instance, one German dead: 100 Serbs, one German wounded: 50 Serbs).” ...|$|R
50|$|A {{referendum}} on whether Antonio López de Santa Anna should remain President., and if not, who should replace him, {{was held in}} Mexico on 1 December 1854. The proposal was approved by 99.07% of voters. On 11 December Santa Anna ordered <b>reprisal</b> <b>measures</b> against those who had voted no. On 2 January 1855 he declared that the country had confirmed his position in office. He was subsequently overthrown on 8 December that year.|$|R
5000|$|According to Biddiscombe [...] "the {{threat of}} Nazi {{partisan}} warfare had a generally unhealthy effect on broad issues of policy among the occupying powers. As well, it prompted {{the development of}} draconian <b>reprisal</b> <b>measures</b> {{that resulted in the}} destruction of much German property and the deaths of thousands of civilians and soldiers". Ian Kershaw states that fear of Werwolf activities may have motivated atrocities against German civilians by Allied troops during and immediately after the war.|$|R
25|$|Partisan {{activities}} {{centred on}} sabotaging economic targets and communications; engaging the Germans in combat; intelligence gathering; and terrorist activities. The primary partisan targets in 1941–42 {{were not the}} German invaders but rather the local police, who were under German direction, and civilian collaborators. The years 1943–44 were the peak of partisan activity within the territory of present-day Ukraine, as the Soviets battled the far-right, nationalistic OUN and the UPA, both of whom collaborated with the Nazis. <b>Reprisal</b> <b>measures</b> for attacks on Soviet partisans or support for Ukrainian nationalists included burning down villages and executions. Whole families were killed, and children, even babies, were sometimes bayoneted or burned alive.|$|R
50|$|Most Arab {{countries}} viewed al-Asifah's guerilla {{activities as}} reckless adventurism {{that could result}} in an untimely war with Israel. In 1965, the Lebanese Army Command requested that the Lebanese press stop publishing al-Asifah communiques and news of its operations. In January 1966, Arab representatives of the Mixed Armistice Commission demanded an end to activities by al-Asifah {{on the grounds that they}} were ineffective and causing Israeli <b>reprisals.</b> <b>Measures</b> to curb such incursions were agreed on. King Hussein of Jordan quietly but forcefully tried to prevent al-Asifah from operating in Jordanian territory. The first one of al-Asifah's men to die in action was killed by Jordanian border patrols while his unit was returning from a mission in Israel.|$|R

5000|$|Following the Carlist defeat Olazábal’s {{return to}} Spain was unthinkable, though {{governmental}} <b>reprisal</b> <b>measures</b> {{did not affect}} him very much; in the late 1870s {{he was the first}} taxpayer of Irun. He settled in Saint-Jean-de-Luz in the French province of Labourd, only 8 km from the Spanish border, where he acquired several properties. By the 1890s, he purchased a residential estate that would be known as [...] "Villa Arbelaiz". According to Sûreté, which kept monitoring his activities, Olazábal joined a committee co-ordinating Carlist activities in France. He was allegedly entrusted with new military purchases in England and in fact he kept trafficking arms across the border. In late 1876 Ejército del Norte, the occupation army in Vasco-Navarrese provinces, was put on alert as the news of Carlist war preparations mounted, especially that in 1877 Carlos VII issued a manifesto pledging to defend the fueros, scrapped by the central government. At that time Olazábal was already referred to by the Madrid press as “famous Tirso de Olazábal” ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the very}} late 1890s Sanz emerged among the party heavyweights. In 1897 {{he was invited}} to the claimant’s {{residence}} in Venice to take part in editing the Carlist doctrinal manifesto, though little is known about his actual contribution to the so-called Acta de Loredan. The following year he was already fully engaged in a Carlist plot, aimed at launching another insurgency. In 1899 he was nominated to a 7-member junta, supposed to co-ordinate action plan of the rising, and grew to its supreme military authority; this was formally recognized by Carlos VII nominating Sanz to mariscal del campo. Full picture of the attempt remains obscure; it seems that the Carlist command put off the insurgency, which in Catalonia got out of hand and materialized as few isolated revolts, known as La Octubrada. During the key period Sanz was in Bayonne, not clear whether part of Carlist smokescreen or actual strategy to disengage from would-be unrest. Also the aftermath period is far from clear. Some authors claim that Sanz was spared the claimant’s anger and in 1900 was still considered Minister of War in a would-be rebellious Carlist government. On the other hand, contemporary press reported his alleged differences with Carlos VII, pointed to his supposed opposition to military action and speculated this was the reason for no official <b>reprisal</b> <b>measures</b> having been administered versus Sanz. La Octubrada caused major shakeup in the Carlist political command, with marqués de Cerralbo replaced by Matías Barrio y Mier as the king’s Jefe Delegado. Sanz is not named as a protagonist of the turmoil which rocked top layers of the party, apart that he resigned from the Navarrese jefatura. It seems he did not fall from grace, as in 1902 he was considered member of an auxiliary junta, to be set up as assistance to the ailing Barrio. However, having lost the parliamentary mandate in 1903 he lost also prestigious position within the executive, especially that his friend de Cerralbo was also sidetracked and the party was controlled by a new team.|$|R
60|$|The {{conflagration}} of Falmouth {{was as a}} bale of fire {{throughout the}} country. [Lieutenant Mowat had declared {{to the people of}} Falmouth that he had orders from Admiral Graves to set fire to all the seaport towns between Boston and Halifax. Washington supposed such to be the case.] General Sullivan was sent to Portsmouth, where there was a fortification of some strength, to give the inhabitants his advice and assistance in warding off the menaced blow. Newport, also, was put on the alert, and recommended to fortify itself. Under the feeling roused by these reports, the General Court of Massachusetts, exercising a sovereign power, passed an act for encouraging the fitting out of armed vessels to defend the sea-coast of America, and for erecting a court to try and condemn all vessels that should be found infesting the same. This act, granting letters of marque and <b>reprisal,</b> anticipated any <b>measure</b> of the kind {{on the part of the}} General Government.|$|R
