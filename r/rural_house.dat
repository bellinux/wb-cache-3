While {{there are numerous}} studies analyzing the loss of arable land due to urban sprawl, less {{attention has been paid}} to the study of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land in China. This paper develops a theoretical framework for <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in China. It introduces a research method, which is using the spatial differentiation in regional development for compensating the deficiencies in time-series data, to analyze the <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in the Transect of the Yangtse River (TYR). Detailed land-use data and socio-economic data from both research institutes and government departments were used to test the following hypothesis on <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition. We assume that <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in every region will undergo specific stages the proportion of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in the increase of total construction land will decline gradually with the development of the local economy, and the end of the transition corresponds to a new equilibrium between <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> and other construction activities. Five regional types of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change were defined according to an aggregation index used to reflect landscape patterns. The outcomes indicated that the share of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> in the increase of total construction land declines gradually from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Yangtse River, i. e. from Ganzi-Yushu to Luzhou-Diqing, Enshi-Chongqing, Tongling-Yichang and to Shanghai-Chaohu. Each region is in a different phase of the <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition, which corresponds to a particular socio-economic developmental level. Finally, some policy implications were discussed by applying this research to land management issues. The authors argue that there are problems in the current <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land managerial system in China, and that the Central Government needs to define uniform regulations for <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> according to regional socio-economic developmental level, physical conditions and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition phase...|$|R
40|$|Land use {{transition}} {{refers to}} the changes in land use morphology (both dominant morphology and recessive morphology) of a certain region over {{a certain period of}} time driven by socio-economic change and innovation, and it usually corresponds to the transition of socio-economic development phase. In China, farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land are the two major sources of land use transition. This paper analyzes the spatio-temporal coupling characteristics of farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in China, using high-resolution Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data in 2000 and 2008, and the data from the Ministry of Land and Resources of China. The outcomes indicated that: (1) during 2000 - 2008, the correlation coefficient of farmland vs. <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change is - 0. 921, and it shows that the change pattern of farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land is uncoordinated; (2) the result of Spearman rank correlation analysis shows that <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change has played a major role in the mutual transformation of farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land; and (3) it shows a high-degree spatial coupling between farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change in southeast China during 2000 - 2008. In general, farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in China is driven by socio-economic, bio-physical and managerial three-dimensional driving factors through the interactions among rural population, farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land. However, the spatio-temporal coupling phenomenon and mechanism of farmland and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition in China are largely due to the "dual-track" structure of rural-urban development...|$|R

40|$|With the rural-to-urban {{migration}} under China's rapid urbanization, the Bohai Rim of China experienced dramatic <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land transition (RHLT) {{in the last}} decade, {{especially in terms of}} per capita <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land (PRHL). The objectives of this study are to (i) analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of RHLT, and (ii) detect the underlying driving forces and mechanism of RHLT in Bohai Rim during 2000 - 2010. To achieve these goals, we collected and rasterized high resolution Landsat TM data, socio-economic and physical environmental data for the Bohai Rim. Spatial econometric regression models at both grid scale and county scale were developed to examine the driving forces of RHLT in Bohai Rim. The results indicated that the distribution of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land was characterized by vertical zonality, i. e., the proportion of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land decreased gradually with the increase of elevation, and was more sensitive to slope than to elevation. The results of hot spots analysis showed that the spatial mismatch of <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land change and rural population migration made the regional differences of RHLT more remarkable, based on which four <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land consolidation regional types were differentiated. The authors argue that towns are effective hubs for linking the urban system and rural system, and it is better to get the farmers to migrate to towns instead of big cities in the process of pushing forward China's new-type urbanization in the future. For this, it is necessary to further improve related system and institution. Only by this way can the relationship between out-migrated farmers and <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land be orderly and completely removed, so as to smoothly pushing forward <b>rural</b> <b>housing</b> land consolidation.
