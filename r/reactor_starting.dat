40|$|Abstract – One of {{the pending}} {{questions}} concerning Molten Salt Reactors {{based on the}} 232 Th/ 233 U fuel cycle is the supply of the fissile matter, {{and as a consequence}} the deployment possibilities of a fleet of Molten Salt Reactors, since 233 U does not exist on earth and is not yet produced in the current operating reactors. A solution may consist in producing 233 U in special devices containing Thorium, in Pressurized Water or Fast Neutrons Reactors. Two alternatives to produce 233 U are examined here: directly in standard Molten Salt <b>Reactors</b> <b>started</b> with Plutonium as fissile matter and then operated in the Th/ 233 U cycle; or in dedicated Molten Salt <b>Reactors</b> <b>started</b> and fed with Plutonium as fissile matter and Thorium as fertile matter. The idea is to design a critical reactor able to burn the Plutonium and the minor actinides presently produced in PWRs, and consequently to convert this Plutonium into 233 U. A particular reactor configuration is used, called ‘unique channel’ configuration {{in which there is no}} moderator in the core, leading to a quasi fast neutron spectrum, allowing Plutonium to be used as fissile matter. The conversion capacities of such Molten Salt Reactors are excellent. For Molten Salt <b>Reactors</b> only <b>started</b> with Plutonium, the assets of the Thorium fuel cycle turn out to be quickly recovered and the reactor’s characteristics turn out to be equivalent to Molten Salt Reactors operated with 233 U only. Using a combination of Molten Salt <b>Reactors</b> <b>started</b> or operated with Plutonium and of Molten Salt <b>Reactors</b> <b>started</b> with 233 U, the deployment capabilities of these reactors fully satisfy the condition of sustainability...|$|R

40|$|A {{reusable}} Thermal {{protection system}} has to satisfy several specific requirements. One {{of the most critical}} is the control of the oxidation of the materials during the re-entry step. This result may be reached through a proper balance between bulk materials with good mechanical properties and coatings with good thermal barrier properties. Carbon composites (SiC) are nowadays the most suitable candidates as they have both good thermal resistance and good thermal stability which preserve the mechanical properties at high temperatures. However a further improvement is needed: The development of a coating which allows to optimize both the oxidation protection and the substrate adhesion. Plasma sputtered oxide films of valve-metals (Ta, Nb, Zr, Ti) deposited on hybrid captive device are proposed in this study as a possible solution to the above-mentioned specifications. The exposed experimental findings refer to Zr 02 nanostructured thin films deposited in a RF (13. 56 MHz) magnetron sputtering <b>reactor,</b> <b>starting</b> from Zr targets (purity 99, 99 %) in plasma fed with Ar and 02 in different experimental conditions.

40|$|The safe {{start-up}} of {{a nuclear}} reactor depends upon {{the presence of a}} steady neutron source in the core. This source, however, does not always have to be physically inserted into the reactor because there exist in the core natural neutron sources from spontaneous fission, cosmic rays, photo neutrons, fission products, etc. Nevertheless, so that the source magnitude is well defined, it is generally thought judicious to have a specially constructed source of the (α,n) type present. From an operational point of view, it is vital to assess the strength of the natural sources to see if they will be sufficient in magnitude to ensure safe stochastic startup without the addition of an extraneous source. The most important case for source evaluation is that of a <b>reactor</b> <b>starting</b> up with fresh, unirradiated fuel because then the natural background sources will be at a minimum. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to examine the criteria necessary to ensure that the source strength is high enough to reduce the probability of any undesirable stochastic transient occurring to a specified value, e. g. 10 e- 8; it may also be considered as an update of the classic work of Hurwitz and co-workers (1963). To carry out the calculations, we use the Pál-Bell backward formalism (Pázsit and Pál, 2008) and apply it to the point model in order to make comparisons with the earlier work of Hurwitz. We also extend the study to include space and energy dependence which are found to have a not insignificant influence on the results.

The horizontal pipe model inner diameter is 305 mm with thickness of 33. 5 mm and length of four diameters. The Pressurized Water Reactor type Nuclear Power Plants operate in the range of dimensionless Froude number 0. 02 – 0. 2. Four cases for flow velocities ranging between 0. 01 and 0. 2 m/sec, based on Froude number, are considered. The propensity for stratification of the fluid in a horizontal pipe can be correlated to the dimensionless Richardson number. If the Richardson number is greater than unity thermal stratification is expected to occur and for Richardson number above 10 the natural convection dominates the flow field and a strongly stratified flow can be maintained until either the temperature difference decreases or the flow velocity increases enough to lower the value of Richardson number below 0. 1 or less. The Richardson number for the four cases is greater than unity. The transient analysis is performed using commercially available software ANSYS CFX. The transient temperature distribution along the horizontal pipe with different heat up rates is represented in this study.
