40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model that can {{estimate}} filter resistance. Two sorts of value are used as inputs to estimate filter resistance. One is the power consumed by the fan in the indoor unit {{and the other is}} the thermal performance. For the room air-conditioners that the real time indoor unit fan power consumption is available, fan power consumptions are used as inputs to estimate filter resistance. For the room air-conditioners that are equipped with <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature sensors, this model estimates filter resistance using <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature, air temperature or enthalpy difference between supply and indoor air. The maximum and average difference between estimated and measured filter resistance are 12. 72 % and 5. 89 % when using the fan power consumption as inputs. When using the air-conditioner thermal performance data, the maximum and average estimation errors are 13. 12 % and 5. 96 %.

40|$|A {{literature}} review indicates {{that almost all}} moving boundary heat exchanger models used in dynamic simulations of heat pumps rely on the common hypothesis that the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop is negligible. In fact, {{it is important to}} include the momentum balance in some applications, such as electronics cooling where microchannels are commonly used and significant pressure drop is observed and large-scale heat exchangers in solar thermal plants where tube length can be longer than several hundred meters. In addition, a comprehensive and robust switching approach is needed to handle transitions between different model states due to phase change. It is found that the current switching methods in the literature exhibit several shortcomings which may cause serious errors and stability issues when simulating cycling transients of vapor compression systems. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose an improved moving boundary formulation that aims to fill in the above research gaps. Specifically, two different approaches are presented to account for the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop across the heat exchanger. A novel and comprehensive switching scheme is introduced to ensure smooth transition between different model representations under large disturbances. The proposed model is validated using measured data. The validation shows that the proposed heat exchanger model along with other supporting component models can reasonably capture the start-up transients of a flash tank vapor injection heat pump system...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Water source {{heat pumps}} are {{increasingly}} being used for residential and commercial space heating. Typically, these heat pumps are capable of both heating and cooling, and historically the design emphasis has been on improving the units' cooling performance. Recently, there has been more interest in improving the heating performance, however, in order to optimize the design for improved heating performance data on the heat pump components operating in the heating mode are required. These data have not been available for the waterto- refrigerant heat exchangers typically installed in unitary water source heat pumps. The purpose of this work is to provide performance data on such heat exchangers operating as evaporators (data is available for the heat exchangers operating as condensers) {{and to provide a}} numerical model by which a limited amount of evaporator data might be expanded for system modeling and optimization studies. A well instrumented water-to-water heat pump was assembled for the purpose of testing two such water-to-refrigerant heat exchangers to determine their heat transfer and <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop characteristics as evaporators. The overall heat transfer coefficient for each of the two heat exchangers was found to be a strong function of both the water and refrigerant flow rates and a relatively weak function of the refrigerant evaporation temperature. The <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop was determined to be highly dependent on the refrigerant flow rate and only slightly dependent on the evaporator temperature. The overall heat transfer coefficient showed an apparent difference between parallel and counter flow conditions. This coefficient, as defined by the log-mean temperature difference, was slightly higher for the counter flow condition. A numerical model of the evaporator was developed and compared with the experimental results. The model follows a numerical solution in which the governing equations (continuity, momentum, and energy) are solved for a finite control volume and an appropriate finitedifference scheme is used to continue the solution step-wise {{along the length of the}} heat exchanger. The numerical model accurately predicts the effect of flow rate and temperature on <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop and the effect of water flow rate and direction on the overall heat transfer coefficient.

Small diameter copper tubes are more desirable in applications with higher pressures. For tubes of the same thickness, smaller diameter tubes can withstand higher pressures than larger diameter tubes. Hence, as tube diameters decrease, burst pressures increase. This is because working pressure is directly proportional to wall thickness and inversely proportional to diameter. By designing coils with shorter tube lengths, less work is required to circulate the <b>refrigerant.</b> Therefore, <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop factors due to small diameter tubes can be offset.|$|R

40|$|The natural {{refrigerant}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) offers new possibilities for design of flexible, efficient and environmentally safe mobile heat pumping systems. As high-efficient car engines with less waste heat are developed, extra heating {{of the passenger}} compartment is needed in the cold season. A reversible transcritical CO 2 system with gliding temperature heat rejection can give high air delivery temperature which results in rapid heating of the passenger compartment and rapid defogging or defrosting of windows. When operated in cooling mode, the efficiency of transcritical CO 2 systems is higher compared to common (HFC) air conditioning systems, at most dominant operating conditions. Several issues were identified {{for the design of}} compact interior heat exchangers for automotive reversible CO 2 heat pumping systems. Among theses issues are: • Refrigerant flow distribution • Heat exchanger fluid flow circuiting. • Air temperature uniformity downstream of the heat exchanger. • Minimization of temperature approach. • Windshield flash fogging, due to retained water inside the heat exchanger. • Internal heat conduction in heating mode operation. • <b>Refrigerant</b> side <b>pressure</b> drop. In order to provide a basis for understanding these issues, a calculation model was developed, a test facility was established, and different prototype heat exchangers were experimentally investigated.
