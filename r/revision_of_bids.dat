50|$|It {{was later}} {{said that the}} whole bidding process was staged {{in a way that}} only Stožice project could meet all the {{criteria}} and therefore receive all of the available funds. Because of his decision Minister Igor Lukšič had to endure an interpellation in the parliament that eventually turned out in his favour. In late March, 2011, it was revealed that the European Commission demands from the Slovenian Government a full report about the bidding process, which was alleged to be staged from the start in a way that Stožice Sports Park was the only possible recipient of the financial means. If the Commission finds any irregularities in the bidding process, they could insist that the funds (9,4 million euros) would be returned. On 12 April 2011, SVLR (Office for Local Self-Government and Regional Policy), under the pressure of the European Commission, made a <b>revision</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bidding</b> process and found three irregularities. Their findings were presented to the European Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the Slovenian Government.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of sterilized Central Bank {{interventions}} on the micro structure of currency markets. We analyze their major channels of effectiveness, imperfect substitutability and signaling, in a model of sequential trading in which the stylized monetary authority is a rational, but not necessarily profit-maximizing player. In such a setting, and consistent with available empirical evidence, we find that intervention has endogenous long-lived effects on quotes when informative about policy objectives and fundamentals, or when the threat of future actions by the Central Bank is significant and credible, for these circumstances lead uninformed investors or dealers to a permanent revision in their beliefs. Portfolio balance effects of such transactions are instead short-lived, because of trading occurring sequentially and not because of high asset substitutability, as often argued in the literature. We also find that a monetary authority attempting to lean against the wind or to chase the trend of the domestic currency is generally more successful when dealers compete against {{each other for the}} incoming trades. Intuitively, competition induces the dealers to pass all revenues or losses they expect from trading with the Central Bank onto the population of investors. This is accomplished by greater, and generally asymmetric, <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> their <b>bid</b> and ask quotes. The resulting equilibrium process of intraday price formation and bid-ask spreads are shown to depend crucially on the degree of market power held by the forex dealers, on the sign and magnitude of announced and realized interventions, on the perceived likelihood of a future intervention to occur, and on the transparency of the order flow induced by the intervention. ...|$|R

40|$|Releases of the GDP {{are subject}} to {{revisions}} over time. This paper examines the predictability <b>of</b> German GDP <b>revisions</b> using forecast rationality tests. Previous studies of German GDP covering data until 1997 finds that <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonally adjusted GDP are predictable. This paper uses a newly available real-time data to analyze the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonal adjusted GDP, of nominal unadjusted GDP, of the seasonal pattern, and of the GDP deflator for the period between 1992 and 2006. We find that the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> the nominal unadjusted GDP are unpredictable, but that the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> the price adjustments are predictable. Nevertheless, <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonally adjusted GDP are hardly predictable and less well predictable compared to earlier studies. This lower predictability seems {{to be linked to}} the finding that <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> seasonal adjustments are hardly predictable, too, and that their predictability decreased over time...|$|R
