40|$|Congenital myopathies are {{heterogeneous}} inherited {{diseases of}} muscle {{characterized by a}} range of distinctive histologic abnormalities. We have studied a consanguineous family with congenital myopathy. Genome-wide linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous non-sense mutation in 3 -hydroxya-cyl-CoA dehydratase 1 (HACD 1) in affected individuals. The mutation <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>non-sense</b> mediated decay of the HACD 1 mRNA to 31 % of control levels in patient muscle and completely abrogates the enzymatic activity of dehydration of 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA, the third step in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). We describe clinical findings correlated with a deleteriousmutation in a gene not previously known to be asso-ciatedwithcongenitalmyopathy inhumans. Wesuggest that themutation in theHACD 1 genecausesareduction in the synthesis of VLCFAs, which are components of membrane lipids and participants in physiological pro-cesses, leading to congenital myopathy. These data indicate that HACD 1 is necessary for muscle function...|$|E
40|$|The book {{edited by}} Massimiliano Cappuccio and Tom Froese {{is aimed at}} {{understanding}} <b>non-sense</b> <b>in</b> cognition {{and the process of}} sense-making. The authors of twelve chapters included in the book focus on different aspects of sense-making in diversified aspects of cognition. The texts included in the book show that sense-making {{is one of the most}} important aspects of cognition in general. They put the enactive perspective to the problem, which influences the overall reception of the book. Since enactivism has strong philosophical implications, not everyone will agree with the positions proposed by the authors, and some of the chapters are non-canonical even in their views on enactivism. However, even readers not accepting this approach might find the book interesting and thought provoking...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{repeated}} {{demonstrations of}} asymmetries in several brain functions, the biological bases of such asymmetries have remained obscure. OBJECTIVE: To investigate development of lateralized facial and eye movements evoked by hemispheric stimulation in right-handed and left-handed children. METHOD: Fifty children were tested according to handedness {{by means of}} four tests: I. Mono-syllabic non-sense words, II. Tri-syllabic sense words, III. Visual field occlusion by black wall, and presentation of geometric objects to both hands separately, IV. Left eye and the temporal half visual field of the right eye occlusion with special goggles, afterwards asking children to assemble a three-piece puzzle; same tasks were performed contra-laterally. RESULTS: Right-handed children showed higher percentage of eye movements to right side when stimulated by tri-syllabic words, while left-handed children shown higher percentages of eyes movements to left side when stimulated by {{the same type of}} words. Left-handed children spent more time <b>in</b> recognizing <b>non-sense</b> mono-syllabic words. Hand laterality correlated with tri-syllabic word recognition performance. Age contributed to laterality development in nearly all cases, except in second test. CONCLUSION: Eye and facial movements were found to be related to left- and right-hand preference and specialization for language development, as well as visual, haptic perception and recognition in an age-dependent fashion in a complex process...|$|R
