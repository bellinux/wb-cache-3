5|$|Magi sacrifices {{herself to}} give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus {{the source of his}} power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta {{seemingly}} sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree. Pips {{and the rest of the}} fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes the seed that Crysta fed him to start growing wildly. Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> that has transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.|$|E
5|$|Such {{witnesses}} {{are those who}} cannot hear an idle intemperate expression, but they must immediately run to the magistrate to inform; or perhaps wrangling in their cups over night, {{when they were not}} able to speak or apprehend three words of common sense, will pretend to <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> the next morning, and think themselves very properly qualified to be accusers of their brethren. God be thanked, the throne of our King is too firmly settled to be shaken by the folly and rashness of every sottish companion.|$|E
5|$|While rescuing Sub-Commander T'Pol from {{a spatial}} anomaly, Captain Archer is {{infected}} by subspace parasites in his cerebral cortex, resulting in anterograde amnesia. His condition prevents him from forming new long term memories. This {{allows him to}} <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> prior to the accident, but any new memories fade within a few hours. It soon becomes clear that Archer is not fit for duty, and he is subsequently relieved of his command. T'Pol is granted a field commission to Captain, but the mission fails and Earth, alongside every other human colony, is destroyed by the Xindi weapon. The few surviving humans form a convoy, led by the Enterprise, which travels to the planet Ceti Alpha V.|$|E

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam, {{known in}} Japan as , , and , are three Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon {{franchise}} that are linked through evolution. Abra evolves into Kadabra after gaining enough experience in battle, and Kadabra evolves into Alakazam after being traded to another trainer. Created by Ken Sugimori, they {{first appeared in}} the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and later appear in subsequent sequels. They have appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the Psi Pokémon, using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its abilities unless rested. This behavior ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. Able to <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> since its birth, Alakazam's IQ is around 5000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Alakazam {{is also one of the}} handful of Pokémon to be capable of undergoing Mega Evolution, which increases its strength and makes it appearance undergo a few noticeable changes.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E

25|$|Sādhanā (Hindi: साधना, meaning Diligence): The poet {{explains}} that Sādhanā (diligence), {{the energy of}} Saṅkalpa (resolution), {{is the key to}} success. Aṣṭāvakra is constantly worried about how he would liberate his father from the bondage of Bandī. He realises that his pointing out of Kahola's mistakes and arguing with Kahola was not his prerogative, even though Kahola was wrong. He concludes that his arguments ended up angering Kahola which led to the unfortunate curse, anger being the dreadful enemy of man. Aṣṭāvakra decides to perfect the scriptures – the Vedas, Upavedas, Nyāya, Mīmāṃsā, Dharma, Āgama and other texts. He entreats Uddālaka for instruction in the scriptures. In a short time, Aṣṭāvakra masters all that Uddālaka teaches, helped by his Ekaśruti (ability to forever <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> that one has heard even once). Uddālaka calls Aṣṭāvakra to give him a final instruction about the Ātman, and orders him to go to the assembly of Janaka with the goal of liberating his father. Uddālaka decides to send the now-repentant Śvetaketu with Aṣṭāvakra, even though the former had insulted the latter in the past. Aṣṭāvakra determines that this task will be his Gurudakṣiṇā, and bows down to Uddālaka. Uddālaka blesses him to be victorious, and so does Sujātā. Aṣṭāvakra undertakes the ambitious journey to Mithilā, along with his uncle Śvetaketu.|$|E

[...] Lyrically, the song sees the protagonist reminisce about a winter romance, with lines such as, [...] "I remember us together / We promised that forever." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Maragret Wappler deemed it an [...] "ode to breakups" [...] and noted that the protagonist asks her willful boyfriend to remember [...] "the good times" [...] of their relationship. In the chorus, she sings [...] "Don't surrender, surrender, surrender", before asking him to remember their [...] "promise of forever". Lovato explained that the song is about [...] "a girl [...] has so much to say to the guy, and it feels like he's not listening, and she wants him to <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> that they had".|$|E

500|$|All of the novel's storylines concern {{memory in}} some sense or another. The most {{apparent}} confrontation of memory is {{on the part of}} Urania Cabral, who has returned to the Dominican Republic {{for the first time in}} 30 years, and is forced to confront her father and the traumas that led her to leave the country at 14. She was the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of the dictator himself, a sacrifice her father made to try to gain favor with the dictator again, a fact to which she alludes throughout the book, but which is only revealed at the very end: the book concludes with her recounting the memory of that night to her aunt and cousins, who never knew the true reason she left the country. When her aunt is surprised that she remembers all these details, she responds that while she forgets many things, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> about that night." [...] For Urania, forgetting the atrocities committed by the regime is unacceptable. Her father, on the other hand, is not capable of joining her in this process of remembering, since he has suffered a stroke and is not capable of speaking; however, Urania is angry that he chose to forget these things while he was still capable of acknowledging them.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his first}} {{summer in the}} Sierra as a shepherd, Muir wrote field notes that {{emphasized}} {{the role that the}} senses play in human perceptions of the environment. According to Williams, he speculated that the world was an unchanging entity that was interpreted by the brain through the senses, and, writes Muir, [...] "If the creator were to bestow a new set of senses upon us [...] [...] [...] we would never doubt that we were in another world[...] [...] [...] " [...] While doing his studies of nature, he would try to <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> he observed as if his senses were recording the impressions, until he could write them in his journal. As a result of his intense desire to remember facts, he filled his field journals with notes on precipitation, temperature, and even cloud formations.|$|E
2500|$|Damage to {{different}} areas of the brain can have varied effects on memory. [...] The temporal lobes, {{on the sides of the}} brain, contain the hippocampus and amygdala, and therefore have a lot to do with memory transition and formation. [...] Patients who have had injury to this area have experienced problems creating new long-term memories. [...] For example, the most studied individual in the history of brain research, HM, retained his previously stored long-term memory as well as functional short-term memory, but was unable to remember anything after it was out of his short-term memory. [...] A patient whose fornix was damaged bilaterally suffered severe anterograde amnesia but no effect on any other forms of memory or cognition. [...] In the fictional case of a patient with a cherry-sized tumor pressing on the temporal lobe of his brain, he temporarily suffered total retrograde amnesia, even after surgery was performed to remove the tumor. [...] However, with time, he was not only able to <b>remember</b> <b>everything</b> starting after the surgery, but childhood memories, up to age 12, all returned with clarity.|$|E
