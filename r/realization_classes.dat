40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the microplanner of PROVERB, {{a system that}} generates multilingual text from machine-found mathematical proofs. The main representational vehicle is the text structure proposed by Meteer. Following Panaget, we also distinguish between the ideational and the textual semantic categories, and use the upper model to replace the former. Based on this, a further extension is made to support aggregation before realization decisions are made. While our the framework of our macroplanner is kept language independent, our microplanner draws on language specific linguistic sources such as <b>realization</b> <b>classes</b> and lexicon. Since English and German are the first two languages to be generated and because the sublanguage of our mathematical domain is relatively limited, the upper model and the textual semantic categories are designed to cope with both languages. Since the work reported is still in progress, we also discuss open problems we are facing. 1 Introduction Most current na [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We report {{here on a}} {{significant}} new set of capabilities that we have incorporated into our language generation system MUMBLE. Their impact will be to greatly simplify the work of any text planner that uses MUMBLE as ita linguistics component since MUMBLE can now take {{on many of the}} planner's text organization and decision-making problems with markedly less hand-tailoring of algorithms in either component. Briefly these new capabilies are the following: (a) ATTACHMENT. A new processing stage within MUMBLE that allows us to readily implement the conventions that go into defining a text's intended prose style, e. g. whether the text should have complex sentences or simple ones, compounds or embedding*, reduced or full relative clauses, etc. Stylistic conventions are given as independently stated rules that can be changed according to the situation. (b) <b>REALIZATION</b> <b>CLASSES</b> are a mechanism for organizing both the transformational and lexical choices for linguistically realizing a conceptual object. The mechanism highlights the intentional criteria which control selection decisions. These criteria effectively constitute an ''inteiiingua' ' between planner and linguistic component, describing the rhetorical uses to which a text choice can be put while allowing its lingustic details to be encapsulated. The first part of our paper (sections 2 and 3) describes our general approach to generation; the rest illustrates the new capabilities through examples from the UMass COUNSELOR Project. This project is a large new effort to develop a natural language discourse system based on the HYPO system [Rissland & Ashley 1964], which acts as a legal advisor suggesting relevant dimensions and case references for arguing hypothetical legal cases in trade-secret law. At various relevant points we briefly contrast our work with that of Appelt, Danlois, Gabriel, Jacobs, Man...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{programmable}} logic devices using LUTs (Look-Up Tables) are presented. An LUT cascade directly implements logic functions {{by a series}} connection of LUTs, while an emulator emulates an LUT cascade by sequentially accessing LUTs. The LUT cascade is faster, but has a limited logic capability, while the emulator is slower, but has a higher logic capability. LUT cascades and emulators can be directly generated from the BDDs of target functions. Their performances are easy to estimate. The C-measure that show the complexity of LUT cascades are also presented. Functions with small C-measures have efficient LUT cascade and emulator <b>realizations.</b> <b>Classes</b> of functions that are suitable for LUT cascade and emulator realizations are also presented...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a {{research}} about the characteristics and tendencies of the socioeconomic dynamics that result from local organizations in Livramento-Rivera, cities located in the border Brazil-Uruguay. The theoretical framework is based on the concept of regional structured coherence: processes of production and consumption, supply and demand (of commodities and labor force), production and <b>realization,</b> <b>class</b> struggle and accumulation, culture and livelihood, remain tight in a kind of structural coherence, which result from the articulation of productive and social forces. The research strategy adopted was the intrinsic and instrumental case study. In the first phase of field study, we identified two clusters of projects: those lead by economic and political established groups; and those articu- lated as innovative social processes. In the second phase, we found new projects and the prevalence of initiatives dominated by economic rationality. The regional coherence structured by the actors in the border Livramento-Rivera follows a historical and cultural pattern of the region, that is, the expectation of big projects propitiated by external actors; and reproduces the historical and cultural pattern of the land structure of property. The organization of projects alternative to the development logic, through intertwining with technical and organizational support institutions, leads to market oriented organizational practices which undermine the production of distinct logics of organizing...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} Genetic Algorithm Optimisation Methods (GA) is studied {{and for the}} first time used to design high {{efficiency}} microwave class E power amplifiers (PAs) and associated load patch antennas. The difficulties of designing high efficiency PAs is that power transistors are highly non linear and classical design techniques only work for resistive loads. There are currently no high efficient and accurate procedures for design high efficiency PAs. To achieve simplified and accurate design procedure, GA and new design quadratic equations are introduced and applied. The performance analysis is based on linear switch models and non linear circuitry push-pull methods. The results of the analytical calculations and experimental verification showed that the power added efficiency (PAE) of the PAs mainly depend on the losses of the active device itself and are nearly independent on the losses of its harmonic networks. Hence, it has been proven that the cheap material PCB FR 4 can be used to design high efficiency class E PAs and it also shown that low Q factor networks have only a minor effect on efficiency, allowing a wide bandwidth to be obtained. In additional, a new procedure for designing class E PAs is introduced and applied. The active device (ATF 34143) is used. Good agreement was obtained between predicted analyses and the simulation results (from Microwave Office (AWR) and Agilent ADS software). For the practical <b>realization,</b> <b>class</b> E PAs were fabricated and tested using PCB FR 4. The practical results validate computer simulations and the PAE of the class E PAs are more than 71...|$|R

It would perhaps be harder to point out anything in SFL where there was a direct influence or borrowing from Tagmemics. We have more of recognition of parallel notions, like the notion of levels in Tagmemics, and the notion of rank in SFL, for example. Or one could compare the notion of the tagmeme in Tagmemics with the notion of a function and its <b>realization</b> by <b>class</b> in SFL. Tagmemics, unlike SFL, never moved in the direction of taking the paradigmatic as the primary organizing axis. So, that’s again a fundamental difference.|$|R
