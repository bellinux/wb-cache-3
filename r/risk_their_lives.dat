5|$|Katie is also {{patron of}} Fair Trees, the {{organisation}} {{that is trying}} to stop exploitation of cone pickers in Ambrolauri, Georgia, by the European Christmas tree industry. The local people in this region of Georgia are paid a pittance to <b>risk</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> climbing 30m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent to Christmas tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, no health insurance and very little pay; every year people are injured and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow and sell the only fair trade Christmas trees in the world (certified by the WFTO).|$|E
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to <b>risk</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E
5|$|After much research, Bella {{concludes that}} Edward is {{seemingly}} human, but has mysterious powers resembling to a vampire. He eventually confirms this, {{but says he}} and the other Cullens only consume animal blood. The pair fall in love, and Edward introduces Bella to his vampire family. Carlisle Cullen, the family patriarch, is a doctor working at the hospital in Forks. His wife is Esme, and Alice, Jasper, Emmett, and Rosalie, are their informally adopted children. Edward and Bella's relationship is soon put in jeopardy, when three nomadic vampires—James, Victoria, and Laurent—arrive in Forks. James, a tracker vampire with incredible hunting instincts, is instantly intrigued by Edward's protectiveness over a human, which incites him to hunt Bella for sport. Edward and the other Cullens <b>risk</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to protect Bella, but James tracks her to Phoenix, where she is hiding with Jasper and Alice. James lures Bella into a trap by falsely claiming that he is holding her mother hostage. James attacks Bella by biting her wrist, infecting her with vampire venom. After a ferocious battle, Edward subdues James just as the other Cullens arrive. Alice, Emmett, and Jasper kill James, decapitating and burning him, as Edward removes the venom from Bella's wrist, preventing her from turning into a vampire. In the aftermath of the battle, Bella has suffered a broken leg, and ends up in the hospital, but her mother comes in to visit. Upon returning to Forks, Edward accompanies Bella to the high school prom, where he refuses to grant her request that he would transform her into a vampire. As the couple dance, they are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is secretly watching, plotting revenge for her lover's death.|$|E
500|$|Not {{all of the}} Lithuanian populace {{supported}} the killings. Out of a population of close to 3,000,000 (80% of it ethnic Lithuanians), a few thousands took {{an active part in}} the killings while many hundreds <b>risked</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> sheltering the Jews. Israel has recognized 891 Lithuanians (as of [...] January 1, 2017) as Righteous Among the Nations for <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to save Jews during the Holocaust. In addition, many members of the Polish minority in Lithuania also helped to shelter the Jews. Lithuanians and Poles who <b>risked</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> saving Jews were persecuted and often executed by the Nazis.|$|R

25|$|Laura attends {{school with}} her younger sister, Carrie until the weather becomes too severe to {{permit them to}} walk {{to and from the}} school building. Blizzard after {{blizzard}} sweeps through the town over the next few months. Food and fuel become scarce and expensive, as the town depends on the trains to bring supplies but the frequent blizzards prevent the trains from getting through. Eventually, the railroad company suspends all efforts to dig out the train, stranding the town. For weeks, the Ingalls subsist on potatoes and coarse brown bread, using twisted hay for fuel. As even this meager food runs out, Laura's future husband Almanzo Wilder and his friend Cap Garland <b>risk</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to bring wheat to the starving townspeople – enough to last the rest of the winter.|$|E
25|$|Under these {{circumstances}} any political bargaining {{might well have}} been disastrous to Home Rule. Redmond desperately wanted and needed a rapid enactment of the Home Rule Act, and undoubtedly his words were a means to that end. He called on the country to support the Allied and British war effort and Britain's commitment under the Triple Entente; this was a calculated response to the situation principally in the belief that the attained measure of self-government would be granted in full after the war and to be in a stronger position to stave off a final partition of Northern Ireland. His added hope was that the common sacrifice by Irish nationalists and Unionists would bring them closer together, but above all that nationalists could not afford to allow Ulster Unionists to reap the benefit of being the only Irish to support the war effort, when they spontaneously enlisted in their 36th (Ulster) Division. He said Let Irishmen come together in the trenches and <b>risk</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> together and spill their blood together, and I say there is no power on earth that when they come home can induce them to turn as enemies upon one another.|$|E

25|$|Prazina {{played an}} {{integral}} role in defending Sarajevo {{during the early}} days of the siege. His forces cleared the streets of Serb paramilitaries and the areas under his control (most notably Alipašino polje) were considered impenetrable to the enemy. On a number of occasions he participated in actions orchestrated by the leaders of other military units more closely affiliated with the central government (such as Dragan Vikić), many of whom he had good relations with. He was proclaimed a hero by the Bosnian press while the Western media frequently portrayed him as a sort of Robin Hood figure. He was widely admired among the besieged Sarajevo populace, even appearing in contemporary patriotic songs. Prazina’s own actions helped enhance the myth that was being built around him. At a time when many Sarajevans had to <b>risk</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> for humanitarian food provisions, Prazina handed out candy to children on the street (albeit usually accompanied by the cameras of foreign news services). When Prazina captured a Serb sniper on the rooftop of a six-story building and accidentally caused the startled man to fall off the edge, the relatively uneventful story was transformed into a popular anecdote where Prazina personally threw one of the hated enemy sharpshooters to death.|$|E

500|$|Joyce {{tested the}} sea-ice on 18 April {{and found it}} firm, but the {{following}} day a blizzard from the south swept all the ice away. The ambience at Hut Point was gloomy, and the unrelieved diet of seal was depressing. This seemed particularly to affect Mackintosh, and on 8 May, despite the urgent pleadings of Joyce, Richards and Ernest Wild, he decided to risk the re-formed ice and walk to Cape Evans. Victor Hayward volunteered to accompany him. Joyce recorded in his diary: [...] "I fail to understand how these people are so anxious to <b>risk</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> again". Shortly after their departure a blizzard descended, and the two were never seen again.|$|E
