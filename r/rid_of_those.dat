Balthasar Báthory and his allies were captured and murdered in late August 1594. Sigismund also confiscated Andrew's Transylvanian estates. The Diet confirmed the prince's acts, convicting Andrew and his brother, Stephen, of treason.|$|E

The RATP would like to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{saturated}} branches in order to improve the network's efficiency.

40|$|Until recently, {{immigration}} policy was {{largely in the}} hands of a small group of bureaucrats, who strove desperately to fend off “offensive” peoples. Barbara Roberts explores these government officials, showing how they not only kept the doors closed but also managed to find a way to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who managed to break through their carefully guarded barriers. Robert’s important book explores a dark history with an honest and objective style...|$|R
5000|$|THX {{was about}} real {{things that were}} going on and the {{problems}} we're faced with. I realized after making THX that those problems are so real that most of us have to face those things every day, so we're {{in a constant state of}} frustration. That just makes us more depressed than we were before. So I made a film where, essentially, we can get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> frustrations, the feeling that everything seems futile.|$|R
25|$|A {{somewhat}} similar method {{had been previously}} used by John Landen in the Residual Analysis, published in London in 1758. Lagrange believed that he could thus get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> difficulties, connected {{with the use of}} infinitely large and infinitely small quantities, to which philosophers objected in the usual treatment of the differential calculus. The book is divided into three parts: of these, the first treats of the general theory of functions, and gives an algebraic proof of Taylor's theorem, the validity of which is, however, open to question; the second deals with applications to geometry; and the third with applications to mechanics.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{stated that}} the theme of Sivaji has been {{inspired}} from Shankar's previous films Gentleman (1993) and Mudhalvan (1999). The film deals {{with the concept of}} corruption and money laundering and how the film's protagonist employs methods to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> elements. Gopinath Rajendran of The New Indian Express compared the film's title character to Robin Hood for being a hero [...] "who takes from the rich and passes it on to the poor".|$|E

Smith believed that there was a special opportunity for game developers, [...] "for someone to come in and tell the stories that people want to know [...] Right now you have four bridges between developer and reader: Developer to PR, to journalist to reader.

500|$|In {{the first}} of three segments, the Simpsons visit Morocco (which Homer {{mistakes}} for Monaco). Homer purchases a severed monkey's hand that will grant four wishes, despite the vendor's warning that the wisher will experience grave misfortune. Back in Springfield, the family argues in how to use the wishes. Despite Marge's warning to heed the advice of the vendor in not using any of them, Maggie is granted that first wish: a new pacifier. Next, Bart wishes for the Simpsons to be rich and famous. His wish is granted, but the people immediately tire of the family's annoying antics, cheesy merchandise and celebrity treatment. Horrified by these wasteful wishes, Lisa wishes for world peace and Homer is furious. While all countries declare peace and destroy their weapons, the aliens Kang and Kodos realize the human race is [...] "ripe for the plucking" [...] and, armed with only a slingshot and a club, enslave the Earth. At the house, Homer blames Lisa and deems her own wishes to be selfish. She defends herself, claiming that Bart and Maggie's own wishes were also selfish as well and felt that hers was the only selfless one. Soon, Marge catches the people who are angry with the Simpsons and calls for a temporary truce in the family. Determined to make a wish that could not be twisted, she begs Homer {{to do the right thing}} and use the last wish to get rid of the aliens. Much to her dismay, Homer refuses and demands a turkey sandwich, but the turkey turns out to be a little too dry. With all the wishes used up, he goes to throw out the paw, but his neighbor Ned asks about it. Hoping to see Flanders suffer, Homer gladly hands the paw over. Ned's first wish is to [...] "Get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> awful aliens," [...] which is accomplished when Moe chases after Kodos with a board with a nail sticking out of it, then brings the aliens back to the flying saucer. Kodos laments their failed invasion, but Kang assures him that humanity is doomed: [...] they will end up in an arms race creating increasingly larger boards and larger nails, which will ultimately [...] "cause the human race to create a board with a nail in it so big to doom mankind." [...] Everyone celebrates and after Flanders wishes to [...] "spruce up the ol' homestead," [...] his house is converted into an opulent castle, making Homer envious. Lisa wakes up from her nightmare and begs Bart to keep her company. Bart sleepily complies after Lisa gives him a candy necklace. Bart then has a nightmare.|$|E

Doby's first game was on July 5 and before the game, Doby was {{introduced}} to his teammates by player-manager Lou Boudreau. [...] "One by one, Lou introduced me to each player. 'This is Joe Gordon,' and Gordon put his hand out. 'This is Bob Lemon,' and Lemon put his hand out. 'This is Jim Hegan,' and Hegan put his hand out. All the guys put their hand out, all but three. As soon as he could, Bill Veeck got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> three", Doby said. The following year later Veeck signed Satchel Paige to a contract, making the hurler the oldest rookie in major league history.|$|E
