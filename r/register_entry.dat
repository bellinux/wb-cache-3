2500|$|In 1999 Yad Vashem {{historian}} Avraham Milgram {{published a}} study where {{he asserted that}} [...] "the discrepancy between the reality and {{the myth of the}} number of visas granted by Sousa Mendes is great." [...] According to Milgram it was probably Harry Ezratty who was the first to mention in an article published in 1964 that Sousa Mendes had saved 30,000 refugees, of which 10,000 were Jews, a number which has since then been repeated automatically by journalists and academics. Milgram says that Ezratty, imprudently, took the total number of Jewish refugees who passed through Portugal and ascribed it to the work of Aristides de Sousa Mendes. To make his point Milgram cross checked the numbers from the Bordeaux ‘s visa <b>register</b> <b>entry</b> books with those of the HICEM reports and although he acknowledged that visas delivered in cities of Bayonne, Hendaye and Toulouse cannot be exactly determined, Milgram asserted that the numbers are exaggerated. Again in 2011, Milgram published a densely researched book, “Portugal Salazar and the Jews” and for a second time he asserted that: [...] "authors, especially those who wish to sing the praises of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, tend to overstate the number of visas with figures that not satisfy research criteria, but rather correspond to their wishful thinking".|$|E

50|$|The first Europeans {{to settle}} in North America {{continued}} the practice of establishing parish registers. Shortly after the establishment of Habitation, the arrival of Jesuit priests in 1615 facilitated the earliest beginnings of the parish register in New France.These earliest accounts entered into the register were recorded primarily within the Jesuits personal logs, and accounted exclusively {{for the number of}} deaths in the early settlement period of Quebec.However, over time the growing French population propagated the development and detailing of the parish <b>register.</b> <b>Entries</b> detailing births, marriages, baptisms and deaths were recorded and kept in the church of Notre Dame-de-la-Recouvrance. Unfortunately, in 1640 the church burned along with all parish records from 1620 to 1640.
