25|$|The loaded {{synaptic}} vesicles must dock near release sites, however docking {{is a step}} of {{the cycle}} that we know little about. Many proteins on synaptic vesicles and at release sites have been identified, however none of the identified protein interactions between the vesicle proteins and <b>release</b> <b>site</b> proteins can account for the docking phase of the cycle.

40|$|AbstractWhether contact of an axon with a {{dendrite}} is {{a necessary}} inductive signal for the assembly of functional presynaptic machinery is controversial. Combining FM 1 - 43 imaging with retrospective immunocytochemistry, we observe many functional synaptic vesicle (SV) <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> lacking postsynaptic specializations in cultured hippocampal neurons. These “orphan” <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> share the same exocytic machinery and mechanisms of endocytic recycling as mature synaptic sites. Moreover, quantitative analysis of FM 1 - 43 destaining at these orphan <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> reveals similar kinetics with slightly lower release probabilities. Time-lapse imaging of FM 1 - 43 reveals that orphans are generated by complete or partial mobilization of synaptic <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> that retain their functionality in transit. Orphan clusters fuse with existing synaptic <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> or form novel <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> onto dendrites.

40|$|The {{number of}} vesicles {{released}} at excitatory synapses {{and the number}} of <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> per synaptic connection are key determinants of information processing in the cortex, yet they remain uncertain. Here we show that the number of functional <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> {{and the number of}} anatomically identified synaptic contacts are equal at connections between spiny stellate and pyramidal cells in rat barrel cortex. Moreover, our results indicate that the amount of transmitter released per synaptic contact is independent of release probability and the intrinsic release probability is high. These prop-erties suggest that connections between layer 4 and layer 2 / 3 are tuned for reliable transmission of spatially distributed, timing-based signals. Synaptic weight is thought to be a primary determinant of neural computation. Accord-ing to the quantal hypothesis (1, 2) the effi-cacy of a connection is determined by the product of the probability of release, the num-ber of <b>release</b> <b>sites,</b> {{and the size of the}} postsynaptic response to a quantum of trans-mitter. Quantal parameters determine how reliably information is transmitted (3, 4), with higher rates of information transfer pos-sible at connections with larger numbers of <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> and higher (sustained) release probabilities (3). However, basic synaptic properties, such as number of functional and anatomical <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> per connection and the <b>release</b> probability per <b>site,</b> remain uncer-tain at most cortical synapses. Moreover, the number of vesicles released at individual syn-aptic contacts is controversial. Correlation of functional <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> and anatomicall...|$|R

25|$|The {{photoreceptor}} ribbon synapse {{is around}} 30nm in thickness. It sticks {{out into the}} cytoplasm around 200-1000nm and anchors along its base to the arciform density which is an electron dense structure that is anchored to the presynaptic membrane. The arciform density is located within the synaptic ridge, a small evagination of the presynaptic membrane. Hair cells lack an arciform density so the anchor of this ribbon {{is considered to be}} invisible by electron microscope. The ribbon’s surface has small particles that are around 5nm wide where the synaptic vesicles tether densely via fine protein filaments. There are multiple filaments per vesicle. There are also voltage gated L-type calcium channels on the docking sites of the ribbon synapse which trigger neurotransmitter release. Specifically, ribbon synapses contain specialized organelles called synaptic ribbons, which are large presynaptic structures associated in the active zone. They are thought to fine-tune the synaptic vesicle cycle. Synaptic ribbons are in close proximity to synaptic vesicles, which, in turn, are close to the presynaptic neurotransmitter <b>release</b> <b>site</b> via the ribbon.|$|E

Within bursts, mIPSCs had homogeneous amplitudes with a narrow Gaussian distribution. Analysis of successive event amplitudes revealed an interaction between consecutive IPSCs, indicating that bursts originate at single <b>release</b> <b>sites.</b> A mean receptor occupancy of 76 % was calculated. IPSCs within a burst were analyzed using nonstationary noise analysis. The results indicate that individual <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> differ in the number, unitary conductance, and peak opening probability of their postsynaptic channels. In addition, the IPSC decay kinetics were very different among <b>release</b> <b>sites.</b> Finally, a significant correlation was found between several pairs of single site synaptic parameters...|$|R

40|$|Local {{character}} of calcium release in cardiac myocytes, {{as defined by}} confocal recordings of calcium sparks, implies independent activation of individual calcium <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> based on ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel recruitment. We constructed virtual calcium <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> (vCRSs) composed of a variable number of RyR channels distributed in clusters {{in accordance with the}} experimentally observed cluster size distribution. The vCRSs consisted either of a single virtual calcium release unit, in which all clusters shared a common dyadic space, or of multiple virtual calcium release units containing one cluster each and having separate dyadic spaces. We explored the stochastic behavior of vCRSs to understand the activation and recruitment of RyRs during calcium sparks. RyRs were represented by the published allosteric gating model that included regulation by cytosolic Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. The interaction of Mg 2 + with the RyR Ca 2 +-binding sites and the refractory period of vCRSs were optimized to accord with the experimentally observed calcium dependence of calcium spark frequency. The Mg 2 +-binding parameters of RyRs that provided the best description of spark frequency depended on the number of RyRs assembled in the virtual calcium <b>release</b> <b>sites.</b> Adequate inhibitory effect of Mg 2 + on the calcium dependence of RyR open probability was achieved if the virtual calcium <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> contained at least three clusters. For the distribution of the number of open RyRs in evoked calcium sparks to correspond to the experimentally observed distribution of spark calcium release fluxes, at least 3 clusters had to share a common virtual calcium release unit, in which ~ 3 RyRs open to form an average spark. These results reconcile the small cluster size and stochastic placement of RyRs in the <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> with the estimates of the amount of RyR protein, volume density of calcium <b>release</b> <b>sites,</b> and the size of calcium <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> in rat cardiac myocytes...|$|R
40|$|Inter-pyramidal {{synaptic}} {{connections are}} characterized by {{a wide range of}} EPSP amplitudes. Although repeatedly observed at different brain regions and across layers, {{little is known about the}} synaptic characteristics that contribute to this wide range. In particular, the range could potentially be accounted for by differences in all three parameters of the quantal model of synaptic transmission, i. e. the number of <b>release</b> <b>sites,</b> <b>release</b> probability and quantal size. Here, we present a rigorous statistical analysis of the transmission properties of excitatory synaptic connections between layer- 5 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex. Our central finding is that the EPSP amplitude is strongly correlated with the number of estimated <b>release</b> <b>sites,</b> but not with the release probability or quantal size. In addition, we found that the number of <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> can be more than an order of magnitude higher than the typical number of synaptic contacts for this type of connection. Our findings indicate that transmission at stronger synaptic connections is mediated by multiquantal release from their synaptic contacts. We propose that modulating the number of <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> could be an important mechanism in regulating neocortical synaptic transmission...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{combination}} of Ca 2 + imaging and current-clamp recording in cultured cortical neurons {{was used to}} evaluate the reliability of coupling between the action potential and rises in Ca 2 + at distal <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> as a possible source of variability in CNS synaptic transmission. Local domains of enhanced Ca 2 + influx were observed at varicosities on axon collaterals. Functional assay of vesicle turnover using FM 1 - 43 and parallel electron microscopy confirmed that these varicosities were <b>release</b> <b>sites.</b> Single action potentials reliably (> 95 % of the time) resulted in a presynaptic Ca 2 + transient at all presumed <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> including those on distal collaterals. Variability in the amplitude of presynaptic Ca 2 + transients at individual boutons was estimated to be on average less than 20 %. We conclude that the coupling of somatic action potentials to distal <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> is generally a reliable process, although nonlinearity in the relationship between Ca 2 + influx and neurotransmitter release may amplify the effects of relatively small fluctuations in Ca 2 + influx...|$|R

50|$|While {{the use of}} {{multiple}} <b>release</b> <b>sites</b> for reintroducing captive-bred deer into the wild could improve the outlook of reintroduction by reducing competition among the individuals of the reintroduced species, several risks are associated with multiple <b>sites</b> of <b>release,</b> including the increased monetary cost of the reintroduction project, the reduced genetic diversity of the subpopulations, and the Allee effect, which involves a reduced proliferation rate in small populations.
