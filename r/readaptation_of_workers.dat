40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{the long term}} oncological and functional outcomes after <b>readaptation</b> <b>of</b> the dorsolateral peritoneal layer following pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) and cystectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS A randomised, single-center, single-blinded, two-arm trial was conducted on 200 consecutive cystectomy patients who underwent PLND and cystectomy for bladder cancer (<cT 4, cN 0, cM 0) between April 2006 and September 2009. Patients were randomised into two groups: group A with <b>readaptation</b> <b>of</b> the dorsolateral peritoneal layer (n= 100; 73 male, 27 female; median age 68 yrs, range 35 - 86 yrs) and group B without readapation (n= 100; 66 male, 34 female; median age 65 yrs, range 30 - 86 yrs). Regular postoperative follow-up was performed at our outpatient clinic. Median follow-up was 59 months (range 3 - 100 months), five patients were lost to follow-up in group A, seven in group B. Bowel function was evaluated using the validated Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index questionnaire and an institutional questionnaire regarding post-cystectomy outcome.

40|$|Rats were {{subjected}} to hypokinesia for two months and the contractile function of isolated papillary muscle was studied. Hypokinesia reduced significantly the isotonic contraction rate which depended on the ATPase activity of the myofibrils; it also reduced the rate and index of relaxation which depended on the functional capacity of the Ca(++) pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The maximum force of isometric contraction determined by the quantity of actomyosin bridges in the myofibrils did not change after hypokinesia. This complex of changes is contrary to that observed in adaptation to exercise when the rate of isotonic contraction and relaxation increases while the force of isometric contraction does not change. The possible mechanism of this stability of the contractile force during adaptation and <b>readaptation</b> <b>of</b> the heart is discussed...|$|R

A series of musical comedies {{starting}} with Der Dumme Gärtner aus dem Gebirge, oder Die zween Antons ("The Foolish Gardener from the Mountains, or The Two Antons"), premiered in July 1789. The comedy provided a vehicle for Schikaneder's comic stage persona. Another line of performances by the company involved fairy tale operas, starting with the 1789 premiere of Oberon, with music by Paul Wranitzky and a libretto that was a <b>readaptation</b> <b>of</b> Sophie Seyler's original libretto. This was followed by Der Stein der Weisen oder Die Zauberinsel in September 1790, a collaborative opera marked by the musical collaboration of Gerl, Schack, Schikaneder and Mozart.|$|R
40|$|An {{explicit}} exploration {{strategy is}} necessary in reinforcement learning (RL) to balance the need to reduce the uncertainty associated with the expected outcome of an action {{and the need to}} converge to a solution. This dependency is more acute in on-policy reinforcement learning where the exploration guides the search for an optimal solution. The need for a self-regulating exploration is manifest in knowledge transfer with the <b>readaptation</b> <b>of</b> past solutions. Tabu search (TS) is an adaptive memorybased exploration method that has been successful in combinatorial optimization problems by systematically exploring the search space and avoiding cycles through action inhibition. Tabu search has also been successfully used in genetic algorithms to ensure diversity and protect against premature convergence. This paper presents an approach to tabu search exploration in reinforcement learning.

50|$|One basic {{assumption}} of ecological modernization relates to environmental <b>readaptation</b> <b>of</b> {{economic growth and}} industrial development. On the basis of enlightened self-interest, economy and ecology can be favourably combined: Environmental productivity, i.e. productive use {{of natural resources and}} environmental media (air, water, soil, ecosystems), can be a source of future growth and development {{in the same way as}} labour productivity and capital productivity. This includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable supply chain management, clean technologies, benign substitution of hazardous substances, and product design for environment. Radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions, but also change the quality or structure of the industrial metabolism. In the co-evolution of humans and nature, and in order to upgrade the environment’s carrying capacity, ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play, which may entail conflicts with nature conservation.|$|R

40|$|The goal is {{to study}} the {{cerebral}} blood flow and psychometric characteristics in veterans of Afghanistan with early forms of chronic brain ischemia. Material and Methods. The study included 74 veterans of the Afghan war aged from 45 to 55 years: group 1, 28 people with NPNKM; Group 2 - 28 patients with circulatory encephalopathy stage 1; group 3 - 18 healthy persons. Doppler examination of cerebral vessels was carried out on the unit «Smart-lite». Reactive and personal anxiety of patients was assessed using the scale of Spielberger, evaluation {{of the quality of}} life through the test SAN. Determining the level of neuroticism and psychoticism was conducted by the scale of neuroticism and psy-choticism. Results: The study of cerebral blood flow in the Afghan war veterans showed signs of insolvency of carotid and carotid-basilar anastomoses, hypoperfusion phenomenon with the depletion of autoregulation, violation of the outflow of venous blood {{at the level of the}} microvasculature, accompanied by cerebral arteries spasm. More than 40 % of patients with early forms of chronic brain ischemia had high personal anxiety, low levels of well-being and activity, with maximum expression of dyscirculatory hypoxia. Conclusion. <b>Readaptation</b> <b>of</b> veterans of Afghanistan is accompanied by the changes in psychometric performance and the formation of the earliest forms of brain chronic ischemia associated with inadequate hemodynamics providing increased functional activity of the brain and the inefficiency of compensatory-adaptive reactions...|$|R
