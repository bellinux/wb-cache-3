40|$|The {{problems}} associated with training undergraduate human physiology students is not inherent in the discipline physiology, but in the curriculum design, implementation, and actual training. It is definitely unheard of to see a trainer who does not define for sure, the direction and functional application of the so-called training for trainees. Indeed, it is disheartening to note that despite all the advancements {{in the field of}} physiology, the training of physiology students in Nigeria does not include defined skill acquisition towards the operation, utilization, and maintenance of physiologically <b>relevant</b> <b>equipments,</b> accessories and consumables. These issues however, revolve around the intent of the training as enshrined in the curriculum.

50|$|Under present U.S. patent law, {{a method}} claim of a patent is infringed {{only when a}} single actor {{performs}} {{each step of the}} claim. Similarly, induced infringement of a method claim has the same requirement. System claims raise more complicated issues. One can make the system only by placing each element into combination with the others, but it is possible to be liable for using a system invention merely by commercially exploiting the system. Therefore, when both the <b>relevant</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturer and content provider utilize aspects of the invention in a method claim, whether infringement liability attaches to them may depend on both how the relevant claim is written and how licenses or sales are structured. This is illustrated in pending smartphone litigation, in which structure dictated the legal outcome.|$|E

40|$|Regeneration of dehumidizers is {{the most}} {{important}} stage in the working cycle of desiccant system. The lower regeneration temperature will be favorable for the energy efficiency of the whole system. Ultrasonic technology may be a promising method of dehydration applied to the regeneration of desiccant. As a non-heating method, the power ultrasonic may help lower the regeneration temperature and bring about energy savings. In the present paper, the mechanism of ultrasonic regeneration is set forth based on the ultrasonic theory as well as the mass transfer model in solid-gas and liquid-gas system. The recent studies related to ultrasonic dehydration are extensively reviewed, which is of significant reference to the study of desiccant regeneration assisted by power ultrasound. In addition, this work gives the basic ideas of ultrasonic dehydrator for solid/liquid-desiccant regeneration, which will promote the development of <b>relevant</b> <b>equipments.</b> Finally, some unexplored issues on this topic are addressed, including insight into the effects of ultrasonic on the regeneration, drying kinetics model for ultrasonic regeneration and the challenges possibly faced for the ultrasonic transducer development.

50|$|Equipment {{testing is}} an {{important}} part of dive accident and fatality analysis. As stakeholders in the community have different and occasionally conflicting needs when it comes to such testing, tests should be done as soon as possible to avoid degradation of evidence, and the testing should be done by impartial investigators, with all <b>relevant</b> <b>equipment</b> treated as evidence and legally acceptable procedures for controlling custody of the evidence. Currently the procedures for equipment testing after diving accidents are poorly standardized. Important procedural items include when testing should be conducted, who is responsible for the testing, what equipment should be tested and what tests should be done. This requires appropriate training of first responders and law enforcement agencies, availability of testing equipment, development of suitable test protocols, and funding to conduct the testing. Procedures for testing rebreathers differ from those for testing open circuit equipment.|$|E
