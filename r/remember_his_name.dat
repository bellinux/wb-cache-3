5|$|By then, Lincoln {{has broken}} {{out of the}} cold locker and called for backup. Frank rushes Fauxlivia to a {{hospital}} while Lincoln interrogates Dr. Silva. Dr. Silva reveals he was the last host, and implores Lincoln to <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> as he extracts the live queen beetle from his body and dies. Meanwhile, Frank discovers Fauxlivia is pregnant; the adrenaline had induced morning sickness symptoms. At the hospital, the fetus is found to be six weeks old. Frank realizes he was away at that time, accuses Fauxlivia of sleeping with another man, and leaves her. Fauxlivia cries to herself, realizing her child's father is Peter (Joshua Jackson) from her time in the prime universe.|$|E
25|$|The next year, the Eagles again {{earned a}} wild-card spot and then won their first post-merger playoff game over the Chicago Bears before falling to Tampa Bay. Following that season, the Giants traded Pisarcik {{to them for}} a draft choice. He would finish {{his career as a}} backup to Ron Jaworski five years later. His entire NFL career is usually {{embodied}} in that play, and while he is sometimes reluctant to talk about it, he admits that at least people <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> thanks to it.|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC Wozniak was {{piloting}} crashed {{soon after}} takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California. The plane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, went through two fences, {{and crashed into}} an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers—then-fiancée Candice Clark, his brother, and his girlfriend—were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for five weeks after the crash from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> in the hospital or {{the things he did}} after he was released. He would later state that Apple II computer games are what helped him regain his memory. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.|$|E

500|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer is {{disturbed}} that Mr. Burns {{can never}} <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> even after {{working for him}} for ten years. He takes a suggestion from Marge and sends Mr. Burns {{a box of chocolates}} with a family picture underneath the candy; however, Mr. Burns and Smithers are not interested in the one candy covering Homer's face and discard the box. As a result, Burns writes a [...] "thank you" [...] card only to Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, further angering Homer.|$|E
500|$|On September 28, in a MSNBC Town Hall, Johnson {{was asked}} by Chris Matthews to name a world leader he respected, he tried to name Vicente Fox, a former President of Mexico, but could not <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> The {{following}} day, he tweeted, [...] "It's been almost 24 hours...and I still can't {{come up with a}} foreign leader I look up to." [...] Later in a CNN interview, he expanded upon his reluctance to endorse political leaders, [...] "I held {{a lot of people in}} this country on pedestals and then I get to meet them up front and personal and I find out that they're all about getting re-elected, that they're not about issues, a lot of empty suits that I held up on pedestals." ...|$|E
500|$|K' is {{a former}} subject of an {{experiment}} made by the NESTS organization. He stands 183cm (6'0") tall and weighs 65kg (143 lbs). In their attempt to create powerful soldiers, NESTS kidnapped K′ and injected him with DNA from the fighter Kyo Kusanagi, giving him his pyrokinetic skills. Unlike Kyo, K' is only able to create fire from his right hand, which he is sometimes unable to control. He wears a glove to protect his body from being burned accidentally. During the program, NESTS repressed K′s memories, and he was made {{to believe that he}} was Krizalid's clone. While in NESTS, K′ became enraged with how the organization played with human lives, and escaped to recover his memories. As he could not even <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> K' decided to destroy NESTS in order to stop their experiments. K's fighting style is simply called Pure Violence which involves him using the fire from his right hand along with martial arts moves.|$|E

500|$|King Richard IV of England and XII of Scotland and his Queen Gertrude of Flanders {{have two}} sons: Harry, Prince of Wales {{and his younger}} brother Prince Edmund. Of the two, Harry is by far his father's favourite, the King barely {{acknowledging}} his second son's existence. It is a running gag throughout the series that Edmund's father cannot even <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> However, despite his mostly dismissive attitude toward his second son, the series' finale makes it clear that the King loves Edmund as much as Harry: on Edmund's deathbed, the King does his best to console him and has the entire court drink a toast in his honour. In the third episode, when Edmund becomes the Archbishop of Canterbury and helps his father to secure some land before the church, the King acknowledges Edmund as his son, embraces him and even mentions to the Queen that he has [...] "turned out well".|$|E
500|$|There are {{two major}} {{instances}} of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro {{is dealing with the}} [...] "stink spirit." [...] The stink spirit was actually a river spirit, but it was so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go. The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of human's need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but don't think about how it can affect other living things.|$|E
500|$|Bart Simpson {{is one of}} Krusty's biggest fans. In {{the episode}} [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (Season 1, Episode 12) he {{declared}} [...] "I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings" [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to {{the air with a}} comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately forget about it, presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not even <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E

I don't believe that there was any {{connection}} between `Abdu'l-Bahá and The Prophet. But {{he told me that he}} thought of the `Abdu'l-Bahá all through. He said that he was going to write another book with '`Abdu'l-Bahá as the center and all the contemporaries of '`Abdu'l-Bahá speaking. He died before he wrote it. He told me definitely that [...] The Son of Man was influenced by '`Abdu'l-Bahá." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once inside Bellona, an engineer, Tak Loufer, who {{was living}} a few miles outside of the city when the initial {{destruction}} happened, meets and befriends him. Tak has moved to Bellona and stayed there ever since. Upon learning that he cannot <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> Tak gives him a nickname—the Kid. Throughout the novel he is {{also referred to as}} [...] "Kid", [...] "Kidd", and often just [...] "kid." [...] Next Tak takes Kid on a short tour of the city. One stop is at a commune in the city park, where Kid sees two women reading a spiral notebook. When Kid looks at it, we see what he reads: The first page contains, word-for-word, the first sentences of Dhalgren. As he reads further, however, the text diverges from the novel's opening.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a forest}} somewhere outside the city, the protagonist meets {{a woman and}} they have sex. After, he tells her that he has [...] "lost something"—he cannot <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> She leads him to a cave and tells him to enter. Inside, he finds long loops of chain fitted with {{miniature}} prisms, mirrors, and lenses. He dons the chain and leaves the cave, {{only to find the}} woman {{in the middle of a}} field, turning into a tree. Panicked, he flees. Many characters in the novel wear the same sort of “optic chain”; all are loath to discuss how they came to do so. On a nearby road, a passing truck stops to pick him up. The trucker, hauling artichokes, drops him off at the end of a suspension bridge leading across the river to Bellona.|$|E
60|$|Bill {{experienced}} a startle of warm surprise. She had <b>remembered</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> from <b>his</b> union card. The next moment the superintendent had been {{plucked from the}} doorway raving about rights under the law, and the girls were deserting their machines. During {{the rest of that}} short and successful strike, Bill constituted himself Mary Condon's henchman and messenger, and when it was over returned to the University to be Freddie Drummond and to wonder what Bill Totts could see in such a woman.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} they had been friends since their first day at Unseen University, Ridcully cannot decide what to call the Dean and {{eventually}} <b>remembers</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> is Henry (over 'Archchancellor', because that 'was out of the question', 'Dean' was 'too obvious an insult', 'Two Chairs' was 'ditto with knobs on' and 'ungrateful, backstabbing, slimy bastard' took too long to say.) By {{the end of the}} novel Ridcully is comfortable enough with his presence to refer to him as 'Dean' - which Henry lets slide.|$|R
50|$|He is then {{confronted by}} Pios and Elwyn, {{questioning}} him on what happened. He says he cannot remember and only vaguely <b>remembers</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> The two introduce themselves {{to him and}} he finds both his hands have two strange rings. They will not come off his hands as Pios tries to investigate the rings. The two then explain that the rings could possibly be the Twin Dragon Rings, the legendary rings of power. Discarding the thought, Pios investigates more on the rings as Xion falls asleep.|$|R
2500|$|The Spanish Church {{approved}} of the White Terror and cooperated with the rebels. According to Antony Beevor: [...] "Cardinal Gomá stated that 'Jews and Masons poisoned the national soul with absurd doctrine'... A few brave priests put their lives at risk by criticizing nationalist atrocities, {{but the majority of}} the clergy in nationalist areas revelled in their new-found power and the increased size of their congregations. Anyone who did not attend Mass faithfully was likely to be suspected of 'red' tendencies. Entrepreneurs made a great money selling religious symbols... It was reminiscent of the way the Inquisition's persecutions of Jews and Moors helped make pork such {{an important part of the}} Spanish diet." [...] One witness in Zamora said: [...] "Many priests acted very badly. The bishop of Zamora in 1936 was more or less an assassinI don't <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> He must be held responsible because prisoners appealed to him to save their lives. All he would reply was that the Reds had killed more people than the falangist were killing." [...] Nevertheless, the Nationalists killed at least 16 Basque nationalist priests (among them the arch-priest of Mondragon), and imprisoned or deported hundreds more. Several priests who tried to halt the killings and at least one priest who was a Mason were killed.|$|E
2500|$|Periods {{of mental}} illness {{continued}} throughout the king's life. During one in 1393, he could not <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> {{and did not know}} he was king. When his wife came to visit, he asked his servants who she was and ordered them to take care of what she required so that she would leave him alone. During an episode in 1395–96 he claimed he was Saint George and that his coat of arms was a lion with a sword thrust through it. At this time, he recognized all the officers of his household, but did not know his wife nor his children. Sometimes he ran wildly through the corridors of his Parisian residence, the Hôtel Saint-Pol, and to keep him inside, the entrances were walled up. In 1405, he refused to bathe or change his clothes for five months. His later psychotic episodes were not described in detail, perhaps because of the similarity of his behavior and delusions. Pope Pius II, who was born during the reign of Charles VI, wrote in his Commentaries that there were times when Charles thought that he was made of glass, and this caused him to protect himself in various ways so that he would not break. He reportedly had iron rods sewn in his clothes, so that he would not shatter if he came into contact with another person. [...] This condition {{has come to be known}} as glass delusion.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Burns' {{state of}} mind {{is the subject of}} {{frequent}} jokes on the show. At times, he appears to be completely removed from reality and modern conventions. He continually fails to recognize Homer Simpson or <b>remember</b> <b>his</b> <b>name,</b> even though many of the recent major events in Mr. Burns' life have involved Homer in some way. Mr. Burns is, for the most part, unaware of the townspeople's general dislike of him. He also displays mannerisms which are considered outdated, such as practicing phrenology, writing with a quill pen, and using an antique view camera to take photographs. He is also angered when Springfield Elementary children mock his dated car, saying it was [...] "the first car to outrun a man!" [...] Mr. Burns refers to many celebrities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the present tense, assuming they are still alive. In [...] "Homer at the Bat", Mr. Burns instructs Smithers to recruit dead-ball era players, such as Honus Wagner and Cap Anson for the plant's softball team, and has to be told that all of them died long ago. He also once rewarded Homer for being the first to arrive at work with a ticket to the 1939 World's Fair. However, despite his obvious senility and social ineptitude, Mr. Burns is an extraordinarily clever businessman, as he has lost his fortune several times, only to regain it a very brief time later. In the episode [...] "The Old Man and Lisa", Mr. Burns loses his fortune, and regains it by opening a recycling plant, which allows him to regain his nuclear power plant. Additionally, in the episode [...] "The Seemingly Never-Ending Story", Mr. Burns loses both his fortune and nuclear power plant to the Rich Texan after losing a scavenger hunt, but eventually gains both back after a series of events that includes him briefly working at Moe's Tavern.|$|E
