5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} untouchability to {{be wrong}} and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or her background, stated Gandhi, {{has a right to}} choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.|$|E
5|$|Princess Victoria {{soon came}} to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits. Some historians have conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria may have {{stemmed from a}} personal belief that his wife Elizabeth was secretly the illegitimate child of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have stemmed from this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim of descent from the ancient kings of Ireland. <b>Regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing power of this group within British society.|$|E
5|$|<b>Regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{personal}} style, Cubitt {{was credited}} by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, with achieving the desired results. The 38th Division had mounted a successful but very costly attack in April 1918; under Major General Cubitt's command, the division mounted two further major operations, at the Battle of Albert in August and Battle of Cambrai in October. Both were successful, with the division demonstrating flexibility, improvisation, {{and a highly}} effective tactical doctrine. The division's performance at Cambrai was sufficiently good to rank {{it as one of}} the most effective British divisions during the Hundred Days Offensive.|$|E

Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.|$|E
5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. <b>Regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
5|$|In a {{twist on}} The Mansion of Happiness, McLoughlin Brothers and Parker Brothers {{released}} several {{games in the}} late 1880s based on the then-popular Algeresque rags to riches theme. Games such as Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded, Messenger Boy, Game of the Telegraph Boy, and The Office Boy allowed players to emulate the successful capitalist. Players began these games as company underlings, newbies, or gofers, and, with luck, won {{the game with a}} seat in the President's Office (rather than a seat in Heaven, as in The Mansion of Happiness) or as Head of the Firm. In Parker Brothers' The Office Boy, spaces designating carelessness, inattentiveness, and dishonesty sent the player back on the track while spaces designating capability, earnestness, and honesty advanced him toward the goal. Such games reflected the belief that the enterprising American– <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> background, humble or privileged– would be rewarded under the American capitalist system, and insinuated that success was equated with increased social status via the accumulation of wealth.|$|E

5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2009–10 season Bogosian was {{bothered by}} an injury. During {{a game against}} the Ottawa Senators on October 31, 2009, Bogosian fell behind his team's net; with his left hand lying on the net's iron frame along the ice, another player fell on top of him. The impact broke his left thumb and injured his wrist. Though he did not miss any time from the injury, it had an effect on his {{offensive}} play; Bogosian was perceived to be more hesitant with the puck, choosing to pass it more often than shooting. In the first 17 games of the season, he had scored 8 goals, then went 29 contests without scoring. In the final 64 games, he only scored 2 goals. After he recovered, Bogosian admitted he did not play at his full capacity, but had decided not to disclose the injury to the team until the season finished in April 2010. <b>Regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> injury, Bogosian only missed one game throughout the season, a game on March 14 against the Phoenix Coyotes. Even with these setbacks, Bogosian set career highs for games played (81), goals (10), assists (13) and points (23). The 10 goals he scored tied a team record for most by a defenseman in a season, first set by Yannick Tremblay in 1999–2000, the Thrashers' inaugural year. He also set a team record with 196 hits. Again the Thrashers missed the playoffs.|$|E
