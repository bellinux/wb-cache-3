25|$|Qualitative data {{analysis}} contains reviewing, summarizing, generalizing and interpreting data {{in an appropriate}} and accurate way. It is to describe and explain the phenomena or social worlds being studied. One {{of the most important}} steps in the qualitative <b>research</b> <b>process</b> is analysis of data. Analyzing qualitative data also requires researchers’ patience. There are two different analytical procedures: Meaning and discovery-Focused approaches. Meaning-focused approaches emphasize meaning comprehension. In other words, try to understand the subjective meaning of experiences for the participants, instead of placing those meanings into researchers’ own conceptions. Discovery-focused techniques aim to establish patterns and connections among elements of data. However, no matter which procedure is used, it is essential to apply an effective system for retrieving data because of the identity of qualitative {{data analysis}}, which is exploring data progressively.|$|E
25|$|In psychology, {{qualitative}} research {{has come to}} be defined as research whose findings are not arrived at by statistical or other quantitative procedures. Qualitative research is often said to be naturalistic. That is, its goal is to understand behaviour in a natural setting. Two other goals attributed to {{qualitative research}} are understanding a phenomenon {{from the perspective of the}} research participant and understanding the meanings people give to their experience. It attempts to do this by using so-called naturalistic methods—interviewing, observation, ethnography, participant observation and focus groups. Each of these methods seeks to understand the perspective of the research participant within the context of their everyday life. This means that the researcher is concerned with asking broad questions that allow the respondent to answer in their own words. These methods allow the researcher to try to qualify their understanding during the <b>research</b> <b>process</b> through further probing questions. In addition, a method such as observation allows the researcher to observe people within natural settings—particularly those in public places. This has resulted in greater understanding of people's behaviours in, for example, lifts, public transport, and queues.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Brown and Blair {{as depicted in}} the script was based on that between Aaron Altman and Tom Grunick, the characters portrayed by Albert Brooks and William Hurt in Broadcast News. Morgan wanted to set the entire film in the 12 days {{following the death of}} John Smith, but the time frame was widened because the Labour Party's disastrous result at the 1992 general election was [...] "absolutely crucial" [...] to the relationship and motives of the main characters; Morgan had to show the moment Blair decided to aim to become leader of the party. Morgan and the producers engaged in a lengthy <b>research</b> <b>process</b> during script writing and editing, interviewing 40 to 50 of Brown and Blair's closest friends and advisors, as well as aides involved in the 1992 and 1997 elections. Significantly, many of the facts in the film are based on the first three chapters of James Naughtie's book The Rivals: The Intimate Portrait of a Political Marriage. The film briefly adopted The Rivals as a working title, but soon reverted to The Deal. Another title considered by Frears was Bambi and Stalin, based on a line in a speech given by Blair in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{what they}} had done with other social issues and in {{developing}} their curriculum, the CTW researched the topic of death and how preschoolers understand it. [...] The first step in their <b>research</b> <b>process</b> was to assemble a team of experts, led by CTW research director Lewis Bernstein, in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion. [...] The team advised the show's writers and producers how to handle the topic, in what they called [...] "a curriculum bath"; Bernstein described it in this way: [...] "We bring in the experts to allow the writer to soak in expertise. [...] We in Research bring in people to provide the information, and then the artistry of the writer takes over, as they integrate what they've heard". [...] The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a sense of closure about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] They decided not to focus on how Mr. Hooper died, since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children's fears about death. [...] They chose to deal with his death in a single episode, and convey simple messages like: [...] "Mr. Hooper is dead; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all". [...] Gikow stated that the episode they created was an example of the writers and producers' skills as educators as well as entertainers.|$|E
