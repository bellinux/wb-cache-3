5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop <b>rotation</b> <b>and</b> the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop <b>rotation</b> <b>and</b> selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E

5|$|The 1946 Philadelphia Athletics {{season began}} with Christopher {{the subject of}} a {{possible}} trade. The Athletics tried to obtain Johnny Lindell from the Yankees, but they wanted Christopher in return. Mack refused to give him up, and as a result the trade never materialized. He began the season in the starting <b>rotation,</b> <b>and</b> was the opening day starting pitcher in a 5–0 loss against the Yankees. Over {{the first part of the}} season, Christopher again split time between the <b>rotation</b> <b>and</b> the bullpen. In a 7–3 loss to the Indians on July 18, Christopher could not get out of the second inning, allowing five earned runs. After this, he did not pitch for a month, and spent the rest of the season as an occasional reliever. He finished the season with five wins, seven losses and a 4.30 ERA. After the season ended, Christopher began contemplating retirement from baseball. He had lost 10 pounds in the final months of the season and was light to begin with, and decided that he would retire if he could not gain the weight back over the winter.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror.

40|$|Geometric {{computing}} with three-dimensional <b>rotations</b> <b>and</b> orientations is {{a fundamental}} issue in three-dimensional computer graphics. Our approach was inspired by affine geometry and coordinatefree geometric programming. The basic idea of affine geometry {{is to make a}} distinction between points and vectors. The relation between orientations <b>and</b> <b>rotations</b> is analogous to the relation between points and vectors. Similarly to affine geometry, we argue that <b>rotations</b> <b>and</b> orientations should be represented differently in geometric computing. We show that, in three-dimensional space, unit quaternions (or rotation matrices) cannot parameterize rotations without singularity, but rotation vectors can. Conversely, rotation vectors cannot parameterize orientations without singularity, but unit quaternions (or rotation matrices) can. From these observations, we suggest that orientations should be represented by unit quaternions (or <b>rotation</b> matrices) <b>and</b> <b>rotations</b> should be represented by three-dimensional vectors. Furthermore, a set of operations are identified for combining <b>rotations</b> <b>and</b> orientations. Those operations are geometrically meaningful and independent of the choice of reference coordinate frames...|$|R

5|$|Christopher {{began the}} 1944 Philadelphia Athletics {{season as a}} member of the {{starting}} rotation along with Don Black, Lum Harris and Bobo Newsom. However, he did split time in the first half of the year between the starting <b>rotation</b> <b>and</b> the bullpen. Among those appearances was a 16-inning match against the Chicago White Sox; Christopher pitched the final four innings, losing 4–2 after Hal Trosky stole home plate. On July 14, he pitched a 4–3 victory against the Senators, helping his team defeat Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn for the first time in three years. After starting the season with a 4–10 record, on July 22 Christopher went on a seven-game winning streak that culminated with a 5–1 complete game victory over the White Sox. He finished the season with a 14–14 record, 84 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.97. After the season ended, Christopher and others went on a barnstorming tour throughout the United States, ending in Wenatchee, Washington.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne enjoyed {{another game}} {{at home on}} February 14 against the La Salle Explorers. Ron Everhart sought a new {{strategy}} for his team, which was struggling in conference play. In this game, La Salle was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players. Duquesne ran a 10–40 pattern, in which two squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad. At first, Duquesne fell behind by 14points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired. With La Salle fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal <b>rotation</b> <b>and</b> {{went on to win}} 103–82. Bill Clark scored a career high 34points, and also surpassed the 1,000point mark.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 Michelson {{proposed}} {{the use of}} optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907.

By 1975, when the second had been {{defined in terms of}} a physical phenomenon rather than the earth's <b>rotation</b> <b>and</b> Einstein's assertion that the speed of light was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light {{as the basis for the}} definition of the metre.

5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop <b>rotation</b> <b>and</b> fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

Keen to earn praise from his consultants, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley), Oliver claims Penny's research as his own, and is awarded her place in an operation. He is promoted to F2 level, and betrays Penny further by revealing her affair with Scott, which results in her failing her cardiothoracic <b>rotation</b> <b>and</b> being moved to the AAU.

40|$|Global image {{orientation}} techniques aim at estimating camera <b>rotations</b> <b>and</b> {{positions for}} {{a whole set of}} images simultaneously. One of the main arguments for these procedures is an improved robustness against drifting of camera stations in comparison to more classical sequential approaches. Usually, the process consists of computation of absolute <b>rotations</b> <b>and,</b> in a second step, absolute positions for the cameras. Either the first or both steps rely on the network of transformations arising from relative orientations between cameras. Therefore, the quality of the obtained absolute results is influenced by tensions in the network. These may e. g. be induced by insufficient knowledge of the intrinsic camera parameters. Another reason can be found in local weaknesses of image connectivity. We apply a hierarchical approach with intermediate bundle adjustment to reduce these effects. We adopt efficient global techniques which register image triplets based on fixed absolute camera <b>rotations</b> <b>and</b> scaled relative camera translations but do not involve scene structure elements in the fusion step. Our variant employs submodels of arbitrary size, orientation and scale, by computing relative <b>rotations</b> <b>and</b> scales between - <b>and</b> subsequently absolute <b>rotations</b> <b>and</b> scales for - submodels and is applied hierarchically. Furthermore we substitute classical bundle adjustment by a structureless approach based on epipolar geometry and augmented with a scale consistency constraint...|$|R

Caldwell was used mainly as a batting practice pitcher, appearing in just three games in his major league career. During one practice, Caldwell fractured Wally Pipp's skull with a high fastball, allowing Lou Gehrig to assume Pipp's place in the starting lineup.|$|E
