Tedious preventive maintenance tasks, inapplicable solutions and significant start up costs {{are the major}} limitations of this strategy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to improve the analysis efficiency of reliability centered maintenance without trading off quality by its integration with artificial intelligence. In order to achieve key performance indicators for the plant management, we incorporated rule based reasoning along with the case based reasoning. While only case based technique was introduced previously, our approach <b>reduces</b> <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks</b> and also provides support in predicting equipment needs, by applying artificial neural networks.

We present PressureText, a text-entry technique for a pressure augmented mobile phone. In a study comparing PressureText to MultiTap, {{we found that}} despite limited visual feedfback for pressure input, users overall performed equally well with PressureText as with MultiTap. Expertise was a determining factor for improved performance with PressureText. Expert users showed a 33. 6 % performance gain over novices. Additionally, expert users were 5 % faster on average with PressureText than MultiTap, suggesting that pressure input is a valuable augmentation to mobile phone keypads...|$|R
40|$|Biological patent {{analysts are}} often faced with {{querying}} multiple databases of sequence and text. After retrieving the query results, the results must be analyzed by reviewing patents and applications {{in a form}} of manual data reduction. Once families are identified for final analysis, the analyst must expand back out, looking at the members of those patent families. Again, sequence and text is reviewed manually, not algorithmically. One way for patent analysts {{to reduce the number}} of <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks</b> performed is through the creation of macros. Such macros can be used for time-consuming tasks like global formatting, searching and replacing within a document, formatting extracted sequences into FASTA, or even converting three-letter amino acid code into single-letter code. Another way for a patent analyst to <b>reduce</b> <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks</b> in biosequence patent analysis is through an alliance between biological patent analysts and bioinformaticians. Such an alliance could result in the development of tools that focus on these types of <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks.</b> A bioinformatician is skilled in looking for solutions to various <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks.</b> Such a solution could even be packaged and deployed to those colleagues who would benefit from access to such a time-saving program. Finding a way to automate <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks</b> will free the patent analyst to spend more time on intellectual analysis of the results.

40|$|An {{opportunity}} {{was identified}} {{to improve the}} traditional landing gear design process. Especially in the conceptual design phase, lots of man-hours are consumed by making the same calculations over and over again, for different concepts. Often, an existing gear is therefore used as initial starting point, to simplify the design process. This results in little technical progress. Additionally, integration between the different disciplines involved is sub-optimal {{which can lead to}} inconsistent results. In this thesis, an optimization framework is described that can do the preliminary design of a landing gear fully automated. It ensures that communication between disciplines is respected by adding a top-level optimizer which is in charge of changing the design variables. The realization of this framework greatly <b>reduces</b> the <b>repetitive</b> <b>tasks</b> in the design phase of a landing gear. This makes the design phase less limited to traditional architectures while leaving more time to evaluate non-standard solutions that may be lighter, safer and/or cheaper.

40|$|Participation {{in social}} {{networks}} has surpassed all other online activities {{to be one}} of the top internet activities. Information disclosure on social networks comes with the risk of this information falling into wrong hands leading to privacy problems. In this thesis, the problem of privacy in social networks is researched in two aspects. This thesis firstly finds solutions and proposes enhancements to the existing and known privacy leaks. Secondly, advanced ways of inferring user and friends' private information, utilizing user and his friends public information, are proposed. 		 		With the current privacy settings not mapping to the user's mental model of privacy settings, the proposed privacy aware intended audience selection model assists user in finding the right audience for the information to be posted on social network. According to a recent finding more than half of the online adults use multiple social networking sites. User is assisted in <b>reducing</b> <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> of setting privacy across multiple social networks using proposed privacy scoring model in which scores once calculated can be used on all social networks that the user and his friends share. This thesis is the first to provide a detailed account of attribute inference abilities from the follower and following subnetworks of the user, which are partial views of the user's whole network. This work highlights the increased risk of user attribute inference, as a partial view of the user's network and a small percentage (20 %) of friend's public attributes can lead to inference of user's private attributes. In the research on health information disclosure, the research work demonstrates the need to understand the context of information before drawing general health disclosure trends, with the work also demonstrating the privacy leaks prevalent due to the disclosures from the user himself and from his friends on social networks. Utilizing only a single user's public information, containing his friends' comments, likes and wall posts, friends' response prediction model has been successful in predicting the response by friends on user's posts along with predicting friends' latent affinity towards topics of interest. This amounts to privacy leaks of friends. This thesis uses datasets of popular social networks such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter in demonstrating the applicability of all the proposed models through extensive experiments...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{the focus}} is not in {{designing}} any antenna for a particular wireless application but {{a study on the}} existing antennas has been made and the methods by which their performance can be improved. The antennas chosen are the standard designs, ones which are most rampantly used in the wireless applications like the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi & Wireless LAN applications in the frequency range of 2. 45 GHz. An antenna was also designed taking into consideration the GSM band. The bandwidth of the antenna has been given special attention since data rate criterion have to be met apart from the resonant frequency. A circularly polarised antenna was also designed that could be optimised for GPS applications. Further in the thesis a Patch antenna calculator has been designed in MATLAB to <b>reduce</b> the <b>repetitive</b> <b>task</b> of finding the antenna dimension for a rectangular microstrip patch. A GUI has been developed using MATLAB GUIDE tool to provide a user-friendly interface. The calculations are done in the background for several antenna parameters using the cavity model for microstrip patch antenna. This GUI would be helpful in getting the basic idea about a few basic antenna parameters before the design, simulation and parametric analysis in software like CST Microwave Studio, HFSS and IE 3 D. To miniaturize the antennae further a metamaterial based approach has been incorporated. A comparative analysis of different conventional and metamaterial based microstrip patch antenna. A study of SRR based microstrip antenna and their equivalent circuits have been carried out. A unit cell of SRR has also been designed for the frequency of 10. 25 GHz. Using such metamaterial unit cell a miniaturized microstrip patch antenna can be realised as per our requirements...|$|R

40|$|Surface Energy Balance Interface Software (SEBALIS) {{has been}} created using Visual Basic 6. 0 program, which can simplify the {{existing}} system and the formulation, so as to minimize the use of software products that are commercially available. Specifically, the novel framework of SEBALIS facilitates data processing by <b>reducing</b> <b>repetitive</b> and complex <b>tasks</b> implemented with the ErMapper 7. 1 software. The climate variables calculated in SEBALIS are always saved {{in such a way}} that they can be reprocessed using the ArcView GIS 3. 3 software. The significance of this study lies in the combination of these tools is useful for obtaining information on the distribution of urban climate variables such as surface temperature (Ts), air temperature (Ta), net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), latent heat flux (L), sensible heat flux (H), and evapotranspiration (Etp) for each land cover in urban areas. The scheme of SEBALIS is composed of Input Design, Structure of Input Output Data System, Output, User Interface, Menu Structure of Surface Energy Balance Model, and Software User Manual. The system output is capable of displaying spatial distribution map, map scale, and attribute information. The user interface contains five forms for Intro (splash screen), Load Data, MDI, Display, and Layer Symbol. The results of SEBALIS can be directly obtained in digital values, which can immediately be visualized in the software itself.

40|$|AbstractDefining Simulation Intent {{involves}} capturing {{high level}} modelling and idealisation decisions {{in order to}} create an efficient and fit-for-purpose analysis. These decisions are recorded as attributes of the decomposed design space. An approach to defining Simulation Intent is described utilising three known technologies: Cellular Modelling, the subdivision of space into volumes of simulation significance (structures, gas paths, internal and external airflows, etc.); Equivalencing, maintaining functional links between different analysis representations of the same region of design space across multiple analysis models; and Virtual Topology, which offers tools for partitioning and de-partitioning the model without disturbing the manufacturing oriented design geometry. The end result is a convenient framework to which high-level analysis attributes can be applied, and from which detailed analysis models can be generated {{with a high degree of}} controllability, repeatability and automation. There are multiple novel aspects to the approach, including its reusability, robustness to changes in model topology and the inherent links created between analysis models at different levels of fidelity and physics. By utilising Simulation Intent, CAD modelling for simulation can be fully exploited and simulation work-flows can be more readily automated, <b>reducing</b> many <b>repetitive</b> manual <b>tasks</b> (e. g. the definition of appropriate coupling between elements of different types and the application of boundary conditions).
