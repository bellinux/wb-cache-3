50|$|Since it is {{currently}} unknown whether life forms exist on Mars, the mission could potentially transfer viable organisms resulting in back contamination—the introduction of extraterrestrial organisms into Earths biosphere. The scientific consensus is that the potential for large-scale effects, either through pathogenesis or ecological disruption, is extremely small. Nevertheless, returned samples from Mars will be treated as potentially biohazardous until scientists can determine that the returned samples are safe. The goal {{is to reduce the}} probability of release of a Mars particle to less than one in a million. In addition, the proposed NASA Mars Sample Return mission will not be approved by NASA until the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process has been completed. The NEPA process would require a public review of all potential impacts that could result from MSR, including worst case back contamination scenarios. It is likely that a formal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would have to be prepared. Furthermore, under the terms of Article VII of the Outer Space Treaty and probably various other legal frameworks, were a <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>organisms</b> to occur, the releasing nation or nations would be liable for any resultant damages.|$|E
40|$|During {{antibiotic}} therapy for serious Haemophilus influenzae type b infections in children, respiratory mucosal colonization with this organism is suppressed but not eradicated. To define possible mechanisms {{contributing to this}} suppression, the ability of six antibiotics to influence the adherence of H. influenzae type b to human epithelial cells was investigated. In assays in which the organisms were grown in broth containing 0. 5 X the MIC of rifampin, ampicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, lincomycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, all drugs except rifampin significantly reduced bacterial adherence. In assays in which nonreplicating organisms {{were exposed to the}} antibiotics, all six drugs reduced the adherence of the bacteria. In assays in which the epithelial cells were exposed to the antibiotics, all drugs reduced bacterial adherence. In addition, the presence of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, lincomycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appeared to facilitate the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>organisms</b> adherent to epithelial cells. Thus, antibiotics appear to inhibit adherence of H. influenzae type b to human epithelial cells and may interfere with bacterial or epithelial cell binding sites. These observations may explain the suppression of H. influenzae type b mucosal colonization that occurs during antibiotic treatment of patients with systemic H. influenzae type b infections...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{assessment}} for {{genetically engineered bacteria}} sprayed onto crops includes determination of off-site dispersal and deposition. The ability to predict microbial dispersal patterns is essential to characterize the uncertainty (risk) associated with environmental <b>release</b> <b>of</b> recombinant <b>organisms.</b> Toward this end, a particle dispersal model was developed to predict recovery of bacteria on fallout plates at various distances and directions about a test site. The microcomputer simulation incorporates particle size distribution, wind speed and direction, turbulence, evaporation, sedimentation, and mortality, with a time step of 0. 5 s. The model was tested against data reported from three field applications of nonrecombinant bacteria and two applications of recombinant bacteria. Simulated dispersal of 10 (5) particles was compared with reported deposition measurements. The model {{may be useful in}} defining appropriate populations <b>of</b> <b>organisms</b> for <b>release,</b> methods <b>of</b> <b>release</b> or application, characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>release</b> site that influence containment or dispersal, and in developing an appropriate sampling methodology for monitoring the dispersal <b>of</b> <b>organisms</b> such as genetically engineered bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Yersinia pestis, the causative {{agent of}} plague, has caused several pandemics {{throughout}} history and remains endemic in the rodent {{populations of the}} western United States. More recently, Y. pestis {{is one of several}} bacterial pathogens considered to be a potential agent of bioterrorism. Thus, elucidating potential mechanisms of survival and persistence in the environment would be important in the event <b>of</b> an intentional <b>release</b> <b>of</b> the <b>organism.</b> One such mechanism is entry into the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, as has been demonstrated for several other bacterial pathogens. In this study, we showed that Y. pestis became nonculturable by normal laboratory methods after 21 days in a low-temperature tap water microcosm. We further show evidence that, after the loss of culturability, the cells remained viable by using a variety of criteria, including cellular membrane integrity, uptake and incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids, and protection of genomic DNA from DNase I digestion. Additionally, we identified morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of Y. pestis VBNC cells, such as cell rounding and large periplasmic spaces, by electron microscopy, which are consistent with entry into the VBNC state in other bacteria. Finally, we demonstrated resuscitation of a small number of the non-culturable cells. This study provides compelling evidence that Y. pestis persists in a low-temperature tap water microcosm in a viable state yet is unable to be cultured under normal laboratory conditions, which may prove useful in risk assessment and remediation efforts, particularly in the event <b>of</b> an intentional <b>release</b> <b>of</b> this <b>organism...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{potential}} {{disruptive effect}} of human germ line editing seems very small, {{compared to the}} potential effects of other applications of high precision genome editing, for example, the use of gene editing that influences ecosystems (Lunshof, 2015). At this moment, the use of CRISPR-based alterations in wild animal populations, in combination with a gene drive, is considered the most impactful application of genome editing. In this scenario, the genome alterations rapidly spread through a wild animal or plant population and the engineered organisms are self-propagating, thereby enabling the reduction or elimination of disease vectors, pests, and invasive species. Unintentional or premature <b>release</b> <b>of</b> engineered <b>organisms</b> from the laboratory can have far-reaching consequences that may affect the environment and human health and well-being (Akbari et al., 2015).|$|R

50|$|Genetic Engineering can be {{considered}} to be the purposeful alteration of the genetic makeup <b>of</b> an <b>organism</b> through the introduction of genes from sources not belonging to that <b>organism.</b> The isolation <b>of</b> a particular gene and introduction of another is often achieved through the use of biotechnology more broadly.

However, genetic engineering embodies much of what is considered postnatural, but doing so with the next level of technology than used in previous methods such as those mentioned in the above sections.
