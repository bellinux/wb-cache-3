50|$|GIANT KILLER is a {{military}} Air Traffic Control (ATC) call sign used within certain regions of the contiguous United States (CONUS). The call sign is given to air traffic controllers responsible for flight operations within restricted military <b>airspace</b> <b>reserved</b> for combat training exercises. The call sign is commonly published in NOTAMs that designate restricted <b>airspace</b> <b>reserved</b> for military flight operations or combat exercises where normal airspace separation rules do not apply. Previous {{to the use of}} the call sign, no standardized identification method existed for civilian or military aircraft to communicate to the managing controller.|$|R
50|$|European {{air space}} {{is some of}} the busiest in the world, and the current system of air traffic {{management}} suffers from several inefficiencies, such as using air traffic control boundaries that follow national borders, and having large areas of European <b>airspace</b> <b>reserved</b> for military use when in fact they may not be needed.|$|R
40|$|The FAA's Free Flight Phase 1 Office is in {{the process}} of {{deploying}} the current generation of CTAS tools, which are the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) and the passive Final Approach Spacing Tool (pFAST), at selected centers and airports. Research at NASA is now focussed on extending the CTAS software and computer human interfaces to provide more advanced capabilities. The Multi-center TMA (McTMA) is designed to operate at airports where arrival flows originate from two or more centers whose boundaries are in close proximity to the TRACON boundary. McTMA will also include techniques for routing arrival flows away from congested airspace and around <b>airspace</b> <b>reserved</b> for arrivals into other hub airports. NASA is working with FAA and MITRE to build a prototype McTMA for the Philadelphia airport. The active Final Approach Spacing Tool (aFAST) provides speed and heading advisories to help controllers achieve accurate spacing between aircraft on final approach. These advisories will be integrated with those in the existing pFAST to provide a set of comprehensive advisories for controlling arrival traffic from the TRACON boundary to touchdown at complex, high-capacity airports. A research prototype of aFAST, designed for the Dallas-Fort Worth is in an advanced stage of development. The Expedite Departure Path (EDP) and Direct-To tools are designed to help controllers guide departing aircraft out of the TRACON airspace and to climb to cruise altitude along the most efficient routes...|$|R
