The range of seral stages included early shrub/sapling, late shrub/sapling, and pole. In general, the 9 younger stands were opencanopy while the 9 older stands were closed-canopy. Of the 50 bird species recorded, 21 had large enough sample sizes for analysis. Of these 21, 8 showed a pattern of increasing abundance with increasing stand age (chestnut-backed chickadee, golden-crowned kinglet, hermit thrush, hermit warbler, Pacific-slope flycatcher, Swainson's thrush, Wilson's warbler, winter wren). Six species showed a pattern of decreasing abundance with increasing stand age (American robin, darkeyed junco, rufous hummingbird, white-crowned sparrow) and 4 species peaked in abundance in age class 2 (10 - 14 years old) before decreasing with increasing stand age (dusky flycatcher, MacGillivray's warbler, orange-crowned warbler, <b>rufous-sided</b> <b>towhee).</b> Two species did not exhibit any particular pattern associated with stand age (warbling vireo, western tanager). Three species were dropped from analysis because their average territory size {{is larger than the}} smallest stand surveyed. Abundance indices for species which showed an increasing pattern were positively associated with habitat variables describing conifer basal area, percent cover of live conifer crown between 4 m and the height of the tallest conifer tree, number of conifer stems/ha between 20 - and 30 - cm dbh, and/or percent cover of live hardwood crown between 4 m and the height of the tallest hardwood tree. Abundance indices for species which showed a decreasing or peaked abundance were negatively associated with the same variables, excluding percent cover of hardwood crown. Total abundance, species richness, and species diversity did not differ (P< 0. 05) among the age classes. However, bird community composition changed with increasing stand age. Open-canopy stands were dominated by species preferring open-canopy habitats (top 5 species in order of abundance: dark-eyed junco, MacGillivray's warbler, rufous hummingbird, dusky flycatcher, <b>rufous-sided</b> <b>towhee)</b> while closed canopy-stands were dominated by species preferring closed-canopy habitats, (hermit warbler, dark-eyed junco, chestnut-backed chickadee, golden-crowned kinglet, Swainson's thrush); the dark-eyed junco was an exception.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{purpose of}} this study was to record on tape and to analyze the sonagrams of the {{complete}} repertoire of the vocalizations of the <b>Rufous-sided</b> <b>Towhee,</b> Pipilo erythrophthalmus oregonus. Meanings were assigned to a number of the calls. Sounds of nestlings, juveniles, and vocalizations connected with parental care were not included in this study. The following advertising songs were noted in the male only: 1. Full song, one or two introductory notes followed by a fast trill. 2. Introductory note, often used alone or in pairs. 3. Fast trill. 4. Medium trill. 5. Slow trill. With the exception of the Thup note, heard only from the male, and the Kip note, heard only from the female, all call notes were heard from both sexes. The complete list of calls, with meanings assigned where possible, is as follows: 1. Chirp, primarily an attention getter. 2. Meow, usually indicative of the presence of a disturbing factor. 3. See, highly variable, presumably a contact call. 4. Chip, intense fear, alarm note. 5. Thup, contentment. 6. Tzip, frustration or impatience. 7. Tsk, frequent component of secondary song. 8. Chatter, sexual desire. 9. Kip, a post-copulatory note. 10. Slur note, important component of secondary song, also may indicate mild distress. 11. Twitter, used mainly in secondary song. Secondary songs are the softly whispered, usually complex, vocalizations by both sexes, heard only at very close range. Their extreme complexity and variability indicate that they serve some purpose other than to convey information. It is suggested that while advertising song, serving as an isolating mechanism, would diverge in form as part of the process of speciation, the call notes and the secondary songs are likely to remain unchanged. Thus sibling species should have unlike songs but similar call notes and secondary songs. Should this prove to be the case, studies of entire vocal repertoires could prove useful in the study of phylogeny...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 The function, {{seasonality}} and hormonal {{control of}} aggression among male conspecifics {{have been well}} studied in many taxa. In most cases, female-female intraspecific aggression has been less well studied. Male song sparrows are aggressive all year in resident populations, but levels of testosterone correlate with aggression only during periods of social instability. The seasonal pattern and possible hormonal correlates of female aggression are unknown. Female-female aggressive responses are similar to males' and include flights, threat vocalizations, wing waving and posturing. Possible functions, seasonal differences and hormonal underpinnings were tested {{with a series of}} field and laboratory experiments. To investigate function and hormonal control of female-female aggression, at two field sites in Western Washington, either a live caged female song sparrow and playback of female calls, or the control, a <b>Rufous-sided</b> <b>Towhee</b> mount and Towhee vocalizations, were presented to females on their territories in the spring prior to breeding, while the female was incubating, or in the fall following the molt. Females responded more to simulated song sparrow intrusion than to towhee presentations in all seasons. Female-female aggression was highest in spring and decreased across the breeding and post-molt (fall) seasons. Female-female aggression appeared to function to protect a female's monogamous status and access to paternal care, food and nest sites on the territory. At one site, females removals suggested that there were few female floaters. Blood samples taken following the simulated female intrusions were compared to those taken from passively netted females during the same season. Passively netted females had significantly higher levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone than females experiencing simulated female song sparrow intrusions in the field. There {{were no significant differences in}} circulating estradiol, progesterone or corticosterone. To test possible hormonal control of female-female aggression directly, captive females were ovariectomized and given hormone implants then behaviorally tested in single aviaries. There were no significant differences in behavioral response to simulated female intrusion in captive females given either an empty, estradiol or testosterone filled implant. These data suggest that androgens do not activate female-female aggression in song sparrows. Comparisons to data on male song sparrows are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The avifaunal {{composition}} of ten western Oregon forest stands {{located at the}} eastern base of the Coast Range was examined on a seasonal basis. The stands were dominated by Oregon white oak, Douglas fir or western hemlock, Avian populations were sampled monthly from January 1968 to January 1970, using permanent transacts. In order to determine seasonal changes in bird species composition and diversity, variations in the ecological roles of the bird species, their patterns of habitat utilization, {{and the importance of}} habitat components in determining the abundance of species, information was gathered on the behavior and activity patterns, morphological variation and dietary habits of the bird species, and on the vegetative structure of the stands. Intensive studies were centered on seven permanent resident species: Black-capped Chickadee, Chestnut-backed Chickadee, White-breasted Nuthatch, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Brown Creeper, <b>Rufous-sided</b> <b>Towhee,</b> and Oregon Junco. Oak-dominated stands had the highest bird species diversity in all seasons. This is in contrast to the expected increase in diversity with each successional sere, In most cases the actual species diversity was at least 90 percent of the maximum possible diversity. All fir and hemlock stands shared a large number of species and supported roughly similar total populations, in the ecotonal areas diversity was slightly higher than in the surrounding pure stands of either deciduous or coniferous vegetation. More individuals and species were found in western Oregon forests than reported for forests in eastern United States. Further, a large proportion of these birds were permanent residents. Because of this large number of permanent residents, the percentage of migratory birds was lower than in eastern forests. These differences may in part stem from the milder winter climate characteristic of western Oregon. More than 50 percent of the birds present during all seasons in all vegetative types belonged to either the foliage-insect or foliage-seed eating ecological roles. Insect activity had a major influence on avifaunal structure, as at any time of the year 60 to 80 percent of the species recorded belonged to the insect-eating roles. When the effects of vegetative structural features on avian abundance were compared, little difference was found between the importance of variables in the fir and hemlock areas. For the bird species inhabitating all vegetative seres analysed in this study, the same set of structural components affected each species' abundance throughout its ecological distribution, The avifauna of these western Oregon forests thus does not fit into any recognised plant community classification. The birds move between areas within their range of ecological tolerance, providing an energy link between the immobile vegetation...|$|E
