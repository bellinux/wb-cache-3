Our empirical evidence shows that the initial abnormal <b>return</b> <b>in</b> the secondary market is significantly positive.

40|$|We examine stock <b>return</b> {{predictability}} <b>in</b> China.

Only five firm-specific variables predict <b>returns</b> <b>in</b> the Chinese market. Tests on U. S. stock returns find that more predictors can explain cross-sectional stock return variation. We test two explanations {{for the cause of}} weak <b>returns</b> predictability <b>in</b> China. First, perhaps <b>return</b> predictors <b>in</b> China are less heterogeneously distributed than they are in the U. S. Second, stock prices are less informative in China than they are in the U. S.
