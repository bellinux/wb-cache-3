5|$|The {{city was}} known for its prosperity, with shaded streets, gardens, and markets. It {{contained}} high-rise residential buildings, some seven storeys tall, which could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. Al-Muqaddasi in the 10th century described them as Minarets, while Nasir Khusraw in the early 11th century described some of them <b>rising</b> <b>up</b> to 14 stories, with roof gardens on the top storey complete with ox-drawn water wheels for irrigation.|$|E
5|$|At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, {{many of them}} {{bearing the}} republic's vierkleur ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, {{independent}} republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider <b>rising</b> <b>up</b> there and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection <b>rising</b> <b>up</b> from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E

5|$|In late 1990 after Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded and {{occupied}} Kuwait, ultimately {{leading to the}} Gulf War, American commentators and Middle East experts {{expressed concern about the}} possible consequences of the Arab street in the region <b>rising</b> <b>up</b> in support of Saddam against their own governments, many of whom (particularly Egypt) had joined the military coalition led by the United States. This did not happen when the actual war began, nor for the hundred days of combat before Iraqi forces retreated and surrendered. A year later, in 1992, David Pollock of the United States Information Agency (USIA) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and, by extension, all Arab public opinion.|$|E
5|$|In the Star Trek universe, {{prior to}} the arrival of Voyager in the Delta Quadrant, {{hostilities}} between the Trabe and the Kazon led to the Trabe keeping them subjugated. Violence between the Kazon was encouraged to limit the risk of them <b>rising</b> <b>up</b> against the Trabe. Before being conquered by the Trabe, the Kazon were the most advanced society in the quadrant. On stardate 2346, Jal Sankur united the sects into the Kazon Order or the Kazon Collective to overthrow the Trabe. The Kazon stole the Trabe's technology and ships and, rather than settle on a new homeworld, became a nomadic species. After achieving independence from the Trabe, the Kazon continued to fight among themselves for control of resources and technology.|$|E
5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all <b>rising</b> <b>up</b> as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E

5|$|The cratered terrain, {{a rolling}} surface covered by {{numerous}} impact craters and centered on Ariel's south pole, is the moon's {{oldest and most}} geographically extensive geological unit. It is intersected by a network of scarps, canyons (graben), and narrow ridges mainly occurring in Ariel's mid-southern latitudes. The canyons, known as chasmata, probably represent graben formed by extensional faulting, which resulted from global tensional stresses caused by the freezing of water (or aqueous ammonia) in the moon's interior (see below). They are 15–50km wide and trend mainly in an east- or northeasterly direction. The floors of many canyons are convex; <b>rising</b> <b>up</b> by 1–2km. Sometimes the floors are separated from the walls of canyons by grooves (troughs) about 1km wide. The widest graben have grooves running along the crests of their convex floors, which are called valles. The longest canyon is Kachina Chasma, at over 620km in length (the feature extends into the hemisphere of Ariel that Voyager 2 did not see illuminated).|$|E
5|$|The outer {{bands of}} Typhoon Wipha began {{impacting}} parts of eastern China on September17. Heavy rains dropped up to 162mm (6.3in) in some cities, causing rivers to near flood stage.

At least 1,900 communities were left without power as high winds knocked down numerous power lines. A total of 14 {{people were killed in}} China in direct relation to Wipha. One man was electrocuted and died after stepping into floodwaters with live power lines submerged in the water. A landslide triggered by the heavy rains killed five people. At least 11million people were affected by the storm in Fujian and Zhejiang. Once floodwaters receded, a car was found turned over, the five passengers inside were declared dead on scene. Damages in China amounted to ¥7.45billion ($1billion USD).|$|E
5|$|Whilst Wigan Warriors and Wigan Athletic {{flourished in}} the new stadium (Wigan Athletic in {{particular}} would achieve significant success, <b>rising</b> <b>up</b> the English football pyramid to the Premier League by 2005), Orrell R.U.F.C. did not. Dave Whelan and Maurice Lindsay decided to invest heavily in the club, {{with the aim of}} having the club play in rugby union's Guinness Premiership at the stadium. After failing to win 2004's National Division Two, Whelan pulled a large amount of investment from the club, to a more modest GB£30,000 a year. This was the beginning of Orrell's demise, as players left during the summer of that year and the club were consequently relegated the season after. Ownership eventually passed from Lindsay back to the club's members, but by this point, Orrell had sold their former Edge Hall Road ground to Dave Whelan's company, Whelco Holdings, and therefore had no assets apart from their rebuilt clubhouse following a fire in 2002. Orrell never settled at the JJB Stadium, and were eventually de-professionalised {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 season.|$|E
