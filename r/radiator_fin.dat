50|$|It {{is alleged}} that repairs {{conducted}} on the transformer in the earlier {{part of the day}} were unsatisfactory and resulted in loose connections that caused sparking on the B-Phase of the transformer where such repairs were carried out. This resulted in the loosening of one of the cables of the transformer which eventually came off and started dangling loose along the radiator and burnt a hole in the <b>radiator</b> <b>fin.</b> Through this hole the transformer oil started leaking out which, on account of the heat generated by the loose cable touching against the radiator, ignited the oil at about 4.55 p.m. on 13 June 1997. Since the transformer did not have an oil soak pit as required under the regulations and the standard practice, the oil that spread out of the enclosure continued leaking and spreading the fire to the adjacent parking lot where cars were parked at a distance of no more than a metre from the door of the transformer. The result was that all the cars parked in the parking area {{on the ground floor of}} the cinema hall were ablaze. Smoke started billowing in the northern and southward directions in the parking lot of the cinema complex. The northern bound smoke encountered a gate which was adjacent to a staircase leading to the cinema auditorium on the first floor. Due to chimney effect, the smoke gushed into the stairwell and eventually entered the cinema auditorium through a door and through the air conditioning ducts. The southward bound smoke similarly travelled aerially through another staircase and into the lower portion of the balcony of the auditorium from the left side. All this happened while a large number of people were seated in the auditorium enjoying the matinee show of ‘BORDER’, a popular Hindi movie with a patriotic theme.|$|E

Ceramic <b>radiator</b> <b>fins</b> were {{produced}} by screen-printing copper paste on ceramic substrate, which could replace the traditional technique of direct bestrow copper {{and meet the}} requirements of surface mounted technology. This method could be used to manufacture high density, superior thin and micro-sized molectrons. The key processes were screen-printing copper paste, sintering and electroless plating of nickel. The adhesion of copper film onto the ceramic substrate was often reduced after the process of electroless plating of nickel, resulting in the low quality of manufacturing. In this study, we analyzed the ceramic <b>radiator</b> <b>fins</b> which were obtained by the screen-printing copper paste method and using scanning electron microscopy to examine the surface and the cross-sections of copper film and Cu/Ni film.

40|$|In {{the spirit}} of minimal {{modeling}} of complex systems, we develop an idealized two-column model to investigate the climate of tidally locked terrestrial planets with Earth-like atmospheres in the habitable zone of M-dwarf stars. The model is able to approximate the fundamental features of the climate obtained from three-dimensional (3 D) atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) simulations. One important reason for the two-column model’s success is that it reproduces the high cloud albedo of the GCM simulations, which reduces the planet’s temperature and delays the onset of a runaway greenhouse state. The two-column model also clearly illustrates a secondary mechanism for determining the climate: the nightside acts as a “radiator fin ” through which infrared energy can be lost to space easily. This <b>radiator</b> <b>fin</b> is maintained by a temperature inversion and dry air on the nightside, and plays a similar role to the subtropics on modern Earth. Since one-dimensional radiative–convective models cannot capture {{the effects of the}} cloud albedo and <b>radiator</b> <b>fin,</b> they are systematically biased toward a narrower habitable zone. We also show that cloud parameters are the most important in the two-column model for determining the day–night thermal emission contrast, which decreases and eventually reverses as the stellar flux increases. This reversal is important because it could be detected by future extrasolar planet characterization missions, which would suggest that the planet has Earth-like water clouds and is potentially habitable...|$|E

50|$|The {{radiators}} {{are designed}} to heat {{the air in the}} room using convection to transfer heat from the radiators to the surrounding air.

This sets up convective loops of air movement within a room. If the register is blocked either from above or below, this air movement is prevented, and the heater will not work.

40|$|The {{desire to}} explore deep space {{destinations}} with high-power and high-speed spacecraft inspired this work. Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP), shown to provide {{orders of magnitude}} higher specific impulse and propulsion efficiency over traditional chemical rockets, {{has been identified as}} an enabling technology for this goal. One of large obstacle to launching an NEP vehicle is total mass. Increasing the specific power (kW/kg) of the heat radiator component is necessary to meet NASA’s mass targets. This work evaluated a novel lightweight, high-temperature carbon fiber radiator designed to meet the mass requirements of future NEP missions. The research is grouped into three major sections: 1) a micro-scale radiation study, 2) bench-scale experimental and analytical investigations, and 3) large-scale radiator system modeling. In the first section, a Monte Carlo ray tracing model built to predict the effective emissivity of a carbon fiber fin by modeling the radiation scattering among fibers showed that the added surface area of the fibers over a flat fin surface increases the effective emissivity of the radiator area by up to 20 %. The effective emissivity increases as the fiber volume fraction decreases from 1 to about 0. 16 due to increased scattering among the fibers. For fiber volume fractions lower than 0. 10, the effective emissivity decreases rapidly as the effect of radiation transmission becomes significant. In the second section, thermal analyses of the carbon fiber <b>radiator</b> <b>fin</b> predicted that these radiators could meet NASA’s performance targets by reducing the areal density to 2. 2 kg/m 2 or below.

The TEP consists of a nominal 200 -watt output stage tube (OST), a supporting power-processing system (PPS), and a variable-conductance heat-pipe system (VCHPS). The VCHPS, which uses three heat pipes to conduct heat from the body of the OST to a <b>radiator</b> <b>fin,</b> was designed to maintain the TEP at safe operating temperatures at all operating conditions.

Results showed for unidirectional P- 100 Gr/Cu composites, the longitudinal thermal conductivity was nearly independent of fiber volume fraction. Transverse thermal conductivities (perpendicular to the fibers) were strongly affected by the fiber volume fraction with higher volume fractions resulting in lower thermal conductivities. The effect of architecture on thermal conductivity followed the cosine squared law for simple architectures. Insufficient data are available currently to model more complex architectures, but adding fibers {{in the direction of the}} heat flow increases the thermal conductivity as low conductivity plies are supplemented by high conductivity plies.

The hysteresis was eliminated by an engineered interface. Mechanical testing concentrated on the dynamic modulus and strength of the composites. The dynamic modulus of the Gr/Cu composites was 305 GPa up to 400 C, a value equivalent to Be.

Iteration algorithm is used. The non-linear characteristics of weight functions and allowable input heat resistances of radiator are {{applied in the}} algorithm. Mass and overall parameters of standard and optimal radiator are defined by different strategies...|$|R
