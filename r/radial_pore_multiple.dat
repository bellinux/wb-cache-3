40|$|Cortical {{porosity}} {{is a key}} characteristic {{governing the}} structural properties and mechanical behaviour of bone, and its quantification is therefore critical for understanding and monitoring the development of various bone pathologies such as osteoporosis. Axial transmission quantitative acoustics has {{shown to be a}} promising technique for assessing bone health in a fast, non-invasive, and radiation-free manner. One major hurdle in bringing this approach to clinical application is the entanglement of the effects of individual characteristics (e. g. geometry, porosity, anisotropy etc.) on the measured wave propagation. In order to address this entanglement problem, we therefore propose a systematic bottom-up approach, in which only one bone property is varied, before addressing interaction effects. This work therefore investigated the sensitivity of low-frequency quantitative acoustics to changes in porosity as well as individual pore characteristics using specifically designed cortical bone phantoms. 14 bone phantoms were designed with varying pore size, axial-, and <b>radial</b> <b>pore</b> number, resulting in porosities (bone volume fraction) between 0 % and 15 %, similar to porosity values found in human cortical bone. All phantoms were manufactured using laser sintering, measured using axial-transmission acoustics and analysed using a full-wave approach. Experimental results were compared to theoretical predictions based on a modified Timoshenko theory. A clear dependence of phase velocity on frequency and porosity produced by increasing <b>pore</b> size or <b>radial</b> <b>pore</b> number was demonstrated, with the velocity decreasing by between 2 - 5 m/s per percent of additional porosity, which corresponds to - 0. 5 % to - 1. 0 % of wave speed. While the change in phase velocity due to axial pore number was consistent with the results due to <b>pore</b> size and <b>radial</b> <b>pore</b> number, the relative uncertainties for the estimates were too high to draw any conclusions for this parameter. This work has shown the capability of low-frequency quantitative acoustics to reflect changes in porosity and individual pore characteristics and demonstrated that additive manufacturing is an appropriate method that allows the influence of individual bone properties on the wave propagation to be systematically assessed. The results of this work opens perspectives for the efficient development of a multi-frequency, multi-mode approach to screen, diagnose, and monitor bone pathologies in individuals...|$|R

As cells are known to respond to matrix organization, biomaterials that {{take into account the}} specific architecture of the tissues to be regenerated may have an advantage in regenerative medicine. In this study we focussed on the diaphragm, an organ essential for breathing, and consisting of radial oriented skeletal muscle fibres diverging from a central tendon plate. To mimic this structure dual layered collagenous scaffolds were constructed with a <b>radial</b> <b>pore</b> orientation, prepared by inward out freezing, and reinforced by a layer of compressed collagen. Similar scaffolds with a random round pore structure were taken as controls. Scaffolds were first mildly crosslinked by formaldehyde vapour fixation for initial stabilization (13 % and 17 % crosslinking for the radial and control scaffolds, respectively), and further crosslinked using aqueous 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (38 % and 37 % crosslinking, respectively). Scaffolds were implanted into a surgically created diaphragm defect in rats and explanted after 12 weeks. Macroscopically, integration of the radial scaffolds with the surrounding diaphragm was better compared with the controls. Cells had infiltrated further into the centre of the scaffolds (P= 0. 029) and there was a tendency of blood vessels to migrate deeper into the radial scaffolds (P= 0. 057, compared with controls). Elongated cells (SMA-positive) were aligned with the radial structures.
