The article describes the new services that have been set up, the developmental axes for further covering the learning and information needs of the University of Cyprus and the perspectives of its contribution to the development and collaboration of the Cypriot Libraries. The primary mission of the UCYLIB is to serve the information and learning needs {{of the members of}} the Academic community, which are more than 3. 800 active users (students, faculty and researchers). However, the UCYLIB is open for external users, as there are currently more than 700 members of this category. The collection UCYLIB includes: 220. 000 books, of which only 40. 000 are catalogued, accessible through the OPAC and usable, 3. 500 printed journal titles, of which 1. 650 current, access to 3. 500 e-journals (mainly due to the participation of the UCYLIB to the Consortium of the Hellenic Academic Libraries (HEAL-Link), 50 databases, access to 200. 000 digital books located in 100 virtual collections in the Internet, 300 useful links to web sites organised in structured indexes, 1. 500 titles of educational multimedia, music records, CD-ROMs, videotapes, diskettes, microfilms, audiovisual material etc. During 2000 - 2001 new functions and services were set up and several chronic problems were solved. Namely: the admission of UCYLIB in the HEAL-Link consortium, the development of the digital library accessible from all the campus network, the correction and maintenance of the authority files of the library catalogue, the initiation of the <b>retrospective</b> <b>cataloguing</b> of 170. 000 books, the staffing and training of a cataloguers team, the systematic training of the library staff, the encouraging of the staff life long learning, starting with internal seminars of mutual teaching, the extension of library and information services to blind users, with the installation of adaptive workstations and the production of alternative (digital) material etc. However, other issues such as bibliographic support to researchers, provision of information literacy to users, development of web applications are either missing or running their first steps. The arrangement of the pending issues within the UCYLIB (adequate staffing, development and consolidation of new services, completion of the <b>retrospective</b> <b>cataloguing)</b> will permit the UCYLIB to address to the support of the rest libraries in Cyprus. There is ground for cooperation aiming to the production of common information products and services (coordinated cataloguing, union catalogues, interlibrary lending, joint purchasing and access to information sources etc.). The fulfilment of some implicit presuppositions from the side of the rest Cypriot libraries is required for a successful and fruitful cooperation, namely the adequate staffing of libraries, the obtaining of computer and network equipment, the provision of a common Library Information System complying the international standards, the ensuring of systematic technical support, the connection with the internet etc. The UCYLIB will be able to essentially contribute to this direction with its accumulated know how...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to outline the {{approach}} taken to the reclassification of the library collection within a small multi-site college of higher education – whereby 160, 000 volumes were converted from the BLISS system to the Dewey Decimal Classification system, over a period of 11 weeks during Summer 2004. Design/methodology/approach: An automated approach was taken whereby the Library Systems Supplier – Talis was commissioned to convert catalogue records using a batch process. Risk analysis and critical path analysis were used as tools to keep the project on schedule and provide quality control. Findings: An automated approach allowed the project to be completed on time, within budget and with minimal disruption to services. Project planning was crucial to the success of the project. This included mapping BLISS to Dewey numbers, recruitment of a student team, management of work packages and ensuring continuity of the Library Service during the project. Practical implications: Institutional support for the project was secured because of its relevance to the College's corporate agenda and the promise of a wider impact that the project would have in terms of modernisation of the library service. Originality/value: Despite the apparent lack of current articles on re-classification, many libraries are still grappling with ongoing <b>retrospective</b> <b>cataloguing</b> projects. This case study demonstrates how one institution approached the problem and demonstrates that an automated approach can yield benefits.

40|$|The 19 th Century Pamphlets Online {{project was}} {{sponsored}} by Research Libraries UK (RLUK), funded by JISC and led by t he University of Southampton. Other partners included JSTOR, Mimas, and the Universities of Bristol, Durham, Liverpool, LSE, Manchester, Newcastle and UCL. The overall aim {{of the project was}} to provide researchers, teachers and learners with online access to significant collections of 19 th century pamphlets held within UK research libraries. In order to achieve this aim, the project drew on the pamphlet holdings of seven research libraries (Bristol, Durham, Liverpool, LSE, Manchester, Newcastle and UCL), choosing collections that focused on the political, social and economic issues of the day. The project scanned these collections within the University of Southampton Library's specialist BOPCRIS Digitisation Centre and then sent the datasets to JSTOR for archiving and delivery via their online publishing platform. Mimas enabled links to the digitised pamphlets {{to be added to the}} national Copac catalogue and to local library catalogues. A supporting website was developed to hold information about the collections and educational resources to support researchers, teachers and students. The 19 th Century Pamphlets Online project sought to build on previous work and expertise. It followed on from a large <b>retrospective</b> <b>cataloguing</b> project, which included many of the same partners and was also sponsored by RLUK. Metadata created within this previous project was extended and linked to the digitised pages and text. The project drew on the considerable digitisation experience of BOPCRIS, the delivery platform of JSTOR, and existi ng resource discovery channels available via JSTOR and Mimas (such as Google Scholar and Copac). In addition to building on the past, the project was concerned to leave a good legacy for the future. A problem facing large consortia digitisation projects is how to preserve and sustain the resources they create. Which of the many partners will take on this responsibility? How will it be paid for? To address this problem, the UK partners chose to enter into a long (25 year) agreement with JSTOR over the care and delivery of the collection. JSTOR would preserve the data and make it available free of charge to UK users, and it would pay for this by making the content available on commercial terms to others...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{describe}} the structures {{established by the}} Libraries Computer Center (LCC) of the University of Athens {{in order to facilitate}} centralized management, and also ensure the more effective, flexible and safe communication between all the participating parties (namely the LCC personnel, the libraries' staff, and the Academic community that utilizes the libraries and their material). After a reference to the University Libraries as a whole and their individual peculiarities, the plans for an originally virtual and later on physical unification towards Central Libraries will be presented alongside the methods that were introduced in order to achieve this goal. In this respect, a more detailed view will be given not only on the various information deployment procedures targeting the libraries staff, but also on the application environment offered as a service to the libraries by the LCC personnel. In the light of the aforementioned, the library-oriented office automation environment that is being used will be described offering the use of secure, accessible and feature-rich electronic mail facilities (including server-wise and local address books, groups and user classification per library), as well as the support for auxiliary workflow applications that can be securely updated and accessed by the libraries staff (at an editor's access level). They can be either of internal use (such as the on-line help for cataloguing, the help-desk application where hardware and software problems, addressed to the LCC personnel, are recorded, and the automated procedure for ordering journal articles) or even become published on the web via the libraries' web pages that are hosted on the LCC's web site (such applications include information and access to electronic journal subscriptions, update of information and announcements per library). Moreover, a series of personalized-perlibrary location statistic reports will be presented, that are made of dynamically created web pages, accessible by each library that wants to receive administrative information on such issues as library catalog (number of records per collection, record titles, authors, etc.), circulation (items out, items overdue, circulation receipts), subjects, inventory and <b>retrospective</b> <b>cataloguing,</b> that {{are not likely to be}} produced by the library automation software that is being used.
