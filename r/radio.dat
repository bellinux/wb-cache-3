A number of independent <b>radio</b> stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. Several regional <b>radio</b> stations broadcast in Welsh: output ranges from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday (<b>Radio</b> Maldwyn), through over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly (Swansea Sound), to essentially bilingual stations offering between 37% and 44% of programme content (Heart Cymru (formerly Champion 103) and <b>Radio</b> Ceredigion respectively).|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to the popularity of pirate <b>radio</b> BBC <b>radio</b> was restructured in 1967, establishing BBC <b>Radio</b> 1, <b>Radio</b> 2, <b>Radio</b> 3 and <b>Radio</b> 4. A number of DJs of the newly created pop music service BBC <b>Radio</b> 1 came from pirate stations. The UK Government also closed the international waters loophole via the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act of 1967, although <b>Radio</b> Caroline continued to broadcast (with some sizeable off-air periods between 1968 and 1972 and 1980–83) until 1990.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Designed {{to adapt}} {{spectrum}} usage on-the-fly, frequency-agile <b>radios</b> can drastically improve performance of wireless networks. Such flexibility, however, {{comes with a}} cost of increased hardware complexity. This motivates us to understand when and why having higher degree of frequency-agility helps and how much improvement it can lead to. In this paper, we approach this question by comparing two types of agile <b>radios</b> {{in the context of}} dynamic spectrum sharing in any given spectrum chunk. We consider 1 -agile <b>radios</b> that use a single frequency channel but can adjust the channel’s width and central frequency, and k-agile <b>radios</b> that can combine up to k non-contiguously aligned frequency segments into one transmission. We show that, due to inherent demand dynamics and conflict heterogeneity, networks using 1 -agile <b>radios</b> often face the problem of spectrum fragmentation. But k-agile <b>radios</b> can effectively suppress this problem directly at the physical layer. Using theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, we quantify the advantage of k-agile <b>radios</b> over 1 -agile <b>radios</b> in their network spectrum usage. For a fair comparison, we abstract the impact of demand and topology configurations by evaluating the worst case and average case performance. Our results show that in worst cases, the improvement of using fully-agile <b>radios</b> is arbitrarily large, although the improvement of using k-agile <b>radios</b> is upper bounded by k. In average cases, the improvement reduces to 10 – 40 % under typical network configurations. Interestingly, in the context of dynamic spectrum sharing, 2 -agile <b>radios</b> realize the majority of the improvement brought by fully-agile <b>radios.</b> I...|$|R
