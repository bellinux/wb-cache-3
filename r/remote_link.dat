In contrast, a comparison of BLM grazing fees with private land market prices demonstrated the Bundy's are getting a 93% discount by grazing on BLM land.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the captain}} of Dreadnaught, the player could assume the command {{of any of the}} four {{workstations}} on the command bridge. From the command station (CMD), the player received his/her mission briefings and could sometimes control other ships through a <b>remote</b> <b>link.</b> The station also had access to an accurate star map. The ship was normally flown from the navigation station (NAV). From the weapons station (WEP), the player had an outside view of Dreadnaught's wire frame model. Following a locked target, the angle of view could rotate 360 degrees on all [...] This workstation also had a ripple fire mode which allowed attacking quickly a large group of enemies. The fourth station engineering (ENG) was for controlling the repairs when the ship was damaged by weapons or a collision with another object. However, the automated repair functioned well and player supervision was rarely needed. The station also had a fuel gauge, which was nonfunctional because the game design was changed to give Dreadnaught limitless fuel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Can an end-host running {{multiple}} TCP sessions detect {{not just}} the occurrence, but also the location of congestion? This paper answers this question through new analytic results on the two underlying technical difficulties: synchronization effects of loss and delay in TCP and distributed hypothesis testing using only local loss and delay data, as well as practical algorithm development and extensive simulations. It presents a Congestion Location Detection algorithm that effectively allows an end host to distributedly detect whether congestion happens in the local access link or in more <b>remote</b> <b>links.</b> This further enables the practical usage of low-priority congestion control protocols.

40|$|The {{implementation}} {{of high quality}} complex wireless sensor networks requires a good level of flexibility both at compile-time (configuration) and at run-time (management). The twofold goal is on one hand to improve the overall “fitness” of the application implemented to the changing environment {{and on the other}} hand to limit the footprint of the software. This paper presents a flexible and lightweight mechanism to implement dynamic linking of application modules over a wireless sensors network. The proposed approach is based on a client/server approach and a two-phases <b>remote</b> <b>linking</b> aimed at optimizing the resource usage on the network nodes. A prototypical implementation for MantisOS on TelosB nodes is also described...|$|R
50|$|The {{connection}} from Wiesbaden to the {{new line}} was planned under various options for the Cologne-Rhine/Main high-speed line under discussion during the 1980s. Only {{in the case of}} a purely left-bank route (to the west of the Rhine) was a link not provided to Wiesbaden. The Hessian state government considered that a <b>remote</b> <b>link</b> to the Wiesbaden would be inadequate. The forecasts in the 1990s were that more than 1,000 passengers a day would use high-speed services to Wiesbaden.|$|E
50|$|Alan Carter {{tries to}} {{establish}} a <b>remote</b> <b>link</b> with the ship and discovers its controls are set on manual. As the three domes store the atomic waste from Moonbase Alpha's reactors, Tony Verdeschi is concerned an impact could generate a nuclear explosion. Maya assures him that only the introduction of atomic fuel could instigate such an act. If the Commander's reckless behaviour continues, a crash is inevitable; Verdeschi orders Carter to take nuclear physicists Jack Bartlett and Joe Ehrlich {{with him on the}} rescue Eagle.|$|E
50|$|Carter {{establishes}} a <b>remote</b> <b>link</b> and, under automatic control, blasts the ship {{free from the}} surface. However, it is a three-hour flight back to the Moon and only one hour's worth of oxygen remains. With both spacesuit helmets damaged in the crash, Koenig has an inspiration: Maya can {{become a source of}} oxygen by transforming into vegetation. When the ship lands, the emergency crew finds an unconscious Koenig surrounded by a dense thicket—which recedes as Maya ends her third one-hour stint as vegetation. To Helena's relief, Koenig quickly recovers when given oxygen.|$|E

50|$|However, {{having the}} Eye of Harmony {{on board the}} TARDIS contradicted {{the idea that the}} Eye itself was on Gallifrey. To {{reconcile}} this, fan speculation held that this was not the real Eye, but merely a name applied to a <b>remote</b> <b>link</b> to the actual Eye that powered the craft (possibly in the same way the Time Lords transmitted energy from Gallifrey to the TARDIS in The Three Doctors), or alternatively, the Eye had been somehow transferred to the TARDIS. The former conjecture became established fanon, and was taken up in the spin-off media and was eventually confirmed by the official BBC website.|$|E

There, Ultron revived Jocasta with a <b>remote</b> <b>link,</b> activating Wasp's mental [...] "residue" [...] left behind. She escaped from Avengers custody and led the Avengers into Ultron's trap. Jocasta was programmed to be loyal to Ultron. Even though she loved Ultron intensely, she could not abide by her master's evil. Jocasta eventually betrayed Ultron, choosing to help the Avengers defeat her [...] "mate" [...] again. She was then abducted by the Collector. Freed from Collector by the Avengers, she aided the Avengers against Korvac.|$|E

Sasha does not know. Waller demands Sasha return to base, but Sasha says she will not. Waller then instructs Fire to stop Brother Eye from being reactivated, even if it means killing Sasha or Midnight.

With controls set to manual, Paul Morrow cannot use his <b>remote</b> <b>link</b> to establish control and bring them back safely. Eagle Three crash-lands seven hundred metres from the Moonbase perimeter. With no other means available, Koenig decides to lead a rescue team on foot. Halfway to the downed Eagle, Koenig's party is ambushed; a ball of orange light approaches and Helena is compelled to walk into it. Koenig attempts to prevent her abduction, but is thrust back and rendered unconscious. The light, with Helena, disappears.|$|E
