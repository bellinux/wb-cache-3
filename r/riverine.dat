5|$|Adar is {{predominantly}} inhabited by the Dinka people, who mainly cultivate crops and raise cattle. Many of the Dinka use <b>riverine</b> pastures {{along the east}} bank of the White Nile, but in dry seasons can usually find alternative pasturage along the Khor Adal and Khor Wol and {{on the edges of}} the marshes.|$|E
5|$|Da Nang {{was under}} the direct {{responsibility}} of Lieutenant-General Ngô Quang Trưởng. It was home of the ARVN 3rd Division (South Vietnam), the 4th and 7th Armoured Squadrons, the 11th and 14th Ranger Groups, the 911th Regional Force Company, the 1st Air Force Division, one coastal patrol squadron and two <b>riverine</b> squadrons.|$|E
5|$|During the Ming dynasty cannon {{were used}} in <b>riverine</b> warfare at the Battle of Lake Poyang. One {{shipwreck}} in Shandong had a cannon dated to 1377 and an anchor dated to 1372. From the 13th to 15th centuries cannon armed Chinese ships also travelled throughout Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Katyusha rocket launchers, {{which were}} invented in Voronezh, were mounted on many {{platforms}} during World War II, including on trucks, artillery tractors, tanks, and armoured trains, {{as well as}} on naval and <b>riverine</b> vessels as assault support weapons. Soviet engineers also mounted single Katyusha rockets on lengths of railway track to serve in urban combat.|$|E
5|$|Quảng Tin and Quảng Ngãi {{was held}} by the ARVN 2nd Division (South Vietnam), the 12th Ranger Group, the 11th Armoured Squadron, three {{artillery}} battalions, the 912th Regional Force Company, one coastal patrol squadron and one <b>riverine</b> squadron. Brigadier-General Trần Văn Nhựt commanded the 3rd Infantry Division, and all other units in Quảng Nam and Quảng Ngãi.|$|E
5|$|Romania: A single M.alcathoe was {{captured}} in 2007 in a nature reserve in the eastern Carpathians; the reserve contains <b>riverine</b> and conifer forest. The species was additionally recorded in a forested valley containing a small stream in Alba County.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{quantities}} of Sarawak soil are lithosols, up to 60 percent, and podsols, around 12 percent, while abundant alluvial soil {{is found in}} coastal and <b>riverine</b> regions. 12 percent of Sarawak is covered with peat swamp forest.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Riverine</b> and Lake Forces of the KJRM were {{headquartered}} on the Danube {{river in}} Novi Sad, and were organised into the River Flotilla and three Lake Detachments. Each {{division of the}} River Flotilla except the Monitor Division included one or more mobilised customs motorboats.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} territory, {{which consisted}} of Serbia proper, {{the northern part of}} Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government. This was due to the key rail and <b>riverine</b> transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals.|$|E
5|$|Arminius {{called his}} tribe, the Cherusci, and the {{surrounding}} tribes to arms. Germanicus coordinated a land and <b>riverine</b> offensive, with troops marching eastward across the Rhine, and sailing from the North Sea up the Ems River in order to attack the Bructeri and Cherusci. Germanicus' forces went through Bructeri territory, where a general Lucius Stertinius recovered the lost eagle of the XIX Legion from among the equipment of the Bructeri after routing them in battle.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae, {{also known}} as the Lower California rice rat, is a species of rodent from western Mexico. Restricted to the {{southern}} tip of the Baja California peninsula, it {{is a member of the}} genus Oryzomys of family Cricetidae. Only about twenty individuals, collected around 1900, are known, and subsequent destruction of its <b>riverine</b> habitat may have driven the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{operational}} {{capabilities of}} the SBS and the SAS are broadly similar. However, the SBS (being the principal Royal Navy contribution to UKSF) has the additional training and equipment required to lead in the maritime, amphibious and <b>riverine</b> environments. Both units come under the operational command of HQ Directorate of Special Forces (DSF) and undergo an identical selection process. They enjoy significant interoperability in training and on operations.|$|E
5|$|After the scuttling of the monitors, around 450 {{officers}} and {{men from the}} Sava and various other <b>riverine</b> vessels gathered at Obrenovac. Armed only with personal weapons and some machine guns stripped from the scuttled vessels, the crews started towards the Bay of Kotor in the southern Adriatic in two groups. The smaller {{of the two groups}} reached its objective, but the larger group only made it as far as Sarajevo by 14 April before they were obliged to surrender. The remainder {{made their way to the}} Bay of Kotor, which was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus) {{is a small}} crocodilian from {{northern}} and central South America in the alligator family. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Surinam and Venezuela. It lives in <b>riverine</b> forests, flooded forests near lakes, and near fast-flowing rivers and streams. It can traverse dry land to reach temporary pools and tolerates colder water than other species of alligator. Other common names for this species include the musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman and the smooth-fronted caiman. It is sometimes kept in captivity as a pet and may {{be referred to as}} the wedge head caiman by the pet trade.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{indicate}} river otters were once populous throughout most major drainages {{in the continental}} United States and Canada prior to European settlement. North America’s largest otter populations were found in areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats, such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England. In addition, <b>riverine</b> habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but practical, otter populations. The otter existed on {{all parts of the}} Pacific Coast, including the seashore and inland streams and lakes. However, large populations never occurred in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the xeric shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, the otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas.|$|E
5|$|It mostly breeds in acacia and {{tamarisk}} scrub {{and tall}} grass, invariably near rivers or other wetlands. The construction {{and expansion of}} irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India. It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, it moves away from its main <b>riverine</b> habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{units of}} the Vietnam People's Army such as the 2nd Division, the 141st Regiment (3rd ‘Gold Star’ Division), the 52nd Independent Brigade, the 368th and 572nd Artillery Regiments {{operated}} alongside local Viet Cong units, namely the 94th and 96th Local Force Regiments, and 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. The southern region of I Corps {{was considered to be}} the weakest area of defence, which was under the responsibility of ARVN General Trần Văn Nhựt, who also led the 2nd Infantry Division. Also included in General Nhut's order of battle were the 12th Ranger Group, the 916th Regional Force Battalion, the 11th Armoured Brigade, three battalions of artillery, one navy coastal squadron and <b>riverine</b> squadron.|$|E
5|$|Sava {{was raised}} and {{repaired}} by the navy of the Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia, and served alongside her fellow monitor Morava, which was raised, repaired, and renamed Bosna. Along with six captured motorboats and ten auxiliary vessels, {{they made up}} the <b>riverine</b> police force of the Croatian state. Sava {{was part of the}} 1st Patrol Group of the River Flotilla Command, headquartered at Zemun. Her crew scuttled her near Slavonski Brod on the night of 8 September 1944 and defected to the Yugoslav Partisans.|$|E
5|$|The Milwaukee-class {{monitors}} were a {{class of}} four <b>riverine</b> ironclad monitors built during the American Civil War. Several supported Union forces along the Mississippi River in mid-1864 before participating in the Battle of Mobile Bay in August. Chickasaw and Winnebago bombarded Confederate coastal fortifications during the battle and during subsequent operations as well as engaging the ironclad Tennessee II. The other two ships arrived at Mobile Bay after the battle and all four supported the land attacks on Mobile in March–April 1865. Milwaukee struck a torpedo during this time and sank. The surviving three ships were sold in 1874; Chickasaw was converted into a ferry and survived until 1944 when she was scuttled. Her wreck was discovered in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Sadarghat River Port on {{the banks}} of the Buriganga River serves for the {{transport}} of goods and passengers upriver and to other ports in Bangladesh. Inter-city and inter-district motor vessels and passenger-ferry services are used by many people to travel <b>riverine</b> regions of the country from the city. Water bus services are available on Buriganga River and Hatirjheel and Gulshan lakes. Water buses of Buriganga River ferry passengers on Sadarghat to Gabtali route. Water taxis in Hatirjheel and Gulshan lakes provide connectivity via two routes, one route between Tejgaon and Gulshan, another route between Tejgaon and Rampura areas.|$|E
5|$|The first Hispanic {{to command}} a TACLET (Tactical Law Enforcement Team), was then-Lieutenant Jose L. Rodriguez {{when he took}} command of TACLET South, 1996–1998. He {{was also the first}} Coast Guardsman to command a U.S. Marine Corps unit when he took command of the <b>Riverine</b> Training Center, Special Operations Training Group, II MEF at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina in July 1999. He was also the first Hispanic-American Coast Guardsman to earn his Gold Navy/Marine Corps jump wings while in the Coast Guard and {{assigned}} to a jump billet (USMC Majors Billet at Special Operations Training Group II MEF). He earned his wings that same year. He also became the first commanding officer of one of the two MSSTs commissioned in the Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|The species dwells in semi-deserts, savannah, open woodland, dense dry woodland, and mountainous forests up to 4,000m in altitude. It {{is scarce}} or absent in {{tropical}} rainforests and coastal areas. Its preferred habitats in west Africa include the Guinea and Sudan savannahs, and is absent in the belt of dense coastal forest. In the Namib Desert, {{it occurs in}} <b>riverine</b> growth along seasonal rivers, the sub-desertic pro-Namib and the adjoining inland plateau. In ideal habitats, the spotted hyena outnumbers other large carnivores, including other hyena species. However, the striped and brown hyena occur at greater densities than the spotted species in desert and semi-desert regions. Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per km2.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a {{freshwater}} {{species and}} {{is found in}} forested <b>riverine</b> habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, {{but it is also}} found in quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and sub-adult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In the northern and southern parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests in savannah country, but it is absent from such habitats in Los Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of alligator. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic {{women are}} now more highly {{represented}} among enlisted women in the Marine Corps than the other services. Hispanic women are reaching the top echelons of the Marine Corps both in the enlistment and officer ranks. On August 13, 2004, MGySgt. Abigail D. Olmos became the first female Master Gunnery Sergeant {{in the history of}} the Marine Corps. and on August 2, 2006, Brigadier General Angela Salinas, made history when she became the first Hispanic female to obtain a general rank in the Marines. To date servicewomen are still restricted from serving in the following positions: Infantry regiments, artillery battalions, all armored units, combat engineer battalions, reconnaissance units, <b>riverine</b> assault craft units, low altitude air defense units, and fleet anti-terrorism security teams. In Operation Iraqi Freedom female Marines have played a prominent role guarding checkpoints and searching Iraqi women and children. This in turn has exposed many of them to dangerous situations which in some cases could cost them their lives. Two Hispanic female Marines died in said conflict: Lance Corporal Juana Navarro, assigned to 9th Engineer Support Battalion, 3rd Marine Logistics Group, III Marine Expeditionary Force, and Corporal Ramona M. Valdez.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, Argentina made {{inquiries}} in Britain {{to buy a}} new, ocean-going capital {{ship for}} its navy, which to that point, had consisted of only coastal and <b>riverine</b> forces, centered on the two small s. Almirante Brown, the first large ironclad of the Argentine Navy, was ordered from the Samuda Brothers shipyard of London. She was launched on 6 October 1880, and cost the Argentine government £270,000. On 14 June 1881, she conducted speed trials on the Maplin Mile, and achieved her designed speed of 14knots at full power. Upon her delivery to Argentina, she was the largest vessel in the Argentine fleet, and remained so until the four Garibaldi-class armored cruisers were acquired in the late 1890s. Almirante Brown was present during the ceremonies {{for the opening of}} the south basin in the harbor of Buenos Aires on 28 January 1889.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded {{and quickly}} {{defeated}} by the Axis powers. Yugoslavia was partitioned, {{and as part of}} this, the Germans established a military government of occupation in an area roughly the same as the pre-1912 Kingdom of Serbia, consisting of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat. This was due to the key rail and <b>riverine</b> transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals. They did this to secure two strategic lines of communication – the Danube river, and the railway line that connected Belgrade with Salonika in occupied Greece, and thence by sea to North Africa. The German occupied territory of Serbia was also rich in non-ferrous metals such as lead, antimony and copper, which German needed to support its war effort.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period the Mahdi's family became wealthy from cotton {{production}} based on irrigation and migrant laborers, mainly their Baggara followers from Darfur and Kordofan. These western tribes {{had been the}} backbone of the original Mahdist movement. The <b>riverine</b> tribes were more inclined to side with the rival Khatmiyya movement. The government supported Abd al-Rahman in these commercial enterprises. Abd al-Rahman's economic activity, and the resulting wide range of contacts with merchants and owners of pump-schemes for irrigating cotton fields, gave him influence among Sudanese engaged in commerce. As of 1 January 1922 the government suspended payment of allowances to Mahdist notables other than the old and those whose movements were restricted. The allowance of Abd al-Rahman was increased somewhat, but only so that he could support old women and other incapable people whose allowances had been stopped.|$|E
5|$|On rivers, actuariae {{could operate}} year-round, except during periods when the rivers were ice-bound or of high water (after heavy rains or thaw), when the river-current was dangerously strong. It {{is likely that}} the {{establishment}} of the empire's frontier on the Rhine-Danube line was dictated by the logistical need for large rivers to accommodate supply ships more than by defensibility. These rivers were dotted with purpose-built military docks (portus exceptionales). The protection of supply convoys on the rivers was the responsibility of the fluvial flotillas (classes) under the command of the <b>riverine</b> duces. The Notitia gives no information about the Rhine flotillas (as the Rhine frontier had collapsed by the time the Western section was compiled), but mentions 4 classes Histricae (Danube flotillas) and 8 other classes in tributaries of the Danube. Each flotilla was commanded by a praefectus classis who reported to the local dux. It appears that each dux on the Danube disposed of at least one flotilla (one, the dux Pannoniae, controlled three).|$|E
5|$|One {{factor that}} reduces the chances of re-discovering the white-eyed martin is the drastic decline {{in the numbers of}} {{swallows}} wintering at Bueng Boraphet, its only known site, from the hundreds of thousands reported around 1970 to maximum counts of 8,000 made in the winter of 1980–1981. It is not certain whether this represents a real decline or a shift in site in response to persecution. Other potential causes for the species' decline include the disturbance of <b>riverine</b> sand bars, the construction of dams which flood the area upstream and alter the downstream hydrology, deforestation, and increasing conversion of its habitat to agriculture. Very few swallows now roost in the Bueng Boraphet reedbeds, preferring sugarcane plantations, and, despite searching, the white-eyed river martin has not been found in other nearby large swallow roosts. Bueng Boraphet has been declared a non-hunting area in an effort to protect the species, but surveys to find this martin have been unsuccessful. Past surveys include several at Bueng Boraphet, a 1969 survey of the Nan Yom and Wang Rivers of northern Thailand, and a 1996 survey of rivers in northern Laos. A possible unverified sighting was reported in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Sibu is {{the main}} tourist gateway to the Upper Rajang River, with its small <b>riverine</b> towns and its many Iban and Orang Ulu longhouses. Among the notable {{landmarks}} in Sibu are Wisma Sanyan, the tallest building in Sarawak, Lanang Bridge (one of the longest river bridge in Sarawak) and the biggest town square in Malaysia near the Wisma Sanyan. Lau King Howe Hospital Memorial Museum is {{the first and the}} only medical museum in Malaysia. Sibu Central Market is the biggest indoor market in Sarawak. Among the tourists attractions in Sibu are Sibu Heritage Centre, Tua Pek Kong Temple, Bawang Assan longhouses, Sibu Old Mosque, Jade Dragon Temple, Bukit Aup Jubilee Park, Bukit Lima Forest Park, Sibu Night Market, Borneo Cultural Festival (BCF), and Sibu International Dance Festival (SIDF). Timber and shipbuilding industries are the two major economic activities in Sibu.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is a habitat generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and <b>riverine</b> areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were {{integrated}} into a regional trade network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours, and involved the exchange of Manche produce such as cacao, annatto and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This trade monopoly was maintained by force {{on the part of}} the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the Manche Ch'ol remained subservient to them. After the Manche towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland Manche settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancuén River drainage traded via land and <b>riverine</b> routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpetén) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with Cobán and Cahabón).|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} {{shares the}} genus Camelus with the Bactrian camel (C. bactrianus) {{and the wild}} Bactrian camel (C. ferus). The dromedary belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) {{was the first to}} describe the species of Camelus. He named two species in his History of Animals; the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel. The dromedary was given its current binomial name Camelus dromedarius by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae. In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the <b>riverine</b> type slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between these two types.|$|E
5|$|The {{new weapons}} {{meant that the}} {{existing}} coastal and <b>riverine</b> forts were rendered largely obsolete. The American Civil War was soon to demonstrate that traditional brick and masonry forts could be reduced to rubble by rifled guns. The government's response was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. The Royal Commission recommended that a triangle of forts should be established on the lower Thames, east of Gravesend. This would involve replacing the existing Coalhouse Fort on the Essex shore with a new fortification, similarly replacing the existing Shornemead Fort and building the wholly new Cliffe Fort opposite Coalhouse Point, which would replace the abandoned 18th century battery at Lower Hope Point. The location of the forts would enable interlocking arcs of fire from their guns. A boom defence and a minefield would be installed off Coalhouse Point in wartime to further boost {{the strength of the}} defences.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{predominant}} {{environment is}} open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands {{of the park}} have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a <b>riverine</b> forest along the permanent river {{in the south of}} the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{base for}} the KJRM was in the Bay of Kotor on the {{southern}} Adriatic coast. It encompassed the Tivat Arsenal {{and a number of}} schools and other establishments. Other bases were located at Šibenik in central Dalmatia and Selce, a small port nestled behind the island of Krk in the northern Adriatic. The Yugoslav coastline extended for , and there were over 600 Yugoslav islands in the Adriatic. The main <b>riverine</b> port was at Novi Sad on the Danube. Throughout its existence, the KJRM struggled with logistical difficulties associated with foreign-made ships and naval armament. The KJRM grew from slightly over 3,000 officers and men soon after its establishment to a strength of more than 9,000 immediately prior to World War II. Ship crews ranged from 240 for the flotilla leader Dubrovnik and 145 for the Beograd-class destroyers, to just five for the Uskok-class MTBs.|$|E
