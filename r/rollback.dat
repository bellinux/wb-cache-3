Savimbi developed close relations with influential American conservatives, who saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and <b>rollback</b> Soviet-backed, undemocratic governments around the world. The conflict quickly escalated, with both Washington and Moscow seeing it as a critical strategic conflict in the Cold War.|$|E

According to a 2014 study, the ACA likely prevented an estimated 50,000 preventable patient deaths from 2010 to 2013. City University public health professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler wrote in January 2017 that a <b>rollback</b> of the ACA's Medicaid expansion alone would cause an estimated 43,956 deaths annually.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple and {{efficient}} method, called ARIES (Algorithm for Recouery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics), which supports partial <b>rollbacks</b> of transactions, finegranularity (e. g., record) locking and recovery using write-ahead logging (WAL). We introduce the paradigm of repeating history to redo all missing updates before performing the <b>rollbacks</b> of the loser transactions during restart after a system failure. ARIES uses a log sequence number in each page to correlate the state of a page with respect to logged updates of that page. All updates of a transaction are logged, including those performed during <b>rollbacks.</b> By appropriate chaining of the log records written during <b>rollbacks</b> to those written during forward progress, a bounded amount of logging is ensured during <b>rollbacks</b> {{even in the face}} of repeated failures during restart or of nested <b>rollbacks</b> We deal with a variety of features that are very Important in building and operating an industrial-strength transaction processing system ARIES supports fuzzy checkpoints, selective and deferred restart, fuzzy image copies, media recovery, and high concurrency lock modes (e. g., increment /decrement) which exploit the semantics of the operations and require the ability to perform operation logging.

5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled {{backward into}} the Woodley Park – Zoo / Adams Morgan station and hit an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backward into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add <b>rollback</b> protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E
5|$|This {{shift in}} the {{economic}} policies of the BJP was also visible in state governments, especially in Gujarat, where the BJP held power for 16 years. Modi's government, in power from 2002 to 2014, followed a strongly neo-liberal agenda, presented as a drive towards development. Its policies have included extensive privatisation of infrastructure and services, {{as well as a}} significant <b>rollback</b> of labour and environmental regulations. While this was praised by the business community, commentators criticised it as catering to the BJP's upper class constituency instead of the poor.|$|E
5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and his policy of <b>rollback</b> in Korea failed. The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949.

5|$|On October 23 Biden {{revealed}} {{his health care}} plan. It called for expanded coverage {{for children and adults}} but stops short of mandates for complete universal coverage. It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment. Biden stated it would cost between $80billion and $110billion per year. He said it could have been paid with a <b>rollback</b> of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The plan would also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, {{the owners}} were {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, {{and that the}} league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% <b>rollback</b> on salaries.|$|E

40|$|Data distribution, {{degree of}} data replication, and {{transaction}} access patterns are key factors {{in determining the}} performance of distributed database systems. In order to simplify the evaluation of performance measures, database designers and researchers tend to make simplistic assumptions about the system. The effect is studied of modeling assumptions on the evaluation of one such measure, the number of transaction <b>rollbacks,</b> in a partitioned distributed database system. Six probabilistic models and expressions are developed for the numbers of <b>rollbacks</b> under each of these models. Essentially, the models differ {{in terms of the}} available system information. The analytical results so obtained are compared to results from simulation. From here, it is concluded that most of the probabilistic models yield overly conservative {{estimates of the number of}} <b>rollbacks.</b> The effect of transaction commutativity on system throughout is also grossly undermined when such models are employed...|$|R
5|$|In 1922, the {{boundaries}} of the Clause were further defined when Senator William S. Kenyon was allowed to accept an appointment by President Warren G. Harding as circuit judge for the Eighth Circuit. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty concluded that no disqualifying event had occurred because the increase in emoluments to that office had occurred in a term prior to the one Kenyon was serving {{at the time of the}} nomination. (Daugherty's opinion would later be reaffirmed by the Clinton administration when Representative Bill Richardson was nominated as U.N. Ambassador.) No <b>rollback</b> was attempted when Senator Hugo Black was appointed to the Supreme Court, and in Ex parte Levitt, the court rejected, for lack of legal standing, an attempt to prevent Black from taking his seat based on Ineligibility Clause objections. The movant in the Black case, Albert Levitt, only had an interest in the case as a United States Citizen and a member of the Supreme Court bar, which the Court found to be insufficient.|$|E

However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|Biden is {{considered}} to be a moderate liberal, clocking a 77.5 percent liberal voting record in 2006 and lifetime score of 76.8 percent. Biden is Pro-Choice on abortion rated 100% by NARAL and supports a state's right to have civil unions. He favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and a <b>rollback</b> of the Bush tax cuts. He supports the PATRIOT Act, the war in Afghanistan and voted in favor of authorization of military force into Iraq. He believes a political solution can be met in Iraq through federalization. Biden would favor American military intervention into Sudan to end the Darfur genocide. He supports Gun control and was given an F by the NRA. He opposes the No Child Left Behind Act although he voted in favor of it in 2002. Biden opposes capital punishment and supports the continuation of the war on drugs. In 2007 he voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill and supports a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Biden opposes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and believes that the government must take action against global warming.|$|E

25|$|Slab <b>rollback</b> is {{not always}} a {{continuous}} process suggesting an episodic nature. The episodic nature of the <b>rollback</b> is explained by a change in the density of the subducting plate, such as the arrival of buoyant lithosphere (a continent, arc, ridge, or plateau), a change in the subduction dynamics, or a change in the plate kinematics. The age of the subducting plates does not have any effect on slab <b>rollback.</b> Nearby continental collisions have an effect on slab <b>rollback.</b> Continental collisions induce mantle flow and extrusion of mantle material, which causes stretching and arc-trench <b>rollback.</b> In the area of the Southeast Pacific, there have been several <b>rollback</b> events resulting in the formation of numerous back-arc basins.|$|E
25|$|Back-arc basins are {{hypothesized}} to form {{as a result}} of trench <b>rollback</b> (also, hinge <b>rollback).</b> This is the backward motion of the subduction zone relative to the motion of the plate which is being subducted. As the subduction zone and its associated trench pull backward, the overriding plate is stretched, thinning the crust which is manifest in the back-arc basin. Sedimentation is strongly asymmetric, with most of the sediment supplied from the active magmatic arc which regresses in step with the <b>rollback</b> of the trench.|$|E
25|$|Trenches seem {{positionally}} stable over time, {{but scientists}} believe that some trenches—particularly those associated with subduction zones where two oceanic plates converge—move backward into the subducting plate. This is called trench <b>rollback</b> or hinge retreat (also hinge <b>rollback)</b> and is one explanation {{for the existence of}} back-arc basins.|$|E

25|$|Seismic {{tomography}} provides {{evidence for}} slab <b>rollback.</b> Results demonstrate high temperature anomalies within the mantle suggesting subducted material {{is present in}} the mantle. Ophiolites are viewed as evidence for such mechanisms as high pressure and temperature rocks are rapidly brought to the surface through the processes of slab <b>rollback,</b> which provides space for the exhumation of ophiolites.|$|E
25|$|Interactions {{with the}} mantle {{discontinuities}} {{play a significant}} role in slab <b>rollback.</b> Stagnation at the 660-km discontinuity causes retrograde slab motion due to the suction forces acting at the surface. Slab <b>rollback</b> induces mantle return flow, which causes extension from the shear stresses at the base of the overriding plate. As slab <b>rollback</b> velocities increase, circular mantle flow velocities also increase, accelerating extension rates. Extension rates are altered when the slab interacts with the discontinuities within the mantle at 410km and 660km depth. Slabs can either penetrate directly into the lower mantle, or can be retarded due to the phase transition at 660km depth creating a difference in buoyancy. An increase in retrograde trench migration (slab <b>rollback)</b> (2–4cm/yr) is a result of flattened slabs at the 660-km discontinuity where the slab does not penetrate into the lower mantle. This is the case for the Japan, Java and Izu-Bonin trenches. These flattened slabs are only temporarily arrested in the transition zone. The subsequent displacement into the lower mantle is caused by slab pull forces, or the destabilization of the slab from warming and broadening due to thermal diffusion. Slabs that penetrate directly into the lower mantle result in slower slab <b>rollback</b> rates (~1–3cm/yr) such as the Mariana arc, Tonga arcs.|$|E
