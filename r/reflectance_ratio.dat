40|$|The {{leaf area index}} (LAI) is one of {{the most}} {{important}} Earth surface parameters used in the modeling of ecosystems and their interaction with climate. Numerous vegetation indices have been developed to estimate the LAI. However, because of the effects of the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), most of these vegetation indices are also sensitive to the effect of BRDF. In this study, we aim to present a new BRDF-resistant vegetation index (BRVI), which is sensitive to the LAI but insensitive to the effect of BRDF. Firstly, the BRDF effects of different bands were investigated using both simulated data and in-situ measurements of winter wheat made at different growth stages. We found bi-directional shape similarity in the solar principal plane between the green and the near-infrared (NIR) bands and between the blue and red bands for farmland soil conditions and with medium chlorophyll content level. Secondly, the consistency of the shape of the BRDF across different bands was employed to develop a new BRDF-resistant vegetation index for estimating the LAI. The <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratios</b> of the NIR band to the green band and the blue band to the red band were reasonably assumed to be resistant to the BRDF effects. Nevertheless, the variation amplitude of the bi-directional reflectance in the solar principal plane was different for different bands. The divisors in the two <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratios</b> were improved by combining the reflectances at the red and green bands. The new BRVI was defined as a normalized combination of the two improved <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratios.</b> Finally, the potential of the proposed BRVI for estimation of the LAI was evaluated using both simulated data and in-situ measurements and also compared to other popular vegetation indices. The results showed that the influence of the BRDF on the BRVI was the weakest and that the BRVI retrieved LAI values well, with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 84 and an RMSE of 0. 83 for the field data and with an R 2 of 0. 97 and an RMSE of 0. 25 for the simulated data.

40|$|International audienceA {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} to infer the altitude of aerosol plumes {{over the ocean}} from <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratio</b> measurements in the O 2 absorption A-band (759 to 770 nm). The <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is defined as the}} ratio of the reflectance in a first spectral band, strongly attenuated by O 2 absorption, and the reflectance in a second spectral band, minimally attenuated. For a given surface reflectance, simple relations are established between the <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratio</b> and the altitude of an aerosol layer, as a function of atmospheric conditions and the geometry of observation. The expected accuracy for various aerosol loadings and models is first quantified using an accurate, high spectral resolution, radiative transfer model that fully accounts for interactions between scattering and absorption. The method is developed for POLDER and MERIS, satellite sensors with adequate spectral characteristics. The simulations show that the method is only accurate over dark surfaces when aerosol optical thickness at 765 nm is relatively large (> 0. 3). In this case, the expected accuracy is on the order of ± 0. 5 km or ± 0. 2 km for POLDER or MERIS respectively. More accurate estimates are obtained with MERIS, since in this case the spectral <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratio</b> is more sensitive to aerosol altitude. However, a precise spectral calibration is needed for MERIS. The methodology is applied to MERIS and POLDER imagery acquired over marine surfaces. The estimated aerosol altitude is compared with in situ lidar profiles of backscattering coefficient measured during the AOPEX- 2004 experiment for MERIS, or obtained with the space-borne lidar CALIOP for POLDER. The retrieved altitudes agree with lidar measurements {{in a manner consistent with}} theory.

Active regions, such as Hapi, the active pits of Seth and Ma’at, the clustered and isolated bright features in Imhotep, the alcoves in Seth and Ma’at, and the large alcove in Anuket, have bluer spectra than the overall surface.

To obtain {{a range of}} ray blight disease intensities, replicated plots were treated with fungicides that varied in efficacy to control ray blight. Visual disease assessments and measurement of canopy reflectance were made at least once during spring (September through December). Visual assessments involved removal of flowering stems at ground level from which measurements of defoliation severity and the incidence of stems with ray blight were obtained. Reflectance of sunlight from pyrethrum canopies was measured at 485, 560, 660, 830, and 1, 650 nm using a handheld multispectral radiometer.

As a by-product of the methodology, effective leaf area index (LAIe) estimates were derived and compared to hemispherical photography-derived values. To assess the influence of LiDAR aggregation area size on the estimates in a sparse canopy environment, LiDAR CHPs and LAIes were generated by aggregating waveforms to plot- and site-level footprints (plot/site-aggregated) as well as in 5 m grids (grid-processed). LiDAR profiles were then compared to leaf biomass field profiles generated based on field tree measurements. The correlation between field and LiDAR profiles was very high, with a mean R 2 of 0. 75 at plot-level and 0. 86 at site-level for 55 plots and the corresponding 11 sites.

A large set of reflectance and absorption spectra as well as relevant water quality parameters was collected over a period of three years in Nebraska lakes of different origins and morphometrics. A conceptual model originally developed for remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation, was tuned according to the optical characteristics of turbid productive waters and successfully used to predict Chl of independent data sets.

Differences in spectral response between treatments were attributed to varying soil cover, leaf area index, and leaf pigmentation values, all of which changed with N treatment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT] In {{estimating}} the vegetation coverage from NDVI (Normalized Vegetation Index, Rouse et. al., 1974) or SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, Huete, 1988) which are {{calculated from the}} satellite data, the vegetation density within a pixel affect the results. To eliminate this undesirable effect, an optimum vegetation index (OPVI) is {{presented in this paper}} In this method, the vegetation coverage within each pixel is calculated from the <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratio</b> of radiance in TM 5 band to that in TM 7 band. Then, if the <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratio</b> is larger or smaller than a critical value, we select either NDVI or SAVI for calculating the vegetation index in each pixel. In this case, the critical value must be set in advance. For determining the critical value, the relationship between vegetation coverage and the <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratio</b> are studied from the spectral reflectance of plants and soils as a function of ratio of coverage area of plants to that of soils in the laboratory. Then, the critical value is determined by comparing the results obtained by NDVI and SAVI. Comparison of results obtained by OPVI method with those by both NDVI and SAVI are made by using the satellite data collected in and around oases in Taklimakan Desert in China since the vegetation is expected to vary over the wide range. The results show that OPVI gives a better indicator of actual vegetation cover in an arid area than single NDVI or SAVI alone...|$|E
40|$|New {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} multispectral {{data of the}} Moon were obtained by the Galileo spacecraft in December, 1990. These data were calibrated with Earth-based spectral observations of the nearside to compare compositional information to previously uncharacterized mare basalts filling craters and basins on the western near side and eastern far side. A Galileo-based spectral classification scheme, modified from the Earth-based scheme developed by Pieters, designates the different spectral classifications of mare basalt observed using the 0. 41 / 0. 56 micron <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratio</b> (titanium content), 0. 56 micron reflectance values (albedo), and 0. 76 / 0. 99 micron <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratio</b> (absorption due to Fe(2 +) in mafic minerals and glass). In addition, age determinations from crater counts and results of a linear spectral mixing model {{were used to assess}} the volcanic histories of specific regions of interest. These interpreted histories were related to models of mare basalt petrogenesis in an attempt to better understand the evolution of lunar volcanism...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{hand-held}} reflectometer {{was used}} to estimate the shoot DM yield of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), groundnuts, cowpeas, weeds and grass swards non-destructively. While the instrument was able to predict shoot DM well for single, standing millet and cowpea plants and proved useful for a growth analysis of millet, its reliability was unsatisfactory for groundnuts. For millet, the slope of two separate regressions between the difference of <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratios</b> and shoot DM taken 10 d apart, was almost identical. This suggests a possible simplification in future crop growth models. The usefulness of the instrument for estimating stand DM in natural species mixtures such as weeds and grasses depended on the homogeneity of the mixture and the uniformity of their physiological stat...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{evaluation}} of chemical transport models (CTMs) with aerosol optical depth (AOD) products retrieved from satellite backscattered reflectances can be compromised by inconsistent assumptions of aerosol optical properties and errors in surface reflectance estimates. We present an improved AOD retrieval algorithm for the MODIS satellite instrument using locally derived surface reflectances and CTM aerosol optical properties for the 0. 47, 0. 65, and 2. 13 μm MODIS channels. Assuming negligible atmospheric reflectance at 2. 13 μm in cloud-free conditions, we derive 0. 65 / 2. 13 surface <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratios</b> at 1 ° X 1. 25 ° horizontal resolution for the continental United States in summer 2004 from the subset of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data with minimal aerosol reflectance. We obtain a mean ratio of 0. 57 ± 0. 10 for the continental United States, with high values over arid regions and low values over the Midwest prairies. The higher surface <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratios</b> explain the high AOD bias over arid regions found in previous MODIS retrievals. We calculate TOA reflectances for each MODIS scene using local aerosol optical properties from the GEOS-Chem CTM, and fit these reflectances to the observed MODIS TOA reflectances for a best estimate of AODs for that scene. Comparison with coincident ground-based (AERONET) AOD observations at 16 {{sites in the}} western and central United States in summer 2004 shows poor correlation in the daily data but the correlation improves as averaging time increases. Averaging over the available coincident observations (n = 11 – 44 days) results in strong correlations (R 0. 47 μm = 0. 90, R 0. 65 μm = 0. 67) and a 19 % low bias, representing considerable improvement over the operational MODIS AOD products in this region...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this work is to {{describe}} how the visual system groups surfaces of unequal lightness under complex patterns of illumination. We propose that the Gestalt principle of Grouping by Regularity explains this process better than the more often cited principle of Grouping by Similarity. In our first experiment we demonstrate that in a perceptual organization task, pitting proximity against illumination gradients, discounting the illuminant was contingent upon the periodicity of the illuminant. Traditional theories of lightness constancy and discounting the illuminant (Rock, Nijhawan, Palmer, & Tudor, 1992) cannot account for such effects. Three more experiments show that grouping is affected more by local luminance <b>ratios</b> than constant <b>reflectance</b> <b>ratios.</b> We conclude from these findings that Grouping by Regularity is a powerful grouping principle that operates pre-constancy...|$|R
