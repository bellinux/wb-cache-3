40|$|The {{effects of}} regular and {{frequent}} increases in charges {{for health care}} on patient utilisation are analysed using monthly data on National Health Service (NHS) prescribed drugs in England for the period 1979 - 1985. Using a partial adjustment model a utilisation equation of prescribed drugs is estimated for the adult non-elderly population that {{is subject to the}} NHS prescription charge. The maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficients of the equation imply that the charges policy followed in the U. K. has led to a significant reduction in utilisation among non-exempt patients. The short-run price elasticity of utilisation is [...] 0. 109 and the long-run elasticity is [...] 0. 09, while exempt utilisation is unaffected. Although the policy has generated a reduction in the central Government expenditure for prescribed drugs, {{on the basis of these}} estimates around 66 % of these savings arise from the reduction in service use as opposed to the increased <b>revenue</b> <b>per</b> <b>item</b> of drugs. charges health care utilisation...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess the}} {{validity}} of the item as a measure of the volume of a drug prescribed; and to investigate the possibility that higher quantities <b>per</b> <b>item</b> are prescribed for patients who are not exempt from the prescription charge. DESIGN [...] Five substudies. For the first, a frequency distribution was derived of the different quantities <b>per</b> <b>item</b> of 10 commonly used drugs prescribed by 20 randomly selected practices in each of five family health service authority areas. For the second, the variation in average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> for the same drugs in the same practices was calculated. For the third and fourth, variation in average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> for 90 commonly used drugs was calculated for all 90 family health service authorities and for all 14 regional health authorities in England. For the fifth, the average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> for each of the 90 drugs was regressed on the percentage of items exempt from the prescription charge, at family health service authority level, and the percentage of variation explained by the regression found. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Distribution of quantity per item; variation in average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> between the practices, between family health service authorities, and between regions; and percentage of variation between family health service authorities accounted for by exemption from the prescription charge. RESULTS [...] Wide variation was found in the quantities <b>per</b> <b>item</b> prescribed by the practices, and in the average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> between practices and between family health service authorities. No family health service authority was consistently high or low in quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> across the 90 drugs. Variation in average quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> was less at regional than at family health service authority level, though still high for many of the drugs. The proportion of variation accounted for by exemption from prescription charges ranged from 0 % to 49 % across the 90 drugs. CONCLUSIONS [...] The item is unsuitable as a measure of prescribing volume, even at regional level: a new measure, based on standard daily dosages, is needed. The percentage of the variation in quantity <b>per</b> <b>item</b> accounted for by exemption is inconsistent, and in over half the 90 drugs it was below 20 % [...] therefore it is not a useful predictor...|$|R

40|$|This {{study used}} the Ricardian {{approach}} that captures farmer adaptations to varying environmental factors {{to analyze the}} impact of climate change on crop farming in Ethiopia. By collecting data from farm households in different agro-ecological zones of the county, net crop <b>revenue</b> <b>per</b> hectare was regressed on climate, household and soil variables. The results show that these variables {{have a significant impact}} on the net crop <b>revenue</b> <b>per</b> hectare of farmers under Ethiopian conditions. The seasonal marginal impact analysis indicates that marginally increasing temperature during summer and winter would significantly reduce crop net <b>revenue</b> <b>per</b> hectare whereas marginally increasing precipitation during spring would significantly increase net crop <b>revenue</b> <b>per</b> hectare. Moreover, the net crop revenue impact of predicted climate scenarios from three models (CGM 2, HaDCM 3 and PCM) for the years 2050 and 2100 indicated that there would be a reduction in crop net <b>revenue</b> <b>per</b> hectare by the years 2050 and 2100. Moreover, the reduction in net <b>revenue</b> <b>per</b> hectare by the year 2100 would be more than the reduction by the year 2050 indicating the damage that climate change would pose increases with time unless this negative impact is abated through adaptation. Additionally, results indicate that the net revenue impact of climate change is not uniformly distributed across the different agro-ecological zones of Ethiopia. Copyright 2009 The author 2009.
