25|$|In April 1989, in {{preparation}} for the privatisation of London bus services, London Buses was divided into 11 arm's-length business units based on different garages. Eight units inherited Routemasters: CentreWest, East London, Leaside, London Central, London General, London Northern, London United and South London. During this time, following the failure and premature withdrawal of heralded <b>replacement</b> <b>vehicle</b> classes such as the Daimler Fleetlines, the Routemasters that had not yet been disposed of saw their lives extended for use until privatisation. Where new route tenders called for Routemaster operation, these were leased from London Buses.|$|E

Noonan and Geraghty were on board the vehicle {{alongside}} their manager and a friend. Brian Crosby, Dominic Phillips, and Tim O'Donovan were inside the hotel. Fire fighters were called to the scene shortly after 3:30am and spent ninety minutes fanning the blaze, which started in the bus ventilation/air-conditioning unit and caused an estimated $50,000 (€32,000) worth of damage. Talking to local newspaper the Boston Herald, the band's manager, Foye Johnson said: [...] "The guys were basically around the bus, which {{was a good thing}} because {{we were able to get}} all the equipment and instruments out."

2500|$|There {{have been}} many rumours about a <b>replacement</b> <b>vehicle</b> type. This is most likely the larger, higher-capacity 4x4 or 6x6 Pinzgauer forward-control vehicle similar to the now disused Land Rover 101 forward control, given that the current Land Rover design is also {{reaching}} its weight limits due to the increasing amounts of communications and weapons gear used by modern patrol forces. [...] The OVIK Crossway CROSSWAY vehicle has also been mooted as a possible replacement with its 5.4 tonne capacity in 4x4 format and 7.5 tonne capacity in 6x6 format.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, {{studies were}} {{initiated}} {{about a possible}} <b>replacement</b> <b>vehicle</b> for the AMX 30: the Engin Principal Prospectif. In 1971, {{in view of the}} inferiority of the AMX 30 in comparison to the new generation of Soviet tanks about to be introduced, the Direction des Armements Terrestres ordered the beginning of the Char Futur project. In 1975, a working committee was created that in 1977 agreed on a list of specifications. In February 1980 however, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Federal Republic of Germany involving the joint development of a MBT, called the Napoléon I in France and Kampfpanzer III in Germany. Fundamental disagreements about its desired configuration led to a failure of this cooperation in December 1982. It was announced that a purely French battle tank would be developed, called [...] "EPC" [...] (Engin Principal de Combat). The importation of foreign equipment, like the M1 Abrams, the Leopard 2, or the Merkava, had been studied and rejected.|$|E
