40|$|Growth of <b>round</b> <b>ingots</b> is {{cost-effective}} for sheets but leaves unused space when round {{cells are}} packed into a module. This reduces the packing efficiency, which approaches 95 % for square cells, to about 78 % {{and reduces the}} conversion efficiency of the module by the same ratio. Shaping these ingots into squares with regrowth of cut silicon improves the packing factor, but increases growth cost. The cost impact on solar cell modules was determined by considering shaping ingots in stages from full round to complete square. The sequence of module production with relevant price allocation guidelines is outlined. The severe penalties in add-on price due to increasing slice thickness and kerf are presented. Trade-offs between advantages of recycling silicon and shaping costs are developed for different slicing scenarios. It is shown that shaping results in cost saving of up to 21 % for a 15 cm dia. ingot...|$|R

40|$|The {{blanking}} {{conversion of}} {{titanium alloy ingots}} is studied. The purpose {{is to develop a}} process for manufacturing the high-quality titanium alloy billets by the radial shear rolling of large-sized <b>round</b> <b>ingots.</b> A dependence of the tangential rolling-out factor on the process cyclic recurrence is detected for the multipass rolling of large sized titanium ingots. A distribution of the factor in passes and a deformation centre distance is determined. Semiempiric formula for calculating the maximum width and the contact surface area are obtained. A technique of the calculation of the energy and force parameters is redetermined. The efficiency of the application of the radial shear rolling to the intensive structure working of the large-sezed titanium ingots is shown. The judicious rolling conditions affording the manufacture of high-quality billets are determined. The commercial technology of the blanking conversion of verious titanium alloy ingots with a diameter of 420 - 770 mm is developed. The technology developed has been adorpted at the RSP- 500 stand at Chepetsk Machinery Plant and formed the basis for the request for proposal of the RSP- 800 stand.

50|$|SR 299 {{continues}} through <b>Ingot,</b> <b>Round</b> Mountain, Montgomery Creek, Hillcrest (after the rest area), Burney, and Johnson Park. The highway intersects with SR 89 before continuing through Fall River Mills and McArthur, {{where there is}} an intersection with CR A19. SR 299 then crosses into Lassen County, where it passes through Nubieber and Bieber before intersecting CR A2. The highway crosses into Modoc County and passes through Adin, where it runs concurrently with SR 139 and passes through Modoc National Forest. The concurrency lasts for several miles before SR 299 turns east and enters the city of Alturas. SR 299 runs concurrently with US 395 before turning east again and passing through Cedarville, near the Cedarville Airport. SR 299 ends at the Nevada state line.|$|R
