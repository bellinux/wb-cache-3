The analysis focuses on conducted immunity of the PLC channel to noise {{generated by the}} terminal units of the power line (PL).

Closed-form expressions for signal and noise contributions at the <b>receiving</b> <b>modem</b> are derived, and used to develop design rules for the involved coupling/decoupling networks. By combining the spectral properties of the PL noise with the propagation properties of the link, it is shown that DM signaling, besides assuring a nearly flat channel frequency response, results to be more immune to the PL noise. Finally, the role that possible unbalance of the power units may play on the system conducted immunity and radiation properties is discussed by deriving analytical expressions of the longitudinal (LCL) and transversal conversion loss (TCL) associated with the PL terminal networks...|$|R

Historically, SEMG systems employ surface (skin) mounted sensors that transmit electrical muscle data to a computer base via an umbilical cord. A typical SEMG analysis may exercise multiple sensors, each representing a unique data channel, positioned about the patient 2 ̆ 7 s body. Data transmission cables are linked between the surface mounted sensor nodes and a backpack worn by the patient. As the number of sensors increases, the patient 2 ̆ 7 s freedom of mobility decreases due to the lengthy data cables linked between the surface sensors and the backpack. An N-channel wireless SEMG system has been developed based on the ZigBee wireless standard. The system includes N-channels, each consisting of a wireless ZigBee transmitting modem, an 8 -bit microcontroller, a low-pass filter and a pre-amplifier. All channels stream data to a central computer via a wireless <b>receiving</b> <b>modem</b> attached directly to the computer.

40|$|The {{quantification}} of the EEG power (qEEG) {{in different}} frequency bands, and their spatial distribution improve {{the sensitivity of}} the technique, although questions have been raised about the reproducibility of the results. The aim of the present work was to study the reproducibility of some quantitative parameters in clinical routine EEG, and their clinical application in the study of patients with type I diabetes. Paper I is a study of the variability of EEG power spectrum, considering its time course in resting conditions, and the relationship between the spectral parameters and the length of the analysed segments. Recordings were performed in 57 normal subjects, with a protocol consisting of regular cycles with open eyes (5 s) followed by closed eyes (55 s) repeated during 15 min. The power spectrum showed a systematic decrease in alpha and beta power and increase in delta and theta power, both within the closed eyes periods and over the entire recordings. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the power of 4 s epochs was in the range 0. 49 - 0. 67 (delta), 0. 53 - 0. 58 (theta), 0. 58 - 0. 76 (alpha), 0. 37 - 0. 49 (beta) and 0. 09 - 0. 12 for die alpha peak frequency. CV decreased proportionally to the square root of the sample size. Increasing the recording length from 40 to 400 s increased CV by 36 % (alpha), 41 % (beta), 29 % (delta) and 35 % (theta), while the standard error of the mean decreased by 55 - 60 %. In conclusion, the EEG power estimates are heavily dependent on the length of the analyzed segments, and the way they are selected. This observation is particularly relevant for clinical and drug studies where short parts of the recordings are often used, which may lead to a bias in the estimation of the EEG parameters. The present data provide an estimate on the minimal length of EEG required for a given level of variability. In Paper II a clinical study applying the aforementioned protocol was performed on patients with type I diabetes. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify whether adolescents with type I diabetes <b>receiving</b> <b>modem</b> multiple insulin injection therapy (MIT) have abnormal EEGs, and to elucidate possible correlations with a history of severe hypoglycaemia, poor metabolic control and nerve conduction defects. Thirty-five patients (age 14 - 19 years) with disease duration 7. 6 ± 4. 6 years, and 45 healthy control subjects were investigated. The EEGs of the patients showed an increased slow activity (delta and theta) and a reduction in alpha peak frequency, both of which were most pronounced in the frontal regions (p< 0. 001). They also showed a decrease in fast activity, most pronounced bilaterally in the posterior temporal regions (alpha p< 0. 001, beta p< 0. 01, gamma p< 0. 001). A history of severe hypoglycaemia was correlated with a global increase in theta activity (p< 0. 01 - 0. 05). Poor metabolic control, measured as acute and long-term HbA 1 c levels, was correlated with an increase in delta power and a decrease in alpha peak frequency. The decrease in fast activity in the temporal regions was not correlated with any of the studied clinical parameters. It is concluded that recurrent severe hypoglycaemia and poor metabolic control are risk factors for EEG abnormalities in adolescents with type I diabetes receiving MIT treatment. In addition, we found pronounced abnormalities in the temporal regions that were not related to these risk factors...|$|R

However, {{it requires a}} process of adaptation not always achieved because of poor compliance. The role of technology for telemonitoring of NIV compliance is not yet established. Objectives: to compare compliance to NIV and health care utilization of tight follow-up in office visits or with modem communication plus office visits. Design: prospective, single blinded (researchers SP and MC) controlled trial. Population and methods: 40 consecutive, ventilated ALS patients that were by simple random assigned, to a control group (G 1, n= 20) whose compliance and ventilator parameters settings were assessed during office visits, or to an intervention group (G 2, n= 20) where patients <b>received</b> a <b>modem</b> device connected to the ventilator (Goodnight® 425 ST). Results: There were no statistical differences at admission in clinical and demographic characteristics between groups. The amount of intolerant patients was lower in G 2 (ns). No differences over time in parameters settings and compliance. The incidence density of changes in parameters settings throughout the survival period with NIV was lower in G 2 (p< 0. 0001) and it was greater in G 2 during the initial period of days needed to achieve full compliance.

In such a context, the Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) distributed computing approach is an ideal solution. This report focuses on data management operations and coordination activities among peers and their databases. In particular, the report proposes an agent-based cooperative information system architecture consisting of peer agents which cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve information retrieval and integration problems.

Most oceanographic instruments on the seafloor have no connections with the surface and therefore have to run on batteries and store data until recovery. To demonstrate a developing technology, sensors and acoustic modems were powered with energy harvested from the seafloor, and data were relayed acoustically in near–real time to the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) observatory in Monterey Bay, California, and to surface research vessels. MARS is a cabled observatory in deep water (~ 890 m) at the edge of Monterey Canyon. An acoustic modem was attached to the MARS node and configured to send out commands to, and relay data <b>received</b> from, remote <b>modems.</b> Two benthic microbial fuel cells (BMFCs) positioned approximately 0. 5 km away from MARS supplied power to the remote modems and sensors.

The modems utilized in this study contained an integrated power management platform (PMP) designed to manage and store the electrical energy generated by each BMFC and to record BMFC performance parameters and sensor data on an hourly basis. Temperature and either oxygen or conductivity sensors were chosen because of their common use and environmental relevance.

One of the most important applications is to monitor the health care of the patients at anytime and anyplace. In the last two decades, many researchers have focused mainly on heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. Patient 2 ̆ 7 s heart rate variability should be continuously monitored to help them in case of emergency. Under these circumstances, patients are required to have a HRV measuring kit for a constant observation. The proposed project focuses on the development of a heart rate variability measurement system with the use of embedded electronics. This project consists of two systems: transmitter and a receiver side system. The transmitter section composed of sensor, amplifier, processing unit, and display unit, and transmitter module. The sensors, which are pasted on the body, are used to sense the electrical activity of the heart. These electric signals are given to an amplification unit. This amplification unit is designed with IC ADS 1293 to amplify and filter the signals, and also reduce the noise. The output of the amplifier is given to the processing unit. Here, the microcontroller is programmed to process the input signal, and calculate the heart rate. The output of the microcontroller is transmitted to the display unit. The display unit shows the current value of the heart rate. The continuous measurement of heart rate variability is done in the transmitter side system.

This thesis aims at prof ling intemational corbanking practices, operations and management in Australia, leading to answer two questions: why banks choose to enter into corbanking relationships and how they select individual correspondents. Substantial background information derived from chapters of corbanking developments, Australian banking and payment systems, literature reviews and methodology {{opened the way for}} original work on a case study of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and an empirical survey of the intemational corbanking industry.

40|$|Frequently in the past, {{attempts}} have been made to systematize the notion of judicial review of administrative action. Thus, the Donoughmore Commission proposed the judicial, quasi-judicial, purely administrative model of analysis. The Commission was severely criticized, especially after the implementation of certain recommendations of the Franks Report which, in improving the quality of the control exercised on administrative tribunals, underscored the ridiculous character of that existing in other fields. The most violent criticisms came certainly from Griffith and Street, and also from Professor Wade who denounced the progressive atrophy of natural justice, the latter being the main topic of the present article. That concept, distinguished from "procedural ultra vires" in that a judge may look beyond the law for rules he himself has set establishing certain procedural guarantees, goes back a long way in time. Nevertheless, it is not a panacea. Its scope is limited to the study of the means whereby a decision is reached; it does not examine the conclusion, but rather how that conclusion is determinded. The usefulness of the notion was diminished when a condition of its application, the duty to act judicially, was added. Ridge v. Baldwin put the pieces of the puzzle back into place by discarding the decisions which gave the concept a much too restrictive interpretation. These first steps of the fairness concept were rapidly followed in matters concerning the allocation of licences. Judicial intervention here dates back to the last century. Yet, the Nakkuda Ali and Parker decisions restrained the spread of control through an erroneous interpretation of an opinion by Lord Atkin. Both decisions were overturned by the Ridge case. Later on, it seems that Lord Denning took the lead in a movement aimed at extending the scope of the duty to act fairly. That principle <b>received</b> its <b>modem</b> da consecration in the Crockford's decision and was used later in other decisions of a like nature. The late professor de Smith remarked this new tendency to go beyond the words to see, in the matter at issue, what is fair and what is not. Domestic tribunals, not in union matters alone (Breen) but also in sports problems (Machin), have also had this obligation to act fairly imposed on them, even though, strictly speaking, they do not have judicial powers. The question is rather to know whether a legitimate expectation of the person involved in the decision is brought into play, although the extend of the obligation varies depending on the circumstances of the case. It would appear that there is continued refusal to intervene in matters of labour contracts when faced with a purely master and servant relation (Sylva). But now the complete absence of statutory guarantees is required (Malloch). Procedural guarantees have continued to evolve since then. More and more, in different areas, thanks to the initiative of judges like Lord Denning, a system of English administrative law has developed. The principle of the existence of more or less defined minimal procedural guarantees has been established, no matter whether the administrative act implies the exercise of judicial power or not. Yet, British courts still refuse to intervene in legislative functions, including regulations issuing from statutory committees, even should the legislative instrument result from false representations. Control over immigration matters has become increasingly tightened, even though, at one time, there was an apparent desire to sanctify the absolute character of the discretion exercised in that field. The widening ofthat control came about as much from legislative changes as from judicial decisions. Thus it is that in the Re H. K. decision, there was established the duty to act fairly on the part of an immigration officer who might wish to turn a person back at the border whom he considers to be inadmissible. Soon (if it has not already happened) Britons will also benefit from procedural guarantees in matters of land planning. A recent decision made use of the fairness concept in that field. English courts have undertaken to sanctify fundamental procedural guarantees. The name, the scope and the extent of these rules has varied and continues to vary. It would seem, however, that there is a desire to leave the categorization of the act of administration to one side in favour of dealing with the consequences of an act for the individual. If a decision touches an interest, an vested right, or a legitimate expectation, the citizen is entitled to have certain minimal procedural guarantees respected, which may vary according to the circumstances, but which always involve the determination of what is fair in the particular instance. It is a necessary adaptation to the new reality of administration, something we hope to see come about in the very near future in Canada...|$|R
