50|$|Stolnaya (Стольная) is a {{brand of}} vodka {{released}} by OST-Alco. The range consists of Stolnaya Special, Stolnaya <b>Red</b> <b>Bilberry,</b> which is made with cranberries, and Stolnaya Infusion which contains extracts of honey and pepper.|$|E
50|$|In middle Sakhalin in spring, brown bears {{feed on the}} {{previous}} year's <b>red</b> <b>bilberry,</b> ants and flotsam, {{and at the end}} of the season, they concentrate on the shoots and rhizomes of tall grasses. On the southern part of the island, they feed primarily on flotsam, as well as insects and maple twigs. In springtime in Sikhote Alin, they feed on acorns, Manchurian walnuts and Korean nut pine seeds. In times of scarcity, in addition to bilberries and nuts, they capture larvae, wood-boring ants and lily roots. In early summer, they will strip bark from white-barked fir trees and feed on their cambium and sap. They will also eat berries from honeysuckle, yew, Amur grapevine and buckthorn. In southern Sakhalin, their summer diet consists of currants and chokeberries are eaten. In the August period in the middle part of the island, fish comprise 28% of their diet.|$|E
40|$|Fructose is the {{dominant}} monosaccharide in bilberry juice and <b>red</b> <b>bilberry</b> juice, but glucose is dominant in the cranberry juice. Dominant polyphenols are catechine and chlorogenic acid. In the bilberry and <b>red</b> <b>bilberry</b> juices, the most common acids are citric, quinic and tartaric acids, in the cranberry juice – citric, quinic and malic acids. When bilberry juice is heat-treated for 30 min at 98 C  1 C, HMF content is 2 -fold higher than in samples treated at 60 C  1 C. In solutions from lyophilisates of wild berry juice, turbidity and translucent coloration have been determined...|$|E
5000|$|Brightly {{coloured}} {{fruits and}} vegetables are rich in anthocyanins. This makes sense intuitively because anthocyanins offer pigmentation to plants. Blackberries are the most anthocyanin-rich foods, containing 89-211 milligrams per 100 grams. [...] Other foods that are rich in this phytochemical include <b>red</b> onions, blueberries, <b>bilberries,</b> <b>red</b> cabbage, and eggplant. [...] The ingestion {{of any of these}} food sources will yield a variety of phytochemicals in addition to anthocyanins because they naturally exist together. [...] The daily intake of anthocyanins is estimated to be approximately 200 milligrams in the average adult; however, this value can reach several grams per day if an individual is consuming flavonoid supplements.|$|R
40|$|Plants of "Vaccinium" kind, great {{bilberry}} (V. uliginosum L.) belberry (V. myrtillus L.) and <b>red</b> <b>bilberry</b> (V. vitis-ideae L.) {{have been}} investigated in the paper. As a result structural and functional particular features of plants {{have been investigated}} {{for the first time}} on the same objects in natural whereabouts on various heights. The data obtained make an important contribution into the problem of the plant adaptation to conditions of the Kolsky North. The results obtained may be used in the holding of works for the estimation of medicinal raw material stocks, in the delivering of lectures of botany, ecological anatomy and nature protection. The paper results may find their field of application in the development of steps of the protection and rational use of plant resources and they may be used in ecological anatomy, botany, nature protectionAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{commercial}} ethanolic {{extracts from}} medicinal plants were in vitro screened for antibacterial activity against Listonella anguillarum (serotypes O 1 and O 2), Yersinia ruckeri, Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida, and Lactococcus garvieae. Their antimicrobial potential {{was assessed by}} the disc diffusion assay, then minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were established by the broth microdilution method. The extracts of lavender, Lavandula officinalis; lemon balm, Melissa officinalis; basil, Ocimum basilicum; oregano, Origanum vulgare; rosemary, Rosmarinus officinalis; common sage, Salvia officinalis; and <b>red</b> <b>bilberry,</b> Vaccinium vitis-idaea, showed {{a broad spectrum of}} inhibitory effects. The extracts of yarrow, Achillea millefolium; arnica, Arnica montana; marigold, Calendula officinalis; Icelandic lichen, Cetraria islandica; horsetail, Equisetum arvense; grindelia, Grindelia robusta; java tea, Orthosiphon stamineus; and thyme, Thymus vulgaris, were less or not active. P. damselae subsp. piscicida was the most susceptible bacterial strain, while Y. ruckeri was the most resistant. These results can be considered for further investigations aimed to identify novel natural antimicrobial compounds {{that could be used in}} aquaculture for the control of bacterial infections...|$|E
40|$|The Columbia River Gorge {{represents}} an ecocline of shifting environmental factors, species populations, and vegetation associations. Combinations of wind, temperature, and precipitation create different environmental regimes {{from the west}} to the east. The north wall of the Gorge supported four physiognomic associations: western conifer forest, central mixed forest, central broadleaf forest, and eastern steppe. Each association comprised species distributed individually along the ecocline. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), dull Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa), sword fern (Polystichum munitum), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), vine maple (Acer circinatum), and <b>red</b> <b>bilberry</b> (Vaccinium parviflorum) were centered in the western conifer forest. Garry oak (Quercus garryana), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), poison oak (Rhus diversiloba), and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) were centered in the central mixed forest. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), northern buckwheat (Eriogonum compositum), Wyeth's lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus var. humicola), western serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), mockorange (Philadelphus lewisii), and Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa sandbergii) were centered in the eastern steppe. Although the centre of distribution for each species {{was in one of}} the associations, few were confined to a specific association. The Columbia River Gorge is analogous to a mountain turned on its side, with the cool, moist summit to the west and the warm, dry base to the east. Plant species have migrated both eastward and westward along this ecocline during the lifetime of the Gorge, and each association has combinations of species derived from surrounding regions in Washington and Oregon.
