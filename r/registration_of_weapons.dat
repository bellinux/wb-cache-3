5000|$|The legal {{foundations}} {{that the}} National Socialists later {{used for the}} purpose of disarming the Jews were already laid during the Weimar Republic. Starting with the Reichsgesetz über Schusswaffen und Munition (Reich law on firearms and ammunition), enacted on 12 April 1928, weapon purchase permits were introduced, which only allowed [...] "authorized persons" [...] the purchase and possession of firearms. Mandatory <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> was introduced, which gave the government the opportunity of accessing weapon owner and their weapons at any given time. Manufacture and sale of weapons was only permitted if authorized so. The purpose was to ensure that firearms were only issued to [...] "reliable individuals". Starting in 1930, bladed weapons were also regulated. The carrying of weapons in public now required a weapons permit.|$|E
5000|$|Duck {{claimed to}} support [...] "restoring fiscal {{responsibility}} to Washington" [...] by eliminating [...] "the culture {{of corruption and}} fraud, (reexamining) current spending to match current priorities, and (rolling) back the {{tax cut for the}} top two percent of Americans". His infrastructure platform called for ensuring that Maryland can [...] "support water, sewer, transportation and education" [...] while preserving [...] "open spaces... rural heritage (and) affordable housing". On education, he supports increased funding and claims that the No Child Left Behind Act has been a failure due to underfunding and a lack of flexibility. He was an advocate of gun ownership restrictions and sought to reduce gun violence by closing the gun show loophole, providing universal health care, including mental health care, and promoting the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> and a law enforcement focus on violent criminals and anti-gang initiatives. He supported energy independence, believing it can be achieved in 10 years; his proposals included [...] "re-engineering federal buildings to reduce government energy consumption", raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, increasing funding for mass transit, requiring disclosure of home energy costs and offering tax [...] "incentives for energy conservation and (the) use of mass transit." [...] He opposed partially privatizing Social Security. He also advocated federal legislation to change bankruptcy protection so that individuals' retirement is [...] "safe and secure". He supported universal health care and environmental protection, which he claimed was rolled back by the George W. Bush Administration. Specifically, on the environment, he supported the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act and opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; he believed that the Healthy Forests Initiative and the Clear Skies Act {{have a negative impact on}} the environment. Though his website does not cover the issue, Duck has been described as opposed to gay marriage yet in favor of civil unions. His website also does not cover immigration, but he said he was opposed to securing the border and supported greater enforcement immigration-related employment law.|$|E

50|$|The United States Supreme Court, in 1968 {{decided the}} case of Haynes v. United States {{in favor of the}} defendant, which {{effectively}} gutted the National Act of 1934. As one could possess an NFA firearm and choose not to register it, and not face prosecution due to Fifth Amendment protections, the Act was unenforceable. To deal with this, Congress rewrote the Act to make <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>weapons</b> impossible except by the government (previously, an existing firearm could be registered by any citizen). In addition to fixing the defect identified in Haynes, the revision tightened definitions of the firearms regulated by the Act, as well as incorporating a new category of firearm, the Destructive Device, which was first regulated in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.|$|R
