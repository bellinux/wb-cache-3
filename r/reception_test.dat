40|$|The {{relationship}} was explored between a subjective measure of hearing status, {{derived from a}} functional self-assessment {{expressed in terms of}} ability to hear and understand spoken words, and a comparable objective measure of hearing status, obtained from a speech <b>reception</b> <b>test.</b> The Augmentation Survey of the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of the National Center for Health Statistics provided the necessary data for a sample of 3059 adults. Using chi-square tests for the subsample with the highest level of objectively assessed hearing status, favorable subjective assessments were found to be significantly associated with higher income, lower age group, higher level of educational attainment, greater psychological adjustment, fewer symptoms of depression, and higher self-ratings of overall health. In a linear regression with self-assessment of hearing status as the dependent variable, less than one-quarter of the variation could be explained by objective status and the six explanatory variables. ...|$|E

When large-scale PV plants are concerned, this is typically accomplished in three consecutive phases: an energy yield forecast, that is performed {{at the beginning of}} the project and is typically accomplished by means of a simulation exercise performed with dedicated software; a <b>reception</b> <b>test</b> campaign, that is performed at the end of the commissioning and consists of a set of tests for determining the efficiency and the reliability of the PV plant devices; and a performance analysis of the first years of operation, that consists in comparing the real energy production with the one calculated from the recorded operating conditions and taking into account the maintenance records. In the last six years, IES-UPM has offered both indoor and on-site quality control campaigns for more than 60 PV plants, with an accumulated power of more than 300 MW, in close contact with Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contractors and financial entities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to see if there are any {{differences}} between high school girls and boy’s reception ability and memory after reading two Swedish lifestyle magazines. 9 boys and 9 girls from ages 17 - 18 were chosen to participate in the study. They were placed in a room one by one where they had to read one women’s magazine (Cosmopolitan) and one men’s magazine (Café). They did not know this was a memory and <b>reception</b> <b>test</b> until after they finished their reading. With help from former reception studies and the magazines, questions were selected so the interviews would give as much information as possible. The study gave some unexpected results, for example both genders seemed to remember numbers very well even if they didn’t remember the article itself. The myth that boys pay immediate attention to half naked girls more than anything else was not confirmed. They seemed to look at the half naked guys to compare themselves instead. When it comes to who remembered the most, girls outshined the boys. They paid more attention to the magazines and they got higher scores on the questions during the interviews. Overall the participants remembered far less than they thought which indicated that when they read these magazines they don’t think or reflect much.

A Pretest-Posttest Control Group design was employed. The study utilized fifty kindergarten children from Superior Street School located in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The subjects were randomly assigned to the control group and experimental group. Both groups were pretested on the: (1) Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test, (2) Auditory <b>Reception</b> <b>Test,</b> (3) Auditory Sequential Memory Test, (4) Auditory Closure Test, and (5) Sound Blending Test. The last four tests mentioned are subtests relating to auditory discrimination selected from the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities. The experimental group was exposed to eighteen organized Yamaha Music Lessons provided by a Yamaha Music representative. Each lesson took forty-five minutes and was presented twice a week to the experimental group. The experimental group was divided into two smaller groups according to their respective kindergarten teacher and participated in such activities as art and physical education. No special treatment was supplied for the control group. At the conclusion of the experiment, the control group and experimental group were post tested on the same five auditory discrimination tests. The- t test for uncorrelated data was applied to test hypotheses one through five. The t test for correlated data was used to test hypotheses six through fifteen. Each hypothesis was treated independently. The findings of the present study indicate that significant (p<. 05) ratios were attained on only one pretest and posttest comparison for the experimental group on the Auditory Sequential Memory Test. There were no significant ratios attained on the posttest comparisons for the experimental and control groups. There were no significant t ratios attained on the pretest and posttest comparisons for the control group. The significance revealed by the experimental group indicated that the exposure to the organized Yamaha Music Program improves kindergarten children's auditory sequential memory ability...|$|E
40|$|At the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva the new proton-proton {{collider}} ring LHC and {{the experiments}} {{that will be}} operated at this accelerator are currently being finalised. Among these experiments is the multi-purpose detector CMS whose aim it is to discover and investigate new physical phenomena that might become accessible {{by virtue of the}} high center-of-mass energy and luminosity of the LHC. Two of the most intensively studied possibilities are the discovery of the Higgs Boson and of particles from the spectrum of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. CMS is the first large experiment of high-energy particle physics whose inner tracking system is exclusively instrumented with silicon detector modules. This tracker comprises 15148 silicon strip modules enclosing the interaction point in 10 – 12 layers. The 1. Physikalisches Institut B of RWTH Aachen was deeply involved in the completion of the end caps of the tracking system. The institute played {{a leading role in the}} end cap design, produced virtually all support structures and several important electrical components, designed and built the laser alignment system of the tracker, performed system tests and finally integrated one of the two end caps in Aachen. This integration constitutes the central part of the present thesis work. The main focus was on the development of methods to recognise defects early in the integration process and to assert the detector’s functionality. Characteristic quantities such as the detector noise or the optical gain of the readout chain were determined during integration as well as during a series of tests performed after transport of the end cap from Aachen to CERN. These measurements show a constantly high quality of the integrated device. The procedures followed during the mechanical integration of the detector and during the commissioning of integrated sectors are explained, and the software packages developed for quality assurance are described. This part of the document also covers problems that occured in the course of the integration process. In addition, results of the detector readout are presented. It could be shown that more than 99. 5 % of the approximately two million readout channels of the detector are working, that the noise of the silicon modules is below about 2000 electrons and that the common-mode noise is negligible. With these results, reliable signal detection can be expected even towards the end of the foreseen life time of the end cap, when radiation damages will lead to higher noise and reduced signal charge collection. During the integration phase, sub-structures of the end cap – named petals – were subjected to a <b>reception</b> <b>test</b> which has also been designed and operated as part of this thesis work. The test setup and software developed for the test are introduced and an account of the analysis of the recorded data is given. Containing about 20 silicon modules and related readout electronics, petals are the basic building blocks of the end cap system. The <b>reception</b> <b>test</b> mainly confirmed the very good quality of petals delivered by external intitutes and found a small number of defects which could be repaired before integration of the petals into the end cap. Before the end cap project entered the production phase, a final test beam experiment was performed in which the suitability of a system of two fully equipped petals for operation at the LHC was checked. In this last step of the system test for the end caps, stable operation and a good data quality could be verified. The measured ratio of the signal induced in the silicon sensors by minimal ionising particles to the detector noise – in the readout mode relevant for operation at design luminosity – was shown to be greater than 20 for all module geometries. A software for analysing the recorded data was developed and used in all presented studies. This tool was tuned to the special requirements of the test and integration phase of the detector. The functionality of the software and the algorithms it uses are explained. A comparison of the different studies demonstrates the constantly high detector quality in setups of individual petals as well as in systems comprising hundreds of silicon modules in the integrated end cap. At the same time, the reproducibility of the measurements could be established, which is another requirement for successful operation of the tracker end caps in the search of new physics at the LHC...|$|E
40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{contains}} eight main dipole circuits, each of {{them with}} 154 dipole magnets powered in series. These 15 -m-long magnets are wound from Nb-Ti superconducting Rutherford cables, and have active quench detection triggering heaters to quickly force the transition of the coil to the normal conducting state {{in case of a}} quench, and hence reduce the hot spot temperature. During the <b>reception</b> <b>tests</b> in 2002 - 2007, all these magnets have been trained up to at least 12 kA, corresponding to a beam energy of 7. 1 TeV. After installation in the accelerator, the circuits have been operated at reduced currents of up to 6. 8 kA, from 2010 to 2013, corresponding to a beam energy of 4 TeV. After the first long shutdown of 2013 - 2014, the LHC runs at 6. 5 TeV, requiring a dipole magnet current of 11. 0 kA. A significant number of training quenches were needed to bring the 1232 magnets up to this current.

40|$|Nasal balloon autoinflation {{has been}} found in {{clinical}} trials to be an effective, nonsurgical treatment for otitis media with effusion (OME) that is applicable to primary care where most affected children initially present. Research findings suggest that it is a feasible and safe treatment which has the potential to improve ear-related quality of life for children and families, whilst enhancing primary care management and adherence to the NICE recommended 3 month active monitoring period. However, implementing new research findings into routine clinical practice can be challenging. Whilst nasal balloon autoinflation may be effective {{in the context of a}} clinical trial, it is not clear how generaliseable it is to the normal primary care setting. The main aim of this PhD is to facilitate wider implementation of the nasal balloon using the Normalization Process Theory to help understand how the treatment can become routinised and embedded in every day primary care practice. A qualitative study of GPs views and experiences of primary care management of children with OME provided important information about the context for implementation. A secondary analysis of qualitative data from multiple stakeholders (GPs, nurses and parents) then identified that a high quality demonstration video would promote engagement and uptake of the nasal balloon, and thus minimize the potential burden on the GP consultation. A theory-based educational intervention (LittleEARS) was then developed, guided by the medical literature, qualitative enquiry, multi-expert knowledge, and end-user feedback. Additionally, to help facilitate better active monitoring for OME, the Two Alternative Auditory Disability and Speech <b>Reception</b> <b>Test</b> (TADAST) was further developed, evaluated and embedded within the educational intervention. A feasibility study was then conducted to assess acceptability, demand, practicality and implementation of the educational intervention in families of children with OME. The qualitative work has provided a valuable insight into the potential barriers and facilitators for implementation of the nasal balloon for OME in child in primary care. The LittleEARS educational intervention appears to be both appropriate and potentially useful to families of children with OME during the recommended 3 month active monitoring period. However, further work is required to confirm acceptability and feasibility to the wider primary care population. The use of Normalization Process Theory (NPT) helped towards a better understanding of the processes for implementation, and provided an appropriate theoretical framework for my research...|$|E

This was conducted in a well-controlled clinical field trial in 16 hearing-aid users, using a single-blind crossover design. The hearing aid fitting was controlled by insertion gain measurements and measurements with loudness scaling. This study combined laboratory experiments with three consecutive field trials of 4 weeks each. We used performance measurements (speech recognition tests in background noise), paired comparisons, and self-report measurements (questionnaires). The speech recognition or <b>reception</b> <b>tests</b> were performed before and after each field trial, the paired comparisons were performed in weeks 4 and 12, and the questionnaires were administered after each field trial. For all subjects, results were obtained for three different settings: no noise reduction, SSP alone, and TMS alone. In the last week, we also performed speech recognition or <b>reception</b> <b>tests</b> in background noise with both noise reduction concepts combined. Three types of results have been reported: "objective" results from the critical signal to noise ratios for speech recognition or reception in different background noises for different settings and "subjective" results: paired comparisons and questionnaires. The subjective scores show the same trend as the objective scores. The effects of TMS were clearly positive, especially for the speech <b>reception</b> threshold <b>tests</b> and for the paired comparisons. The effects of SSP were much smaller but showed significant benefits with respect to aversiveness and speech perception or reception in noise for specific acoustical environments.
