5|$|The BC Express Company also hired Captain Owen Forrester Browne to be {{the master}} of the BX as he was the most {{experienced}} upper Fraser <b>River</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} the BC Express was Joseph Bucey, an {{experienced}} Skeena <b>River</b> <b>pilot.</b> On the Skeena, he had piloted the Inlander from Port Essington to Hazelton.|$|E
25|$|Nestor {{was built}} at Catlin, Washington, (now west Kelso) in 1902 by Capt. C.P. Stayton (1846-1932), and named after his son, Nestor W. Stayton (1878-1957), who himself {{later became a}} {{steamboat}} captain and Columbia <b>river</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although {{having a}} {{well-established}} agricultural history, Saint-Jean's {{location on the}} Saint Lawrence River prompted also development of maritime and fishing trades. It was especially known for its <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> who would guide vessels through the treacherous Saint Lawrence navigation channel. Over the centuries, {{a great number of}} <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> came from Saint-Jean.|$|R
50|$|The flyer {{also warned}} <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> {{that they would}} receive the same {{treatment}} if they tried {{to bring in the}} Polly. (Another such broadside specifically warning <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> was later issued on December 7.) Consignees of the tea would also suffer dire consequences if they accepted shipment. Captain Ayres was ushered to the Arch Street Wharf and from there returned to his ship. He then refitted the Polly with food and water and sailed it back to Britain, still laden with its cargo of tea.|$|R
25|$|The {{captain of}} the BX was Owen Forrester Browne, an {{experienced}} Fraser <b>River</b> <b>pilot.</b> By the time he took command of the BX in 1910, he was already {{well known in the}} area, as he had been the {{captain of the}} local sternwheeler Charlotte.|$|E
25|$|Once it was raised, Coast Guard {{officials}} from the Marine Investigation Office boarded the ferry and examined the pilot house. One of the radar sets was off, another was on. The radio was turned on, and tuned to channel 13, the same channel used by the <b>river</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Guided by Joseph Thierry, a Huguenot <b>river</b> <b>pilot,</b> two British {{warships}} {{approached the}} fort that dominated Île d'Aix. The guns {{of the fort}} were bombarded into silence by the guns of HMS Magnanime of 74 guns, commanded by Captain Richard Howe, soon joined by HMS Barfleur of 80 guns, and within two hours the island, considered a crucial starting point in any further assault on Rochefort, had fallen to the British.|$|E

25|$|The BC Express was a stern wheel paddle steamer (sternwheeler) that {{operated}} on the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, from 1912 to 1919. The BC Express {{was built for}} the BC Express Company by Alexander Watson, Jr {{to work on the}} upper Fraser River between Tête Jaune Cache and Fort George during the busy years of Grand Trunk Pacific Railway construction. The BC Express Company hired Captain Joseph Bucey, an experienced Skeena <b>River</b> <b>pilot,</b> to be her master.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 she {{was moved}} to a {{custom-built}} dry dock at Greenwich. She was stripped of upper masts, yards, deck-houses and ballast to lighten her before being towed from the East India Import Dock to the special dry dock at Greenwich. The skipper on this occasion was 83-year-old Captain C.E. Irving, who had sailed the world three times in her before he was 17. The <b>river</b> <b>pilot</b> was Ernest Coe. Thereafter the entrance tunnel to the dry dock was filled in, the river wall rebuilt {{and the work of}} re-rigging began. The foundation stone of the dry dock was laid by The Duke of Edinburgh, patron of the Cutty Sark Preservation Society, in June 1953. The restoration, re-rigging and preparation for public exhibition was estimated to cost £250,000.|$|E
25|$|Richard King (1824–1885) was a <b>river</b> <b>pilot,</b> born in New York City to Irish immigrants. He was indentured to {{a jeweler}} at age 11, but later ran to sea, {{eventually}} attaining a pilot's rating. In 1843, King first met his future business {{partner in the}} King Ranch, Mifflin Kenedy (1818–1895), captain of the steamboat Champion. Both served under General Zachary Taylor, operating steamboats from Brazos Santiago Harbor to Matamoros, and on up river to Camargo, Tamaulipas, {{in support of the}} U.S. invasion of Monterrey and Saltillo. After the Mexican War, King made a good living hauling merchandise on the Rio Grande, as far up river as Camargo, and Rio Grande City. In the meantime, Kenedy was able to make money by carrying goods overland into Mexico. By March 1, 1850, King, Kenedy, Charles Stillman, founder of Brownsville, and James O'Donnell entered into a business partnership (M. Kenedy & Co.) to transport Stillman's goods from Brazos Santiago Harbor on the Gulf of Mexico and up the Rio Grande. The enterprise required two types of steamers — the Grampus and Comanche. During the American Civil War, the steamboat fleet was reflagged under the name of the Matamoros, Mexico citizen Francisco Iturria and the Mexican flag. As Mexico was a neutral country, the steamboats could not be stopped by Union blockaders, and engaged in a lively commerce of transporting Texas cotton to many deep-water ships anchored offshore Matamoros, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. Stillman sold his share of the enterprise after the Civil War; the new firm operated as King, Kenedy & Co. until 1874.|$|E
50|$|Pilottown {{serves as}} a {{temporary}} home {{for members of the}} Crescent River Port Pilots' Association and as a base for oil exploration. Although the captain is always responsible for his ship, all oceangoing ships must take a pilot on board when entering the Mississippi River system. The river has shifting passages and sand bars that make the journey difficult, especially given the tides and the powerful current downriver. The Associated Branch <b>Pilots</b> supplies <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> for ships traveling between the Gulf of Mexico and Pilottown. The Crescent River Port Pilots' Association supplies <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> between Pilottown and New Orleans, Louisiana, and the New Orleans-Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Association supplies pilots for ships that are bound for Baton Rouge, Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|In 1842, {{after the}} {{salvaging}} the Windsor Castle, Inis Cathaigh {{was home to}} Shannon Estuary Pilots and their families. The primary families of the island were the Brennan, Melican, Scanlan, McMahon, Costelloe, Hehir, Moran, and Griffin. The <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> were highly skilled mariners.|$|R
50|$|After Knowles was {{discharged}} from the military, {{he went to work}} as a draftsman for Amoco Oil Company. He became a fee land supervisor. Retiring in 1984 after thirty-eight years of service with Amoco, he later worked for the Lake Charles <b>River</b> <b>Pilots.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1977, Hopewell again {{made the}} {{national}} news due to another accident involving a drawbridge when the tanker S.S. Marine Floridian outbound {{under the command}} of a James <b>River</b> <b>pilot</b> suffered a steering malfunction just after dawn on February 24 that caused it to veer out of the channel and hit the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge just east of town. [...] The accident caused serious damage to the bridge and it was closed for months.|$|E
2500|$|The ship's last week, {{before being}} {{declared}} surplus {{to the port}} and Army's needs, was her busiest with 12,764 Army personnel transported. The ship had been the last contact troops had with continental transportation before boarding ocean transports and shipping overseas and was now the first for those returning from the Pacific. On her last run, during which she {{was turned over to}} WSA with her Army service master, former Sacramento <b>river</b> <b>pilot</b> Captain Howard J. King, turning her over to her peacetime master, Captain E. L. Mussetter. [...] The ship was returned to civilian service on April 22, 1946.|$|E
2500|$|While training, Samuel {{convinced}} {{his younger brother}} Henry to work with him. Henry was killed on June 21, 1858 when their steamboat Pennsylvania exploded. Twain claimed to have foreseen this death in a dream a month earlier, which inspired his interest in parapsychology; he was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research. Twain was guilt-stricken and held himself responsible {{for the rest of}} his life. He continued to work on the river and was a <b>river</b> <b>pilot</b> until the Civil War broke out in 1861, when traffic was curtailed along the Mississippi River. At the start of hostilities, he enlisted briefly in a local Confederate unit. He later wrote the sketch [...] "The Private History of a Campaign That Failed", describing how he and his friends had been Confederate volunteers for two weeks before disbanding.|$|E
50|$|Adjacent to {{the dock}} is the Pilotage Building, which opened in 1883 to manage the <b>river's</b> <b>pilot</b> boats. The {{building}} was converted in 1980 by the Building Design Partnership {{for use as a}} museum. Both this building and the dock itself are now part of Merseyside Maritime Museum.|$|R
25|$|On 6 August 1812, {{near the}} Balize {{entrance}} to the Mississippi, she captured the US brig Beaver, which was sailing to Havana with a cargo of sugar and coffee. She put the crew and two <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> ashore and then a prize crew of a lieutenant and five seamen sailed Beaver to Jamaica.|$|R
50|$|Pilottown {{consists}} of a few buildings, including temporary housing for <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> and a weather station, and some large oil tanks. Because Pilottown {{is only a few}} feet above river level, a raised concrete walkway connects these buildings and runs the length of the island, to provide some footing in flood conditions.|$|R
2500|$|At that time, {{salvaging}} wrecks {{from the}} Mississippi River was nearly impossible because of strong currents. Eads made his initial fortune in salvage {{by creating a}} diving bell, using a forty-gallon wine barrel to retrieve goods sunk in riverboat disasters. He also devised special boats for raising the remains of sunken ships from the river bed. Eads did much of the diving himself because the work was so dangerous. His work gave Eads an intimate knowledge of the river, as he explored its depths from the Gulf of Mexico to Iowa. Because of his detailed knowledge of the Mississippi (the equal of any professional <b>river</b> <b>pilot),</b> his exceptional ability at navigating the most treacherous parts of the river system, and his personal fleet of snag-boats and salvage craft, he was afforded the much prized courtesy title of [...] "Captain" [...] by the rivermen of the Mississippi and was addressed as Captain Eads throughout his life.|$|E
2500|$|A former <b>river</b> <b>pilot,</b> John (Jack) Deighton, {{set up a}} small (24' x 12') saloon on {{the beach}} about a mile west of the sawmill in 1867 where mill {{property}} and its [...] "dry" [...] policies ended. His place was popular and a well-worn trail between the mill and saloon was soon established – this is today's Alexander Street. [...] Deighton's nickname, Gassy Jack, came about because {{he was known as}} quite the talker, or [...] "gassy". A number of men began living near the saloon and the [...] "settlement" [...] quickly became known as Gassy's Town, which was quickly shortened to [...] "Gastown". In 1870, the colonial government of British Columbia took notice of the growing settlement and sent a surveyor to lay out an official townsite named Granville, in honour of the British Colonial Secretary, Lord Granville, though it was still popularly known as Gastown (which is the name still current for that part of the city).|$|E
2500|$|Ariel started [...] {{to raise}} her anchor at 5 am on the 29th and with the paddle steamer Island Queen towing alongside, headed down-river for the sea. The <b>river</b> <b>pilot</b> left and the tug was sent ahead to tow. The fast flowing River Min then {{presented}} problems for the under-powered tug as they met eddies and Ariel had to anchor {{to regain control of}} the situation. By this time it was low tide. With a mean draft of 18ft 5.5 ins., there was not enough water for her to get over the bar. [...] Captain Keay's frustration was increased by Fiery Cross, with a more powerful tug and drawing significantly less, towing past her and getting out to sea. Then the weather closed in: poor visibility preventing safe departure on the next tide. On the morning of the 30th Ariel finally got to sea, but with Taeping and Serica only a few minutes behind and Fiery Cross 14 hours ahead. In a final delay, Ariel could not leave her pilot on Island Queen, as the tug's boat capsized on launching (the boat crew eventually being rescued) - so a pilot boat had to be summoned.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house was}} {{possibly}} built in 1860 for Henry Horton, {{who was an}} engineer on raft steamers. James Suiter lived here after Horton. He was one of thelast <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> who worked the Le Claire Rapids. [...] He worked as a mortician {{during the winter months}} when the river was frozen to supplement his income.|$|R
5000|$|The first French {{settlers}} {{had built}} a crude fort and dwellings for La Balize {{near the mouth of}} the Mississippi in 1699. The name meant [...] "seamark", and the French built a 62-foot-high wooden pyramidal structure in 1721 to help guide ships on the Mississippi River and at its shifting delta. This was where <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> came to live.|$|R
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from <b>river</b> <b>pilots</b> who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|R
6000|$|... "We were to tow {{right up}} to the dock. The <b>river</b> <b>pilot</b> boarded us below Gravesend, and the first words I heard him say were: 'You may just as well take your port anchor inboard at once, Mr. Mate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Clemens was now {{suddenly}} lifted {{to a position}} of importance. The [...] Mississippi <b>River</b> <b>pilot</b> of those days was a person of distinction, [...] earning a salary then regarded as princely. Certainly two hundred [...] and fifty dollars a month was large for a boy of twenty-three. At [...] once, of course, he became the head of the Clemens family. His [...] brother Orion was ten years older, but he had not the gift of [...] success. By common consent the younger brother assumed permanently [...] the position of family counselor and financier. We expect him to [...] feel the importance of his new position, and he is too human to [...] disappoint us. Incidentally, we notice an improvement in his [...] English. He no longer writes [...] "between you and I." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} Mr. Paramor was radiant. [...] "Excellent idea!" [...] but {{directly}} his face fell. [...] "Why [...] . Yes! But we can't make that job {{last more than}} three days," [...] he muttered discontentedly. I don't know how long he expected us to be stuck on the riverside outskirts of Rouen, but I know that the cables got hauled up and turned end for end according to my satanic suggestion, put down again, and their very existence utterly forgotten, I believe, before a French <b>river</b> <b>pilot</b> came on board to take our ship down, empty as she came, into the Havre roads. You may think that this state of forced idleness favoured some advance in the fortunes of Almayer and his daughter. Yet it was not so. As if it were some sort of evil spell, my banjoist cabin-mate's interruption, as related above, had arrested them short {{at the point of}} that fateful sunset for many weeks together. It was always thus with this book, begun in '89 and finished in '94--with that shortest of all the novels which it was to be my lot to write. Between its opening exclamation calling Almayer to his dinner in his wife's voice and Abdullah's (his enemy) mental reference to the God of Islam--"The Merciful, the Compassionate"--which closes the book, there were to come several long sea passages, a visit (to use the elevated phraseology suitable to the occasion) to the scenes (some of them) of my childhood and the realisation of childhood's vain words, expressing a light-hearted and romantic whim.|$|E
25|$|In Virginia and North Carolina, the Pamunkey and Lumbee {{chose to}} serve the Union. The Pamunkey served as {{civilian}} and naval pilots for Union warships and transports, while the Lumbee acted as guerrillas.
