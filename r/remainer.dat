Better internal dwelling conditions were associated with several better health behaviours; in relation to neighbourhood conditions, the results were more mixed. Outmovers often exhibited worse health behaviours than <b>Remainers,</b> perhaps because environmental and social conditions were little altered by relocation, and because personal support mechanisms were missing. Health behaviours were relatively good among <b>Remainers,</b> indicating that in situ changes might stimulate life-changing improvements, but relocation less so...|$|R

5000|$|A second {{airborne}} unit, the 1st Laotian Parachute Battalion (French: 1er Bataillon de Parachutistes Laotiens - 1er BPL), began {{forming in}} October 1951. By 1 April 1952 the battalion {{was brought to}} strength with 853 officers and enlisted men, divided into a headquarters and three companies. Based at Chinaimo, just outside Vientiane, 1er BPL participated in twenty operations, six involving parachute jumps, during 1952. On 15-24 December 576 members of the unit conducted a reinforcement drop into Sam Neua garrison during Operation [...] "Noel". Eighty more members of the battalion jumped into Sam Neua in February 1953, enabling the BPL to create a fourth company.On 15 April 1953, the Vietminh invaded northeastern Laos with 40,000 troops commanded by General Võ Nguyên Giáp and crushed the Sam Neua garrison, sending remnants of the BPL fleeing toward the Plain of Jars. A month later, the battalion was reconstituted at Chinaimo, and conducted several reconnaissance and commando operations north of Luang Prabang - such as Operation [...] "Dampieres" [...] in September 1953 - for the <b>remainer</b> of the year.

On 18 June the BPL regrouped at the French Air Force's Seno Airbase near Savannakhet. From 2-4 August the battalion performed the last airborne operation of the First Indochina War, jumping into the town of Phanop in Khammouane Province to link up with local militia units and sweep the territory up to the strategic Mụ Giạ Pass, located in the Annamite Range on the Laotian-Vietnamese border.|$|E

By September, 1ére CCPL strength {{had risen to}} a headquarters (HQ) section and three commando sections, totalling 132 Laotians and 22 French officers and senior NCOs seconded from the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (CEFEO) parachute units. During the same month, the 1ére CCPL headquarters and an airborne training centre manned by French instructors were established at the French Air Force's Wattay Airbase just outside Vientiane, Laos' capital city. On 11 May 1949, 1ére CCPL performed its first combat jump, dropping 18 commandos to reinforce the Luang Namtha garrison. Six more airborne operations were conducted by the company during the year, including a 112-man jump to reinforce Sam Neua in Sam Neua Province, close to the Laotian-Vietnamese border, on 16 December.On 29 April 1951 the company was increased to six commando sections. In October, however, Commandos 4, 5, and 6 were removed to form the 2nd Company of the new 1st Laotian Parachute Battalion. The <b>remainer</b> of 1ére CCPL conducted five airborne reinforcement jumps around the country during the year. On 1 March 1952 1ére CCPL was renamed 1st Laotian Commando Company (French: 1ére Compagnie de Commandos Laotiens - 1ére CCL). Numerous jumps were conducted during the year, mostly as part of counter-insurgency sweeps north of Vientiane.On 27 April 1953 1ére CCL was dropped at the Nam Bac valley, north of Luang Prabang to establish a forward defensive line in face of a Vietminh invasion. The company was decimated, and could not reconstitute its headquarters section and four commando sections until 4 August. On 15 June 1954 the company was transferred from the French Union Army to the Laotian National Army (French: Armée Nationale Laotiènne - ANL), changing its name to 1st Group of Laotian Para-Commandos (French: 1er Groupement de Commandos Parachutistes Laotiens - 1er GCPL).

The WWC responded by entering the IWA's next event, Summer Attitude and vandalizing Quiñones' Hall of Fame induction. Despite this, the negotiations between the promotions were halted. A brief continuation took place at Septiembre Negro 2011, with Dennis Rivera and Noel Rodríguez defeating [...] "Lynx" [...] Rivera and [...] "Niche" [...] Marrero for the WWC World Tag Team Championship to unify it with the IWA World Tag Team Championship. They became the first unified tag team champions recognized by {{at least two of the}} three major promotions, but the reign was short-lived when WWC stripped them and Rivera and Rodríguez responded by legitimately taking them. Following a tour in which they defended the Unified Puerto Rico Tag Team Championship concluding in the EWO against a tag team known as [...] "La Milicia", Rodríguez was legitimately ambushed by Alejandro [...] "Niche" [...] Marerro and Wilfredo [...] "Lynx" [...] Rivera, who took one belt of each pair. With no use to a pair of non-matching belts, the issue was resolved backstage and each promotion received their respective titles back. Prior to the WWC's Euphoria 2012 event, Rivera reappeared in Súperestrellas de la Lucha Libre, supporting Cosme (who was then allowed to use the [...] "Ricky Banderas" [...] character) in his contest against Colón.

Angel went on to defeat all contenders, one of them being Carlos Cotto, who was subsequently fired by Pérez after questioning his involvement in a match between both. This event launched a storyline between the IWA and the Extreme Wrestling Organization, the largest independent company and de facto third main promotion in Puerto Rico. On December 17, 2011, Cotto won the EWO World Heavyweight Championship, only to be interrupted by Pérez. This was in response to a previous confrontation between both, that occurred following an unrelated charity card. After defending the title at Tierra de Nadie 2012, Pérez once again reclaimed his contract. In this event, Dennis Rivera and Noel Rodríguez participated in a scripted version of the incident at WWC, taking the EWO Tag Team Championship belts with them. At Histeria Boricua, Angel was absent for a scheduled defense due to a storyline injury, which resulted in the title being stripped from him.
