It can be seen from Figs.  16 and 17 that the throughput in the HTDM routing scheme is almost proportional to the number of creating <b>routing</b> <b>paths.</b> Therefore, the number of created <b>routing</b> <b>paths</b> can be identified according to the practical demand, which can offset the difference of communication ability between actors and sensor nodes. From experimental results, the throughput of multi-path routing scheme is smaller than that of HTDM scheme which creates two <b>routing</b> <b>paths,</b> and it is much smaller than that of HTDM scheme which creates three <b>routing</b> <b>paths.</b> Those results show HTDM scheme has a better throughput.|$|R

50|$|The OPM {{technology}} {{is based on}} the cognitive networking principles that are advanced from traditional wireless networking by the opportunistic utilization of both spectrum bandwidth and mesh station/radio availability. Traditional wireless networking assumes that those resources can be predetermined, and the protocol stacks from wire-line networks can be re-used. For example, in the traditional stack, the MAC (Media Access Control) layer allocates spectrum resources to wireless links; and the network layer sets up a network <b>routing</b> <b>path</b> from source to destination based on the overall network topology. In large-scale wireless systems, the use of this stack results in a network that is unable to respond to volatile spectrum availability which can be typical in unlicensed bands where interference prevails. In addition, random station/radio availability is also often encountered due to the dynamic traffic load (congestion) and other factors such as radio failure. Bottlenecks along both wireless links and stations are created because the packet forwarding protocol cannot respond quickly to these changes.|$|E
50|$|Path vector routing is {{used for}} inter-domain routing. It is similar to {{distance}} vector <b>routing.</b> <b>Path</b> vector routing assumes that one node (there can be many) in each autonomous system acts {{on behalf of the}} entire autonomous system. This node is called the speaker node. The speaker node creates a routing table and advertises it to neighboring speaker nodes in neighboring autonomous systems. The idea is the same as distance vector routing except that only speaker nodes in each autonomous system can communicate with each other. The speaker node advertises the path, not the metric, of the nodes in its autonomous system or other autonomous systems.Path vector routing is discussed in RFC 1322; the path vector routing algorithm is somewhat similar to the distance vector algorithm in the sense that each border router advertises the destinations it can reach to its neighboring router. However, instead of advertising networks in terms of a destination and the distance to that destination, networks are advertised as destination addresses and path descriptions to reach those destinations. A route is defined as a pairing between a destination and the attributes of the path to that destination, thus the name, path vector routing, where the routers receive a vector that contains paths to a set of destinations.The path, expressed in terms of the domains (or confederations) traversed so far, is carried in a special path attribute that records the sequence of routing domains through which the reachability information has passed.|$|E
