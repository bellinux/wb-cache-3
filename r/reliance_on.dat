Other rorquals' situations were very similar to them, but their local extinction (functionally) occurred later in 20th century by modern Japanese industries.|$|R

5|$|As a consequence, most {{battles in}} the 4th century were, as in {{previous}} centuries, primarily infantry encounters, with cavalry playing a supporting role. The main qualification is that on the Eastern frontier, cavalry played a more prominent role, due to the Persian <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> cavalry as their main arm. This obliged the Romans to strengthen their own cavalry element, in particular by {{increasing the number of}} cataphracti.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, Winnipeg was Canada's third-largest city. However, {{the city}} faced {{financial}} difficulty when the Panama Canal opened in 1914.

5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the mismanagement behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E

40|$|Philosophers have {{in general}} offered {{only a partial}} view of the {{normative}} grounds of reliance.

6000|$|This {{distrust}} is not, perhaps, the {{proximate cause}} of the strikes that now follow each other so disconcertingly, but it embitters their spirit, it prevents their settlement, and leads to their renewal. I have tried to suggest that, whatever immediate devices for pacification might be employed, {{the only way to}} a better understanding and co-operation, the only escape from a social slide towards the unknown possibilities of Social Democracy, lies in an exaltation of the standard of achievement and of the sense of responsibility in the possessing and governing classes. It is not so much [...] "Wake up, England!" [...] that I would say as [...] "Wake up, gentlemen!"--for the new generation of the workers is beyond all question quite alarmingly awake and critical and angry.

On the other hand, visual images, paintings in particular, caused the <b>reliances</b> <b>on</b> [...] "illusionary images" [...] However, in the Western world, children begin primary school with abstract thought and shapes, but as we grow older, according to Rudolf Arnheim, [...] "arts are reduced to a desirable supplement" [...] The general world trend in the late twentieth century caused an emphases towards scientific, mathematical, and quantitative approach to education, and art education is often refuted because it is based on perception. It is qualitative and subjective which makes it difficult to measure and evaluate.|$|R
