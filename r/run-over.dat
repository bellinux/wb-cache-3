5000|$|Fire in the Hole's dated {{production}} {{values and}} odd subject matter {{have made the}} ride a cult favorite, with some people even developing [...] "callback lines" [...] to shout at various points during the ride. Riders pass scenes of the town's residents trying to extinguish the flames before crossing a collapsing bridge, nearly getting <b>run-over</b> by a steam train, and crashing into a dynamite storage shack. In the ride's finale the coaster trains are sent hurtling over a drop into {{a pool of water}} with a splash down finish. The splash {{has been part of the}} ride since its conception.

50|$|Upon {{realising}} {{that her}} mother has betrayed her with her husband, Tiffany decides to flee Walford. Moments before {{she is about to}} depart, Grant accosts her and an argument culminates in Tiffany falling down the stairs and being hospitalised. After Tiffany recovers, she refuses to have anything more to do with Louise. After setting Grant up as the perpetrator of her accidental fall, she tries to leave Walford again but is <b>run-over</b> and killed by Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) on New Year's Eve 1998 before she can leave. On the day of her funeral, Tiffany's best friend, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), discovers a letter from Tiffany explaining Louise's betrayal, upon which Bianca furiously threatens to tell Simon what Louise has been up to unless she leaves Walford. Louise flees in January 1999, leaving her son distraught.|$|E
50|$|The coaster is themed {{around the}} story of an old {{mountain}} town set on fire by a group of Russian bandits. Riders pass scenes of the residents trying to extinguish the flames; one is a hotel with a lady on the top deck about to jump off, before crossing a collapsing bridge, nearly getting <b>run-over</b> by a steam train, and wrecking into a dynamite storage shack. In the finale, the trains are sent hurtling over an eighteen-foot-high drop into a pool of water. This is used to brake the train. It was discovered that it could still do so without being full, and this allowed the park to keep the coaster open during the winter. During the 2010 off-season, magnetic brakes were installed, removing the finale splashdown. Over the years, many of the coaster's props and theme elements have been removed, somewhat obscuring the storyline.|$|E
50|$|Each {{day of the}} search, an ASDIC expert, Lieutenant R A Nairn (a/s), RCNVR, was embarked. The searchers were {{fortunate}} in that weather and water conditions were favourable on all occasions. Every {{effort was made to}} use any information, such as survivors' reports, which might be helpful toward the end of locating the wreck. The Halifax East Light Vessel No 6, which had been accurately fixed and used as a datum point for the search, was closed and inquiries made from the Captain where he estimated the sinking had taken place. Many ASDIC echoes were investigated. Echo sounder traces had been made off boulders on the bottom, and some looked promising; when crossed, however, on a course at right angles to the initial <b>run-over,</b> all proved to be false. The search was successful in so far as it was thorough and left no doubt that detection by any future search would be purely a matter of chance.|$|E
5000|$|The slot {{has been}} used by the {{networks}} to broadcast <b>run-over</b> programming from NFL games, since the NFL broadcasting contracts require the games to air in their entirety (this happened {{as a result of the}} Heidi Game in 1968, in which NBC cut away from an Oakland Raiders-New York Jets game to air the television film Heidi, prior to the Raiders' comeback late in the fourth quarter). While CBS [...] "shifts" [...] its Sunday evening schedule to start after its NFL coverage concludes, Fox has utilized a different approach: the network completely pre-empted its lineup until the last game it held the right to broadcast in each region had finished until 2004, upon which it joined its prime-time lineup in progress (pre-empting portions or even the entirety of programs scheduled to air in the [...] "first" [...] hour of its prime time schedule following the game's designated time slot). Similarly, if necessary, major tournaments in professional golf are also treated in this manner; since 1987 (the year Daylight Savings Time was moved earlier), The Masters Tournament has begun to finish into the hour. The U. S. Open and Men's PGA Championship can, depending on the region, also can be overrun into the time slot, with Pacific Time Zone tournaments allowing networks to run into prime time hours.|$|E
50|$|After a {{week off}} to let his hurt {{hamstring}} to heal, Aaron Rodgers {{and the rest of}} the Packers made a dominant showing over the rival Bears, building an insurmountable 42-0 lead in the first half. After forcing a Bears' punt, Rodgers marched the Packers 71 yards in 12 plays to take a 7-0 lead on a touchdown pass to Brandon Bostick on fourth-and-goal. The Bears' following possession lasted only two plays as Micah Hyde intercepted Jay Cutler and returned the ball 9 yards to the Bears 23-yard line. Four plays later Rodgers connected with Andrew Quarless for a 4-yard touchdown. After another punt by the Bears, the Packers went 72 yards in three plays. After the first two plays went for −1 yard, Rodgers hit Jordy Nelson for a 73-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the second quarter. After a three-and-out by the Bears offense, Rodgers once again hit Nelson for a 40-yard touchdown pass on the fourth play of the Packers responding drive. The Bears started to move the ball on their next drive as they drove 70 yards, but turned the ball over on downs at the Packers 4-yard line. The Packers responded by driving 95 yards with Rodgers hitting Eddie Lacy for a 56-yard touchdown on a screen pass, extending the lead to 35-0. The Bears turned the ball over on downs again on their next drive. After both teams lost fumbles, Rodgers hit Randall Cobb, making the score a 42-0 <b>run-over.</b> On their second possession of the second half, Mason Crosby extended the Packers' lead to 45-0. The Bears finally got the scoreboard on their next drive as Cutler connected with Brandon Marshall for a 45-yard touchdown pass to cap of a 75-yard drive. Crosby connected on a 20-yard field goal next and after a three-and-out each, Chris Hayward intercepted Cutler and returned it 82 yards for a touchdown, extending the score to 55-7 early in the fourth quarter. Chris Williams returned the ensuing kickoff 101 yards for a touchdown, making the final score 55-14. Rodgers threw six first-half touchdowns, which matched the Packers' single-game record (with Matt Flynn) and the NFL record for touchdowns in a half (with Daryle Lamonica, 1969). The final score of 55 points tied a Lambeau Field record and Rodgers threw his NFL-record 16th scoring pass of 70 yards or more.|$|E
40|$|URL] Roads {{are long}} and {{intermittent}} sources of wildlife loss due to their indirect effects, such as fragmentation of habitat, or their direct effects, such as constant mortality by <b>run-over.</b> Thus, some studies indicate that a portion of these <b>run-over</b> incidents may be intentional and could be avoided. We investigated whether various groups of small animals had different <b>run-over</b> rates and how “charisma” affects the survival chances of an animal on the roads. During our experiment, we quantified <b>run-over</b> rates for models of spiders, snakes, chicks, and tree leaves (control) on three roads with different traffic volumes. We found out that snakes and spiders were consistently ran over with a higher frequency than chicks and leaves. We also observed that chicks were the only models rescued by human beings. We concluded that the survival chances of chicks are the highest among the models tested and {{this is due to}} the charismatic value attributed to them by human beings, when compared to snakes and spiders. We suggest the broadcasting of campaigns in the media to increase public awareness regarding wildlife conservation as a useful tool to solve the problem of intentional run over of small animals...|$|E

Data were obtained for children aged 0 - 15 years in the Australian state of Queensland (January 2004 -December 2008). Results There were 15 deaths (12 boys and 3 girls) during 2004 - 2008 (rate: 1. 67 / 100 000). Over half were aged 0 and 1 years of age (n 8; 53. 3 %, rate: 14. 67 / 100 000), and one quarter were 2 and 3 years of age (n 4, 27 %,rate 7. 46 / 100 000). There were no LSVRO deaths recorded among 10 - 15 year olds. Most (13 / 15) of the incidents occurred on private property, and only two occurred on a street/road. Almost half of the fatalities were caused by a four wheel drive (4 WD) vehicle; large family sedans were involved in four fatalities, and heavy vehicles were involved in three deaths. In 11 of the fatalities, parents were the drivers of the vehicle involved (mothers 5; fathers 6). In nine, the vehicle involved was reversing before it came in contact with the child.
