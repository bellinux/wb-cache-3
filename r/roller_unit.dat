The Center for Advanced Manufacturing at the Potchefstroom {{campus of}} the North West University aims to develop a twin screw {{extruder}} that is able to process powder coating resin. The facility has thus far produced various components and sub systems for local and international manufacturers of extrusion products. The research presented in this thesis aims to both develop a twin screw extruder with an integrated cooling roller system and to investigate {{of the performance of}} a twin screw extruder. The development of a twin screw extruder consists of the selection of the drive section of the extruder, the complete design of a twin screw extruder gearbox, the investigation and design of a suitable barrel for the manufacturing of powder coatings as well as the development of a unique cooling <b>roller</b> <b>unit</b> for the forming of the processed product when exiting the extruder. The extruder was manufactured from the designed components and systems. It was found on further testing that it was capable of producing a powder coating resin of good quality. In order to evaluate the performance of an extruder, the transfer of energy through the extruder needs to be understood. Furthermore it is necessary to understand the theory behind each type of energy being consumed by the extruder, as well as the factors influencing the usage of that energy. The theories investigated were verified in practice by measuring the energy consumption of a twin screw extruder operated under various conditions. These tests provided a correlation between the consumption of mechanical and electrical energy. The results gave an indication of the effectiveness of the screw configuration of the processing section of the extruder, making it possible to determine how the configuration should be amended in order to improve the performance of the extruder. The two aims of the thesis were satisfactory completed. The developed twin screw extruder is able to manufacture powder coatings of good quality and the performance evaluation of a twin screw extruder was also successfully completed. It enables the manufacturer to measure and evaluate the energy consumption of the process in order to improve the performance of the extruder. Master...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new stage}} of on-going research to fully characterize the rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damage observed in rail axle Compact Tapered <b>roller</b> Bearing <b>Units</b> (CTBUs). The bearings examined in this work {{have been removed from}} service, following the identification of degradation using on-board condition monitoring techniques. The running surfaces of the bearings were examined and the damage fully characterized using a mixture of metallographic, surface profilometry and high-resolution micro-Computed Tomography (μ-CT) techniques. In this manner the RCF was categorised by initiation mechanism: sub-surface or surface. This work has led to an increased understanding of the propagation of sub-surface and surface initiated RCF and its implications for life and condition of the bearing once failure has initiated. It was determined that the sub-surface initiated RCF damage was the first to occur in service and produced large craters on the bearing running surface. Once material had been lost in this primary manner, further secondary surface-initiating RCF grew from the edges of the large craters. It was deemed that the deep primary sub-surface RCF craters were more life limiting than the secondary surface damage. Therefore maps of the damage were created allowing the two mechanisms to be examined separately, both visually and by quantitative parameters such as volume loss, area, depth, roughness etc...|$|R

5000|$|The Bipolars {{operated}} on the Coast Division from 1919 to 1953, {{for most of}} that period without any serious rebuilding. In 1939 they were renumbered E1-E5. In 1953 all five of the EP-2s, which were 35 years old and worn out from heavy wartime service, were heavily rebuilt by the Milwaukee Road {{at a cost of}} about $40,000 per locomotive. The rebuild included additional traction motor shunts for increased speed, <b>roller</b> bearings, multiple <b>unit</b> capability, flash boilers, and streamlining. The E5, rebuilt in the Tacoma Shops as the prototype, performed as advertised, but went over budget, so the Milwaukee Shops were tasked with rebuilding the other four Bipolars. Unfortunately the Milwaukee Shop forces, unaccustomed to working on electric locomotives, did a [...] "poor job" [...] in the opinion of Electrification Department Head Laurence Wylie. (Wylie's successor, T. B. Kirk, stated that he saw a group of disconnected wires in a newly rebuilt EP-2 bundled together and tagged with a written message, [...] "We don't know where these go".) Afterwards the Bipolars were prone to electrical fires and failures, despite repeated attempts by Tacoma Shops to correct them.|$|R
40|$|In the Australian sugar industry, {{sugar cane}} is smashed into a straw like {{material}} by hammers before being squeezed between large rollers {{to extract the}} sugar juice. The straw like material is initially called prepared cane and then bagasse as it passes through successive <b>roller</b> milling <b>units.</b> The sugar cane materials are highly compressible, have high moisture content, are fibrous, and they resemble some peat soils in both appearance and mechanical behaviour. A promising avenue to improve the performance of milling units for increased throughput and juice extraction, and to reduce costs is by modelling of the crushing process. To achieve this, it is believed necessary that milling models {{should be able to}} reproduce measured bagasse behaviour. This investigation sought to measure the mechanical (compression, shear, and volume) behaviour of prepared cane and bagasse, to identify limitations in currently used material models, and to progress towards a material model that can predict bagasse behaviour adequately. Tests were carried out using a modified direct shear test equipment and procedure at most of the large range of pressures occurring in the crushing process. The investigation included an assessment of the performance of the direct shear test for measuring bagasse behaviour. The assessment was carried out using finite element modelling. It was shown that prepared cane and bagasse exhibited critical state behavior similar to that of soils and the magnitudes of material parameters were determined. The measurements were used to identify desirable features for a bagasse material model. It was shown that currently used material models had major limitations for reproducing bagasse behaviour. A model from the soil mechanics literature was modified and shown to achieve improved reproduction while using magnitudes of material parameters that better reflected the measured values. Finally, a typical three roller mill pressure feeder configuration was modelled. The predictions and limitations were assessed by comparison to measured data from a sugar factory...|$|R
