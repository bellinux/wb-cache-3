25|$|The TTC's current {{fleet of}} streetcars {{consists}} of 248 Canadian Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Vehicle</b> and Articulated Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Vehicle</b> streetcars which are {{nearing the end}} of their useful life. The TTC ordered 204 new Flexity Outlook light rapid transit vehicles from Bombardier Transportation. The first of these new streetcars entered service on the 510 Spadina line on August 31, 2014. As more vehicles arrive, they will be rolled out onto more streetcar routes with full deployment expected by the end of 2019.|$|E
25|$|The TTC then {{maintained}} most of {{its existing}} network, purchasing new custom-designed Canadian Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (CLRV) and Articulated Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (ALRV). It also continued to rebuild and maintain the existing fleet of PCC (Presidents' Conference Committee) streetcars until {{they were no longer}} roadworthy.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{selection}} {{came down to}} a choice of one of three systems - double-deck diesel powered buses, electrically powered trolley buses, and electrically powered light <b>rail</b> <b>vehicles</b> supported by diesel buses serving less densely populated areas or where steeper gradients limited the use of light <b>rail</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Diesel buses, although unquestionably more flexible in operation and requiring far lower initial capital costs, {{because they did not}} rely on fixed overhead power lines and tracks like trolley buses and light <b>rail</b> <b>vehicles,</b> were ruled out on grounds of air pollution.|$|R

25|$|The US Standard Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Vehicle</b> {{was a light}} <b>rail</b> <b>vehicle</b> (LRV) {{built by}} Boeing Vertol in the 1970s. The Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) {{promoted}} it as a standardized vehicle for U.S. cities. Part {{of a series of}} defense conversion projects in the waning days of the Vietnam War, the LRV was seen as both a replacement for older PCC streetcars in many cities and as a catalyst for new cities to construct light rail systems. The USSLRV was marketed as and is popularly known as the Boeing LRV (not to be confused with their prior lunar roving vehicles for NASA) and is usually referred to as such.|$|E

25|$|The table below {{illustrates}} {{the capacity of}} a light rail train (the Siemens S70) {{compared to that of}} a standard car with five seats. The average length of a standard five-seat car is about 4.74 metres. The length of a Siemens S70 light <b>rail</b> <b>vehicle</b> is 27.7 meters, approximately the same length as 5.8 cars. The maximum occupancy of a five-seat automobile car is five people. The maximum capacity of the Siemens S70 is 220 people. This means that one metre in a car has a capacity of one person and one metre in a light <b>rail</b> <b>vehicle</b> has a capacity of almost eight persons, so the capacity of light rail is about eight times as high as that of an average consumer car, if only the length of the vehicles is taken into consideration. The average width of an automobile is about 1.77 metres, while the average width of the Siemens S70 is about 2.7 metres. The area of an average consumer car is about 8.4m², while the area taken up by a light rail car is about 74.8m². In an automobile car, each square metre has room for only 0.6 persons, while each square metre in a light rail car has room for 2.9 persons. This means that a light <b>rail</b> <b>vehicle</b> is significantly more capacity-effective than a consumer car is. Height is not taken into consideration, because it is not normally a problem given minimum-clearance regulations for underpasses.|$|E
