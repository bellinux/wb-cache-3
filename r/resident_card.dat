25|$|Consular {{processing}} – This is {{the process}} if the immigrant is outside the United States, or is ineligible for AOS. It still requires the immigrant visa petition to be first completed and approved. The applicant may make an appointment at the U.S. embassy or consulate in his/her home country, where a consular officer adjudicates the case. If the case is approved, an immigrant visa is issued by the U.S. embassy or consulate. The visa entitles the holder {{to travel to the}} United States as an immigrant. At the port of entry, the immigrant visa holder immediately becomes a permanent resident, and is processed for a permanent <b>resident</b> <b>card</b> and receives an I-551 stamp in his/her passport.

25|$|As part of {{immigration}} reform under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), {{as well as}} further reform enacted in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA), persons who are eligible and properly apply for permanent residence based on either a recent marriage to a U.S. citizen or as an investor are granted permanent residence only on a conditional basis, for two years. An exception to this rule {{is the case of}} a U.S. citizen legally sponsoring a spouse in which the marriage {{at the time of the}} adjustment of status (I-485) is more than two years old. In this case, the conditional status is waived and a 10-year Permanent <b>Resident</b> <b>Card</b> is issued upon USCIS approval of the case. A permanent resident under the conditional clause may receive an I-551 stamp as well as a Permanent <b>Resident</b> <b>Card.</b> The expiration date of the conditional period is two years from the approval date. The immigrant visa category is CR (conditional resident).|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2007, New Haven {{was the center of}} protests by anti-immigration groups who opposed the city's program of {{offering}} municipal ID cards, known as the Elm City <b>Resident</b> <b>Card,</b> to illegal immigrants. In 2008, the country of Ecuador opened a consulate in New Haven to serve the large Ecuadorean immigrant population in the area. It is the first foreign mission to open in New Haven since Italy opened a consulate (now closed) in the city in 1910.|$|E

25|$|Democratic Progressive Party {{candidate}} Frank Hsieh questioned Ma for {{his possession}} of a US Permanent <b>Resident</b> <b>Card.</b> Ma denied having one and publicly expressed that no {{members of his family}} had one. However, the fact that Ma and his wife had applied for green cards and that his sisters and his elder daughter Lesley Weichung Ma are United States citizens caused controversy, as the DPP continued to question Ma's loyalty to the country. In response to the DPP attack on the US citizenship of his sisters and daughter, Ma commented that having a US passport or green card did not necessarily mean that someone was not loyal to Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|The {{applicant}} {{receives an}} I-551 stamp in their foreign passport upon approval of their case. The applicant is then {{free from the}} conditional requirement once the application is approved. The applicant's new Permanent <b>Resident</b> <b>Card</b> arrives via mail to their residence several weeks to several months later and replaces the old two-year conditional residence card. The new card must be renewed after 10 years, but permanent resident status is now granted for an indefinite term if residence conditions are satisfied at all times. USCIS may request to renew the card earlier because of security enhancements of the card or {{as a part of}} a revalidation campaign to exclude counterfeit green cards from circulation.|$|E

2500|$|A United States Permanent <b>Resident</b> <b>Card</b> (USCIS Form I-551), {{formerly}} known as Alien Registration Card or Alien Registration Receipt Card (INS Form I-151), is an identification card attesting to the permanent resident status of an alien in the United States. Owing to its green design from 1946 until 1964, it is known informally as a [...] "green card", a nickname it retained even after the color was changed. The card was restored to green in 2010. [...] "Green card" [...] also refers to an immigration process of becoming a permanent resident. The green card serves as proof that its holder, a lawful permanent resident (LPR), has been officially granted immigration benefits, including permission to reside and take employment in the United States. The holder must maintain permanent resident status, and can {{be removed from the}} United States if certain conditions of this status are not met.|$|E
2500|$|Under certain conditions, {{permanent}} residence status can be lost involuntarily. This includes committing {{a criminal act}} that makes a person removable from the United States. A person might also be found to have abandoned his/her status {{if he or she}} moves to another country to live there permanently, stays outside the USA for more than 365 days (without getting a re-entry permit before leaving), or does not file an income tax return on their worldwide income. [...] Permanent resident status can also be lost if it is found that the application or grounds for obtaining {{permanent residence}} was fraudulent. The failure to renew the permanent <b>resident</b> <b>card</b> does not result in the loss of status, except in the case of conditional permanent residents as noted above. [...] Nevertheless, it is still a good idea to renew the green card on time because it also acts as a work permit and travel permit (advance parole), but if the green card is renewed late, there is no penalty or extra fee to pay.|$|E
