50|$|One of {{the issues}} with using RC network to {{generate}} PoR pulse is {{the sensitivity of the}} R and C values to the power-supply ramp characteristics. When the power supply ramp is rapid, the R and C values can be calculated so that the time to reach the switching threshold of the schmitt trigger is enough to apply a long enough <b>reset</b> <b>pulse.</b> When the power supply ramp itself is slow, the RC network tends to get charged up along with the power-supply ramp up. So when the input schmitt stage is all powered up and ready, the input voltage from the RC network would already have crossed the schmitt trigger point. This means that there might not be a <b>reset</b> <b>pulse</b> supplied to the core of the VLSI.|$|E
50|$|Many voltage-controlled {{oscillators}} {{for electronic}} music {{are based on}} a capacitor charging linearly in an op-amp integrator configuration.

40|$|Abstract. Rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) logic needs {{synchronous}} pulses {{for each}} gate, so the clock-wiring problem is more serious when designing larger scale circuits with this logic. So we {{have proposed a}} new SFQ logic which follows Boolean algebra perfectly by using set and <b>reset</b> <b>pulses.</b> With this logic, the level information of current input is transmitted with these pulses generated by level-to-pulse converters, and each gate calculates logic using its phase level made by these pulses. Therefore, our logic needs no clock in each gate. We called this logic ‘Boolean SFQ (BSFQ) logic’. In this paper, we report design and experimentation for an AND gate with inverting input based on BSFQ logic. The experimental results for OR and XOR gates are also reported. 1...|$|R
50|$|A DCO can be {{considered}} as a VCO that is synchronised to an external frequency reference. The reference in this case is the reset pulses. These are produced by a digital counter such as the 8253 chip. The counter acts as a frequency divider, counting pulses from a high frequency master clock (typically several MHz) and toggling the state of its output when the count reaches some predetermined value. The frequency of the counter's output can thus be defined by the number of pulses counted, and this generates a square wave at the required frequency.The leading edge of this square wave is used to derive a <b>reset</b> <b>pulse</b> to discharge the capacitor in the oscillator's ramp core. This ensures that the ramp waveform produced is of the same frequency as the counter output.|$|E
50|$|The {{write cycle}} begins by {{applying}} the value to be written to the bit lines. If we wish to write a 0, we would apply a 0 to the bit lines, i.e. setting BL to 1 and BL to 0. This is similar to applying a <b>reset</b> <b>pulse</b> to an SR-latch, which causes the flip flop to change state. A 1 is written by inverting {{the values of the}} bit lines. WL is then asserted and the value that is to be stored is latched in. This works because the bit line input-drivers are designed to be much stronger than the relatively weak transistors in the cell itself so they can easily override the previous state of the cross-coupled inverters. In practice, access NMOS transistors M5 and M6 have to be stronger than either bottom NMOS (M1, M3) or top PMOS (M2, M4) transistors. This is easily obtained as PMOS transistors are much weaker than NMOS when same sized. Consequently when one transistor pair (e.g. M3 and M4) is only slightly overridden by the write process, the opposite transistors pair (M1 and M2) gate voltage is also changed. This means that the M1 and M2 transistors can be easier overridden, and so on. Thus, cross-coupled inverters magnify the writing process.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Microprocessors, microcontrollers, and {{system-on-chip}} devices (SoCs) {{that operate}} with multiple supply voltages often require a <b>reset</b> <b>pulse</b> to initialize properly, and the supply voltages must turn on {{in a specific}} sequence to prevent damage via unexpected current paths. Sequencing for two voltages can be implemented with just a pair of microprocessor-supervisor ICs (MAX 6418). A similar {{version of this article}} appeared in the May 13, 2010 issue of EDN magazine. Microprocessors, microcontrollers, and systems on chip (SoCs) often need a <b>reset</b> <b>pulse</b> to initialize properly. Many of these devices also use separate I/O and core voltage supplies. When multiple supplies are used, the supplies must be turned on in a specific sequence to prevent the circuits from ending up in an unknown state or burning out due to unexpected current paths. The voltages should also be monitored to ensure that the device will not come out of reset until both voltages settle to levels within the operating voltage range. A previous design idea presents a circuit performing the reset function. Unfortunately this circuit suffers from a number of limitations. The circuit does not monitor the voltage on the 3. 3 V rail, the 1. 8 V rail suffers from poor monitoring accuracy since the 3. 3 V rail is used as a reference, the reset delay may not be present if the power rails are sequenced in the reverse order, the <b>reset</b> <b>pulse</b> has a glitch that could cause problems with the SoC, and the reset delay capacitor may not be reset correctly if power is rapidly cycled.

40|$|Aggregates {{of heart}} cells from chicken embryos beat spontaneously. We used {{intracellular}} microelectrodes {{to record the}} periodic behavior of the membrane potential that triggers the contractions. Every 5 - 12 beats, a short current pulse was applied at various points in the cycle to study the phase-dependent resetting of the rhythm. Pulses stronger than 2. 5 nA caused the final rhythm to be reset to almost the same point in the cycle regardless of the phase at which the pulse was applied (type zero <b>resetting).</b> <b>Pulses</b> of {{less than or equal}} to 1 nA only caused a slight change of the phase. Increasing current intensities to between 1 and 2. 5 nA gave rise to an increasing steepness in a small part of the phase-response curve. The observation of type zero resetting implies the existence of a critical stimulation that might annihilate the rhythm. Although we did find a phase at which more or less random responses occurred, the longest pause in the rhythm was 758 ms, 2. 4 times the spontaneous interval. This suggests that the resting membrane potential was unstable, at least against the internal noise of the system.

40|$|Silicon Drift Detectors with {{integrated}} FET transistor fabricated at Max-Planck-Institute in Munich {{in cooperation}} with PNSensor GmbH are widely used as X-ray sensors in many industrial and scientific applications. In the classical readout scheme, the integrated transistor on the SDD is operated in the source–follower configuration. The signal charge is removed continuously by the detector selfrest mechanism. The method gives very good results at counting rates up to 10 kcps. For higher count rates, the FWHM increases with the growing reset current and a slight shift of the energy peak is observed. The relative large signal rise time can be also a limitation for operation at very high count rates. Alternatively, the SDD can be operated in a Charge Sensitive Amplifier (CSA) configuration. The detector signal charge is integrated on a feedback capacitor across an inverting amplifier with the integrated FET as the input transistor. The signal rise time {{does not depend on}} the integrated transistor and can be made very short (e. g. 50 ns). In applications requiring very high counting rates and constant energy resolution, pulsed-reset operation of the SDD is desirable.

40|$|A basal {{animal model}} is {{described}} as an organism similar to a Limpet that {{is attached to the}} sea floor living in a reproductive community. Its brain model uses logic cells (gates) to create a high frequency spike generator. Addition logic cells create a timing framework based upon Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and create multi-cell, spike driven muscle actuators and bi-directional shift registers that serve as memories. Together, these logic cells generate a pulse train that forms a recurrent fractal in the form of coherent square waves that consist of an equal number of set <b>pulses</b> and <b>reset</b> <b>pulses.</b> These pulses drive the actuators that pump water and food through its shell. Some of these individuals lose their permanent attachment to the sea floor, and evolve the ability to move around using the feeding motions. This creates the hazard of getting stuck against an object or moving away from its breeding community. They evolve a sensor system and logic cells that produce a restoring motion for each avoidance motion. This keeps the animal in the specific region of an object that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of the fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed in its environment. The logic units evolve to store permanent memories, and add plus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the animal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve that allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow the animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using permanent memories that are created when a <b>pulse</b> is not <b>reset</b> to zero. So, information is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one logic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic) connections between cells.

Our analysis shows that the thermal crosstalk strongly depends on the scaling approach used, e. g., isotropic or nonisotropic scaling.

40|$|The {{orientation}} of the central proton-binding site, the protonated Schiff base, away from the proton release side to the proton uptake side is crucial for the directionality of the proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. It has been proposed that this movement, called the reprotonation switch, {{takes place in the}} M 1 to M 2 transition. To resolve the molecular events in this M 1 to M 2 transition, we performed double-flash experiments. In these experiments a first pulse initiates the photocycle and a second pulse selectively drives bR molecules in the M intermediate back into the BR ground state. For short delay times between initiating and <b>resetting</b> <b>pulses,</b> most of the M molecules being reset are in the M 1 intermediate, and for longer delay times most of the reset M molecules are in the M 2 intermediate. The BR-M 1 and BR-M 2 difference spectra are monitored with nanosecond step-scan Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Because the Schiff base reprotonation rate is kM 1 = 0. 8 x 10 (7) s(- 1) in the light-induced M 1 back-reaction and kM 2 = 0. 36 x 10 (7) s(- 1) in the M 2 back-reaction, the two different M intermediates represent two different proton accessibility configurations of the Schiff base. The results show only a minute movement of one or two peptide bonds in the M 1 to M 2 transition that changes the interaction of the Schiff base with Y 185. This backbone movement is distinct from the larger one in the subsequent M to N transition. No evidence of a chromophore isomerization is seen in the M 1 to M 2 transition.
