Several {{provisions}} of the law were designed to reduce the cost of Medicare.

5000|$|Some claimants are {{initially}} confused when {{informed of}} an overpayment, {{and believe that}} HMRC are trying to reclaim money the claimant didn’t receive. This is because {{during the course of}} an award claimants are sent award notices stating the current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments,</b> so when an overpayment is declared claimants don’t understand that those award notices are now ‘wrong’. If the circumstances used to calculate an overpayment are correct, then there is no denying the amount paid was wrong, but responsibility, and therefore who should have to foot the bill, can be contested.|$|E

After that period expires, coverage at the previous rate of premiums is no longer guaranteed and the client must either forgo coverage or potentially obtain further coverage with different payments or conditions.

Term insurance is typically the least expensive way to purchase a substantial death benefit on a coverage amount per premium dollar basis over a specific period of time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{analyzes}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of establishing a debt fund on the repayment of student loan. Based on these analyses, on one hand, we discuss the mode of equal fraction repayment of the total amount of the loan principal and its interest in each term. This mode yields great flexibility in that the repayment fund can have a greater interest rate to enhance the will of the lender to save money in the fund and thus can promote the early repayment. Banks can therefore regulate and control the situation and reduce the rate of contract breaking in loan repayment. Moreover, this mode can work well with the current policy and then can have excellent operability; On the other hand, theoretical analysis and example also shows that if the repayment amounts form a reasonable geometric increasing sequence, the repayment can be even more optimal in that it not only has the advantages of the foregoing mode, but also has the advantage of selecting the increasing <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> to adjust the burdens in each period of the repayment and make each period repayment burden relatively equal.

The pension fund policy set the payment base at the average wage of employer {{in the previous}} year. However, the actual base has a gap with this base. For example, the actual payment base in 2014 is 35, 405 yuan, and the average wage of employer in 2013 is 51, 483 yuan. 14 In order to make closer to the actual situation, this paper makes the actual payment base as the standard, and the base in 2015 and in the following years increases by a certain growth rate. It is assumed that the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> base from 2015 to 2020 is 7 %, and drops by 0.5 % every 5  years until to 2 %.
