40|$|Most {{software}} maintenance tasks {{are driven by}} specific customer <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> program <b>corrections</b> or enhancements.

This paper describes a strategy for quickly producing new special-purpose tools. The strategy combines existing tools including simple, off-the-shelf text processing tools; rule-based, language-specific analysis tools; and a commercial CASE tool. 1 Background 1. 1 The maintenance context The greatest part of the {{software maintenance}} process is devoted to understanding the system being maintained. Fjeldstad and Hamlen report that 47 % and 62 % of the time spent on actual enhancement and correction tasks, respectively, are devoted to comprehension activities. These involve reading the documentation, scanning the source code, and understanding the changes to be made[1]. The implication is that if we want to improve maintenance, we sho [...] ...|$|R

30|$|These two {{waves are}} both {{characterized}} by a much slower vertical propagation than acoustic waves and need about 45 minutes to reach the ionosphere in the pure gravity case (Occhipinti et al., 2008, 2011), which explains why they appear at about 400 km of epicentral distance. Figure 4 shows the likely associated dispersion curves of these two waves, with a first one associated to free atmospheric gravity modes (continuous magenta line) and the second one associated to the tsunami modes (dashed magenta line).

Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) {{received}} a petition from the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resources Association (MICRA) {{to list the}} black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) under the injurious wildlife provision of the Lacey Act (18 U. S. C. § 42). On June 2, 2000, we published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) (65 FR 35314) to seek comments {{on whether or not}} we should propose to list black carp as injurious under the Lacey Act. The comment period on the ANPR was open for 60 days, until August 1, 2000. During that comment period, we received 124 comments. We published a proposed rule to add all forms of live black carp to the list of injurious fishes under the Lacey Act in the Federal Register on July 30, 2002 (67 FR 49280). We opened the public comment period on the proposed rule for 60 days, until September 30, 2002. We received 82 comments on the proposed rule. Because of the complexity of this issue, on June 4, 2003, in an effort to gather more economic and ecological information on our proposed action, we reopened the public comment period on the proposed rule for an additional 30 days, until August 4, 2003 (68 FR 33431). We received 21 comments during the reopened comment period. On August 30, 2005, we published in the Federal Register (70 FR 51326) a document announcing the availability of the draft environmental assessment and draft economic analysis, including the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, for the proposed rule, and sought public comments on those draft documents and on listing only the diploid (fertile) form of black carp. The public comment period for the draft documents was originally 60 days, ending October 31, 2005; however on October 27, 2005, we published a document (70 FR 61933) extending the comment period by an additional 45 days, until December 16, 2005. During the 105 -day comment period, we received 89 comments. Therefore, in total, the Service received 316 comments during the four public comment periods.

40|$|This {{provides}} guidance to Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) regarding the policies <b>for</b> <b>requesting</b> data <b>corrections</b> in the Automated System Support for Employment and Training (ASSET) participant reporting system. An error has been discovered that affects the specified participant exit date <b>for</b> which data <b>correction</b> <b>requests</b> can be submitted. Under the policy that was issued on January 20, 2005, data correction requests were limited to any participant who exited on or after October 1, 2003. This date has an adverse impact on the Older Youth Employment and Credential Attainment and the Older Youth Employment Retention performance measures. These performance measures are computed for older youth that exit between April 1 and March 31 of each program year. For Program Year 2004, the reporting period for these measures is April 1, 2003 to March 31, 2004. The policy has been revised to correct the error. This policy continues to establish deadlines for ASSET data clean-up and corrections as necessary to comply with U. S. Department of Labor (U. S. DOL) data validation requirements. The policy correction {{is shown in the}} paragraph below as bolded text; the remainder of the policy is already in effect. If WDB staff had data correction requests denied because the participant exited WIA Title 1 prior to October 1, 2003, they may resubmit those data correction requests via the ASSET Data Change Request screen. Only data change <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> participants that exited on or after April 1, 2003 will be considered...|$|R

40|$|Strømme {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} multiple congenital malformation syndrome consisting in apple peel intestinal atresia, ocular anomalies, microcephaly and developmental delay. To date, this condition was described {{in a couple of}} sibs and 7 additional sporadic patients. We report on a 11 -month-old female, who <b>requested</b> surgical <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> jejunal atresia shortly after birth and also presented with megalocornea and persistence of the pupillary membrane. Microcephaly and developmental delay were absent at last examination. An oligonucleotide CGH-array analysis excluded cryptic chromosome rearrangement(s). Comparison of the previously published and present patients added some details on the natural history of Strømme syndrome. Delivery is usually performed preterm possibly due to polyhydramnios. Birth parameters, especially head circumference, are commonly {{at the lower end of}} the normal range. Microcephaly is more frequently but not constantly observed in older individuals, thus suggesting a progressive course, and may relate to an underlying neuronal migration defect. Jejunal atresia has an apple peel appearance in most but not all patients and its post-surgical course is usually uneventful. The ocular phenotype comprises a wide range of anterior chamber anomalies with sclerocornea/corneal leukoma being the most common. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
