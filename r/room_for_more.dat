5|$|So many South Vietnamese {{helicopters}} {{landed on}} the TF76 ships that some 45 UH-1 Hueys {{and at least one}} CH-47 Chinook were pushed overboard to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> helicopters to land.

5|$|The Project 26 ships landed their {{catapult}} during 1941 to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> AA guns, as did Molotov in 1942. A ZK-1a catapult {{was installed}} aboard Molotov in 1943, and she conducted successful experiments with a catapult-launched Supermarine Spitfire fighter. The Project 26bis2 ships {{did not receive}} a catapult until {{after the end of}} the war, when a ZK-2b was fitted. The catapults, however, were removed from all ships by 1947.|$|E

5|$|Within Mississauga, {{the freeway}} {{encounters}} its narrowest right-of-way, sandwiched between residential subdivisions {{on either side}} that prevent further expansion. It crosses the Credit River Valley, where a second bridge is under construction. The segment east of the Credit River is being examined for expansion possibilities, but, like the previous section, there is little <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> lanes without property acquisition. After crossing Etobicoke Creek, which forms the boundary between Mississauga / Peel Region and Toronto, the route curves eastward to meet Highway427 at a large sprawling interchange. The QEW formerly continued beyond this interchange to the old Toronto city limits at the Humber River; this section was downloaded from provincial to municipal ownership on April1, 1997, and {{became part of the}} Gardiner Expressway.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} rationale is {{the desire}} to limit {{the size of the}} full Unicode character set, where CJK characters as represented by discrete ideograms may approach or exceed 100,000 (while those required for ordinary literacy in any language are probably under 3,000). Version 1 of Unicode was designed to fit into 16 bits and only 20,940 characters (32%) out of the possible 65,536 were reserved for these CJK Unified Ideographs. Later Unicode has been extended to 21 bits allowing many more CJK characters (87,882 are assigned, with <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more).</b>|$|E
25|$|The Commodore Perry, {{originally}} designed for short operating distances of the Great Lakes, was ill-fitted {{for her new}} duty in the open sea. Vessels on duty in Alaskan waters required ample food storage room, enough to hold six month's stores and provisions, and enough coal-bunker space to cruise actively {{for at least two}} weeks. The Perry was designed to carry only 90 tons. Making <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> coal required stores and provisions to be stored on the deck. Most often, her cruising radius was limited to about 1,500 miles, insufficient to meet the duties demanded of her.|$|E

The corporate drama Company Funeral (1989) was selected for the Kinema Junpo magazine's annual Best Ten list. Masuda's most recent feature film was the crime thriller Heavenly Sin (1992). It starred Sayuri Yoshinaga as a detective in near-future Tokyo and Omar Sharif as a Chinese Triad boss. Sharif replaced Yusaku Matsuda who had died of cancer. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Masuda continues to direct and write for television.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Hughes {{told his}} aides {{that he wanted}} to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened {{screening}} <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than four months, never leaving. He ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk, and was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.|$|E
25|$|With {{only two}} runways, {{operating}} at over 98% of their capacity, Heathrow has little <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> flights, although the {{increasing use of}} larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380 will allow some increase in passenger numbers. It is difficult for existing airlines to obtain landing slots to enable them to increase their services from the airport, or for new airlines to start operations. To increase the number of flights, Heathrow Airport Holdings has proposed using the existing two runways in 'mixed mode' whereby aircraft would be allowed to take off and land on the same runway. This would increase the airport's capacity from its current 480,000 movements per year to as many as 550,000 according to British Airways CEO Willie Walsh. Heathrow Airport Holdings has also proposed building a third runway {{to the north of the}} airport, which would significantly increase traffic capacity (see Future expansion below).|$|E

25|$|The {{challenges}} of the global food crisis followed by {{challenges of}} the global financial crisis made <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> integrated policy reforms. Considering the massive economic measures {{that have been taken}} over the past 12 months or so, Egyptian economic policymakers score high based on the inside lag, i.e. the lapse of time between the moment that the shock began to affect the economy and the moment that economic (monetary and fiscal) policy as well as the regulatory policy are altered and put into effect in response to the shock to various markets: goods market (real GDP), the labor market (unemployment rate), money market (interest rate and inflation), and the financial (stock and bond) market. Indeed, moderate financial panic occurred driven—at least partially—by the fear that other investors are about to panic and sell. There were falls in stock and bond market prices, and rises in nominal interest rates.|$|E
25|$|With the North Vietnamese forces {{advancing}} on the South Vietnamese {{capital of}} Saigon, Ford ordered {{the evacuation of}} U.S. personnel, while also allowing U.S. forces to aid others who wished {{to escape from the}} Communist advance. Forty-thousand U.S. citizens and South Vietnamese were evacuated by plane until enemy attacks made evacuation by plane impossible. In the final phase of the evacuation, known as Operation Frequent Wind, military and Air America helicopters took evacuees to U.S. Navy ships off-shore during an approximately 24-hour period on April 29 to 30, 1975, immediately preceding the fall of Saigon. During the operation, so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> people. Other helicopters, having nowhere to land, were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats.|$|E
25|$|The queen {{begins the}} initial {{structure}} of the nest. By chewing wood and adding in saliva to make a quick-drying pulp, these wasps assemble paper nests. The {{first part of the}} nest constructed is the stalk, which eventually narrows into a cord and then expands again to make the first hexagonal cell. Other cells are then added to the sides of the first and an envelope is built around the first group of cells which form a miniature comb. The queen then lays eggs in these cells, which will become workers when hatched. As soon as the workers emerge from their larval state, the nest begins to enlarge rapidly. As more cells are added, the comb grows fast, and when enough cells are on the first comb, a second comb is added, and so on. To make <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> cells, the inner layers of the envelope are rechewed and used to make more envelope layers outside. Because most of the nests are located underground, the cavity in which the nest is built is enlarged by removing soil, carrying it and dropping it outside the nest.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{security}} concerns about an assassination attempts, President Ronald Reagan lit the National Christmas Tree via remote control from the East Room of the White House in 1981, 1982, and 1983. Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment and increased {{aid for the}} poor protested at the event. The lights on the 1981 tree suffered from faulty wiring, {{and could not be}} lit on the final night of the event (January 1, 1982). 1981 also marked the beginning of a number of changes to the Pageant of Peace. The petting zoo was canceled due to cost concerns, {{but for the first time}} each state or territory donated the ornaments to be used on their tree lining the Pathway of Peace. A request to honor Vietnam War veterans during the ceremony was turned down to keep the focus on Christmas. A new contractor, Westport Marketing Group, was also hired to manage the tree lighting ceremony. Westport changed the ceremony so that fewer guests sat on stage. This made <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> performers. Westport also suggested that more national celebrities be invited to perform as well to turn the event into a national (rather than local) event and boost the appeal to a national audience. Westport suggested even more radical reductions in the number of guests and field seating as well as elimination of the Yule log in 1982. There was also discussion of moving the entire event into the White House, but these suggestions were not acted on.|$|E
