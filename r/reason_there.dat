5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>there</b> are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
5|$|The LSWR M7 {{class is}} {{a class of}} 0-4-4 {{passenger}} tank locomotive built between 1897 and 1911. The class was designed by Dugald Drummond for use on the intensive London network of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), and performed well in such tasks. Because of their utility, 105 were built and the class went through several modifications over five production batches. For this <b>reason</b> <b>there</b> were detail variations such as frame length. Many of the class were fitted with push-pull operation gear that enabled efficient use on branch line duties without the need to change {{to the other end}} of its train at the end of a journey.|$|E
5|$|Although the Calendar Round {{is still}} in use today, the Maya started using an {{abbreviated}} Short Count during the Late Classic period. The Short Count is a count of 13 k'atuns. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>there</b> is no direct correlation between the Long Count and the European calendar. The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation. This equates the Long Count date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the Gregorian date of 12 November 1539. Epigraphers Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation. The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems {{with the rest of}} the Maya region. The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period. Radiocarbon dating of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.|$|E

25|$|The {{authors and}} editors of Samuel and Chronicles did not aim to record history, but to promote David's reign as {{inevitable}} and desirable, {{and for this}} <b>reason</b> <b>there</b> is little about David that is concrete and undisputed.|$|E
25|$|The Armenians had no {{representation}} in the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451, due to their struggle against the Sassanids in an armed rebellion. For that <b>reason,</b> <b>there</b> appeared a theological drift between Armenian and Byzantine Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Lakota uses postpositions, {{which are}} similar to English prepositions, but follow their noun complement. Adverbs or postpositional phrases can {{describe}} manner, location, or <b>reason.</b> <b>There</b> are also interrogative adverbs, which are used to form questions.|$|E
25|$|Despite its biological, {{ecological}} and cultural diversity, {{there have been}} few studies performed in the park area. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>there</b> is a lack of information about species, habitats and water flow. There is also relatively little information about how human activities affect the park.|$|E
25|$|When {{a company}} {{establishes}} an ADR program, it must decide what exactly it wants {{out of the}} program, and how much time, effort, and other resources {{they are willing to}} commit. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>there</b> are different types of programs, or facilities, that a company can choose.|$|E

25|$|Individual {{reproduction}} {{is the most}} important phase in the proliferation of individuals or genes within a species: for this <b>reason,</b> <b>there</b> exist complex mating rituals, which can be very complex even if they are often regarded as FAPs. The stickleback's complex mating ritual, studied by Tinbergen, is regarded as a notable example of a FAP.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} environment {{is complicated by}} the potential for military conflict should Taiwan declare de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible, as stated in its anti-secession law, and for this <b>reason</b> <b>there</b> are substantial military installations on the Fujian coast.|$|E
25|$|Fox {{hunting with}} hounds has been {{happening}} in Europe {{since at least the}} sixteenth century, and strong traditions have built up around the activity, as have related businesses, rural activities, and hierarchies. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>there</b> are large numbers of people who support fox hunting and this can be for a variety of reasons.|$|E

25|$|Kangaroo Island {{is noted}} for its honey and its Ligurian honey bees. The island has the world's only {{pure-bred}} and disease-free population {{of this type of}} bee. The exporting of pure-bred queen bees is a notable industry for the island. For this <b>reason</b> <b>there</b> are significant quarantine restrictions on bringing bee products and bee-handling equipment onto the island.|$|E
25|$|Around 1550, many Sephardi Jews {{travelled}} across Europe to {{find their}} haven in Poland, which had the largest Jewish population {{in the whole of}} Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries. For this <b>reason</b> <b>there</b> are still Polish Jewish surnames with a possible Spanish origin. However, most of them quickly assimilated into the Ashkenazi community and retained no separate identity.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} factor was {{that during the}} Middle Ages {{a large proportion of}} the population would have been illiterate and so pictures on a sign were more useful than words as a means of identifying a public house. For this <b>reason</b> <b>there</b> was often no reason to write the establishment's name on the sign and inns opened without a formal written name, the name being derived later from the illustration on the pub's sign.|$|E

25|$|Since {{mushroom}} cultivation is not {{a subject}} available at school, most urban farmers learned it by doing. The time to master mushroom cultivation is time consuming and costly in missed revenue. For this <b>reason</b> <b>there</b> are numerous companies in Europe specialized in mushroom cultivation that are offering training for entrepreneurs and organizing events to build community and share knowledge. They also show the potential positive impact of this business on the environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} Figure 5.2's speed lines {{provides}} {{a good example of}} why it is inappropriate to use the term choke in association with a maximum flow of all centrifugal compressor speed lines. In summary; most industrial and commercial centrifugal compressors are selected or designed to operate at or near their highest efficiencies and to avoid operation at low efficiencies. For this <b>reason</b> <b>there</b> is seldom a reason to illustrate centrifugal compressor performance below 60% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Ralph {{was educated}} at Leeds Grammar School, {{and on the}} death of his older brother became the eldest son of the family. He was sent at age {{eighteen}} to the house of a relation in London, as part of his grooming as a merchant.

And for this <b>reason</b> <b>there</b> is easily available a detailed chronology of his life.|$|E
