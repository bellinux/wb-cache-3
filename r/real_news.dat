After Skylark and his crew celebrate their 1,000th episode, the show's producer Aaron Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticized the show as not being a <b>real</b> <b>news</b> program. A while later Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Skylark discovers that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is a fan of Skylark Tonight, prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview. Rapaport travels to a place outside Dandong, China to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the North Korean chief propagandist, and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim, on behalf of Skylark.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began in}} the middle of winter, which {{presented}} problems for the cast and filming crew. Some scenes were delayed because of bad weather, even snow at one point, and as a result scheduling became tighter. Another problem was the cold temperatures. The beginning scene in [...] "Who Guards the Guards?", where Mace and Khordad meet in Hebron, was filmed on a roof garden in below zero temperatures; however, McInnerny and Paul Bhattacharjee wore summer clothes. To prevent hypothermia a heater was placed near them. The cameras used light-coloured filters to make the environment look warmer. However, winter did have an advantage of longer nights, making night scenes easier; summer nights would last as little as five hours. The producers hired <b>real</b> <b>news</b> presenters from Sky News and the programme London Tonight to present the news of the events from some episodes. All episodes begin with a recap from past episodes, which the producers regard as [...] "an art in themselves" [...] in terms of editing. The opening title sequence went through three changes {{over the course of the}} series. More split screen sequences were also added to create more tension for the audience. Overall, each episode took approximately six weeks to prepare, and would take approximately six weeks to edit.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{contagious}} movement of financial institutions' common stock prices {{in response to}} <b>real</b> estate <b>news.</b> The basic hypothesis is that because real estate assets are traded infrequently, the market has incomplete information about their true value. The stock price reaction by banks, thrifts and insurance companies to announcements of poorly performing real estate portfolios is studied. Consistent with the hypothesis, significantly negative reactions obtain, both within and across industries, to these announcements. Reflecting the differential regulatory environment and disclosure policies, insurance companies, in general, react more strongly to adverse <b>real</b> estate <b>news.</b> Also, the price reaction of an individual firm is significantly associated {{with the level of}} its real estate exposure.

Previous literature has produced weak {{evidence to support the}} hypothesis that <b>real</b> economic <b>news</b> affects stock returns.

Since newspaper headlines provide an interpretation of the statistical releases, we choose Lott and Hassett (2006) headlines classification as our measure of news. Our findings indicate that news on GDP and unemployment does affect stock returns. 2 I...|$|R
