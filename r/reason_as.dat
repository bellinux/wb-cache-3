5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement but a small town, and much more to Allen's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he characterized as an appendix to Reason. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> a way to bring Man closer to the universe. The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Rand {{published}} her best-known work, {{the novel}} Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, {{she turned to}} non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> {{the only means of}} acquiring knowledge, and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral, and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, and instead supported laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. Conceiving of <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E

40|$|This {{is part of}} an authors meets critics {{session on}} Daniel Star's {{wonderful}} book, Knowing Better. I discuss a potential problem with Kearns and Star's <b>Reasons</b> <b>as</b> Evidence thesis. The issue {{has to do with the}} difficulties we face is we treat normative <b>reasons</b> <b>as</b> evidence and impose no possession conditions on evidence. On such a view, it's hard to see how practical reasoning could be a non-monotonic process. One way out of the difficulty would be to allow for (potent) unpossessed reasons but insist that all evidence is possessed evidence. This option, I argue, isn't open to proponents of the <b>Reasons</b> <b>as</b> Evidence thesis. Instead, it seems that they'll have to say that all normative reasons are identified with pieces of possessed evidence. This requires the proponents of the <b>Reasons</b> <b>as</b> Evidence thesis to impose epistemic constraints on norms that some of us find objectionable...|$|R
5|$|In {{the sixth}} season, Gilchrist made a {{comeback}} for his final IPL stint. He stated the <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> being the Kings XI management's decision to renew his contract for another season. An interesting {{change in the}} team staff was the induction of Darren Lehmann as the new Kings XI coach. This brought together the duo of Gilchrist and Lehmann who had guided their previous franchise, the Deccan Chargers to its 2009 IPL victory. Some good performances by the players led the Kings XI Punjab team eyeing for the fourth spot in the play-offs and a possible maiden win under Gilchrist's leadership. They were knocked out very late in the tournament. In his final game at IPL, Gilchrist decided to bowl the last over of the match against the Mumbai Indians, where he got the wicket of Harbhajan Singh of his first ball, securing KXIP's victory in the match. In a recent press conference, Gilchrist has confirmed {{that this will be}} his final IPL season and that he was looking forward to a fresh start in the inaugural Caribbean Premier League in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to pin point any one <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> being the main cause or catalyst of the mutiny. However, a recent perspective has emerged {{of the role of}} global connections. The mutiny has revealed the permeable nature of colonial boundaries and the way that external influences were able to reach the colonies in Southeast Asia. The sepoys of the 5th Light Infantry were constantly being bombarded with information about what was happening outside of Singapore. As news of the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan spread, an anti-British movement spearheaded by the Ghadar Party was also disseminating special pamphlets in a variety of languages which were reaching through secret channels {{into the hands of the}} sepoys. Acrimonious slogans against the British only fuelled the anti-colonial sentiment among the sepoys. Some of the slogans were “the wicked English and their allies are now attacking Islam, but the German Emperor and the Sultan of Turkey have sworn to liberate Asia from the tyranny. Now is the time to rise.... Only your strength and religious zeal are required”. The sepoys were clearly being bombarded with a lot of anti-British sentiments while being stationed on the small island of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

5|$|No new {{gameplay}} {{content was}} added to Type-0 HD. The team instead focused on upgrading the graphics, adjusting existing gameplay for home consoles, and including a lower difficulty level. The latter was due to complaints from players that the original game was too difficult. While carrying over the original's multiplayer functions was considered, it would have lengthened the estimated development time by another year. Since Tabata's priority was to bring the game to fans worldwide, the multiplayer and associated elements were either removed or incorporated into the single-player campaign. Tabata also decided against creation of a demo or an international version for this <b>reason.</b> <b>As</b> {{a substitute for the}} multiplayer, the team strengthened and improved the original single-player Academy Assistance function. As with the original, the team used the names of developers from both the core team and other Square Enix departments for the NPCs. While the main story remained unchanged, a secret cutscene teasing future Type games was commissioned. Created by Square Enix's CGI movie subsidiary Visual Works, it was based on some of Tabata's early ideas for Type-0. A small piece of the cutscene was shown privately to attendees of Square Enix's 25th anniversary commemoration event for the Final Fantasy series. Hiroki Chiba, writer for Type-0, returned to write the scene. In the cutscene, a fatally-wounded samurai warrior resembling main protagonist Ace is saved from death by a fire spirit.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges and the Roxolani invaded Lower Pannonia and Lower Moesia, respectively, in 117. The war was {{probably}} {{brought on by}} difficulties in visiting and trading with each other due {{to the location of}} Dacia between them. The Dacian provincial governor, Gaius Julius Quadratus Bassus, was killed in the invasion. The Roxolani surrendered first, so {{it is likely that the}} Romans exiled and then replaced their client king with one of their choosing. The Iazyges then concluded peace with Rome. The Iazyges and other Sarmatians invaded Roman Dacia in 123, likely for the same <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> the previous war of not being allowed to visit and trade with each other, Marcius Turbo stationed a thousand legionaries in Potaissa and Porolissum. The Romans probably used these towns as the invasion point into Rivulus Dominarum. Marcius Turbo succeeded in defeating the Iazyges; however, the terms of the peace, and the date, are not known.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{melting point}} of gallium {{allows it to}} melt in the human hand, and then refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong {{tendency}} to supercool below its melting point/freezing point. Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium {{is one of the}} four metals (with caesium, rubidium, and mercury) that are known to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium {{is the only one that}} is neither highly reactive nor highly toxic and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having (unlike mercury) a low vapor pressure at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale, the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, along with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and Teflon), making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror. For this <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.|$|E

5|$|Concepts {{for a third}} {{installment}} in the Parasite Eve {{video game}} series had been around for some time. As work was being finished on , Nomura voiced his wish {{to create a new}} game for the character Aya Brea, and this time it was taken up. Despite the story of Parasite Eve II not leaving many avenues for a sequel, the development team wanted to take advantage of advancing gaming technology and popularity by creating a mature gaming experience that would re-introduce Aya to players around the world. The main staff consisted of director Hajime Tabata, producer Yoshinori Kitase, creative producer and character designer Tetsuya Nomura, art director Isamu Kamikokuryo, scenario director Motomu Toriyama, and main writer Toshimitsu Takeuchi. Nomura requested Tabata as the two had worked well together on previous projects, and Nomura was busy with other projects despite his strong interest. The 3rd Birthday was originally announced in May 2007 as an episodic mobile game developed by Square Enix for Japan's FOMA mobile service. In 2008, during a special Square Enix event, the game was announced to have changed to a game for the PlayStation Portable. Part of the <b>reason,</b> <b>as</b> stated by Nomura, was that the desired level of realism was not possible on mobile phones. The game became exclusive to PSP as Tabata wanted to make full usage of the platform's hardware capabilities, along with it being a gaming platform available worldwide. Tabata and his team worked on The 3rd Birthday {{at the same time as}} fellow mobile-turned-PSP title Final Fantasy Type-0. Square Enix requested Tabata to concentrate on finishing The 3rd Birthday, leading to Type-0 almost being cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} {{company-wide}} narrative {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to listen and continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a <b>reason</b> <b>as</b> to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end that type of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{accounts}} of the subsequent battle: the account of Wen Daya, and a later official account, which became the dominant version in traditional Chinese historiography. The latter was compiled {{during the reign of}} Li Shimin, and therefore enhances his own role, having him decide the battle in a cavalry charge, while denigrating the role of both his father and his elder brother Li Jiancheng, whom Li Shimin would murder and supplant on the throne. The two accounts are difficult to reconcile, but Wen Daya's account, despite its own inadequacies, is to be preferred as an eyewitness testimony. According to Wen Daya, Li Yuan feared that Song Laosheng would deny battle and instead force him to engage in a prolonged and costly siege of the town. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>as</b> soon as the headquarters with the cavalry cleared the hills and came into view of Huoyi in the early afternoon of 8 September, Li Yuan sent his sons {{at the head of the}} cavalry to manoeuvre before the walls of Huoyi, hoping to entice the Sui army to come out. In this he hoped to exploit Song Laosheng's reputation for rashness. The slower-moving infantry, which formed bulk of Li Yuan's army, was still in the process of traversing the hills, and Li Yuan sent officers to hurry them up. Song Laosheng, who may have seen this as an opportunity to destroy his enemy piecemeal, deployed his army outside the town wall, but proved reluctant to advance further, and had to be goaded further away from the town through a feigned retreat by the cavalry.|$|E
