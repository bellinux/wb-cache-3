50|$|Subsequently, Steve Jr. {{engineered}} the stapling of rail to fiber track, along with inventing the first practical <b>rail</b> <b>joiner</b> and pre-assembled turnouts and flexible track. All of these products, and more, helped to popularize model railroading and {{assisted in the}} creation of a mass-market hobby. The growing company quickly outgrew the garage and basement of the family home. Realizing they could actually make a living selling track and related products, the first factory was built in nearby Hillside, New Jersey, at 413 Florence Avenue in 1947. On September 30, 1949, the Atlas Tool Company was incorporated.|$|E
5000|$|Track {{is offered}} with three {{different}} curve radii: 120 mm, 132.5 and 145 mm; straight tracks are 30 and 60 mm long. As of Q1 2010, switches (or turnouts) and crossovers are {{in the final stages}} of production. The sectional track is [...] "roadbed" [...] style, with integrated ballast. The rail is approximately 0.040 in high ("Code 40"). Track pieces are connected with gold-plated metal <b>rail</b> <b>joiners</b> plus plastic clips in the roadbed. Different types of dummy catenary masts can be attached to the track. Flex track is available in one metre lengths, with wood or concrete ties (not [...] "roadbed" [...] style).|$|R
5000|$|Successor Wm. K. Walthers {{continues}} to offer less-expensive train sets under the Life-Like name. They usually come with their Power-Loc brand of integrated roadbed track (originated in 1996 {{as the first}} HO track system that connects without the need of traditional <b>rail</b> <b>joiners),</b> along with action accessories such as an operating log dump station and car or railroad crossing with operating gates, building kits (usually a snap-together train station or their older [...] "Trackside Shanty" [...] kits), and additional accessories such as autos, trees, figures, signs and utility poles, {{to help make the}} most out of starting a model railroad. Most locomotives in these sets are either high-nose or low-nose EMD GP38-2, EMD F7, EMD F40PH, or 0-4-0 steam locomotive with tender, and roadnames include Santa Fe, Union Pacific, Chessie System, and Amtrak.|$|R
