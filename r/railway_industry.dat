5|$|The DWS has functioned {{successfully}} {{since its}} initial operation in 2007. The most powerful earthquake that THSRC has experienced measured 6.4 on the Richter Scale with an epicenter 17km from Jiaxian, Kaohsiung that shook southern Taiwan on 4 March 2010 (甲仙地震). One operating train was slightly derailed in Xinshi Tainan (台南新市) and six trains were {{stopped on the}} track. In spite of the temporary suspension of operations, there was no damage or casualties. All 2,500 affected passengers were evacuated in two hours without injury. Service resumed the next day. Such a record was well noted, and provided valuable experience in operational safety to the global <b>railway</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic <b>railway</b> <b>industry</b> of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E

5|$|In August 1849 the MCS {{appointed}} Joseph Bazalgette to {{the position}} of assistant surveyor. He had been working as a consultant engineer in the <b>railway</b> <b>industry</b> until overwork had brought about a serious breakdown in his health; his appointment to the commission was his first position on his return to employment. Working under the chief engineer, Frank Foster, he began to develop a more systematic plan for the city's sewers. The stress of his position was too much for Foster and he died in 1852; Bazalgette was promoted into his position, and continued refining and developing the plans {{for the development of the}} sewerage system. The Metropolis Management Act 1855 replaced the commission with the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), which took control of the sewers.|$|E
5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town.

Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|With the {{expansion}} of the electric supply industry in the early 1900s, power stations were built to supply homes with electric lighting. Around Newcastle upon Tyne this led to the construction of power stations at Lemington, The Close and Carville. Two supply companies built the stations, the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company (NESCo) to the east of Newcastle, and the Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company (DisCo) to the west. To meet an increasing demand for electricity, NESCo commissioned Dunston Power Station (later Dunston A Power Station) on the Derwent Haugh, a large flood plain to the west of Gateshead, to balance the supply of the Newcastle area with the Carville station. Construction of the new station began in 1908, the work undertaken by the company of Sir Robert McAlpine. They completed the construction in the short time of 20months, and this was to be their first in a large number of power station constructions, following the decline of the <b>railway</b> <b>industry.</b> In 1910, the station was opened and began generating electricity.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} scholarship {{over the last}} fifty years on the causes of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century British <b>railway</b> <b>industry’s</b> declining profitability. Nonetheless, scholars have largely avoided studying how individual companies’ were managed, instead making general conclusions about the challenges industry leaders faced and the quality of their responses. This thesis examines the management of one of the British <b>railway</b> <b>industry’s</b> largest companies, the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), during the tenures of three of its General Managers: Archibald Scott, who was in the post between 1870 and 1884, Charles Scotter, who succeeded him from 1885 to 1897, and Charles Owens, who held the position between 1898 and 1911. Compared with other major British railways the LSWR’s profitability ranged from being poor under Scott, to excellent under Scotter and then average under Owens. This thesis will explore what internal and external factors caused these changes. Furthermore, it considers how the business’ organisational form, senior managers’ career paths and directors’ external business interests all played a role in shaping the company’s operational efficiency and financial performance. Ultimately, the thesis will argue that while external factors were an influence on the LSWR’s profitability between 1870 and 1911, primarily its financial performance was determined by the quality of the strategies and policies enacted by its directors and managers. Ultimately, this thesis brings clarity to the existing debates and, by using the LSWR as a case study, provides important suggestions as to what actually caused the British <b>railway</b> <b>industry’s</b> declining profitability between 1870 and 1911...|$|R
