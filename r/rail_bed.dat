It has agreed to establish a right-of-way, rerouting the trail to allow public access. Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool, which will be bypassed. The Mohonk Preserve and Open Space Conservancy were given a $20,000 state grant in March 2011 to maintain the portion of the trail by Kingston. By the end of summer 2013, the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale-Kingston extension was opened to the public, completing the entire 23.7 mile rail trail.|$|E

50|$|The {{sections}} Offenburg-Hausach and Villingen-Singen were {{expanded into}} twin track lines by November 1921, {{which was made}} possible {{by the fact that the}} <b>rail</b> <b>beds</b> of the entire Black Forest Railway had been laid out to accommodate two tracks.

2500|$|By February 5, 1862 the {{construction}} was still proceeding, but no ballast was being used, as is typically needed for drainage {{and stability of}} <b>rail</b> <b>beds,</b> and the ties were being spaced a twice the normal spread.

25|$|The only carrier {{to exist}} in Bermuda folded in 1948 and was {{converted}} to a rail trail in 1984. Some of the former right of way has been converted for automobile traffic, but 18 miles are reserved for pedestrian use and bicycles on paved portions. The <b>rail</b> <b>bed</b> spans {{the length of the}} island, and connected Hamilton to St. George's and several villages, though several bridges are derelict, causing the trail to be fragmented.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{technical}} difficulties {{for such a}} railway. About half of the second section was built on barely permanent permafrost. In the summer, the uppermost layer thaws, and the ground becomes muddy. The heat from the trains passing above is able to melt the permafrost even with a small change in temperature. The main engineering challenge, aside from oxygen shortages, is {{the weakness of the}} permafrost. For areas of permafrost that are not very fragile, an embankment of large rocks is sufficient. Meanwhile, in the most fragile areas, the <b>rail</b> <b>bed</b> must be elevated like a bridge. The engineers dealt with this problem in the areas of weakest permafrost by building elevated tracks with pile-driven foundations sunk deep into the ground. Similar to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, portions of the track are also passively cooled with ammonia-based heat exchangers.|$|E

25|$|Copper was {{effective}} in reducing microbial loads on all 6 surfaces tested (i.e., <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> by 91%, <b>bed</b> levers by 82%, tray tables by 83%, chair arms by 92%, monitor pen by 49%, and IV poles by 88%).|$|R
40|$|Bedside {{safety rails}} are used {{extensively}} throughout hospitals and residential care environments {{as a safety}} device to protect people against the risk of falling out of bed. However, several adverse incidents involving body entrapment {{have been linked to}} their use, which have resulted in serious injury to the bed occupants and, in more extreme cases, fatalities. Internationally agreed standards (i. e. European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) standards) for the design and testing of <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> have recently been developed and are targeted at improved safety requirements (European Committee for Standardisation 1997, 2000). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to: 1) determine whether the CEN test procedure for assessing <b>bed</b> <b>rail</b> strength and rigidity requirements is consistent with human force exertions to which <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> may be exposed; 2) carry out loading tests on <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> currently in use throughout the UK to determine whether they comply with the current safety recommendations proposed by the CEN standards. A laboratory study was conducted to determine the force exertions of 20 participants performing seven tasks (including activities of both bed occupants and care providers), which were considered representative of the forces to which <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> could be exposed during normal use. Forces exerted by participants were measured using a force platform and distortions of the <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> leading to potential entrapment zones were measured using linear displacement transducers. Static load tests were then conducted, in which incremental point loading was applied at the most adverse points on each of nine different <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> (commonly used in UK nursing and residential care homes) in accordance with the test procedure detailed in the current CEN standards. Maximum static forces exerted by participants were found to range between 250 N and 350 N, which were within the 500 N force tolerance requirements set by the standards. Dynamic tasks involving ‘rolling aggressively’ against the <b>bed</b> <b>rail</b> produced the highest peak force of 722 N. None of the <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> included in this study met the requirements of the CEN test procedures, principally due to horizontal lateral displacements being in excess of 50 mm for a 500 N applied force and/or the bed rails' inability to withstand inward horizontal forces of 500 N. Bed rails used with divan beds were often unable to withstand forces greater than 300 N due to turning moments exceeding the <b>bed</b> <b>rail's</b> restraining mechanism. Current CEN standards for assessing the strength and rigidity of bedside safety rails appear to be consistent with the human forces that might arise as a consequence of the normal movement and activities of a bed occupant or care provider. Although compliance with existing standards is not compulsory, findings from the tests carried out on the selection of <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> in current use throughout the UK highlight the need for improvements in the design and manufacture of <b>bed</b> <b>rails...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Streetcar {{tracks in}} Portland {{are the same}} gauge as MAX tracks, but of a lighter and {{shallower}} construction (the <b>rail</b> <b>bed</b> is only [...] deep), and the two systems share the same overhead line voltage, 750 Vdc.
