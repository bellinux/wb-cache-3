25|$|Another {{phenomenon}} is <b>relearning.</b> Some studies show that, despite {{the end of}} learning and no language input, a residual learning can happen. Weltens (1989), who studied foreign language learners, identifies an increase in reading and listening comprehension. He says that it happens because a process of maturation happens. Schöpper-Grabe determines that contact and the intensity with the target language cannot be the only variable causing language attrition (Schöpper-Grabe 1998).|$|E
25|$|In 1971, he {{returned}} to Japan {{with the aim of}} <b>relearning</b> the aikido from the basics. Besides aikido, he worked as gymnastics professor at the Dokkyo High School, where he had been a pupil before. Seven years passed like that instead of one to two years as he had envisaged. He collected some experience in teaching and some knowledge in Asian medicine like Seitai or seibukenkoho (method of cure according to the manner of seibu). He had also the possibility to learn the hojo kata (in the Kobudo Chokoshinei-ryu).|$|E
25|$|A recent {{newspaper}} article by the Toronto Star states that everyone to sing, {{even if they}} are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to <b>relearning</b> the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates {{the right side of the}} brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.|$|E

25|$|For {{most people}} with stroke, {{physical}} therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) are the cornerstones of the rehabilitation process. Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved {{by the use of}} ankle foot orthoses. PT and OT have overlapping areas of expertise; however, PT focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and <b>relearning</b> functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with patients to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and patient’s goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the patient relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes. OT is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. Speech and language therapy is appropriate for people with the speech production disorders: dysarthria and apraxia of speech, aphasia, cognitive-communication impairments, and problems with swallowing.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{stepped down}} in 1986 after {{thirteen}} years as musical director; he was succeeded by Mackerras, whose {{association with the}} company dated back more than thirty years. Among the features of his six-year tenure was an increasing use of surtitles for performances not given in English. In the company's early days, all operas had been sung in English, but as more international stars began to appear as guest principals the language policy had to be reconsidered: few of the leading names in world opera were interested in <b>relearning</b> their roles in English. WNO steered a middle course between the practices of the two main London companies; after the 1960s The Royal Opera had generally given operas in the original language, and English National Opera was committed to opera in English. WNO's practice varied, after its early years. Examples from the 1980s include Wagner's Tristan und Isolde sung in German, and the Ring in English; and Verdi's The Force of Destiny given in English and Otello in Italian. Mackerras was a strong advocate of performance in the original language, with surtitles: [...] "I can't imagine a greater advance for opera. … What a gift! It's like Siegfried understanding the woodbird." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start <b>relearning</b> his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E

However, due to Ibotenic acid's reactivity with glutamate receptors such as the NMDA receptor, Ibotenic acid lesioning does allow the subject to <b>relearn</b> tasks. Due to this, Ibotenic acid lesioning is preferred in studies where re-learning a task after lesioning is essential.When compared to other lesioning agents, Ibotenic acid {{is one of the}} most site-specific, however, on going research is searching for less-damaging alternatives.|$|R

The show was billed as Nudedragons, an anagram for Soundgarden. Asked in August 2010 if Soundgarden will record new material, Cornell replied, [...] "it would be exciting to record one song, to hear how Soundgarden-ish that might be this much time later.

Damaged networks are less effective by zeroing the weight of the connection. Each connection is embedded and is still faintly there, making it easier to <b>relearn.</b>|$|R

[...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{approach}} {{takes the}} term [...] "Renaissance" [...] literally as a [...] "rebirth". A closer study of Greek Philosophy and Greek Mathematics demonstrates {{that nearly all}} of the so-called revolutionary results of the so-called scientific revolution were in actuality restatements of ideas that were in many cases older than those of Aristotle and in nearly all cases at least as old as Archimedes. Aristotle even explicitly argues against some of the ideas that were espoused during the scientific revolution, such as heliocentrism. The basic ideas of the scientific method were well known to Archimedes and his contemporaries, as demonstrated in the well-known discovery of buoyancy. Atomism was first thought of by Leucippus and Democritus. Lucio Russo claims that science as a unique approach to objective knowledge was born in the Hellenistic period (c. 300 B.C), but was extinguished {{with the advent of the}} Roman Empire. [...] This approach to the scientific revolution reduces it to a period of <b>relearning</b> classical ideas that is very much an extension of the Renaissance. [...] This view does not deny that a change occurred but argues that it was a reassertion of previous knowledge (a renaissance) and not the creation of new knowledge. [...] It cites statements from Newton, Copernicus and others in favour of the Pythagorean worldview as evidence.|$|E

40|$|Extrastriate {{visual cortex}} of the ventral-posterior suprasylvian gyrus (vPS cortex) of freely {{behaving}} cats was reversibly deactivated with cooling {{to determine its}} role in performance on a battery of simple or masked two-dimensional pattern discriminations, and three-dimensional object discriminations. Deactivation of vPS cortex by cooling profoundly impaired {{the ability of the}} cats to recall the difference between all previously learned pattern and object discriminations. However, the cats' ability to learn or <b>relearn</b> pattern and object discriminations while vPS was deactivated depended upon the nature of the pattern or object and the cats' prior level of exposure to them. During cooling of vPS cortex, the cats could neither learn the novel object discriminations nor <b>relearn</b> a highly familiar masked or partially occluded pattern discrimination, although they could <b>relearn</b> both the highly familiar object and simple pattern discriminations.
