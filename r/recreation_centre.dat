5|$|Hamersley's first school, Glendale Primary School in Glendale Avenue, {{opened in}} 1971 {{in the western}} portion of the suburb. The school and {{neighbouring}} kindergarten quickly became overcrowded as their catchment area initially extended to Hepburn Avenue, taking in Warwick and Greenwood to its north. As schools were built in those suburbs in 1974–1976, congestion eased considerably. The school and kindergarten were also used as a hall and meeting place by residents and groups until the <b>recreation</b> <b>centre</b> opened in April 1975. In 2016, the school provided for 248 primary students between Year 1 and Year 6, and 28 pre-primary students.|$|E

5|$|Willis had thus {{earned a}} second season at Surrey, and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches, taking 40 {{first-class}} wickets at 28.37, and 31 one day wickets at 14.65. Surrey came {{fifth in the}} Championship that year. He achieved a noteworthy performance in the Gillette Cup quarter-final against Middlesex. In a high-scoring match, Surrey made 280 {{for the loss of}} five wickets. Middlesex appeared to be coasting to victory when they reached 240–3, but Willis turned the game, and they collapsed and finished on 272–9. Willis took 6–49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award. Despite this, Surrey's preference for Geoff Arnold and Robin Jackman kept Willis out of the side on occasions. He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace <b>Recreation</b> <b>Centre</b> while playing as a goalkeeper for local football club Cobham. However, Ray Illingworth and Colin Cowdrey, captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via telephone to ask him to travel to Australia and join the current England tour there. Willis, who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited his call up to the influence of senior member of the touring party John Edrich, Willis' long-term friend, mentor and Surrey teammate.|$|E
