500|$|The New Yorkers David Denby {{felt the}} new version of Hairspray was [...] "perfectly pleasant," [...] but {{compared}} unfavorably to the Broadway musical, since [...] " [...] have removed the traces of camp humor and Broadway blue that gave the stage show its happily knowing flavor." [...] Denby criticized the dance numbers, calling them [...] "unimaginatively shot," [...] and he considered [...] "the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy’s hefty mother... a blandly earnest betrayal." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray [...] "reasonably entertaining. But do we <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> entertained reasonably? Waters' original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this Hairspray toils needlessly {{to make sense of}} that craziness, and something gets lost in the translation." [...] Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of [...] "I Know Where I've Been" [...] was incorporated into the movie, saying [...] "The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Broderick and Hughes {{stayed in}} touch for a while after production. [...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1515 Fugger {{provided}} a loan of 48.000 guilders to Albrecht von Brandenburg {{to pay for}} his acquisition of the archdioceses of Magdeburg in 1512 and Mainz in 1514. To repay his debt Albrecht ceded his part of the indulgence granted by Pope Leo X for the construction of St. Peter's Basilica. Within the large scale of the Fugger business, however, the sale of indulgences was insignificant. Nevertheless, it caused considerable potential for conflict due to its moral dubiousness, and its role in the advancement of the Reformation in Germany. The sale of indulgences by the Dominican Johann Tetzel was one of the causes that motivated Martin Luther to formulate his 95 Theses. In 1520 Luther wrote in his letter To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation (...) : [...] "Fugger and similar people <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kept in check" [...] (...)

For all the use we are to her, we might go back to the ship. However, as we are here we may as well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody really wants us.

They feel Jerry has a better chance in the long run of losing weight and keeping it off than Dan will if he went home this early in the game. After deliberation, the contestants unanimously vote to send Jerry home, which eliminates both Jerry and Estella.|$|E

50|$|The current Internet {{architecture}} has {{an incomplete}} naming and addressing schema, which {{the reason why}} mobility and multi-homing require ad-hoc solutions and protocols tailored to different operational environments. The only names provided are Point of Attachment (PoA) names (IP addresses), which are usually confused to be node names. The {{result is that the}} network has no way to understand that the two or more IP addresses of a multi-homed node belong to the same node, making multi-homing hard. The same choice, naming the interface and not the node, forces the Internet to perform routing on the interface level instead of the node level, resulting in having much bigger routing tables than they <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Mobility, which can be seen as dynamic multi-homing, is the next feature that suffers from having an incomplete naming schema.|$|E
