Neutral compounds in which helium and neon are involved in chemical bonds have not been formed (although there is some theoretical evidence for a few helium compounds), while xenon, krypton, and argon have shown only minor <b>reactivity.</b> The <b>reactivity</b> follows the order Ne < He < Ar < Kr < Xe < Rn.|$|E
5|$|Although lithium {{is widely}} {{distributed}} on Earth, {{it does not}} naturally occur in elemental form due to its high <b>reactivity.</b> The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm), or 25 micromolar; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.|$|E

40|$|The {{serological}} <b>reactivities</b> of polysaccharides {{isolated from}} five species of dermatophytes, Microsporum quinckeanum, Trichophyton granulosum, T. interdigitale, T. rubrum, and T. schoenleinii, with rabbit antisera to these species were studied qualitatively by precipitation in gel and quantitatively by complement-fixation analyses. Significant {{differences in the}} serological <b>reactivities</b> of the galactomannans I were detected with antisera to T. schoenleinii and T. interdigitale. The differences appeared {{to be related to}} the specificity of these antisera for the galactofuranose residues in the polysaccharides. Antisera to M. quinckeanum, T. granulosum, or T. rubrum did not detect differences between the galactomannans I. The serological <b>reactivities</b> of the galactomannans II were different with each of the five antisera. The <b>reactivities</b> of the glucans could be correlated with the amount of α 1 → 6 linked glucopyranose residues when antisera to T. schoenleinii and M. quinckeanum were used...|$|R

30|$|Radical-chain {{mechanisms}} are postulated for fragmentation of gaseous LG instead of heterolysis reactions from the kinetic data [12]. We discussed the different fragmentation <b>reactivities</b> (GlcαOMe[*]>[*]GlcβOMe[*]>[*]LG) {{in terms of}} the <b>reactivities</b> of the C- and O-centered radicals, which are formed through hydrogen abstractions by radical species from C–H and O–H groups, respectively. Although the selectivity of the hydrogen abstraction during pyrolysis is unclear, 1 -C, 6 -C, and 6 -O radicals shown in Fig.  9 were considered, because <b>reactivities</b> of these radicals are expected to be different between methyl glucosides and LG.

40|$|Chemical tools {{have been}} {{valuable}} for establishing {{a better understanding}} of the relationships between metal ion dyshomeostasis, the abnormal aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Still, very little information is available to correlate the structures of chemical tools with specific <b>reactivities</b> used to uncover such relationships. Recently, slight structural variations to the framework of a chemical tool were found to drastically determine the tool's <b>reactivities</b> toward multiple pathological facets to various extents. Herein, we report our rational design and characterization of a structural series to illustrate the extent to which the <b>reactivities</b> of small molecules vary toward different targets as a result of minor structural modifications. These compounds were rationally and systematically modified based on consideration of properties, including ionization potentials and metal binding, to afford their desired <b>reactivities</b> with metal-free or metal-bound Aβ, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and free organic radicals. Our results show that although small molecules are structurally similar, they can interact with multiple factors associated with AD pathogenesis and alleviate their <b>reactivities</b> to different degrees. Together, our studies demonstrate the rational structure-directed design that can be used to develop chemical tools capable of regulating individual or interrelated pathological features in AD...|$|R

40|$|We {{report that}} {{approximately}} 1 / 4 of monoclonal rheumatoid factors produced by hybridomas derived from fusions of spleen cells from MRL/lpr/lpr mice with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) and arthritis exhibited multiple <b>reactivities</b> with other autoantigens, including dDNA, histones, and/or cytoskeletal-cytoplasmic elements. The patterns of <b>reactivities</b> of most of these clones differed, indicating that each had a separate B cell ancestor. Studies with eluted antibodies demonstrated that a single species of antibody molecules {{was responsible for the}} observed multiple <b>reactivities.</b> Inhibition experiments suggested that an antibody combining site may be large enough to accommodate dissimilar epitopes.

40|$|Patients with {{systemic}} {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) produce antibodies to many different self-antigens. Here, we investigated antibodies in SLE sera using an antigen microarray containing many hundreds of antigens, mostly self-antigens. The aim was to detect sets of antibody <b>reactivities</b> characteristic of SLE patients in each of various clinical states – SLE patients with acute lupus nephritis, SLE patients in renal remission, and SLE patients who had never had renal involvement. The analysis produced two novel findings: (i) an SLE antibody profile persists independently of disease activity and despite long-term clinical remission, and (ii) this SLE antibody profile includes increases in four specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) <b>reactivities</b> to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and hyaluronic acid; the profile also includes decreases in specific IgM <b>reactivities</b> to myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD 99, collagen III, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP 1) and cardiolipin. The <b>reactivities</b> together showed high sensitivity (> 93 %) and high specificity for SLE (> 88 %). A healthy control subject who had the SLE antibody profile was later found to develop clinical SLE. The present study did not detect antibody <b>reactivities</b> that differentiated among the various subgroups of SLE subjects with statistical significance. Thus, SLE is characterized by an enduring antibody profile irrespective of clinical state. The association of SLE with decreased IgM natural autoantibodies suggests that these autoantibodies might enhance resistance to SLE...|$|R

5|$|The alkali metals, due {{to their}} high <b>reactivity,</b> do not occur {{naturally}} in pure form in nature. They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core.

5|$|The {{production}} of the metals itself is difficult due to their <b>reactivity.</b> The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are reacted with coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the metals are then reacted with magnesium, yielding magnesium chloride and the metals.|$|E
5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. This {{is the result of}} a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing <b>reactivity</b> down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the <b>reactivity</b> increases down the group.|$|E

Of fundamental importance is {{the relative}} <b>reactivities</b> of the 1 - and 2 - positions in naphthalene to electrophilic and nucleophilic attacking reagents. With two partial exceptions, sulphonation and Friedal-Crafts reactions, reactions involving attack by electrophilic reagent take place in the 1 - position (C 1).

40|$|Basic {{data are}} {{lacking in the}} {{literature}} concerning the <b>reactivities</b> of desensitizing dyes to Iodine, and concerning their redox potentials while undergoing such reactions. Such information {{may be useful in}} deciding on the mechanism of desensitization, since there is good evidence that the halogen liberated from an Iodobromide emulsion during photolysis is actually Iodine. Therefore, experiments were undertaken to measure the polarographic anodic potential of the first addition product of a series of thiacyanine dyes, if such a species existed. Also, preliminary experiments were undertaken to determine the relative <b>reactivities</b> of the dyes to molecular Iodine and Bromine while they were adsorbed to a dilute Silver Bromide sol. Both experiments proved unfeasable because, first, {{it was not possible to}} achieve a stable sol for the purpose of spectrophotometry, and second, the dyes did not show a stable, reactive intermediate. However; basic data concerning the relative <b>reactivities</b> of the dyes to Iodine and Bromine were obtained.
