It was shown that γ′ precipitate coarsening occurs in the bulk of the specimens and obeys the LSW kinetics. Metallographic analysis led to the conclusion that creep does not alter oxidation, except at grain boundaries, where oxide spikes can be developed under creep. Therefore grain boundary oxidation was found to be creep strain-assisted. A constitutive model accounting for precipitate coarsening was proposed. The oxidation-assisted intergranular damage and the oxidation embrittlement of the microstructure elements phenomena were successfully described using the continuum damage mechanics and the local ductility exhaustion laws, respectively.

The interconnection is based on Cu stripes embedded in a polyimide-enhanced (PI-enhanced) layer.

Stretchable interconnects with a PI-enhanced layer were fabricated based on the optimized design parameters and tested. In situ experimental observations did validate the optimal design. Statistical analysis indicated that the PI width plays the most important role among the different design parameters. By increasing the PI width, the plastic strain in the Cu stripes is reduced, and thus, the stretchability and fatigue lifetime {{of the system is}} increased.

Such interventions are used when there is extensive leaflet prolapse caused by chordae <b>rupture</b> or <b>elongation.</b> Understanding the role of individual chordae tendineae before operating could be helpful to predict if the mitral valve will be competent at peak systole. Biomechanical modeling and simulation can achieve this goal. Methods: We present a method to semi-automatically build a mitral valve computational model from micro CT (computed tomography) scans: after manually picking chordae fiducial points, the leaflets are segmented and the boundary conditions {{as well as the}} loading conditions are automatically defined. Fast Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation is carried out using Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) to reproduce leaflet closure at peak systole. We develop three metrics to evaluate simulation results: i) point-to-surface error with the ground truth reference extracted from the CT image, ii) coaptation surface area of the leaflets and iii) an indication if the simulated closed leaflets leak. Results: We validate our method on three explanted porcine hearts and show that our model predicts the closed valve surface with point-to-surface error of appoximately 1 mm, a reasonable coaptation surface area, and absence of leak at peak systole (maximum closed pressure). We also evaluate the sensitivity of our model to changes in various parameters (tissue elasticity, mesh accuracy, and the transformation matrix used for CT scan registration). We also measure the influence of the chordae tendineae positions on simulation results and show that marginal chordae have a greater influence on the final shape than intermediate chordae.

The relationship between carbide volume fraction {{and the loss}} of ductility was systematically investigated. The embrittlement was found to be severe for volume fractions greater than about 0. 03 if the carbides were formed principally on grain and twin boundaries. Cracks were propagated unhindered in the continuous, grain boundary carbide films formed in alloys containing Cr or Mo and caused intergranular fracture with rupture elongations of similar magnitude to that of the carbide phase itself. Grain boundary carbide precipitates which were not continuous led to less severe ductility loss. Intracrystalline carbide precipitates as found in the W or Nb containing alloys reduced the ductility only slightly compared with grain boundary carbidesin alloys of similar carbon content because the linkage of pores was prevented by the presence of ductile matrix between the pores. The fracture of individual intragranular carbides as well as of connected carbide plates was interpreted using the parallel loaded, two phase structure model.

40|$|The {{austenitic}} steel 1. 4981 thermomechanically treated {{to provide a}} range of microstructures has been irradiated at temperatures of 400 - 500 °C with neutron fluxes of 1, 55 x 10 ^ 23 to 3 x 10 ^ 25 m^- 2. The degree of high temperature helium embrittiement caused by (n, α) nuclear reactions was determined in post-irradiation tensile and stress rupture tests at temperatures in the range 400 - 850 °C. Under the irradition conditions used, the production of helium within the grains {{was so great that}} the helium concentration at grain boundaries which leads to ductility loss was controlled by the diffusion of helium. At test temperatures below 700 °C, the difference in the duration of tensile and of stress rupture tests has a significant effect. The test results show that the microstructural variations of the steel 1. 4981 tested under the same conditions exhibited similar relative ductilityloss. However, the absolute value of the <b>rupture</b> <b>elongation</b> after irradiation was proportional to the ductility of the material in the unirradiated condition, which was in turn dependent on the thermomechanical treatment. Specimens which had been embrittled by helium were found to contain numerous intercrystalline microcracks, which were orientated normal to the stress direction and eventually caused rupture. The elongation of the specimens resulted mainly from the widening of the microcracks; the grains themselves were not elongated to the same extent as found in unirradiated specimens. This explains why for the irradiated specimens litte or no secondary creep was observed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractType 316 L(N) {{austenitic}} stainless steel {{is used for the}} fabrication of Proto-type Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) under advanced stage of construction at Kalpakkam, India. The influence of flowing sodium on creep rupture behaviour of the steel has been investigated and results are compared with those obtained on carrying out creep test in air environment. Creep test on the material both in flowing sodium and in air were carried out at 873 K over a stress range of 225 - 305 MPa. Sodium velocity across the creep specimen was maintained around 2. 5 m/s. The testing environment was found not to change the rate of steady state creep deformation significantly. The tertiary stage of creep deformation of the steel was found to change significantly by the testing environment. The tertiary stage of creep deformation in the steel started much later for testing in sodium environment than that in air environment. The steel possessed higher creep rupture life for testing in liquid sodium environment that in air environment. Higher creep rupture strength of the material in flowing sodium was companied with higher creep <b>rupture</b> <b>elongation.</b> Optical micrographic investigation of the creep ruptured specimen in air showed extensive intergranular creep cavitation both in interior {{as well as on the}} specimen surface, whereas specimen tested in sodium showed relatively less creep cavitation. Almost no oxidation was observed on the specimen surface creep tested in flowing sodium and also no evidence of surface damage due to possible carburization and decarburization was noticed. SEM fractrographs of the creep ruptured specimens tested in flowing sodium showed predominantly ductile dimple failure whereas predominantly intergranular creep failure was observed in the creep ruptured specimen tested in air...|$|E
40|$|Biodegradable soft {{elastomeric}} biomaterials are desired in {{the application}} of soft tissue engineering and a new family of crosslinked elastomers, poly (polyol sebacate) (PPS), have shown promises in applications of nerve, vascular and myocardial tissue engineering. However, a number of problems remain with these novel polymers, including the poor reproducibility in the synthesis and properties of PPS, the toxicity of very soft versions of the PPS family, and too rapid degradation rates. Therefore, this PhD thesis project aims to address these issues and develop soft, degradable elastomers with improved reliability, biocompatibility and satisfactory degradation rates. The major results include: (1) The poor reproducibility of poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) was caused by the evaporation of small molecule, glycerol; and the satisfactory biocompatibility and reasonable slow degradation rate of PGS could only be achieved by a long curing time with a compromise of mechanical elasticity. (2) In order to achieve a satisfactory combination of mechanical flexibility and degradation rate, a larger monomer, xylitol, was used to replace glycerol to synthesize poly(xylitol sebacate) (PXS). A comparative study on PXS and PGS demonstrated that PXS polymers had better mechanical elasticity (twice elongation) than PGS of the same crosslink density, whilst their degradation rate and biocompatibility were similar to those of PGS counterparts. (3) The degradation mechanisms of PGS and PXS was further investigated in vitro and it demonstrated that all the materials underwent esterase enzymatic and free radical synergistically degradation. (4) In order to achieve nonlinear elasticity of soft tissue, an elastomeric PXS scaffold was fabricated by core/shell electrospinning technique using PXS as the core material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the shell polymer, with PVA shell being washed off after PXS curing. The newly fabricated PXS scaffold exhibited softer and remarkably higher <b>rupture</b> <b>elongation</b> than PXS sheet in aqueous conditions. In conclusion, soft, degradable elastomeric biomaterial with improved reliability, biocompatibility and satisfactory degradation rates could be achieved from the elastomer PXS using the core/shell electrospinning technique. The produced PXS fibrous scaffold demonstrated a high potential in soft tissue engineering in terms of biocompatibility, mechanical properties and degradation kinetics. Further work shall focus on in vivo evaluation of the PXS fibrous scaffold...|$|E
