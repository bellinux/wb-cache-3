25|$|It {{was argued}} by Martin Chanock that, as a {{reaction}} to the rapid social and economic changes {{that took place in the}} late pre-colonial and early colonial periods, older men in many African communities sought to impose their authoritarian and <b>restrictive</b> <b>interpretation</b> of customary law, which they used to control younger men and particularly women. It was this view of traditional law as a punitive instrument rather than a means of mediating disputes that was presented to the Europeans codifying these laws. It was also the view of traditional law in Malawi that inspired both the then-Prime Minister, Banda, and the Minister of Justice Orton Chirwa to criticise such principles of English-based law as the presumption of innocence, the need to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt and the requirement for corroborating evidence. By 1969, Aleke Banda, the Minister of Finance, openly attacked the use of defence lawyers and the safeguards or restrictions imposed by the English-law Rules of evidence. Dr Banda specifically linked traditional law to punishment, and claimed that lack of evidence was not proof of innocence.|$|E

As evidenced by the title, the subject is Napoleon, and the content is Ingres's representation of Napoleon as [...] "Emperor-God beyond time and space".

By scrutinizing the process of developing refugee policies during the 1990 s and 2000 s, the research will demonstrate that the countries united in the V 4 platform in their first years of transition generously contributed to international refugee protection. Steep increase of asylum applicants and negotiation talks with the EU in the late 1990 s brought various changes to the refugee policies in the region, marked by more closely defining and the enhancing of asylum seekers' and recognized refugees' rights, but also by lower refugee recognition rates. Accession to the European Union ultimately resulted in more complete and comprehensive asylum policies in line with the Common European Asylum System (CEAS).

40|$|Application of the World Trade Organization 2 ̆ 7 s (WTO) dispute {{resolution}} procedures to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement) has provoked {{a variety of}} reactions over time. At its inception, the decision to enforce the treaty through the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s {{dispute resolution}} process was widely viewed as a loss for developing countries. Many feared {{it would lead to}} an explosion of litigation against developing countries and cause distortions in domestic intellectual property (IP) policy making. More recent scholarship, however, has argued that these fears were unfounded. Few disputes before WTO panels have involved violations of the TRIPS Agreement, even fewer have been brought against developing countries, and none of those have authorized the withdrawal of trade concessions. This Article argues that the availability of adjudication through the WTO has indeed had significant consequences for the policy space of developing countries-just not in the manner initially imagined. Although the TRIPS Agreement has given rise to relatively few litigated cases overall, the threat of defending a costly complaint and the possibility of sanctions have contributed to a culture of overcompliance that has discouraged countries from experimenting with flexibilities protected under the treaty. Yet the problem of trade adjudication {{is not so much a}} problem of adjudication as it is of trade. Although the decision to link trade and intellectual property has transformed intellectual property discourse in a variety of ways, one of its most underappreciated consequences has been the conflation of trade and intellectual property jurisprudence in TRIPS dispute resolution. In an important case interpreting exceptions and limitations under TRIPS, the panel applied an interpretive approach drawn from trade cases that was fundamentally at odds with the structure and purpose of the TRIPS Agreement. The decision to subject intellectual property decision making to adjudication within the trade system has thereby led to overly <b>restrictive</b> <b>interpretations</b> that do not respect the intentions of the parties or the needs of intellectual property policy making. This Article proposes the use of a more deferential standard of review and a human rights presumption to remedy these overly <b>restrictive</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Panels should consider and respect the purposes states attempt to achieve through intellectual property regulation and should give greater presumptive weight to state policies that seek to fulfill human rights and protect human health and dignity. Additional deference to state priorities is appropriate given the object and purpose of the treaty and the nature of intellectual property regulation itself. Moreover, such deference is particularly important with respect to least developed countries. Several provisions of the WTO-covered agreements require special attention to the needs of least developed countries, and a deferential standard of review would be an important means of giving content to these terms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{starts from}} the {{encounter}} between a European navy vessel and a dinghy carrying boat refugees and other desperate migrants across the Mediterranean or West African Sea towards Europe. It explores the growing {{trend in the}} EU of enacting migration control at the high seas or international waters - so-called interdiction. It is argued that these forms of extraterritorial migra-tion control aim at reconquering {{the efficiency of the}} sovereign function to control migration, by trying to either deconstruct or shift correlate obligations vis- 0 -vis refugees and other persecuted persons to third States. In both instances, European States are entering into a sovereignty game, in which creative strategies are developed in order to reassert sovereign power unconstrained by national and international obligations. Starting from an analysis of the refugee regime itself, the paper looks at the possibilities for as-serting human rights extraterritorially, on the high seas, in foreign territorial waters and in relation to situations defined as search and rescue missions. On the basis of this, two interrelated dynamics emerge. The first concerns the legal debate surrounding the criteria for establishing extra-territorial jurisdiction. The so far <b>restrictive</b> <b>interpretations</b> applied provide a context for States to deconstruct protection responsibilities towards refugees by moving migration control outside their sovereign territory and into that of a foreign State. The second dynamic is what could be termed a growing commercialisation of sovereignty for the purpose of migration control. By negotiating access to foreign territorial waters or simply outsource the function of migration control to e. g. North and West African countries, European States are exploiting territorial principles of international law to shift and reduce refugee responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|This {{collection}} {{is concerned with}} access to asylum justice in the sense outlined in Chapter 1; that is: it focuses {{on the ability of}} protection seekers to overcome the physical obstacles to reaching territory as well as the legal, policy or political barriers to a quality asylum procedure. The majority of chapters have explored the interplay between law and asylum, largely focusing on <b>restrictive</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the law or the inability of asylum seekers and refugees to benefit from rights and entitlements provided by the law. The countries considered are all party to the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees/ 1967 Protocol (Refugee Convention) and they are therefore bound under international law to meet their obligations to refugees as set out in the Convention. Some, of course, have gone further and have established sophisticated refugee determination systems or constructed an architecture of asylum, ostensibly to provide asylum seekers and refugees with minimum standards of treatment. 1 Lebanon is different and the position of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is arguably unique. Alongside many of its Middle Eastern neighbours, it is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention or to the Protocol. It does not have a national asylum process and it has a very regional view towards the idea of the ‘refugee’ or those seeking protection within its borders. It is also an example of a developing, low income economy that has been obliged to handle enormous numbers of displaced people over a considerable period of time with limited and shrinking resources, a public debt (as a ratio of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) continuing to rise, 2 and enduring political instability. 3 The consequences have been extreme.

40|$|The thesis, {{based on}} {{research}} into written works, aims to de-essentialise the terms 'feminism' and 'fundamentalism'. Drawing on the growing anthropological evidence of a 'feminist' type activism within an Islamic framework, I analyse this global phenomena of Gender Activism. I explore the important intersections between gender activism and the Islamic revival. In order to give focus to the study and to highlight the specifics at the national level, I include case studies of gender activism {{in the context of}} increasing Islamism in present day Egypt and Iran. The Islamic revival has meant that the issue of gender has re-emerged as an area of conflict between, on the one hand. Western countries endorsing international human rights norms and, on the other hand, Muslim countries drawing on pre-modem Shari 'a Laws. The globalisation of Islam {{in the last two decades}} has resulted in the world-wide promotion of a particular model of the 'Ideal Islamic Woman'. This model, winch reflects the dominant discourse within Islamism, emphasises the inferiority and natural domesticity of women. I look at how gender activists fight this restrictive monolithic image of women put forward by Islamists as being part of 'true Islam'. Muslim women are reclaiming their history and religion for themselves. They have reinterpreted the Qur'an and Sunna in radically new ways and have drawn upon the egalitarian propositions evident within them. Their work shows how during the spread of Islam in its first centuries <b>restrictive</b> <b>interpretations</b> were built into the Shar 'iah by male jurists. This has resulted in an association of orthodox Islam with 'patriarchy'. Today, Islamists in Egypt and Iran attempt to restore legal discriminations against women based on pre-modem Shari 'a Law. Gender activists are fighting such legislation unfavourable to women in the areas of marriage and divorce using religiously-based arguments. Islamist women themselves are actively involved in this battle against the dominant model of the 'Ideal Islamic Woman'. The feminism of Islamist women provides a valuable warning against the persistence of Orientalist attitudes. It leads us to question the definition and very nature of religion and 'feminism'...|$|R
