25|$|Herbst notes {{a modern}} paradox {{regarding}} the colonial borders in Africa: {{while they are}} arbitrary there is a consensus among African leaders {{that they must be}} maintained. Organization of African Unity in 1963 cemented colonial boundaries permanently by proclaiming that any changes made were illegitimate. This, in effect, avoided <b>readdressing</b> the basic injustice of colonial partition, while also reducing the likelihood of inter-state warfare as territorial boundaries were considered immutable by the international community.|$|E
2500|$|A {{medley of}} [...] "Kansas City" [...] and [...] "Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey" [...] was sequenced {{as the final}} song on side one of the LP. In McCartney's description, his {{performance}} on the track required [...] "a great deal of nerve to just jump up and scream like an idiot"; his efforts were egged on by Lennon, who [...] "would go, 'Come on! You can sing it better than that, man! Come on, come on! Really throw it!'" [...] The medley was inspired by Little Richard, who similarly combined Leiber and Stoller's [...] "Kansas City" [...] with his own composition, [...] "Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!" [...] Riley considers that, although McCartney's presence on Beatles for Sale appears relatively slight next to Lennon's, his performance of [...] "Kansas City" [...] goes some way to <b>readdressing</b> the balance. Hertsgaard says that the irony evident in Harrison's delivery of [...] "Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby" [...] "allows the Beatles to close the album with a not-so-veiled comment on the oddities of living inside Beatlemania".|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the letters}} {{was one in}} that dreaded hand writing marked [...] "Immediate," [...] and {{forwarded}} from his chambers. She took it up, {{and put it to}} her nose. A scent--of what? Too faint to say. Her thumb nails sought the edge of the flap on either side. She laid the letter down. Any other letter, but not that--she wanted to open it too much. <b>Readdressing</b> it, she took it out to put with the other letters. And instantly the thought went through her: 'What a pity! If I read it, and there was nothing!' All her restless, jealous misgivings of months past would then be set at rest! She stood, uncertain, with the letter in her hand. Ah--but if there WERE something! She would lose at one stroke her faith in him, and her faith in herself--not only his love but her own self-respect. She dropped the letter on the table. Could she not take it up to him herself? By the three o'clock slow train, she could get to him soon after five. She looked at her watch. She would just have time to walk down. And she ran upstairs. Little Gyp was sitting on the top stair--her favourite seat--looking at a picture-book.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the von Neumann network there are no limitations for topology of neurons for semantic networks. It leads to the impossibility of relative addressing of neurons as it was done by von Neumann. In this case an absolute <b>readdressing</b> should be used. Every neuron should have a unique identifier that would provide a direct access to another neuron. Of course, neurons interacting by axons-dendrites should have each other's identifiers. An absolute <b>readdressing</b> can be modulated by using neuron specificity as it was realized for biological neural networks.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Hillsboro {{opened the}} Reedville Creek Park, which {{included}} the city’s first skate park.

5000|$|House-sitting is the {{practice}} whereby a landlord (or [...] "homeowner"), leaving their {{house for a}} period of time, entrusts it to one or more [...] "house-sitters", who by a mutual agreement are entitled to live there rent-free in exchange for assuming responsibilities such as taking care of the homeowner's pets, performing general maintenance (including pools, lawns, air-conditioning systems etc.), keeping trespassers off the property, <b>readdressing</b> the mail, and in general, making sure that everything runs smoothly just as if the owner was at home.|$|E

50|$|For {{many years}} {{addresses}} in Shamokin Dam were listed {{under the same}} ZIP code as Selinsgrove, which was 17870. This led to confusion by delivery companies, emergency services and visitors to the region. Additionally, tax funding that {{should have gone to}} Shamokin Dam was lost. The implementation of the GIS <b>readdressing</b> program required that several local communities rename streets so that there were no redundancies within the Selinsgrove ZIP code. This prompted Shamokin Dam officials to appeal to the United States Postal Service for a unique ZIP code. It was awarded. Shamokin Dam addresses became 17876.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his death, Bess was nearly forgotten to history, but a 1981 solo show curated by Barbara Haskell at the Whitney Museum of Art helped revive his reputation as an artist. In the catalog, Haskell wrote, [...] "Indeed, this painter's direct, almost primitive images, loaded with symbolic meaning and emotional content, are finding echoes in the so-called New Image painters. It {{may be that the}} show at the Whitney {{is the first step toward}} <b>readdressing</b> the import of his work." [...] Bess' legacy was further enhanced in 1988, when Hirschl & Adler Modern exhibited 61 of his works.|$|E

5000|$|Network address {{translation}} (NAT) {{is a method}} of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in Internet Protocol (IP) datagram packet headers while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. [...] The technique was originally used for ease of rerouting traffic in IP networks without <b>readdressing</b> every host. In more advanced NAT implementations featuring IP masquerading, {{it has become a}} popular and essential tool in conserving global address space allocations in face of IPv4 address exhaustion by sharing one Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway for an entire private network.|$|E
50|$|Hub of the Swinging Sixties and the {{pop culture}} revolution, fashion forward stores from provocative {{designers}} such as Mary Quant, alongside the Chelsea Drugstore {{and numerous other}} fashion boutiques, cafes and restaurants provided a unique, colourful environment, popular {{with some of the}} 20th century’s most iconic figures. From its bohemian atmosphere germinated the next great cultural movement - punk - Vivienne Westwood and Malcom McLaren’s fashion designs and music were born on the King’s Road and the area thronged with safety-pinned youth. <b>Readdressing</b> the balance towards respectability, the area later began being reclaimed by quiet well-dressed offspring of the wealthy, the archetypal ‘Sloane Ranger’.|$|E
5000|$|Frontman Dustin Bates {{outlines}} {{the process for}} creating the album: I start with sonic goals. This time I had {{a greater understanding of}} what instrumentation and even arrangements and genres, to an extent, would be amalgamated into these songs… and then chord structures. Once there’s a great chord structure then I always scat melodies. Then once I have the melody I spend an exorbitant amount of time coming up with lyrics that fit the theme that I want, over that melody. I think it is the way I’ve always written, then after that a <b>readdressing</b> of the musical soundscape and flushing out of the atmosphere of it as well.|$|E

50|$|H.R. 2499 {{proposes to}} take the {{question}} directly to voters {{in at least one}} plebiscite. For those who believe that direct democracy is the best method for <b>readdressing</b> the status issue, the plebiscite approach could be preferred. Plebiscites, however, necessarily include pre-determined questions and answers (i.e., the options listed on the ballot). Other proposals (e.g., H.R. 110-1230) suggest a more grassroots-oriented approach involving constitutional conventions without preconditions on the issues to be considered or options to be proposed. The plebiscite approach is perhaps a more efficient way to ascertain the electorate’s views on specific questions, but plebiscites do not allow for modification of the questions presented. By contrast, although conventions have the potential advantage of allowing for wide-ranging debate, they rely on delegates to represent popular will and might or {{might not be able to}} reach a politically viable status choice.|$|E
