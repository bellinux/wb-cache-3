5|$|In {{the third}} match, Carlito faced Mankind, who {{was chosen by}} the fans' vote with 52%. The match began when Carlito {{performed}} a dropkick on Mankind. However, Mankind got the advantage over Carlito. Midway through the match, Mankind tried to use a steel chair on Carlito, but Carlito avoided, executeing drop toe-hold, sending Mankind into the steel steps. Mankind <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick, resulting in Mankind to hit {{the back of his}} head into the steel steps. Back in the ring, Mankind received the upper hand after delivering a DDT and forced Carlito to submit with the Mandible claw and win the match.|$|E

25|$|On 14 January 1908 at {{the annual}} College Colston society dinner George Alfred Wills <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and {{dramatically}} announced the news that his father, Henry Overton, was to donate £100,000 to the cause promoting {{the creation of the}} University providing that a Royal Charter was obtained within two years. Records note that the room began to cheer after the announcement was made. This announcement caused further funds to be promised by those attending the University. The day ended with the University endowment fund standing at five times greater than it had at the start with the University scheme attracting more in 24-hours than it did in its entire history. The raising of such large firms meant that the Privy Council could not argue that the creation of what were then disparagingly known as 'Lilliputian' Universities would in any way result in a decrease in the standard of British universities. H.O. Wills had little contact with the College apart from {{the fact that he had}} sent his son Harry to classes there. He died in 1911 after becoming the first Chancellor of the University of Bristol. The Wills Memorial Building was built by his two surviving sons in memory at a cost of £500,000. The impact of the Wills family upon the University can also be founding in the naming of the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory built by George in memory of his brother which cost some £200,000 and the building of Wills Hall, a hall of residence for the University in Stoke Bishop. Unlike many of the supporters of the University the Wills were not Liberals or Quakers but Congregationalists.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America, in {{the name}} of Congress, takes pride in {{presenting}} the Medal of Honor (Posthumously) to Private First Class Leonard C. Brostrom, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in action as a rifleman with an assault platoon of Company F, 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, which ran into powerful resistance near Dagami, Leyte, Philippine Islands, on 28 October 1944. From pillboxes, trenches, and spider holes, so well camouflaged that they could be detected at no more than 20 yards, the enemy poured machinegun and rifle fire, causing severe casualties in the platoon. Realizing that a key pillbox {{in the center of the}} strong point would have to be knocked out if the company were to advance, Private First Class Brostrom, without orders and completely ignoring his own safety, ran forward to attack the pillbox with grenades. He immediately became the prime target for all the riflemen in the area, as he rushed to the rear of the pillbox and tossed grenades through the entrance. Six enemy soldiers left a trench in a bayonet charge against the heroic American, but he killed one and drove the others off with rifle fire. As he threw more grenades from his completely exposed position he was wounded several times in the abdomen and knocked to the ground. Although suffering intense pain and rapidly weakening from loss of blood, he slowly <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and once more hurled his deadly missiles at the pillbox. As he collapsed, the enemy began fleeing from the fortification and were killed by riflemen of his platoon. Private First Class Brostrom died while being carried from the battlefield, but his intrepidity and unhesitating willingness to sacrifice himself in a one-man attack against overwhelming odds enabled his company to reorganize against attack, and annihilate the entire enemy position.|$|E

500|$|The split-second {{incident}} {{only allowed}} Banks {{time for one}} conscious thought – that the shot was impossible to catch, {{and the only way}} to prevent Pelé from following up on the rebound would be to parry the ball over the bar. The ball bounced two yards in front of the goal-line, and Banks managed to make contact with the ball with the fingers of his right hand, and rolled his hand slightly to angle to ball over the crossbar. He landed in the inner netting of the goal, and knew he had saved the ball after witnessing Pelé's reaction. Banks then <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> to defend the corner, and broke into laughter after the following exchange: ...|$|E
500|$|Disraeli {{delivered}} the budget on 3 December 1852, {{and prepared to}} wind up the debate for the government on 16 December—it was customary for the Chancellor to have the last word. A massive defeat for the government was predicted. Disraeli attacked his opponents individually, {{and then as a}} force, [...] "I face a Coalition... This, too, I know, that England does not love coalitions." [...] His speech of three hours was quickly seen as a parliamentary masterpiece. As MPs prepared to divide, Gladstone <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and began an angry speech, despite the efforts of Tory MPs to shout him down. The interruptions were fewer, as Gladstone gained control of the House, and in the next two hours painted a picture of Disraeli as frivolous and his budget as subversive. The government was defeated by 19 votes, and Derby resigned four days later. He was replaced by the Peelite Earl of Aberdeen, with Gladstone as his Chancellor. Because of Disraeli's unpopularity among the Peelites, no party reconciliation was possible while he remained Tory leader in the House of Commons.|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} decade, the most {{fruitful}} of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, The Two Widows and The Secret were warmly received, while The Kiss {{was greeted by}} an [...] "overwhelming ovation". The ceremonial opera Libuše was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling [...] "dishonoured and dispirited." [...] This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim that followed the first performance of the complete Má vlast cycle in November: [...] "Everyone <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and the same storm of unending applause was repeated after {{each of the six}} parts... At the end of Blaník [...] the audience was beside itself and the people could not bring themselves to take leave of the composer." ...|$|E

500|$|Leno {{began to}} drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, {{like his father}} and {{stepfather}} before him, he had become an alcoholic. He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that began to affect his work. By 1902, Leno's angry and violent behaviour directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic. His erratic behaviour was often {{a result of his}} diminishing ability to remember his lines and inaudibility in performance. Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of Bluebeard, Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left stuck up a tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of Mother Goose in 1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre's management, with an expensive silver dinner service. Leno <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and said: [...] "Governor, it's a magnificent present! I congratulate you and you deserve it!" ...|$|E
500|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{was part}} of an {{offensive}} plan to break through German resistance in northeastern France, as far as Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. In the area of Genevreuille on 15 September 1944, Murphy narrowly escaped death from a mortar shell hit that killed two others and wounded three. Although his resulting heel wound was not serious, he received his first Purple Heart. By this point, all but Murphy and two others of Company B's original group had either been killed or taken off the lines with wounds. General O'Daniel moved the 15th Infantry, 3rd Division to the Moselle and the Cleurie river valley in late September. Stone quarries dotted the hills and provided good defensive positions for the Germans. The 15th was met with fierce resistance north of St. Ame at the heavily fortified multi-tunneled L'Omet quarry. On 2 October at L'Omet, Murphy advanced alone to the location of a machine gun manned by a unit of German soldiers. Within [...] of the machine gun nest, he <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "The Germans spot me instantly", he recalled. [...] "The gunner spins the tip of his weapon toward me. But the barrel catches in a limb, and the burst whizzes to my right". Murphy lobbed two hand grenades at the men, killing four and wounding three. He was awarded the Silver Star for this action. The 15th achieved success in its continued attack when Germans began evacuating the quarry on 5 October. On that date, Murphy, while carrying a SCR-536 radio, advanced alone for [...] towards the Germans while they continually fired directly at him. Around [...] from the Germans' location, he relayed firing orders by radio to the artillery, and remained at his position alone for an hour directing his men. When Murphy's men finally took the hill, 15 German combatants were killed and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him an Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{crowning}} of his consort, the newly crowned Tsar retrieved his orb and sceptre, while the cathedral choir intoned the Orthodox prayer for [...] "many years" [...] {{of health and}} a long, prosperous reign for both Tsar and Tsaritsa. [...] This was accompanied by the ringing of bells and a 101-gun salute outside the cathedral. [...] Kneeling, the Tsar again handed his orb and sceptre to his attendant, then recited a prayer. [...] Following this, he <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> while the presiding bishop and all others present knelt to pray for him {{on behalf of all}} the Russian people while the choir sang: [...] "We praise Thee, O God".|$|E

2500|$|Green {{started the}} fight {{strongly}} with commentators estimating that {{he won the}} first six rounds – whilst stating that Włodarczyk [...] "didn't appear all that shaken up by the onslaught." [...] Włodarczyk improved in round seven, however the commentators believed Green to be ahead on points {{by the end of}} round nine. In round ten one commentator observed that [...] "Green's had his nose busted a bit", and with a minute remaining in the eleventh round, Green was knocked down by [...] "a massive left" [...] from Włodarczyk. Green <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> however the referee called off the fight to award Włodarczyk a TKO victory.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1984, Durán was {{stripped}} of his Light Middleweight title when the WBA did not approve of his fight with WBC Champion Thomas [...] "Hitman" [...] Hearns and took away recognition of Durán as world champion the moment Durán stepped into the ring to box Hearns. Durán again made history in the fight, {{but this time it}} was the wrong kind. Hearns dropped Durán twice in the first round and as he <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> after the second knockdown, which ended the round, the former champion did not know where his corner was. Hearns went on to knock Duran down a third time in the second round and the fight was stopped, marking {{the first time in his}} career that Durán had been knocked out in a fight (the [...] "No Más" [...] fight was officially recorded as a technical knockout, because Duran quit).|$|E
2500|$|Brostrom {{with the}} lead assault platoon of F Company {{encountered}} [...] "withering fire from pillboxes, trenches, and enemy spider holes". The Japanese soldiers were well entrenched and camouflaged. Enemy fields of fire were well calculated with criss-crossing machine gun bunkers supported by infantry in trenches. Pfc. Brostrom {{was hit by}} enemy weapon fire three times as he fought {{his way through a}} bamboo thicket {{that was part of the}} enemy line. Brostrom dashed to the rear of a large enemy machine gun bunker/pillbox. [...] During his charge from the bamboo thicket, he was visible not only to the rest of his rifle company, but to the Japanese riflemen shooting at him as well. As he threw several grenades into the bunker, six Japanese infantrymen charged with fixed bayonets. Brostrom was able to kill one soldier and wound others, causing them to retreat. [...] Brostrom was hit a fourth time and fell to the ground. Again, in view of the Americans and Japanese soldiers, he <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and assaulted the bunker with grenades and rifle fire. The Japanese soldiers ran out of the bunker as Brostrom fell seriously wounded.|$|E

2500|$|The {{service was}} {{conducted}} by the elderly and infirm Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who would be dead {{before the end of}} the year. He steadfastly refused to delegate any part of his duties and had to be supported throughout by two other bishops. Because of his failing eyesight, the text of the service had to be printed in gigantic type onto rolls of paper called [...] "prompt scrolls"; they are preserved in the Lambeth Palace Library. Archbishop Temple provided most of the upsets in an otherwise splendid ceremony; he was unable to rise after kneeling to pay homage and had to be helped up by the King and several bishops, he placed the crown back-to-front on the King's head, and when a colleague enquired after his well being, he was told to [...] "go away!" [...] in a loud voice that was plainly heard by the congregation. The King also deviated from the order of service; when the Prince of Wales touched the Crown and kissed his father's left cheek in the traditional gesture of homage, the King <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and threw his arms around his son's neck in an unusual display of affection. Because he was still convalescing, Edward had been crowned with the Imperial State Crown instead of the intended St Edward's Crown which is heavier. Alexandra was crowned immediately after her husband by William Dalrymple Maclagan, Archbishop of York. She was crowned with a new crown containing the Koh-i-Noor diamond.|$|E
