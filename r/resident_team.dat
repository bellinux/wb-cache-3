40|$|Hypothesis: When {{work hours}} are limited, {{improving}} residents' work efficiency allows {{more time for}} key training activities, reduces frustration, and improves work satisfaction. Design Prospective control study. Setting General surgical service with a trauma program. Participants Five full-time attending physicians, a <b>resident</b> <b>team</b> of 9 members, and 3 surgical assistants. Intervention Reorganization of work habits based on a goal-oriented work style. Main Outcome Measures Changes {{of time spent in}} key activities; punctuality for operations, clinics, and conferences; residents' work satisfaction, physical fatigue, and mental stress; and attending physician and patient evaluations of residents. Results: A goal-oriented work style reduced round time and nonpurposeful time and improved punctuality for key education activities. More operative time could be accommodated within the work-hours limits. Residents' work satisfaction improved while mental stress was reduced. Patient satisfaction scores also increased. Conclusions: Residents' work is generally inefficient. Reduced work hours should be accompanied by work-habit reform to make the best use of residents' training time...|$|E

H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA Background: Although the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) {{model is}} {{considered}} {{important for the}} future of primary care in the USA, it remains unclear how best to prepare trainees for PCMH practice and leadership. Following a baseline study, the authors added a new required PCMH block rotation and <b>resident</b> <b>team</b> to an existing longitudinal PCMH immersion and didactic curriculum within a Level 3 -certified PCMH, aiming for “enhanced situated learning”. All 39 residents enrolled in a USA family medicine residency program {{during the first year of}} curricular implementation completed this new 4 -week rotation. This study examines the effects of this rotation after 1  year. Methods: A total of 39 intervention and 13 comparison residents were eligible participants. This multimethod study included: 1) individual interviews of postgraduate year (PGY) 3 intervention vs PGY 3 comparison residents, assessing residents’ PCMH attitudes, knowledge, and clinical experience, and 2) routine rotation evaluations. Interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed using immersion/crystallization. Rotation evaluations were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis of free text responses. Results: Authors analyzed 23 interviews (88 %) and 26 rotation evaluations (67 %). Intervention PGY 3 s’ interviews revealed more nuanced understanding of PCMH concepts and more experience with system-level PCMH tasks than those of comparison PGY 3 s. More intervention PGY 3 s rated themselves “extremely prepared” to implement PCMH than comparison PGY 3 s; however, most self-rated “somewhat prepared”. Their reflections demonstrated deeper understanding of PCMH implementation and challenges than comparison PGY 3 s but inadequate experience to directly see the results of successful solutions. Rotation evaluations from PGY 1, PGY 2, and PGY 3 s revealed strengths and several areas for improvement. Conclusion: Adding one 4 -week block rotation to existing longitudinal training appears to improve residents’ PCMH knowledge, skills, and experience from “basic” to “intermediate”. However, this training level appears inadequate for PCMH leadership or for teaching junior learners. Further study is needed to determine the optimum training for different settings.
