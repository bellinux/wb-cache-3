40|$|The {{intraperitoneal}} injection of insulin-producing islets immunoprotected by an alginate-poly(amino acid) membrane {{is a potential}} method of <b>reversing</b> <b>diabetes</b> {{without the need for}} lifelong immunosuppression. Previous attempts to demonstrate this technology in large animals have failed, preventing application in humans. We have determined that key factors responsible for these past failures include cytokine (interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor) stimulation by mannuronic acid monomers from alginate capsules with weak mechanical integrity, which results in fibroblast proliferation. With this insight, we formulated mechanically stable microcapsules by using alginate high in guluronic acid content and report prolonged reversal of diabetes in the spontaneous diabetic dog model by the {{intraperitoneal injection}} of encapsulated canine islet allografts. Euglycemia, independent of any exogenous insulin requirement, was noted for up to 172 days. Graft survival, evidenced by positive C-peptide release, was noted for as long as 726 days in a recipient receiving a single injection of immunoprotected islets. Histological evidence of viable islets retrieved from the peritoneal cavity 6 months posttransplant confirmed the biocompatibility and immunoprotective nature of this capsule formulation. The finding that intraperitoneal injection of alginate-immunoprotected islets, a minimally invasive surgical procedure, is effective in prolonged (> 1 year) maintenance of glycemic control, without the need for lifelong immunosuppression, may have significant implications for the future therapy of type I diabetes in humans...|$|E

In the current study, we used a retroviral vector to deliver either the human insulin gene alone, the rat NeuroD 1 gene alone, or the human insulin gene and rat NeuroD 1 genes together, to the rat liver cell line, H 4 IIE, to determine if storage of insulin and pancreatic transdifferentiation occurred. Stable clones were selected and expanded into cell lines: H 4 IIEins (insulin gene alone), H 4 IIE/ND (NeuroD 1 gene alone), and H 4 IIEins/ND (insulin and NeuroD 1 genes). The H 4 IIEins cells did not store insulin; however, H 4 IIE/ND and H 4 IIEins/ND cells stored 65. 5 ± 5. 6 and 1475. 4 ± 171. 8 pmol/insulin/ 5 × 106 cells, respectively. Additionally, several β cell transcription factors and pancreatic hormones were expressed in both H 4 IIE/ND and H 4 IIEins/ND cells. Electron microscopy revealed insulin storage vesicles in the H 4 IIE/ND and H 4 IIEins/ND cell lines.

We hypothesize that co-transplantation of islets with human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stromal cells that conditionally overexpress VEGF (hESC-MSC:VEGF) may augment islet revascularization and reduce the minimal islet mass required to <b>reverse</b> <b>diabetes</b> in mice. HESC-MSCs were transduced by recombinant lentiviruses that allowed conditional (Dox-regulated) overexpression of VEGF. HESC-MSC:VEGF were characterized by tube formation assay. After co-transplantation of hESC-MSC:VEGF with murine islets in collagen-fibrin hydrogel in the omental pouch of diabetic nude mice, we measured blood glucose, body weight, glucose tolerance and serum C-peptide. As control, islets were transplanted alone or with non-transduced hESC-MSCs. Next, we compared functional parameters of 400 islets alone versus 200 islets co-transplanted with hESC-MSC:VEGF. As control, 200 islets were transplanted alone. Metabolic function of islets transplanted with hESC-MSC:VEGF significantly improved, accompanied by superior graft revascularization, compared with control groups. Transplantation of 200 islets with hESC-MSC:VEGF showed superior function over 400 islets alone. We conclude that co-transplantation of islets with VEGF-expressing hESC-MSCs allowed {{for at least a}} 50 % reduction in minimal islet mass required to <b>reverse</b> <b>diabetes</b> in mice.

40|$|A recent type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) {{clinical trial}} of rituximab (a B cell-depleting anti-CD 20 antibody) achieved some therapeutic benefit in preserving C-peptide {{for a period of}} approximately nine months in patients with recently diagnosed diabetes. Our previous data in the NOD mouse demonstrated that co-administration of antigen (insulin) with anti-CD 3 antibody (a T cell-directed immunomodulator) offers better protection than either entity alone, indicating that novel combination therapies that include a T 1 D-related autoantigen are possible. To accelerate the identification and development of novel combination therapies that can be advanced into the clinic, we have evaluated the combination of a mouse anti-CD 20 antibody with either oral insulin or a proinsulin-expressing DNA vaccine. Anti-CD 20 alone, given once or on 4 consecutive days, produced transient B cell depletion but did not prevent or reverse T 1 D in the NOD mouse. Oral insulin alone (twice weekly for 6 weeks) was also ineffective, while proinsulin DNA (weekly for up to 12 weeks) showed a trend toward modest efficacy. Combination of anti-CD 20 with oral insulin was ineffective in <b>reversing</b> <b>diabetes</b> in NOD mice whose glycemia was controlled with SC insulin pellets; these experiments were performed in three independent labs. Combination of anti-CD 20 with proinsulin DNA was also ineffective in diabetes reversal, but did show modest efficacy in diabetes prevention (p = 0. 04). In the prevention studies, anti-CD 20 plus proinsulin resulted in modest increases in Tregs in pancreatic lymph nodes and elevated levels of proinsulin-specific CD 4 + T-cells that produced IL- 4. Thus, combination therapy with anti-CD 20 and either oral insulin or proinsulin does not protect hyperglycemic NOD mice, but the combination with proinsulin offers limited efficacy in T 1 D prevention, potentially by augmentation of proinsulin-specific IL- 4 production...|$|E
40|$|The {{prospect}} of <b>reversing</b> <b>diabetes</b> by the transplantation of isolated pancreatic islets thereby avoiding the major surgery and associated morbidity of whole pancreas transplants, {{led to the}} first reports of transplantation of dispersed human islets both purified and unpurified in the late 1970 's. Reports of complications and even deaths following intraportal infusion of unpurified islets, led to intensified research into methods for purifying islets from the collagenase dispersed human pancreas. Separation {{on the basis of}} physical differences in the density of islets and exocrine tissue has proven to be the most effective method, and studies in Leicester pioneered the use of density gradients on the COBE 2991 cell processor for large scale islet purification. The first half of the work described in this thesis examines methods for maximising the differences in islet and exocrine densities using cold storage solutions, both at the time of organ retrieval and during pancreas processing. The improvement in human islet purification using University of Wisconsin solution and the components responsible for this are outlined. Simultaneously the mechanical process of density gradient purification was optimised by the introduction of continuous rather than discontinuous density gradients on the COBE. Despite this work, purified islet yields from a single donor pancreas remain insufficient for successful transplantation and the need to use more than one donor/transplant reduces both the number of transplants and the HLA matching possible. The second part of this work therefore examined the use of alternative immunomagnetic techniques to purify islets in a rat model. By coupling 4. 5 mum diameter magnetic beads to the exocrine fragments via very specific monoclonal antibody linkages, reliable and effective removal of 90 % of the exocrine fragments was possible with islet yields of 60 %. Immunomagnetic methods would therefore provide an alternative or adjunct to existing density dependent methods...|$|E
40|$|Proinsulin, the insulin {{precursor}} protein, is synthesized in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) of pancreatic beta cells, {{where it}} folds {{to the native}} state, involving the formation of three evolutionarily conserved disulfide bonds. Once folded, proinsulin exits the ER, traverses the secretory pathway to the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) and into budding secretory granules. Proinsulin is then processed by endopeptidases that excise the connecting C-peptide that links the B- and A-chains, leading {{to the creation of}} mature, two-chain insulin. Upon secretion to the bloodstream, insulin binds to cell surface insulin receptors on target tissues, resulting in the activation of signaling cascades that promote metabolic homeostasis. This thesis aims to look at two distinct aspects of the proinsulin maturation process. In the first part of my thesis work, I have designed a proinsulin with a shortened linker peptide with the intent to create a bioengineered protein that acts as a single-chain insulin (SCI), i. e., without a requirement for cleavage by endopeptidases. SCIs expressed via gene therapy {{have been found to be}} effective in <b>reversing</b> <b>diabetes</b> in rodent models, obviating the need for exogenous insulin injection. However, to date, very little structure-function analysis of SCIs has been performed. In Chapter 2, I have examined the structural features of the linker peptide that would allow for mammalian expression, secretion, and bioactivity of SCIs for development into future diabetes therapeutics. In the second part of my thesis work, I have been attempting to identify the ER oxidoreductase(s) that promote(s) formation of the three disulfide bonds of proinsulin, which heretofore are unknown. In Chapter 3, I present results that point to two key members of the family of PDI-like ER oxidoreductases: Protein Disulfide Isomerase itself, and Endoplasmic Reticulum protein 72 (ERp 72), which may both play critical, yet opposing, roles in this process. As the misfolding of proinsulin is implicated in the progression of various forms of diabetes, understanding the key factors that control the balance of proinsulin folding and misfolding (by regulating proinsulin disulfide bond formation) could also provide potential benefit for designing therapies that increase insulin production...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{development}} of small-molecule tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors offers increasing {{opportunities for the}} treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated the potential of this new class of drugs to treat and cure type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) in the NOD mouse. Treatment of prediabetic and new onset diabetic mice with imatinib (Gleevec) prevented and reversed T 1 D. Similar results were observed with sunitinib (Sutent), an additional approved multikinase inhibitor, suggesting that the primary target of imatinib, c-Abl, was not essential in blocking disease in this model. Additional studies with another TK inhibitor, PLX 647 (targeting c-Kit and c-Fms) or an anti-c-Kit mAb showed only marginal efficacy whereas a soluble form of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), PDGFRβIg, rapidly <b>reversed</b> <b>diabetes.</b> These findings strongly suggest that inhibition of PDGFR is critical to <b>reverse</b> <b>diabetes</b> and highlight a crucial role of inflammation in the development of T 1 D. These conclusions were supported by the finding that the adaptive immune system was not significantly affected by imatinib treatment. Finally, and most significantly, imatinib treatment led to durable remission after discontinuation of therapy at 10 weeks in a majority of mice. Thus, long-term efficacy and tolerance is likely to depend on inhibiting a combination of tyrosine kinases supporting the use of selective kinase inhibitors as a new, potentially very attractive approach {{for the treatment of}} T 1 D...|$|R

Extracellular glutamate enters β-cells through the glutamate transporter- 1 (GLT- 1), and is then converted to GABA (Adeghate and Ponery, 2002). GABA can be secreted by β-cells and acts as an autocrine through a positive feedback loop in pancreatic β-cells (Braun et al., 2010). It is reported that inflammation can increase β-cell proliferation (Sherry et al., 2006), and GABA could inhibit inflammation which probably partially counteracted its ability to induce proliferation (Song and Park, 2014). However, Tian et al. (2013) observed that GABA increased β-cell mass through enhanced survival and proliferation of β-cells.

Here, combining conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches, we show that the selective inhibition of the Arx gene in α-cells is sufficient to promote the conversion of adult α-cells into β-like cells at any age. Interestingly, this conversion induces the continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine cell fate, the glucagon(+) cells thereby generated being subsequently converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition. Of interest, through the generation and analysis of Arx and Pax 4 conditional double-mutants, we provide evidence that Pax 4 is dispensable for these regeneration processes, indicating that Arx represents the main trigger of α-cell-mediated β-like cell neogenesis. Importantly, the loss of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass and thereby <b>reverse</b> <b>diabetes</b> following toxin-induced β-cell depletion.

40|$|Indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO), {{an enzyme}} that plays a {{critical}} role in fetomaternal tolerance, exerts immunoregulatory functions suppressing T-cell responses. The aims of this study were to promote IDO expression in rat islets using a nonviral gene transfer approach, and to analyze the effect of the in vivo induction of IDO in a model of allogeneic islet transplantation. The IDO cDNA was isolated from rat placenta, subcloned into a plasmid and transfected into rat islets using Lipofectamine. The efficiency of transfection was confirmed by qRT-PCR and functional analysis. The in vivo effect of IDO expression was analyzed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Lewis rats transplanted with allogeneic islets under the renal capsule. Transplantation of IDO-allogeneic islets <b>reversed</b> <b>diabetes</b> and maintained metabolic control, in contrast to transplantation of allogeneic nontransfected islets, which failed shortly after transplantation in all animals. Graft survival of allograft islets transfected with IDO transplanted without any immunosuppression was superior to that observed in diabetic rats receiving nontransfected islets. These data demonstrated that IDO expression induced in islets by lipofection improved metabolic control of streptozotocin-diabetic rats and prolonged allograft survival.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that an insulin 2 gene knockout, when bred onto nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, accelerates diabetes. We produced insulin 1 gene knockout congenic NOD mice. In contrast to insulin 2, diabetes and insulitis were markedly reduced in insulin 1 knockout mice, with decreased and delayed diabetes in heterozygous females and no insulitis and diabetes in most homozygous female mice. Lack of insulitis was found for insulin 1 female homozygous knockout mice at 8, 12, and 37 weeks of age. Despite a lack of insulitis, insulin 1 homozygous knockout mice spontaneously expressed insulin autoantibodies. Administration of insulin peptide B: 9 - 23 of both insulin 1 and 2 to NOD mice induced insulin autoantibodies. Insulin 1 is not the only lymphocytic target of NOD mice. Insulin 1 homozygous knockout islets, when transplanted into recently diabetic wild-type NOD mice, became infiltrated with lymphocytes and only transiently <b>reversed</b> <b>diabetes.</b> These observations indicate that loss of either insulin gene can influence progression to diabetes of NOD mice and suggest that the preproinsulin 1 gene is crucial for the spontaneous development of NOD insulitis and diabetes...|$|R
40|$|The {{progress}} of islet transplantation {{as a new}} therapy for patients with diabetes mellitus depends directly upon the development of efficient and practical immunoisolation methods for the supply of sufficient quantities of islet cells. Without these methods, large scale clinical application of this therapy would be impossible. Two eras of advances can be identified {{in the development of}} islet transplantation. The first was an era of experimental animal and human research that centered on islet isolation procedures and transplantation in different species as evidence that transplanted islets have the capability to <b>reverse</b> <b>diabetes.</b> The second was the era of the Edmonton protocol, when the focus became the standardization of isolation procedures and introduction of new immunosuppressive drugs to maintain human allograft transplantation. The quest for an alternative source for islets (xenographs, stem cells and cell cultures) to overcome the shortage of human islets was an important issue during these eras. This paper reviews the history of islet transplantation and the current procedures in human allotransplantation, as well as different types of immunoisolation methods. It explores novel approaches to enhancing transplantation site vascularity and islet cell function, whereby future immunoisolation technology could offer additional therapeutic advantages to human islet allotransplantation...|$|R
