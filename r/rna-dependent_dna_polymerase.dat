5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E

These synthetic <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> are identified by their ability to copy efficiently the ribo strand of synthetic oligonucleotide-homopolymer complexes, and differ in this respect from the known DNA-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> found in HeLa cells.

They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which {{is required for the}} replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: The central {{player in}} the {{replication}} of RNA viruses is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The 53 kDa poliovirus polymerase, together with other viral and possibly host proteins, carries out viral RNA replication in the host cell cytoplasm. RNA-dependent RNA polymerases comprise a distinct category of polymerases that have limited sequence similarity to reverse transcriptases (<b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases)</b> and perhaps also to DNA-dependent polymerases. Previously reported structures of <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> DNA-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase show that structural and evolutionary relationships exist between the different polymerase categories. Results: We have determined {{the structure of the}} RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus at 2. 6 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. It has the same overall shape as other polymerases, commonly described by analogy to a right hand. The structures of the ‘fingers’ and ‘thumb’ subdomains of poliovirus polymerase differ from those of other polymerases, but the palm subdomain contains a core structure very similar to that of other polymerases. This conserved core structure is composed of four of the amino acid sequence motifs described for RNA-dependent polymerases. Structure-based alignments of these motifs has enabled us to modify and extend previous sequence and structural alignments so as to relate sequence conservation to function. Extensive regions of polymerase–polymerase interactions observed in the crystals suggest an unusual higher order structure that we believe is important for polymerase function. Conclusions: As a first example of a structure of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the poliovirus polymerase structure provides for a better understanding of polymerase structure, function and evolution. In addition, it has yielded insights into an unusual higher order structure that may be critical for poliovirus polymerase function...|$|R
40|$|Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> {{that usually}} {{function}} in the replication of selfish DNAs such as retrotransposons and retroviruses. Here, we have biochemically characterized a RT-related protein, AbiK, which is required for abortive phage infection in the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis. In vitro, AbiK does not exhibit the properties expected for an RT, but polymerizes long DNAs of ‘random’ sequence, analogous to a terminal transferase. Moreover, the polymerized DNAs appear to be covalently attached to the AbiK protein, presumably because an amino acid serves as a primer. Mutagenesis experiments indicate that the polymerase activity resides in the RT motifs and is essential for phage resistance in vivo. These results establish a novel biochemical property and a non-replicative biological role for a polymerase...|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitive}} biochemical assay of viral {{reverse transcriptase}} (RT) was developed that {{is useful for}} both the detection and quantitation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the agent responsible for acquired immune deficiency syndrome in humans. This assay gave a 20 - to 40 -fold increase in enzyme activity over the current method used for RT detection of HIV. The test {{is based on a}} previous biochemical study showing the unusual stability of avian oncornavirus <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> at 30 degrees C for at least 2 days. Our study shows that the HIV polymerase is stable at 30 to 37 degrees C for up to 3 days. By using this sensitive RT assay, as few as 250 HIV virions can be quantitated directly in tissue culture medium. This assay should prove useful in studies in which the detection of HIV or the quantitation of the number of virions is required...|$|R
50|$|The genome {{of viruses}} from this family is unsegmented, -RT, positive-sense, {{single-stranded}} RNA and is 4200-9700 nucleotides long. The genome encodes structural proteins and non-structural proteins which codes for an <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase,</b> replicase, and reverse transcriptase for the reverse transcription step during replication.|$|E
50|$|All {{members of}} Group VI use virally encoded reverse transcriptase, an <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase,</b> to produce DNA {{from the initial}} virion RNA genome. This DNA is often {{integrated}} into the host genome, {{as in the case}} of retroviruses and pseudoviruses, where it is replicated and transcribed by the host.|$|E
50|$|Some viruses also encode special DNA polymerases, such as Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase. These may {{selectively}} replicate viral DNA {{through a}} variety of mechanisms. Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase, which is an <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> (RdDp). It polymerizes DNA from a template of RNA.|$|E
40|$|Viral RNA {{dependent}} polymerases (vRdPs) {{are present}} in all RNA viruses; unfortunately, their sequence similarity is too low for phylogenetic studies. Nevertheless, vRdP protein structures are remarkably conserved. In this study, we used the structural similarity of vRdPs to reconstruct their evolutionary history. The major strength of this work is in unifying sequence and structural data into a single quantitative phylogenetic analysis, using powerful a Bayesian approach. The resulting phylogram of vRdPs demonstrates that <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> (RdDPs) of viruses within Retroviridae family cluster in a clearly separated group of vRdPs, while RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) of dsRNA and +ssRNA viruses are mixed together. This evidence supports the hypothesis that RdRPs replicating +ssRNA viruses evolved multiple times from RdRPs replicating +dsRNA viruses, and vice versa. Moreover, our phylogram may be presented as a scheme for RNA virus evolution. The results are in concordance with the actual concept of RNA virus evolution. Finally, the methods used in our work provide a new direction for studying ancient virus evolution...|$|R
40|$|Four {{consensus}} sequences are conserved {{with the}} same linear arrangement in <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> encoded by retroid elements and in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases encoded by plus-, minus- and double-strand RNA viruses. One of these motifs corresponds to the YGDD span previously described by Kamer and Argos (1984). These consensus sequences altogether lead to 4 strictly and 18 conservatively maintained amino acids embedded in a large domain of 120 to 210 amino acids. As judged from secondary structure predictions, each of the 4 motifs, which may cooperate to form a well-ordered domain, places one invariant amino acid in or proximal to turn structures that may be crucial for their correct positioning in a catalytic process. We suggest that this domain may constitute a prerequisite 'polymerase module' implicated in template seating and polymerase activity. At the evolutionary level, the sequence similarities, gap distribution and distances between each motif strongly suggest that the ancestral polymerase module was encoded by an individual genetic element which was most {{closely related to the}} plus-strand RNA viruses and the non-viral retroposons. This polymerase module gene may have subsequently propagated in the viral kingdom by distinct gene set recombination events leading to the wide viral variety observed today...|$|R
40|$|Several {{properties}} of the viral <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> and of rabbit globin mRNA {{make it possible to}} consider synthesis of the globin gene in vitro. These enzymes copy an RNA template using a short sequence of complementary nucleotides as a primer. Furthermore, globin mRNA has a 3 ′-terminal sequence of adenylic acid residues that make it particularly suitable as a template, since oligo(dT) can be annealed to a specific site on the mRNA. This small primer could phase the <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase,</b> possibly ensuring that replication is initiated from that end of the globin message. We have used this approach and find that purified mRNA is an efficient template for the polymerase enzyme. The reaction requires the RNA template and the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and it is markedly stimulated by the addition of oligo(dT). Consistent with the expectation that the oligo(dT) uniquely phases the polymerase at an adenine-rich region in the globin message, oligo(dG), oligo(dC), and oligo(dA) fail to serve as primers. The product has a density intermediate between that of DNA and RNA, and shifts to a lighter DNA density after treatment with base. Further, it is specifically complementary to globin mRNA and sediments slightly faster in an alkaline sucrose gradient than a DNA standard that has a molecular weight of 129, 000. The data suggest that a major portion of the DNA product is a sequence of at least 500 bases, about 50 more than would be necessary to encode rabbit globin. The potential usefulness of this interesting product is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Retroviruses encode {{an unusual}} DNA {{polymerase}} called reverse transcriptase, {{which is an}} <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> (RdDp) that synthesizes DNA from a template of RNA. The reverse transcriptase family contain both DNA polymerase functionality and RNase H functionality, which degrades RNA base-paired to DNA. An example of a retrovirus is HIV.|$|E
50|$|A similar process {{occurs with}} {{other types of}} viruses. The {{hepatitis}} B virus, for example, carries its genetic material in the form of DNA, and employs a <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> to replicate. Some of the same compounds used as RTIs can also block HBV replication; when used in this way they are referred to as polymerase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|Abacavir is a {{nucleotide}} {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitor. Specifically, abacavir is a guanosine analogue that interferes with HIV viral <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase,</b> ultimately resulting in inhibition of replication of HIV. Dolutegravir inhibits the HIV replication cycle by binding to the integrase active site and inhibiting the strand transfer step of HIV-1 DNA integration. Lamivudine is a cytosine analogue that inhibits HIV reverse transcription by terminating the viral DNA chain.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{validity}} of classifications of RNA viruses, published alignments and phylogenies of <b>RNA-dependent</b> RNA and <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> sequences were reevaluated by a Monte Carlo randomization procedure, bootstrap resampling, and phylogenetic signal analysis. Although clear relationships between some viral taxa were identified, overall the sequence similarities and phylogenetic signals were insufficient to support many of the proposed evolutionary groupings of RNA viruses. Likewise, no support for the common ancestry of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases was found...|$|R
40|$|Influenza virus {{polymerase}} {{complex is}} a heterotrimer consisting of polymerase basic protein 1 (PB 1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB 2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA). Of these, only PB 1, {{which has been}} implicated in RNA chain elongation, possesses the four conserved motifs (motifs I, II, III, and IV) and the four invariant amino acids (one in each motif) found among all viral RNA-dependent RNA or <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases.</b> We have modified an assay system developed by Huang et al. (T. -J. Huang, P. Palese, and M. Krystal, J. Virol. 64 : 5669 - 5673, 1990) to reconstitute the functional polymerase activity in vivo. Using this assay, we have examined the requirement {{of each of these}} motifs of PB 1 in polymerase activity. We find that each of these invariant amino acids is critical for PB 1 activity and that mutation in any one of these residues renders the protein nonfunctional. We also find that in motif III, which contains the SSDD sequence, the signature sequence of influenza virus RNA polymerase, SDD is essentially invariant and cannot accommodate sequences found in other RNA viral polymerases. However, conserved changes in the flanking sequences of SDD can be partially tolerated. These results provide the experimental evidence that influenza virus PB 1 possesses a similar polymerase module as has been proposed for other RNA viruses and that the core SDD sequence of influenza virus PB 1 represents a sequence variant of the GDN in negative-stranded nonsegmented RNA viruses, GDD in positive-stranded RNA virus and double-stranded RNA viruses, or MDD in retroviruses...|$|R

The inhibition of the <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> activity was found to be non-competitive with respect to either the template-primer or the deoxynucleotide-triphosphate.

40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> binds to {{the double}} {{stranded}} DNA and extends the primer strand by adding deoxyribonucletide to the 3 ’-end. Several reactions in the polymerase active site {{have been reported}} by Kornberg {{in addition to the}} polymerization. We observed <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> I can act as a pyrophosphatase and hydrolyze deoxyribonucletide. In performing the pyrophosphatase activity, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> I requires to interact with RNA. RNA in general, was found to activate the <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> I as pyrophosphatase. This hydrolysis causes depletion of dNTP and inhibits DNA polymeration synthesis in vitro. In this <b>RNA-dependent</b> catalysis, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> I catalyzes only dNTP but not rNTP. We have also observed that many other <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> have this type of the RNA-dependent pyrophosphatase activity. Our experimental data suggest that the exonuclease active sites most likely play the critical role in this RNA-dependent dNTP hydrolysis, which might have a broader impact on biological systems. On the basis of the crystal structure of a ternary complex of RNase H (Bacillus halodurans), DNA, and RNA, we have introduced the selenium modification at the 6 -position of guanine (G) by replacing the oxygen (SeG). The SeG has been incorporated into DNA (6 nt. - 6 nucleotides) by solid phase synthesis. The crystal structure and biochemical studies with the modified SeG-DNA indicate that the SeDNA can base-pair with the RNA substrate and serve as a template for the RNA hydrolysis. In the crystal structure, it has been observed that the selenium introduction causes shifting (or unwinding) of the G-C base pair by 0. 3 Å. Furthermore, the Se-modification can significately enhance the phosphate backbone cleavage (over 1000 fold) of the RNA substrate, although the modifications are remotely located on the DNA bases. This enhancement in the catalytic step is probably attributed to the unwinding of the local duplex, which shifts scissile phosphate bond towards the enzyme active site. Our structural, kinetic and thermodynamic investigations suggest a novel mechanism of RNase H catalysis, which was revealed by the atom-specific selenium modification...|$|R

To complete this complex process, the retroviral RT enzymes need to adopt a multifunctional nature. They therefore possess 3 of the following biochemical activities: <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase,</b> ribonuclease H, and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities [...] ).

As demonstrated by Temin and Baltimore, who shared the Nobel Prize with Dulbecco, the transfer of viral genes to the cell is mediated by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (or, more precisely, <b>RNA-dependent</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase),</b> which replicates the viral genome (in this case made of RNA) into DNA, which is later incorporated in the host genome.|$|E
50|$|Retroviral RT {{proteins}} from HIV-1 and {{murine leukemia}} virus are the best-studied members of the family. Retroviral RT is responsible for converting the virus' single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded DNA.

Cells carrying the variant plasmids lost the replicase activity and severely inhibited the proliferation of phage Q beta (group III) and related phage SP (group IV) by suppressing phage RNA synthesis. In contrast, substitution of the Gly residue at 390 showed only a slight inhibitory effect, although replicase activity was also lost.
