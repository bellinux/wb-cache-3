25|$|By 1908, the {{situation}} had become unbearable, and {{with the need to}} duplicate the line, the old single-track tunnel was replaced by an almost tunnel-free alignment, with a reduced <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> of 1 in 60.|$|E
25|$|A <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> {{is often}} {{found at a}} long climb up to a summit. Ideally, the cutting at the summit should be as deep as possible, such as at Shap, as this helps {{reduce the amount of}} climb, and the {{steepness}} of the gradient. Alternately, a summit tunnel should be provided, such as at Ardglen.|$|E
25|$|The Lapstone Zig Zag {{became a}} {{bottleneck}} because, among other reasons, {{the length of}} the top and bottom roads restricted train lengths. A single-track tunnel was built in 1892 to replace the zig zag. However, this tunnel was on a steep gradient, with a <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> of 1 in 33, which caused problems with the smoke from hard-working locomotives. These problems pre-dated the fume problems with the first Cascade Tunnel {{on the opposite side of}} the world.|$|E
5000|$|Willow Tree — medium length {{crossing}} {{loop and}} railway station {{and end of}} <b>ruling</b> <b>grades.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Murrurundi — medium length {{crossing}} {{loop and}} start of <b>ruling</b> <b>grades.</b> Had a locomotive depot for bank engines in steam days.|$|R
50|$|Because the Ardglen tunnel is at {{the summit}} of <b>ruling</b> <b>grades,</b> and because of its narrow profile, the tunnel had fume {{problems}} during steam days. Larger locomotives such as the 60-class Garratt were either prohibited or limited in load. Fortunately heavy trains tended to go though the tunnel (towards Sydney and Newcastle) in the downhill direction.|$|R
25|$|Tractive {{effort is}} a measure of the {{heaviest}} load a locomotive can start or haul at very low speed over the <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> in a given territory. However, as the pressure grew to run faster goods and heavier passenger trains, tractive effort was seen to be an inadequate measure of performance because it did not take into account speed. Therefore, in the 20th century, locomotives began to be rated by power output. A variety of calculations and formulas were applied, but in general railways used dynamometer cars to measure tractive force at speed in actual road testing.|$|E
25|$|Tunnels on steep {{gradients}} {{can present}} problems for air-breathing locomotives, such as steam locomotives and diesel locomotives. Poor ventilation in long or narrow tunnels can starve the locomotive of power. The solution {{is analogous to}} compensation for curvature and requires the gradient in the tunnel and for some distance on either side to be greatly reduced compared to the <b>ruling</b> <b>grade.</b> Unfortunately, the necessary compensation for gradient {{is not a simple}} equation, but is rather a trial and error process. Since one cannot build several tunnels to find out which one is best, it is useful to study existing tunnels with steep gradients.|$|E
25|$|Gitt {{developed}} the cost estimate {{for the road}} assuming single track operation, iron rail at 50 pounds per yard,ties on 24 inch centers, a road bed base fourteen foot in width, with slopes of one foot horizontal to each vertical for cuts and twelve foot in width for embankments with slopes of one foot and-a-half horizontal to each vertical, no excavation deeper than 25 feet or embankments over 30 feet.(Gitt, page 46) As in his Western Maryland work, the cost for right of way {{was not included in}} Gitt's estimate.(Gitt, page 45) The <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> for Gitt's proposed route was 52.8 feet to the mile, or 1% and no curve was shorter than 1,000 feet.(Gitt, page 46) The highest point on the line between Littlestown and Frederick at 520 feet was one mile west of Ladiesburg, Maryland while the lowest point on the line at 281 feet was at the Frederick station.(Data from 1953 USGS topo maps) At the end of their survey, Gitt and Irwin estimated that their proposed 30 mile alignment could be shortened by a half-mile with more careful work, or 29.5 miles.|$|E
25|$|The Trans-Iranian railway {{traverses}} many mountain ranges, and {{is full of}} spirals and 1 in 36 (2.78%) <b>ruling</b> <b>grades.</b> Much of {{the terrain}} was unmapped when construction took place, and its geology unknown. Several stretches of line, including tunnels, were built through unsuitable geology, {{and had to be}} replaced even before the line opened. Nevertheless, the line was completed ahead of schedule.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of improved traction control and adoption of AC traction motors {{has led to}} the {{development of}} high adhesion locomotives. Rollingstock manufacturers have been successful in marketing these high adhesion locomotives to train operators because of the increase in continuous tractive effort these locomotives provide allowing larger trains to be hauled over <b>ruling</b> <b>grades.</b> Some concerns have been held by track infrastructure owners in the Australian rail industry about the rail damage associated with high adhesion locomotives in operation on the tight curves associated with <b>ruling</b> <b>grades.</b> This paper uses vehicle dynamics simulation to determine the wheel rail contact forces of high adhesion locomotive operations on steep grades (up to 1 in 37) and compares the advantages to be gained from the use of distributed power and steering bogie designs to current locomotives and head end trains. The reduction of the available adhesion due to wheelset angle of attack is demonstrated by the simulation...|$|R
50|$|The {{reduction}} in the westbound <b>ruling</b> <b>grades</b> allowed the Canadian Pacific Railway to remove the pusher locomotives that had been required on the Connaught Tunnel route. This was especially important for the unit coal trains from the Crowsnest Pass area destined for Asian markets through the port of Vancouver, British Columbia. Trains now predominantly travel east through the Connaught Tunnel and west through the Mount Macdonald Tunnel.|$|R
500|$|In {{order to}} connect the eastern and western {{divisions}} of the railroad at this time divided by the unfinished Blue Ridge Railroad, a temporary track over Rockfish Gap was proposed by the railroad's chief engineer, Charles Ellet, Jr., and by 1854 had been constructed and was in use. [...] Built over and around the under construction Blue Ridge Tunnel, this [...] track, called the Mountain Track, included steep grades (maximum 5.6% with a <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> of 5.3%) and sharp curves (minimum radius of [...] ), thereby limiting speeds to around [...] [...] Three small tank locomotives were ordered for the temporary track, {{one of which was}} supplied by the Tredegar Iron Works of Richmond, the Joseph R. Anderson, and two from Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, the Baldwin and C.R. Mason. [...] A second temporary track [...] around the Brooksville Tunnel and a third [...] around Robertson's hollow were also constructed. [...] The temporary tracks successfully joined the railroad and by eliminating the extra cost and effort of removing freight and passengers from trains for transport over the mountains, facilitated further growth and expansion westward.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1953 {{edition of}} Railway Engineering William H. Hay says [...] "The <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> {{may be defined}} as the maximum {{gradient}} over which a tonnage train can be hauled with one locomotive....The <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> does not necessarily have the maximum gradient on the division. Momentum grades, pusher grades, or those that must regularly be doubled by tonnage trains may be heavier." [...] This means the [...] "ruling grade" [...] may change if the management chooses to operate the railroad differently.|$|E
2500|$|The Woodhead Tunnel was summit {{tunnel of}} [...] length and {{suffered}} from poor working conditions as the gradient of 1 in 200 (0.5%) {{in the tunnel}} was not sufficiently reduced compared to the 1 in 100 (1%) <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> of the approaches as a whole. The tunnel actually consisted of two separate bores, of minimum cross-section.|$|E
5000|$|On railways, steep {{gradients}} on sharp curves have {{an equivalent}} gradient slightly steeper than the stated value. This {{is because of}} extra friction of the wheel on the rails, and because wagons stretch out on the chord {{rather than on the}} arc, and may thus cause trains to stall. To compensate, the gradient of <b>ruling</b> <b>grades</b> is slightly reduced from say 1 in 50 to 1 in 53.|$|R

50|$|Expedited Transcon {{traffic is}} {{generally}} routed via the direct Seattle route, and slow bulk-freight traffic is generally routed via the Spokane-Portland-Seattle route (through Vancouver, WA). The Spokane-Portland-Seattle route is mostly water level with a 1.15% maximum grade near Marshall, Washington. (Note {{that there is}} a parallel BNSF-owned route that bypasses the 1.15% grade with a maximum grade of 0.8%; they operate it directionally.) There is a 0.95% maximum grade in the Napavine, Washington area. The direct Seattle route traverses the Cascade Range at the Cascade Tunnel (Scenic and Berne, Washington); it has 2.2% <b>ruling</b> <b>grades</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} tunnel.|$|R
2500|$|In North America, Congress set the Standard Grade for railroads {{eligible}} for subsidies and grants in the 1850s. They took as that standard the one {{adopted by the}} Cumberland – Wheeling Railway, that grade being 116 feet per mile. Later when charters were drawn up for the Union Pacific Railroad and the Canadian Pacific Railway in Canada, the national governments imposed the Standard <b>Ruling</b> <b>Grade</b> on the two lines because both received federal assistance and regulation. (Vance, JE Jr.,1995) ...|$|E
2500|$|At , {{the line}} {{would be about}} [...] shorter than the [...] Old Road. The new route would have only 15 curves—42 fewer curves than the Old Road, the {{equivalent}} of more than four complete circles of curvature—which increased speeds and decreased running time—especially for freight, but for passenger trains as well. [...] The <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> was cut in half from 1.1% to 0.55%. The new line would also be built without railroad crossings to avoid collisions with automobiles and horse-drawn vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first route}} to be {{considered}} was a branch line from Epuni, climbing {{the side of the}} hills in the Hutt Valley, and passing through a tunnel near the present hill road before dropping into the Wainuiomata Valley. [...] The <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> would have been about 1:60, and would possibly have required a second short tunnel to pass through a spur. [...] Negative points for this option included the fact that it would have to pass through an appreciable amount of developed land, and a requirement for heavy earthworks.|$|E
50|$|The trains conductor, William Allen Fuller, and {{two other}} men, chased the stolen train, first on foot, then by handcar. Locomotives of the time {{normally}} averaged 15 mph, with short bursts of an average speed of 20 mph. In addition, the terrain north of Atlanta is very hilly, and the <b>ruling</b> <b>grades</b> are steep. Even today, average speeds are usually never greater than 40 mph between Chattanooga and Atlanta. Since Andrews intended to stop periodically to perform acts of sabotage, a determined pursuer, even on foot, could conceivably have {{caught up with the}} train before it reached Chattanooga.|$|R
5000|$|The EMC E2 was an American passenger-train diesel {{locomotive}} which {{as a single}} unit developed , from two (2) [...] prime movers. These locomotives were typically operated as a unit set (A - B - B); where the three unit lashup developed 5400 horsepower. This was almost the ideal horsepower required (...) for the tonnage of a 15 - 18 car passenger train, operated over the <b>ruling</b> <b>grades</b> of {{virtually all of the}} mileage between major American cities. The units were of the A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, and manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC), later Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) of La Grange, Illinois.|$|R
50|$|The H&S {{was built}} across the hilly terrain of {{southern}} Iowa {{and the line}} suffered operationally from steep <b>ruling</b> <b>grades,</b> numerous curves and many trestles had to be built and maintained. Loss of timber trestles due to fire led {{to many of the}} line segments being put up for abandonment. The southern Iowa economy has generally lagged behind much of the remainder of Iowa and the Midwest, and the H&S suffered from a lack of industrial development along its line. The line's revenue base relied too much on coal, products of agriculture, and passenger operations for it to remain profitable once autos and trucks came to the area of southern Iowa.|$|R
2500|$|The {{second and}} more {{favourable}} route would have started at Naenae, passed Taita Cemetery, around {{the head of}} Rata Street, through a spur by cutting or tunnel, then through the main tunnel {{at the head of}} Seddon Street. [...] The <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> would have been about 1:45, but could have been reduced with more earthworks. [...] Positive points for this option included the fact that it would have passed through less developed land, and would have had the secondary benefit of serving the industrial areas of Naenae and Taita.|$|E
2500|$|In steam days Southern Pacific trains eastward across Nevada and Utah faced nothing steeper than 0.43% in the 531 {{miles from}} Sparks to Ogden—except {{for a few}} miles of 1.4% east of Wells. Trains would leave Sparks with enough engine to manage the 0.43% grade (e.g. a 2-10-2 with 5500 tons) and would get helper engines at Wells; the [...] "ruling grade" [...] from Sparks to Ogden could be {{considered}} 0.43%. But nowadays the railroad doesn't base helper engines and crews at Wells so trains must leave Sparks with enough power to climb the 1.4%, making that the division's <b>ruling</b> <b>grade.</b>|$|E
2500|$|So {{the term}} is always {{ambiguous}}, and is more ambiguous still if the <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> is a momentum grade. Overland Route trains from Sacramento, California to Oakland face nothing steeper than 0.5% on Track 1, the traditional westward track, but nowadays they might need to climb to the Benicia bridge on Track 2 which includes 0.7 mile at about 1.9%, preceded and followed by near-level track. How to define [...] "ruling grade" [...] there? Should we assume a running start? How much of one?

5000|$|The EL went {{bankrupt}} {{in the early}} 1970s. Conrail took over its operations, but the Main Line did not fit Conrail's plans, since the realignments were much less efficient than the original Main Line and Boonton Branch for straight freight traffic. The severing of various freight lines and the new connections required to create a contiguous east-west line through New Jersey to Pennsylyvania was circuitous and involved fairly steep <b>ruling</b> <b>grades.</b> As a result, Conrail wished to abandon all freight operations on the former E-L lines. The State of New Jersey agreed {{to take over the}} [...] "E-L" [...] commuter lines from Conrail. The Main Line saw little to no freight traffic after this transfer.

5000|$|Not {{long after}} {{connecting}} Alamogordo to El Paso, Eddy, his chief engineer Horace Sumner and their crews set about building the Alamogordo and Sacramento Mountain Railway (A&SM). Described as an [...] "engineering marvel", 28 mi were completed by 1898. By 1903 the line climbed 4747 ft over 32 mi crossing several large trestles and a switchback with <b>ruling</b> <b>grades</b> of 6.4 %. From {{the outside world}} it provided improved connections to rich timber country, and later the resort at Cloudcroft—in addition to small communities like La Luz and Russia.

40|$|In a {{heavy haul}} train {{operations}} the <b>ruling</b> <b>grades</b> {{that set the}} tractive power requirements for train consists are often associated with tight curvatures. Past studies of passive or active bogie steering developments have been mostly directed towards high speed rail applications or light rail and commuter rail applications and hence {{studies have focused on}} two axle bogies. Linked passive steering three axle locomotive bogies such as produced by General Motors EMD for the SD 70 class locomotive are in widespread use however, there are few publications on traction and curving, and few papers on linked passive steering bogies. This paper presents a simulation study three axle bogie locomotives on various curve radii with traction and variable rail friction conditions. Curving performance is assessed showing body linked radial bogies to have considerable advantages over axle linked bogies that are significantly better than yaw relaxation bogies at improving steering under traction. As traction adhesion approaches the rail friction coefficient steering performance of all bogies without forced steering deteriorates to the same levels as a rigid bogie...|$|R
2500|$|The Woy Woy tunnel in New South Wales is {{approximately}} 2000m long. [...] It is straight and level, and double track. [...] The tunnel is near sea-level, which partly explains {{why it is}} near level. [...] There are no intermediate ventilation shafts. [...] There are short rising grades of 1 in 40 and 1 in 80 {{on either side of}} the tunnel. [...] The <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> of the line is 1 in 40, and taking all these factors into account, the tunnel has never suffered heavily from smoke. [...] In all, a reasonably well designed tunnel. The line was electrified in 1961, but since the 1990s freight trains have reverted to diesel haulage.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> {{is usually}} {{used as a}} synonym for [...] "steepest climb" [...] between two points on a railroad. More simply, the steepest grade to be climbed {{dictates}} how powerful the locomotive must be (or how light the train) in order to complete the run without assistance. Even if 99% of the line could be run with a light (and cheap) locomotive, if at some point on the line there is a steeper gradient that a light engine {{would be unable to}} climb, this gradient [...] "rules" [...] that a more powerful (and expensive) locomotive must be used, in spite of it being far too powerful {{for the rest of the}} line. This is why special [...] "helper engines" [...] (also dubbed [...] "Bankers") are often stationed near steep grades on otherwise mild tracks, because it is cheaper than running a too-powerful locomotive over the entire track mileage just in order to make the grade, especially when multiple trains run over the line each day.|$|E
50|$|A refuge loop {{built on}} the <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> on Cowan bank proved to be {{unworkable}} as the refuged train could not restart.

A refuge siding at Razorback halfway up the 1 in 75 <b>ruling</b> <b>grade</b> climb from Fish River to Cullerin also allowed trains to restart from level track.|$|E
5000|$|One may plot {{fuel cost}} per {{year as a}} {{function}} of traffic flow (in net tonnes/year in one direction) for various assumptions (of <b>ruling</b> <b>grades,</b> locomotive model, single or double track, and fuel/power prices), resulting· in a large number of such plotted curves. [...] For early 1970s energy prices of 1.3 kopecks/kwh and 70 roubles/tonne for diesel fuel, these curves (or tables based on them) show the fuel/power costs to be very roughly 1.5 to 2 time higher for diesel operation as for electric. [...] The exact ratio, of course, depends on the various assumptions and in extreme cases of low diesel fuel prices (45 roubles/tonne) and high electricity cost (1.5 kopecks/kwh), diesel fuel costs of rail movement are lower than electricity costs. [...] All of these curves show the difference in energy cost (of diesel vs. electric) increases with traffic flow. One may approximate the above-mentioned curves by cubic functions of the traffic flow (in net tonnes/year) with the coefficients being linear functions of fuel/power prices. In mathematics, such coefficients are usually shown as constants, but here they are also mathematical functions [...] Such use of mathematical formulas facilitates computerized evaluation of alternatives.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the passive}} and active {{steering}} developments of traction bogies have been directed towards {{high speed rail}} or light rail and commuter rail applications. Previous studies ignored coupler forces and often assumed the wheel rail profiles have ample conicity for the curving task. There is little work directed towards high adhesion rates which is a critical area for freight locomotive performance. In heavy haul train operations <b>ruling</b> <b>grades</b> are often associated with tight curvatures, and steering tasks of hauling locomotives are affected by lateral components of longitudinal train forces. Haul locomotives also have a significant yaw moment from coupler forces making uneven longitudinal creeps useful in balancing these yaw forces. The use of larger diameter wheels on locomotives reduces effective steering conicity such that contact profiles may become insufficient to negotiate tight curves. The large diameter wheels make longitudinal creepage or slip inevitable and Goodall et al. [1] definition of perfect steering unattainable. A new criteria for ideal steering in these conditions is proposed. For hauling locomotives, ideal steering is defined as when the lateral rail creep and contact loads of each axle in one bogie are equal and longitudinal creeps are positive to the applied traction. This definition is applicable to all curving tasks that a hauling locomotive encounters whilst still applying low wheel rail creep forces. In {{most of the cases}} ideal steering can be achieved with zero lateral creep forces. The paper describes equations for quasi-static curving forces including traction and in-train forces. An analysis of curving forces for locomotives with three axle bogies is made with the equations for various curvatures and with haulage locomotives in different train configurations including pusher configuration...|$|R
40|$|We first review {{some basic}} facts of contact and {{symplectic}} topology. Symplectic cobordisms are the objects that bring these two worlds together: they are symplectic manifolds with contact manifolds as their boundary. Lagrangian submanifolds in a symplectic cobordism limit to Legendrian submanifolds on the boundary. When the symplectic manifold is four-dimensional and the contact manifolds are three- dimensional, the Legendrian submanifolds are knots and links. We review certain {{restrictions on the}} classical invariants of such Legendrian knots imposed by the relation of Lagrangian cobordism. Then we specialize to Legendrian knots in the 3 -sphere as the boundary of Lagrangian surfaces in the 4 -ball. Much of the recent {{research in this area}} uses tools related to contact homology. In particular, we explore the notion of a ruling of a Legendrian knot.
