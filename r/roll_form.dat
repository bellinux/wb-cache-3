40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> is a 3 D {{deformation}} complex process. Stiffness of {{stands and}} strength of shafts are the preconditions {{for the production of}} precision products. However, the existing <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> equipment cannot meet the requirements of the production for high strength steel or ultra high strength steel. In order to solve the forming problem of high strength steel or ultra high strength steel, it needs to redesign a set of <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> equipment. The redesign of <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> equipment not only makes the production cycle too long, but also results in a high cost. So it is not suitable for the production of forming products. In this paper, based on the existing <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> equipment a new method of <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> operation is proposed to optimize the production of U shaped products.

40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> is an {{incremental}} bending process for forming metal sheet, strip or coiled stock. Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{is a standard}} tool for metal forming simulation, it is only now being increasingly used {{for the analysis of}} the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. This is because of the excessive computational time due to the long strip length and the multiple numbers of stands that have to be modelled. Typically a single solid element is used through the thickness of the sheet for <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> simulations. Recent investigations have shown that residual stresses introduced during steel processing may affect the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process and therefore need to be included in <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> simulations. These residual stresses vary in intensity through the thickness and this cannot be accounted for by using only one solid element through the material thickness, in this work a solid-shell element with an arbitrary number of integration points has been used to simulate the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. The system modelled is that of <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> a V-channel with dual phase DP 780 sheet steel. In addition, the influence of other modelling parameters, such as friction, on CPU time is further investigated. The numerical results are compared to experimental data and a good correlation has been observed. Additionally the numerical results show that the CPU time is reduced in the model without friction and that considering friction does not {{have a significant effect on}} springback prediction in the numerical analysis of the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process...|$|R

40|$|The {{residual}} stresses in a <b>roll</b> <b>formed</b> product {{play a critical}} role in determining the product quality. They are generally very complex and frequently difficult to predict due to the complicated fabricating process and its parameters. Consequently, they attract many concerns from <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> scholars and engineers. However, how to inspect the {{residual stresses}} in <b>roll</b> <b>formed</b> products efficiently and economically is still a challenge. This paper introduces a novel, highly efficient, operationally simple and accurate residual stresses measurement method for evaluating the residual stresses in <b>roll</b> <b>formed</b> products. It utilizes a modification of the current sectioning methods to firstly obtain the membrane and bending residual stresses components. Then a novel material removal approach, the tapered removal, is employed to determine the layering stresses component by measuring the curvature variations of the remaining sample through its thickness direction. A practical implementation of the method is performed through the residual stresses measurement of a typical <b>roll</b> <b>formed</b> square hollow section (SHS). The method is successfully verified by the neutron diffraction method. The new method is expected to become a routine measuring method to determine the residual stresses distribution in <b>roll</b> <b>formed</b> products, with potentially significant impact on the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> industry...|$|R

40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> of ultra-high {{strength}} steels (UHSS) {{and other}} high strength alloys is an advanced manufacturing methodology {{with the ability}} of cold forming those materials to complex three-dimensional shapes for lightweight structural applications. Due to their high strength, most of these materials have a reduced ductility which excludes conventional sheet forming methods under cold <b>forming</b> conditions. <b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> is possible due to its low strains and incremental forming characteristic. Recent research investigates the development of high strength nano-structured aluminum sheet and titanium alloys, {{as well as their}} behaviour in <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> with regard to formability, material behaviour and shape defects. The development of new materials is often limited to small scale samples due to the high preparation costs. In contrast, industrial application needs larger scale tests for validation, especially in <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> where a minimum sheet length is required to feed the sample trough the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> machine. This work describes a novel technique for studying <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> of a short length of experimental material. DP 780 steel strips (500 mm – 1300 mm length) were welded between two mild steel carrier sheets of similar width and thickness giving an overall strip length of 2 m. <b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> trials were performed and longitudinal edge strain, bow and springback determined on the welded samples and samples formed of full length DP 780 strip before and after cut off. The experimental results of this work show that this method gives a reasonable approach for predicting material behavior in <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> transverse to the rolling direction. In contrast to that significant differences in longitudinal bow were observed between the welded sections and the sections formed of full length DP 780 strip; this indicates that the applicability of this method is limited with regard to predicting longitudinal material behavior in <b>roll</b> <b>forming.</b> <br /...|$|R

In this thesis, the process of cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is introduced and it is seen that <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design {{is central to the}} cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. The conventional design and manufacture of <b>form</b> <b>rolls</b> is discussed and it is observed that surrounding the design process are a number of activities which although peripheral are time consuming and a possible source of error. A CAD/CAM system is described which alleviates many of the problems traditional to <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design. New techniques for the calculation of strip length and controlling the means of forming bends are detailed. The CAD/CAM system's advantages and limitations are discussed and, whilst the system has numerous significant advantages, its principal limitation can be said to be the need to manufacture <b>form</b> <b>rolls</b> and test them on a mill before a design can be stated satisfactory. A survey of the previous theoretical and experimental analysis of cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is presented and is found to be limited. By considering the previous work, a method of numerical analysis of the cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process is proposed based on a minimum energy approach. Parallel to the numerical analysis, a comprehensive range of software has been developed to enhance the designer's visualisation of the effects of his <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design. A complementary approach to the analysis of <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design is the generation of <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design, a method for the partial generation of designs is described.

Hence, an initial experimental investigation of the rolling of channel sections is described. Finally, areas of potential future work are discussed...|$|R

It has been suggested that this process can be used to manufacture automotive components from Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) which has limited tensile elongation and is unsuitable for stamping. In the flexible <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process, the pre-cut blank is fed through a set of rolls; some rolls are computer-numerically controlled (CNC) to follow the 3 D contours of the part and hence parts with a variable cross-section can be produced. As with conventional <b>roll</b> <b>forming,</b> the number of forming stations is kept to a minimum, particularly the controlled roll stations, in order to limit tooling costs.
