Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} a new technical analysis method for finding reversal points of stock price. The proposed method applies the Fuzzy logic theory to the Japanese candlestick theory by converting the open, close, {{high and low}} prices into fuzzy candlestick chart. Using the model, we can define and interpret the “symptom sequence” before the reversal point, and then identify the <b>reversal</b> <b>patterns</b> of the candlestick chart. Transaction data of non- ST Shares in SSE A Share, SSE B Share, Shenzhen A share and Shenzhen B share are analyzed to validate the proposed model, respectively. Results demonstrate that <b>reversal</b> <b>patterns</b> are convincingly identified by the model, and basically the model {{could be applied to}} establish a stock price reversal early warning system in the financial market...|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} of single nucleus accumbens (NAcc) neurons of rats was extracellularly recorded during intravenous cocaine self-administration sessions (0. 7 mg/kg per infusion, fixed ratio 1). We reported previously that NAcc neurons showed a change, usually a decrease, in firing rate {{during the first}} 1 min after the cocaine-reinforced lever press. This postpress change {{was followed by a}} progressive reversal of that change, which began within the first 2 min after the press and was not complete until the last 1 min before the next lever press (termed the change � progressive <b>reversal</b> firing <b>pattern).</b> In the present study we documented a regular pattern of locomotion that occurred in parallel with the change � progressive <b>reversal</b> firing <b>pattern.</b> This observation suggested that discharges time locked to locomotion may determine the change � progressive <b>reversal</b> firing <b>pattern.</b> However, 55 % of the neurons failed to show firing time locked to locomotion that could have contributed to the change � progressive <b>reversal</b> firing <b>pattern.</b> Moreover, for all neurons, the change � progressive <b>reversal</b> firing <b>pattern</b> was apparent even if the calculation of firing rate excluded all periods of locomotion. The present data showed that the change � progressive <b>reversal</b> firing <b>pattern</b> is not solely attributable to phasic changes in firing time locked to the execution of locomotion. The change � progressive <b>reversal</b> firing <b>pattern</b> closely mirrors changes in drug level and dopamine overflow observed by previous researchers and may thus be a component of the neurophysiological mechanism by which drug level regulates drug-taking behavior during an ongoing self-administration session.

50|$|The rising wedge {{pattern is}} {{characterized}} by a chart pattern which forms when the market makes higher highs and higher lows with a contracting range. When this pattern is found in an uptrend, it is considered a <b>reversal</b> <b>pattern,</b> as the contraction of the range indicates that the uptrend is losing strength. When this pattern is found in a downtrend, it is considered a bearish pattern, as the market range becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that the correction is losing strength, and that the resumption of the downtrend is in the making.|$|E
50|$|A hanging {{man is a}} type of bearish <b>reversal</b> <b>pattern,</b> made up of {{just one}} candle, found in an uptrend of price charts of {{financial}} assets. It has a long lower wick and a short body {{at the top of the}} candlestick with little or no upper wick. In order for a candle to be a valid hanging man most traders say the lower wick must be two times greater than the size of the body portion of the candle, and the body of the candle must be at the upper end of the trading range.|$|E
50|$|Most {{statistical}} models of reversals have analyzed {{them in terms}} of a Poisson process or other kinds of renewal process. A Poisson process would have, on average, a constant reversal rate, so it is common to use a non-stationary Poisson process. However, compared to a Poisson process, there is a reduced probability of reversal {{for tens of thousands of}} years after a reversal. This could be due to an inhibition in the underlying mechanism, or it could just mean that some shorter polarity intervals have been missed. A random <b>reversal</b> <b>pattern</b> with inhibition can be represented by a gamma process. In 2006, a team of physicists at the University of Calabria found that the reversals also conform to a Lévy distribution, which describes stochastic processes with long-ranging correlations between events in time. The data are also consistent with a deterministic, but chaotic, process.|$|E

Ten normal subjects, aged between 22 and 52 years (mean age 32 ± 8. 37 years), participated in the study. All subjects underwent mfVEP testing with <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> and <b>pattern</b> pulse stimulus presentations. The stimulus subtends 26 ° from fixation and includes 24 segments. Only the vertical channel was recorded on all subjects. Testing was repeated after 1 - 2 weeks. Only the right eye of all subjects was analysed. Segments with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR < 1. 5) were excluded from analysis. The latencies were analysed to confirm values from the same peak for the two tests. The latency values were then analysed {{for the start of}} the response, the first peak and the second peak. The waveforms were reproducible throughout the field. Reproducibility of la tency at the "start of the response" was significantly lesser than the first and the second peaks studied, while the reproducibility of latency at the first peak was not statistically different from the second peak for either <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> or <b>pattern</b> pulse stimulation. The latency values were not different between the first and the second sessions for either <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> or <b>pattern</b> pulse stimulation for any of the peaks.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cholinergic}} agents undergoing clinical trials {{for the treatment}} of Alzheimer's disease and the anticholinergic agent scopolamine, were investigated on the components of the flash and <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in young healthy volunteers. The effect of recording the flash and <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> VEPs for 13 hours in 5 healthy male volunteers, revealed no statistically significant change in the latency or amplitude measures. Administration of the muscarinic agonist SDZ 210 - 086 to 16 healthy male volunteers resulted in the reduction of the flash N 2 -P 2 and <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> N 75 -P 100 peak-to-peak amplitudes. These effects on the flash VEP occurred at both doses (0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/day), but only at the higher dose on the <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> VEP. Administration of the antimuscarinic agent scopolamine to 11 healthy young male volunteers, resulted in a delay of the flash P 2 latency but no effect on the <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> P 100 latency. The <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> N 75 -P 100 peak-to-peak amplitude was also increased post dosing. The combination of scopolamine with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor SDZ ENA 713 resulted in no significant effect on the flash and <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> VEPs, suggesting that the effects of scopolamine may have been partially reversed. Topical application of scopolamine in 6 young healthy volunteers also resulted in no statistically significant effects on the flash and <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> VEPs. The selective effect of scopolamine on the flash P 2 latency but not on the <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> P 100 latency, provided a model whereby new cholinergic agents developed {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease can be investigated on a physiological basis. In addition, {{the results of this study}} led to the hypothesis that the selective flash P 2 delay in Alzheimer's disease was probably due to a cholinergic deficit in both the tectal pathway from the retina to the visual cortex and the magnocellular path of the geniculostriate pathway, whereas the lack of an effect on the <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> P 100 component was probably due to a sparing of the parvocellular geniculostriate pathway...|$|R
5000|$|In {{technical}} analysis, {{a shooting}} star is {{interpreted as a}} type of <b>reversal</b> <b>pattern</b> presaging a falling price. The Shooting Star looks exactly the same as the Inverted hammer, but instead of being found in a downtrend it is found in an uptrend and thus has different implications. Like the Inverted hammer it is made up of a candle with a small lower body, little or no lower wick, and a long upper wick that is at least two {{times the size of the}} lower body. The long upper wick of the candlestick pattern indicates that the buyers drove prices up at some point during the period in which the candle was formed but encountered selling pressure which drove prices back down for the period to close near to where they opened. As this occurred in an uptrend the selling pressure is seen as a potential reversal sign. After encountering this pattern traders often check for a lower open on the next period before considering the sell-signal valid. As with the Inverted hammer most traders will see a longer wick as a sign of a greater potential reversal and like to see an increase in volume on the day the Shooting Star forms.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} the multifocal visual evoked cortical potentials (mfVEP) elicited by pattern pulse stimulation with that of <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> in producing reliable responses (signal-to-noise ratio > 1. 359). Participants were 14 healthy subjects. Visual stimulation was obtained using a 60 -sector dartboard display consisting of 6 concentric rings presented in either pulse or reversal mode. Each sector, consisting of 16 checks at 99 % Michelson contrast and 80 cd/m 2 mean luminance, was controlled by a binary m-sequence in the time domain. The signal-to-noise ratio was generally larger in the <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> than in the pattern pulse mode. The number of reliable responses was similar in the central sectors for the two stimulation modes. At the periphery, <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> showed a larger number of reliable responses. Pattern pulse stimuli performed similarly to <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> stimuli to generate reliable waveforms in R 1 and R 2. The advantage of using both protocols to study mfVEP responses is their complementarity: in some patients, reliable waveforms in specific sectors may be obtained with only one of the two methods. The joint analysis of <b>pattern</b> <b>reversal</b> and <b>pattern</b> pulse stimuli increased the rate of reliability for central sectors by 7. 14 % in R 1, 5. 35 % in R 2, 4. 76 % in R 3, 3. 57 % in R 4, 2. 97 % in R 5, and 1. 78 % in R 6.
