40|$|Abstract—The goal of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the vis-coelastic behavior of the rabbit medial collateral ligament (MCL) at multiple levels of strain (between 0 % and» 5 %) and their corre-sponding stresses (between 0 and » 55 MPa) for stress relaxation and creep, respectively. We hypothesized that in the rabbit MCL the rate of stress relaxation would be strain dependent and the rate of creep would be stress dependent. Thirty MCLs from 15 rabbits were tested ex vivo for this study. Results show that within the physiologically relevant region of ligament behavior, the rate of stress relaxation is strain dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the rate of relaxation decreasing with increasing tissue strain. The rate of creep is stress dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the rate of creep decreasing with increasing stress. These results support our hypothesis, with the greatest nonlinearities in a physiologically relevant <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading.</b> As such, these nonlinearities should be considered when quantifying ligament viscoelastic behavior with a rabbit model.

This project examines the mechanical behaviour of three commonly used structural metals when subjected to a tensile loading; Steel, Aluminium and Brass. The tensile load was applied to the metallic specimens at different loading rates. Acoustic Emission (AE) was the main monitoring tool implemented into the procedure to record in real time the elastic waves produced from the three individual materials, as they were applied with the load until failure. Fractography was also implemented into the analysis to compare the AE signals with microscopic deformation characteristics of the materials. The discussion of AE activity was divided up into individual regions on the loading graphs. Although displaying unique graph shapes, the same regions were still available for all materials. The results showed that for the three materials, steel produced the most amount of AE activity for all loading rates tested. It was also concluded that the elastic <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> graph produced highest accumulation of AE activity for all the materials. The AE signals were also seen to be amplified when increasing the loading rate of tensile load applied to specimens. Each material displayed unique characteristics in relation to the AE activity with defining features when monitoring until failure. Fractography was an effective method for determining the type of fracture of the material, however interpretation of AE source from photographs was highly dependent on investigator- further research into the field would be required. The AE technique proved effective at distinguishing between the three materials, when applied with a tensile load until failure.

To address this issue, we created finite element models to examine the effect on tibial strain of: (1) muscle forces (estimated using instrumented knee data) acting on attachment sites on the proximal tibia, (2) UKR implantation, (3) loading position, and (4) changes in gait pattern. Muscle forces acting on the tibia had no significant influence on strains within the periprosthetic region, but UKR implantation increased strain by 20 %. Strain also significantly increased if the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> application was moved > 3 [*]mm medially.

The impact of aerosol direct radiative forcing on Indian monsoon is extremely complex and is strongly {{dependent on the}} model, aerosol distribution and characteristics specified in the model, modelling strategy employed as well as on spatial and temporal scales. The present study investigates (i) the aerosol direct radiative forcing impact on mean Indian summer monsoon when a combination of quasi-realistic mean annual cycles of scattering and absorbing aerosols derived from an aerosol transport model constrained with satellite observed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is prescribed, (ii) the dominant feedback mechanism behind the simulated impact of all-aerosol direct radiative forcing on monsoon and (iii) the relative impacts of absorbing and scattering aerosols on mean Indian summer monsoon. We have used CAM 3, an atmospheric GCM (AGCM) that has a comprehensive treatment of the aerosol-radiation interaction. This AGCM has been used to perform climate simulations with three different representations of aerosol direct radiative forcing due to the total, scattering aerosols and black carbon aerosols. We have also conducted experiments without any aerosol forcing. Aerosol direct impact due to scattering aerosols causes significant reduction in summer monsoon precipitation over India with a tendency for southward shift of Tropical Convergence Zones (TCZs) over the Indian region. Aerosol forcing reduces surface solar absorption over the primary rainbelt region of India and reduces the surface and lower tropospheric temperatures. Concurrent warming of the lower atmosphere over the warm oceanic region in the south reduces the land-ocean temperature contrast and weakens the monsoon overturning circulation and the advection of moisture into the landmass. This increases atmospheric convective stability, and decreases convection, clouds, precipitation and associated latent heat release. Our analysis reveals a defining negative moisture-advection feedback that acts as an internal damping mechanism spinning down the regional hydrological cycle and leading to significant circulation changes in response to external radiative forcing perturbations. When total aerosol loading (both absorbing and scattering aerosols) is prescribed, dust and black carbon aerosols are found to cause significant atmospheric heating over the monsoon region but the aerosol-induced weakening of meridional lower tropospheric temperature gradient (leading to weaker summer monsoon rainfall) more than offsets the increase in summer-time rainfall resulting from the atmospheric heating effect of absorbing aerosols, leading to a net decrease of summer monsoon rainfall. Further, we have carried out climate simulations with globally constant AODs and also with the constant AODs over the extended Indian region replaced by realistic AODs. Regional aerosol radiative forcing perturbations over the Indian region is found to have impact not only over the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> but over remote tropical regions as well. This warrants the need to prescribe realistic aerosol properties in strategic regions such as India in order to accurately assess the aerosol impact...|$|E

Although the maximum strain energy release rate or G-criterion is based on sound physical concepts, the computational procedures necessary to define exactly the angle of crack extension for an arbitrary angled crack presents a formidable amount of calculations. On the other hand, the minimum strain energy density or S-criterion and the maximum dilatational or T-criterion are compared and their affinities have been established. It was shown that only in the cases when the total strain energy density is due to its distortional component both criteria coincide.

The quadratic or even linear approximation of in plane displacements does not account for the irregular distribution in thickness direction [1].

We characterize the bursts {{in terms of the}} associated elongation increments and peak deformation rates, and demonstrate that these quantities follow power-law distributions that do not depend on specimen orientation or stress rate. We also investigate the statistics of stress increments in between the bursts, which are found to be Weibull distributed and exhibit a characteristic size effect. We discuss our findings in view of observations of deformation bursts in other materials, such as face-centered cubic and hexagonal metals...|$|R

For {{calculation}} of {{bending fatigue strength}} of scroll wraps, the pressure loads and temperatures in compression chambers based on general profile theory are analyzed, and a load model including the pressure loads the temperatures is proposed. For the scroll wraps, their load model for bending fatigue strength includes the pressure loads and the temperatures. Their pressure loads can be simplified on the mid-areas and its temperatures are equal to the temperatures of the mid-areas. The pressure <b>loads</b> are <b>of</b> π normal angle region inner pressure load which have an interval of π normal angle, the number <b>of</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> pressure <b>load</b> {{is equal to the}} number of scroll compression chamber pairs. The discharge angle has significant effect on bending fatigue strength of scroll wraps and the stability of scroll compressor...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} produce stable {{delamination}} of thin film multilayer interfaces is {{a powerful tool for}} studying the interfacial adhesion within microsystems. In this study, a technique involving the four-point bending of microbridges was applied to initiate stable interfacial delamination within a multilayer system. Microscale pre notched bridges with clamped-ends were machined into an Al/SiN/GaA. s multilayer using focus ion beam milling. A square flat-end indenter was used to induce bending of the bridge by two contact locations. Bridge failure occurred via substrate fracture at the pre-notch, followed by crack deflection, and stable interfacial delamination of the SiN/GaAs interface. Substrate fracture and delamination were identified within the obtained load-displacement curves as a pop-in and <b>region</b> <b>of</b> linear <b>load</b> reduction respectively.

40|$|Nylon 6 {{filament}} yarn drawn about 300 % washeated at 60 ℃ {{and at the}} heating rate of 	 40 ℃/min under no tension，and was cooled the yarn from that temperature in the furnace. 	Subsequently， the yarn was subjected to the repeated loading and unloading， and obtained 	the corresponding load-elongation graphs. As a consequence， a singularity was found that 	the elastic elongation of the yarn held constant values against the variation <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> in a 	considerably higher <b>region</b> <b>of</b> the applied <b>load.</b> 	The present paper deals with such a singularity of nylon 6 as revealed when the filament 	yarns with different drawn ratios were variously heated and cooled and then treated as above...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that theMathieu {{eigenvalues}} can be straightforwardly utilized {{to study the}} instability <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> an axially <b>loaded</b> simply supported shaft, the shaft being modeled as a continuous rotating beam. When a harmonic axial load is taken into account, the equation of motion of the system, here written according to the Lagrangian formulation of continuous systems, proves to be the Mathieu equation. It follows that the conditions for the stable or unstable motion of the shaft can be graphically investigated once the operation line corresponding to an actual rotating shaft is drawn in the Mathieu ma...|$|R
