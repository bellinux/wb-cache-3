25|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern: mutated {{copies of the}} gene GCDH must be provided by both parents to cause glutaric acidemia type 1. The GCDH gene encodes the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in degrading the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan. Mutations in the GCDH gene prevent production of the enzyme or result {{in the production of}} a defective enzyme with very low <b>residual</b> <b>activity,</b> or an enzyme with relatively high <b>residual</b> <b>activity</b> but still phenotypic consequences. This enzyme deficiency allows glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid and (to a lesser extent) glutaconic acid to build up to abnormal levels, especially at times when the body is under stress. These intermediate breakdown products are particularly prone to affect the basal ganglia, causing many of the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type 1.|$|E

25|$|There are {{no common}} {{mutations}} that cause disease, however 10 - 15% of disease causing mutations are deletions. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females. Females who carry a defective {{copy of the}} gene can be severely affected or asymptomatic, largely depending on the random nature of X-inactivation. There is some degree of genotype - phenotype correlation with OTC deficiency, but this depends {{on a number of}} situations. Individuals with milder mutations, often associated with late onset disease can still present with severe illness when exposed to sufficient metabolic stress. Correlations are more difficult to ascertain in females, since the <b>residual</b> <b>activity</b> of OTC in the liver is impacted not only {{by the nature of the}} mutation, but also by the random pattern of X-inactivation. OTC deficiency is estimated to be the most common urea cycle disorder. An exact incidence is difficult to calculate, due to the varying clinical presentations of later onset forms of the disease. Early estimates of the incidence were as high as 1:14,000 live births, however later studies have decreased these estimates to approximately 1:60,000 - 1:72,000.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Neonatal {{screening}} {{programs for}} very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency {{have been implemented}} recently in various countries. Mildly elevated C 14 : 1 -carnitine on day 3 of life strongly suggests very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. DESIGN: We characterized 11 neonates with elevated C 14 : 1 -carnitine by enzyme and molecular analyses. Palmitoyl-coenzyme A oxidation was measured in lymphocytes. Sequencing of all 20 exons of the VLCAD gene was performed from genomic DNA. RESULTS: Palmitoyl-coenzyme A oxidation revealed significantly decreased <b>residual</b> <b>activities</b> consistent with very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency in 7 neonates. In 2 individuals, <b>residual</b> <b>activities</b> of 48 % and 44 %, respectively, suggested heterozygosity. Two disease-causing mutations were detected in 6 of 7 neonates with very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency; in the remaining 1 patient, only 1 mutation was identified. Of 2 individuals with <b>residual</b> <b>activities</b> consistent with heterozygosity, 1 was heterozygous for a VLCAD mutation. The other child and both individuals with normal palmitoyl-coenzyme A oxidation had normal genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In 4 of 11 neonates identified with elevated C 14 : 1 -carnitine, very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency was excluded. A C 14 : 1 -carnitine level > 1 micromol/L strongly suggests very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, whereas concentrations < or = 1 micromol/L do not allow a clear discrimination among affected patients, carriers, and healthy individuals.

Although onchocerciasis {{is no longer a}} problem of public health importance nor an obstacle to socioeconomic development in the OCP area, the control of this filariasis is not over because OCP never aimed at eradication, neither of the parasite (Onchocerca volvulus), nor of its vector (Simulium damnosum s. l.). In 2003, the eleven Participating countries of OCP will take over the responsibility of carrying out the <b>residual</b> <b>activities</b> of monitoring and the control of this disease. This mission is of great importance because any recrudescence of the transmission could lead in the long run to the reappearance of the clinical signs of onchocerciasis, if not its most serious manifestations.
