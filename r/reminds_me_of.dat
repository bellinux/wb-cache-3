500|$|Harding's vague oratory irritated some; McAdoo {{described}} a typical Harding speech as [...] "an army of pompous phrases moving over {{the landscape in}} search of an idea. Sometimes these meandering words actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly, a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude and over work." [...] H. L. Mencken concurred, [...] "it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a string of wet sponges, it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> tattered washing on the line; it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm... of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh. It is rumble and bumble. It is balder and dash." [...] The New York Times took a more positive view of Harding's speeches, stating that in them the majority of people could find [...] "a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts".|$|E

Her alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, [...] " [...] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill [...] vocal delivery. She kind of <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions." ...|$|E

[...] "When I saw Romper Stomper (1992), I thought Russell was not only charismatic, attractive and talented but also fearless," [...] Stone reasoned. [...] "And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was convinced I wouldn't scare him." [...] Raimi found Crowe to be [...] "bold and challenging. He <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like." [...] On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as [...] "sort of like the fourth Stooge." ...|$|E

[...] They got {{matching}} tattoos of each other's initials; in Wood's case, a [...] "J" [...] on her left ankle. After a year together, the relationship ended in 2006. Wood later commented that, [...] "We had matching tattoos because we knew our love would last forever. Trouble is, it didn't, things happened, we split. But I don't regret the tattoo. It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a great, great period in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Indiana game, Dari Nowkhah {{wrote in}} ESPN's [...] "Heisman Watch" [...] column that Robinson was [...] "running {{away with the}} Heisman Trophy" [...] and {{compared}} him to 1988 Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders:"We haven't seen this type of college football playmaker since ... Barry Sanders? [...] I'm not saying Robinson <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Sanders. (How could a quarterback remind me of a running back?) But there is a shocking resemblance between the diminutive playmakers in their speed, elusiveness and quickness. So is the effect the two have on my {{sense of what is}} right and wrong. Being that dominant on a football field somehow feels wrong. It's unfair." ...|$|E

500|$|Leng views [...] "Who Can See It" [...] as a [...] "new type of ballad" [...] from Harrison, {{one that}} {{combines}} a [...] "dramatic edge" [...] with rhythmic sophistication. The time signature shifts throughout the composition, from 4/4 to 6/4 and 5/8, with brief portions in 5/4 and 3/4. In Leng's description, the melody features [...] "sweepingly large chromatic intervals", {{beginning with the}} verse's third line – a four-semitone swoop that recalls the ascending melismas commonly used in Indian music. Harrison later remarked, {{with reference to the}} boldness of the tune: [...] " [...] <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Roy Orbison for some reason. He could do this good." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured it out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about.

She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ...

His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998. Regarding Kohli's hundred, South Africa bowling coach Allan Donald said, [...] "The one word that comes to my mind is responsibility. I think he [...] showed great discipline and responsibility. It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Sachin Tendulkar when they came here in 1996." [...] The match ended in a draw, and Kohli was awarded man of the match.

In the meantime, the singer also worked with French disc jockey Madeon. This was his first experience collaborating with a vocalist face-to-face. On MTV News he clarified that he had [...] "always wanted to work with pop artists and my #1 on my list was Lady Gaga. So when I had the opportunity to do that, I was really thrilled."

500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Reutimann clinched his second pole position in the Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.344. He was joined on the grid's front row by Jeff Gordon. Matt Kenseth qualified third, Ragan took fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth. Kahne, Tony Stewart, Kyle Busch, Johnson and Joey Logano rounded out the top ten qualifiers. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Scott Speed, Jeremy Mayfield, Todd Bodine and Scott Riggs. After the qualifier Reutimann said, [...] "We had a great car all day, right off the truck. This pole <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> how much things have changed for me in the past few years.

500|$|Stölzl (chosen by Garbage) {{drew up a}} {{treatment}} liked by the band, but MGM and Eon (who commissioned the video) did not consider it [...] "Bond enough". Stölzl's reworked storyboard featured Manson as an android clone who kills her human counterpart, a concept the band also liked. He provided a special-effects company with sketches of the android, and a replica was constructed with aircraft and missile parts, tubing, metal and plastic. The android was combined with Manson in post-production to show its mechanical interior. [...] "It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> The Man Who Knew Too Much. Some of the shots look like Stanley Kubrick", recalled Vig. [...] "For us it was just important that the music video was also a Garbage video." [...] " [...] like a mini-Bond action-packed film, where an android removes evil from the world and sacrifices herself in the process like a kamikaze warrior. That's as close as we'll ever get ," [...] Manson later said.|$|E

While the band was mentioned by name in the season12 episode [...] "Lisa the Tree Hugger", there had not been any conscious attempts to reference the band before [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's". This includes a scene in the season11 episode [...] "Saddlesore Galactica", which shows Duncan the diving horse hanging from a hoist; some Phish fans argued that the scene was a [...] "blatant" [...] reference to the cover of the band's seventh studio album, Hoist. [...] "That was a total coincidence", Jean said. [...] "It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the whole Wizard of Oz/Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon) hook-up. I haven't done it and I'm sure it works, but I just keep thinking that it must be a coincidence.

500|$|... "Race Against Time" [...] was {{released}} on the 12-inch, cassette, and CD versions of the single. [...] The song developed from the band's interest in urban funk, and was described by The Edge as [...] "a kind of Afro-rhythmic piece" [...] and [...] "a study in rhythm." [...] The bass riff in the song, inspired by the bodhrán, was played by The Edge, but stemmed from some of Clayton's unused bass parts. Mullen's drum part was recorded in a single take. The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase [...] "Race against time". Bono said of the song, [...] "It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the desert. The desert is so empty, but it aches with a strange kind of fullness."

500|$|The {{first season}} {{received}} generally mixed to negative reviews. Many critics said {{the series was}} too similar to The Office and its mock documentary style. In particular, several commentators said the naive and well-meaning Leslie Knope character too closely resembled The Office protagonist Michael Scott, the well-intentioned but dimwitted manager of a paper company sales office. Maureen Ryan, television reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, said Parks and Recreation surpassed the Friends spin-off Joey as the [...] "worst example of NBC's tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical." [...] Daniels said of the comparisons between Leslie Knope and Michael Scott, [...] "My sense {{is that if we}} had built 'Parks and Recreation' around a 90-year-old Maasai warrior people would still have said, 'He <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> [...] Michael Scott'. There was just no way to escape it." [...] Poehler acknowledged that there was some validity to the comparisons, but felt that the series overcame them with the production of [...] "Rock Show": [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re {{on the other side of}} that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style." ...|$|E
