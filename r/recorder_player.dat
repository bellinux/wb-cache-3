25|$|There was {{a revival}} of medieval folk rock of sorts in England in the late 1980s. Shave the Monkey from 1988 managed to use British and European folk festivals to support a career that {{continued}} until 2003. The more progressive cult band the Morrigan formed in 1985, but {{they were unable to}} release their first album until 1996. Wider acceptance for these performers had to wait until the 'folk resurgence' of the 1990s. More recently there have been indications of a return to an interest in medieval folk rock among established folk rock musicians. Since 1986 Maddy Prior, formerly of Steeleye Span, has toured and recorded with the acoustic early music group The Carnival Band. Guitarist Richard Thompson joined <b>recorder</b> <b>player</b> Philip Pickett for an album of early music mixed with rock, The Bones of All Men (1998), and has toured with his show 1000 Years of Popular Music (2003) which included thirteenth-century rounds and baroque versions of modern pop songs.|$|E

2500|$|An {{accomplished}} musician, Burgess composed regularly {{throughout his}} life, and once said, [...] "I wish {{people would think}} of me as a musician who writes novels, instead of a novelist who writes music on the side." [...] Several of his pieces were broadcast during his lifetime on BBC Radio. His Symphony No. 3 in C was premiered by the University of Iowa orchestra in Iowa City in 1975. Burgess described his Sinfoni Melayu as an attempt to [...] "combine the musical elements of the country into a synthetic language which called on native drums and xylophones." [...] The structure of [...] (1974) was modelled on Beethoven's Eroica symphony, while Mozart and the Wolf Gang (1991) mirrors the sound and rhythm of Mozartian composition, among other things attempting a fictional representation of Symphony No.40. Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 features prominently in A Clockwork Orange (and in Stanley Kubrick's film version of the novel). Many of his unpublished compositions are listed in This Man and Music. [...] He wrote a good deal of music for recorder as his son played the instrument. [...] Several of his pieces for recorder and piano including the Sonata No. 1, Sonatina and [...] "Tre Pezzetti" [...] have been included on a major CD release from <b>recorder</b> <b>player</b> John Turner and pianist Harvey Davies; the double album also includes related music from 15 other composers and is titled Anthony Burgess – The Man and his Music (Metier records, release September 2013).|$|E
