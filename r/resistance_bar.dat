Probes for the flanking {{regions of the}} T-DNA and transposed DsHPT elements were obtained with the inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR) technique and used in RFLP linkage analyses. The RFLP map location of 11 T-DNAs carrying DsHPT was determined. The T-DNAs are distributed on 7 of the 12 tomato chromosomes. To explore the feasibility of gene tagging strategies in tomato using DsHPT, we examined the genomic distribution of DsHPT receptor sites relative {{to the location of}} two different, but very closely linked, T-DNA insertion sites. After crosses with plants expressing Ac transposase, the hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) marker on the Ds element and the excision markers beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and Basta <b>resistance</b> (<b>BAR)</b> facilitated the identification of plants bearing germinally transposed DsHPT elements.

In tobacco and Arabidopsis, the streptomycin phosphotransferase (SPT) gene reveals somatic excision of the maize transposon Activator (Ac) as green sectors on a white background in cotyledons of seedlings germinated in the presence of streptomycin. Cotyledons of tomato seedlings germinated on streptomycin-containing medium do not bleach, suggesting that a different assay for transposon excision in tomato is desirable. We have tested the use of the spectinomycin resistance (SPEC) gene (aadA) and a Basta <b>resistance</b> (<b>BAR)</b> gene (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, or PAT) for monitoring somatic excision of Ac in tobacco and tomato. Both genetic and molecular studies demonstrate that genotypically variegated individuals that carry clones of cells from which Ac or Ds have excised from either SPEC or BAR genes, can be phenotypically completely resistant to the corresponding antibiotic. This demonstrates that these genes act non-cell-autonomously, in contrast to the SPT gene in tobacco. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed...|$|E

A single T-DNA construct carried a nonautonomous defective Spm (dSpm) element with a phosphinothricin herbicide <b>resistance</b> (<b>BAR)</b> gene, a transposase expression cassette, and a counterselectable gene. This construct was used to select for stable dSpm transpositions. Treatments for both positive (BAR) and negative selection markers were applicable to soil-grown plants, allowing the recovery of new transpositions on a large scale. To date, a total of 48, 000 lines in pools of 50 have been recovered, of which � 80 % result from independent insertion events.

In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for rapid detection of the bar gene in transgenic sugarcane has been developed and evaluated. A set of six primers was designed for LAMP-based amplification of the bar gene. The LAMP reaction conditions were optimized as follows: 5. 25 mM of Mg 2 +, 6 : 1 ratio of inner vs outer primer, and 6. 0 U of Bst DNA polymerase in a reaction volume of 25. 0 μL. The detection limit of the recombinant plasmid 1 Ac 0229 was as low as 10 copies in the developed LAMP, which was ten-fold higher sensitive than that of conventional PCR. In 100 putative transgenic lines, the bar gene was detected in 100 / 100 cases (100 %) by LAMP and 97 / 100 cases (97 %) by conventional PCR, respectively.

In current investigation, we have established factors influencing gene expression including explant ages of cotyledon- (5 days old cotyledon), pre-culture condition (2 days), wounding technique (multi wired with massive wounding technique), Agrobacterium concentration (A 600 nm 0. 8), co-incubation period of explants with Agrobacterium (30 min) and acetosyringone concentration (200 μM) in co-cultivation medium. These factors gave maximized transformation efficiency. The expression of the foreign functional gene in the plant genome was confirmed by histochemical GUS assay activity after 3 days of co-cultivation period.

40|$|The {{effect of}} anti-sense RNA on the {{expression}} of the bialaphos <b>resistance</b> (<b>bar)</b> gene which encodes phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (PAT), was analysed in tobacco. Transient expression studies revealed that an anti-bar RNA with sequence complementarity to the complete bar coding region, inhibits PAT synthesis. To quantify the phenomenon, SR 1 tobacco cells were transformed twice to introduce first a hybrid bar gene with a reporter gene and in a second instance an anti-bar gene. A first cycle transformant and a double transformant derived herefrom in which PAT synthesis was reduced to only 8 %, were studied in detail. The interference of the anti-sense gene with {{the expression of}} the bar gene is manifested at least two levels. First, the bar mRNA steady state level is significantly reduced relative to the parental whereas the transcript level of the reporter gene is unchanged. Comparison of bar mRNA levels in total and single stranded (ss) RNA preparations demonstrated that little if any stably base-pairing bar and anti-bar RNA accumulates. Secondly, a three fold reduction of PAT synthesis per bar mRNA is observed. This supposes that because of unstable interactions with the complementary anti-bar RNA either a substantial part of the bar mRNA detected does not enter the cytoplasm and/or that in the cytoplasm the bar mRNA is less efficiently translated. It is not clear if or how the reduced bar mRNA level is related to such unstable interactions...|$|E

In the present study, we produced Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) -based vectors that are appropriate for gene expression and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in soybean. The genes of interest were inserted into the RNA 2 -encoded polyprotein open reading frame between the movement protein (MP) and the large coat protein (L-CP) coding regions. Additional proteinase cleavage sites were created to flank the foreign protein by duplicating the MP/L-CP cleavage site.

Here, we present a Cre-based targeting strategy in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) of transferred DNA (T-DNA) delivered by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The rationale for effective RMCE is the precise exchange of a genomic and a replacement cassette both flanked by two heterospecific lox sites that are incompatible with each other to prevent unwanted cassette deletion. We designed a strategy in which the coding region of a loxP/lox 5171 -flanked bialaphos <b>resistance</b> (<b>bar)</b> gene is exchanged for a loxP/lox 5171 -flanked T-DNA replacement cassette containing the neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) coding region via loxP/loxP and lox 5171 /lox 5171 directed recombination. The bar gene is driven by the strong 35 S promoter, which is located outside the target cassette. This placement ensures preferential selection of RMCE events and not random integration events by expression of nptII from this same promoter. Using root transformation, during which Cre was provided on a cotransformed T-DNA, 50 kanamycin-resistant calli were selected. Forty-four percent contained a correctly exchanged cassette based on PCR analysis, indicating the stringency of the selection system. This was confirmed for the offspring of five analyzed events by Southern-blot analysis. In four of the five analyzed RMCE events, there were no additional T-DNA insertions or they easily segregated, resulting in high-efficiency single-copy RMCE events.

Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age and pulse pressure were two important determinants of carotid beta stiffness index and BAD. Vegetarianism is not associated with better arterial elasticity. Conclusion: Apparently healthy postmenopausal vegetarians are not significantly better in terms of carotid beta stiffness index, BAC, and BAD, but have significantly decreased BAR than omnivores. Prevention of vitamin B 12 deficiency might be beneficial for cardiovascular health in vegetarians.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Stable {{expression}} of transgenes {{is required for}} commercial uses of genetically engineered trees. To better understand the stability of transgene expression under field conditions, we studied transgene expression and RNA interference (RNAi) -induced transgene suppression in 2, 480 transgenic poplars (460 transgene insertion events) over three years. Stability of expression was assessed based on two reporter genes, green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by a 35 S promoter and the herbicide <b>resistance</b> gene <b>BAR</b> driven by a poplar rbcS promoter. No cases of gene silencing (complete breakdown of expression) were observed for either gene, although physical loss of the transgenes occurred in three events after 80 events had been subject to further organogenesis in tissue culture. Flanking MARs did not significantly elevate transgene expression or stability, but reduced variance in expression among the events. MARs increased the correlation of expression between events for GFP and BAR genes in the same T-DNA. A majority of transformants (85...|$|R
40|$|Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in Ta/CoFeB/MgO {{structures}} are studied by harmonic voltage method. The {{results indicate that}} both Slonczewski-like (HSL) and field-like (HFL) effective field are enhanced by annealing in the film stacks with various Ta thicknesses. Investigation of the crystallographic phase of the Ta layers and <b>resistance</b> of Hall <b>bar</b> devices suggest that annealing may induce a phase transformation in the Ta layers from the α to the β phase, which results in the enhanced HSL of the annealed samples. Current-induced magnetization switching experiments revealed a corresponding decrease of the switching current in the annealed samples because of their enhanced SOTs...|$|R
40|$|Phytochromes are dimeric pigment {{proteins}} with reversible photochromism between red and far-red light-absorbing forms. They are photoreceptors {{that regulate}} {{various aspects of}} plant growth and development and {{have been used for}} biotechnological applications to improve agricultural performance of crops. Miscanthus species have been suggested {{as one of the most}} promising energy crops. In this paper, Arabidopsis phytochrome B (PHYB) gene was introduced into Miscanthus sinensis using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method that we developed recently, with the herbicide <b>resistance</b> gene (<b>BAR)</b> as a selection marker. After putative transgenic plants were selected using the herbicide resistance assay, genomic integration of the transgene was confirmed by genomic PCR and Southern blot analysis, and transgene expression was validated by Northern blot analysis. Compared to nontransformed control plants, transgenic plants overexpressing PHYB showed phenotypes with increased phytochrome B function, which includes increased chlorophyll content, decreased plant height, and delayed flowering. Therefore, these results suggest that Arabidopsis phytochrome B is functional in M. sinensis and provide a method to develop Miscanthus varieties with enhanced agricultural performance using phytochromes...|$|R
