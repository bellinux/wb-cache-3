40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] moments of mode amplitudes at fixed frequency {{as a function of}} separations in mode number, time, and horizontal distance are investigated using mode-based transport equations and Monte Carlo simulation. These second moments are used to study full-field acoustic coherence, including depth separations. Calculations for low-order modes between 50 and 250 Hz are presented using a deep-water Philippine Sea environment. Comparisons between Monte Carlo simulations and transport theory for time and depth coherence at frequencies of 75 and 250 Hz and for ranges up to 500 km show good agreement. The theory is used to examine the accuracy of the adiabatic and quadratic lag approximations, and the range and frequency scaling of coherence. It is found that while temporal coherence has a dominant adiabatic component, horizontal and vertical coherence have more equal contributions from coupling and adiabatic effects. In addition, the quadratic lag approximation is shown to be most accurate at higher frequencies and longer ranges. Last the range and frequency scalings are found {{to be sensitive to the}} functional form of the exponential decay of coherence with lag, but temporal and horizontal coherence show scalings that fall quite close to the well-known inverse frequency and inverse square <b>root</b> <b>range</b> laws.

40|$|Aims Our {{objectives}} were to 1) examine the ecological adaptability of Potentilla acaulis to grassland degradation {{from the perspective}} of root architecture, 2) reveal why it can be a dominant species in extremely degraded grassland and 3) discuss its important roles in vegetation restoration or succession and preventing grassland fromdesertification. Methods We collected relatively complete P. acaulis roots by trenching. The numbers of first vertical roots, length of horizontal root tillering and number of plant tillers were recorded in the field. The root analysis system of WinRHIZO was used to determine total root length, root surface area, total root volume, root average diameter, number of furcations, average branching angle, number of root axes, length of root axes, number of root tips, number of first lateral roots, length of first lateral roots, number of secondary lateral roots, length of secondary lateral roots, root diameters along root length, root surface area and root volume. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis. Important findings In degraded grassland typified by Stipa grandis, the function of P. acaulis became more important in the community and its <b>root</b> <b>range,</b> root depth, the number of first vertical roots, the number of plant tillers and the length of horizontal root tillering increased significantly. The parameters of root surface area, length of secondary lateral roots, total root length and the number of furcations explained the adaptability of P. acaulis to grassland degradation. Roots with a diameter < 2 mm had a significant effect on root surface area and total root length of single plants of P. acaulis. The three-dimensional root architecture of a broad-waist-inverted centrum was an advantageous configuration for P. acaulis to adapt for grassland degradation and can explain P. acaulis as a constructive species in extremely degraded grassland...|$|E

50|$|Root canal anatomy {{consists}} of the pulp chamber and root canals. Both contain the dental pulp.

Sometimes there are more than one root canal per root. Some teeth have a more variable internal anatomy than others. An unusual root canal shape, complex branching (especially the existence of horizontal branches), and multiple root canals are considered as the main causes of root canal treatment failures. (e.g. If a secondary root canal goes unnoticed by the dentist and is not cleaned and sealed, it will remain infected, causing the root canal therapy to fail).|$|R
