This paper focuses {{on the study of}} the effects of the shape of demand distribution <b>on</b> <b>inventories.</b> Results from a simulation show that demand shape plays a key role in the determination of the stock investments. In particular, this paper measures asymmetry of demand distributions and shows its significant impact <b>on</b> <b>inventories.</b> Moreover, it is demonstrated how multi-modality and asymmetry can both have a negative or a positive impact, depending on the type of asymmetry and the target service level the firm is facing...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} - The paper explores and {{describes}} the impact of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy within a production and assembly plant, and proposes a model for assessing {{the impact of the}} technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical investigation, based on case study research, focuses on an RFID implementation at a supplier of injection-moulded, surface-treated plastic to the automotive industry. This implementation {{is one of the few}} item-level, open-loop RFID implementations in the automotive industry. Findings - The empirical study provides insights into how inventory accuracy has been improved and made attainable in practice by implementing RFID, and indicates that the technology ensures inventory inaccuracy will be kept at minimum. As a result, an analytical model is presented which identifies the impact of RFID technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy. Research limitations/implications - The case study and context need to be considered when generalising upon the findings. Furthermore, it is hoped future research could further develop the model presented and test it against implementation practice. Practical implications - RFID technology provides practitioners with the opportunity to eliminate waste, and improve production and assembly performance. The research provides practitioners with experience of, and insights into how a production and assembly plant has improved inventory accuracy by implementing RFID technology. In particular, practitioners are provided with a model which enables them to assess the impact of RFID <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy. Original/value of paper - This paper contributes to the RFID community by providing empirical insights into the impact of RFID technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy, but also more broadly into logistics and operations management research...|$|R
