50|$|After renovations and {{extensions}} in 1896, Wood Street was {{the largest}} Congregational church in South Wales, with 2000 people regularly attending its services. Although the scandal had not been fatal, the church's finances remained delicate until the late 1910s. In , an adjoining building, the <b>Rapers</b> Hotel, was purchased by the Cardiff & District Congregational Board, and was used by Wood Street as a Sunday School. The Big Tent Mission, {{one of the earliest}} Evangelist movements, pitched its camp behind the church in 1923. The two World Wars, combined with the Great Depression, caused the church to fall on leaner times. Temperance Town was demolished in the late 1930s, depriving the church of many of its attendees. The building subsequently fell into a poor condition. In 1964, three young architectural students inspected the run-down building, and discovered that it had several unusual construction quirks: doors that led nowhere, windows which were actually false, and five doors facing onto Havelock Street which had brick walls behind them.|$|R

Thomas and Melanie, who took shelter in the stairwell of an apartment building are found in the morning by three soldiers of the victorious Soviet infantry that assaulted the town. As Thomas tries to overcome one of them with his Hitler Youth knife, two others overpower him. They begin a brutal beating of Thomas but stop when Melanie proposes a bargain: her body in exchange for Thomas' life. After a last sadistic gash on Thomas arm, the soldiers get their [...] "reward". Eventually Thomas, bloodied and in pain from the beating, picks up his knife left on the floor while two of the soldiers exit the building, drunk. He hears Melanie scream and sees the third soldier, drunk, pursuing her up the stairs and firing his pistol at her. Thomas races up to protect her, reaches the drunken soldier and plunges his knife into his chest, killing him. But Melanie is also dead. Alone again, Thomas sits at a roadside on the edge of town amongst rubble and bombed buildings. A tank pulls up next to him and Tanya (Kincso Petho), a young idealistic Commissar, dismounts and sits beside Thomas. Tanya enthusiastically explains that Stalin provides for orphans and invites him to join on her journey back home. Thomas obliges and aboard the tank with Tanya heads towards Russia.|$|R

40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} is ubiquitous in nature. As the engine that drives genetic diversity, sex accelerates adaptation and removes deleterious mutations. As such, it plays {{a central role}} in the origin and success of species. Studies on the major groups within the fungal kingdom have provided significant and wide-ranging contributions on the molecular bases by which sexual identity and reproduction are defined and controlled. Sex in Fungi: Molecular Determination and Evolutionary Implications not only encompasses the current state of knowledge, but also serves as an invaluable resource that will guide new research on these systems and organisms. Since John <b>Raper’s</b> pioneering studies with the basidiomycetes in the 1960 s, and the elegant work of Ira Herskowitz with Saccharomyces, genetic, molecular, and genomic analyses of fungal sexual reproduction have helped to illuminate how sexual cycles function in, as well as drive, evolution. The biological principles involved are profound and can serve as general paradigms for how cell identity is established and maintained, how cells sense and respond to extracellular cues, the role of genetic rearrangements in generating changes in cell identity and fate, and how genomic regions governing sexual identity are organized and evolved. Drawing on the great advances made over the past 10 years, this volume provides illuminating insights into the molecular details of cell-type specification, mating-type switching, pheromone perception and signaling, and cellular and nuclear fusion. The tremendous impact of comparative genomics on the analysis of mating is evident in many of the chapters in this book. This volume includes chapters on both model and pathogenic fungi as well as a section that looks forward to what we hope to learn in other fungal lineages. The book concludes with a selection of chapters on the implications of sex, and studies of experimental evolution, in a broader evolutionary context...|$|R

When Barbara loses el Miedo she is not willing to give it up and comes to an {{arrangement}} with Marisela to buy it. While Marisela and Santos are happy living their romance Barbara finds out that she is two months pregnant. When Santos hears the news he is furious and decides not to believe Barbara and accuses her of having cheated on him but Marisela knows that Barbara would have never done such a thing and believes her and decides to break off their relationship. Santos slowly comes to realize his mistake and accept the baby is his. When word of Barbara's pregnancy gets to [...] "El Sapo" [...] (her worst enemy, one of the <b>rapers)</b> who is now a high ranking and powerful drug trafficker sends his men to burn Barbara's ranch and to kill anyone who is in it, including her. As the hacienda burns Barbara is able to get Eustaquia, her nanny (mother figure) to the basement for safety seeing as {{there is no other way}} out. She then confronts Sapo and his men and starts firing at them from inside the house. Melquiades, Barbara's right hand, is able to get to Marisela and warn her that her mother is in danger and she and Santos get there in time to help her. The day after Barbara starts suffering from abdomen pains and with the help of Juan Primito goes to la Chusmita, place where she abandoned Marisela when she was two, to meet up with Melquiades. There she loses her baby and goes crazy. She forgets everything that happened to her and that she lost her baby. When Marisela finds out she tries taking Barbara to see a doctor but while they are in the city she sees Sapo and reacts badly even though she doesn't remember who he is. Melquiades decides to take her back to el Miedo which is fully restored. She starts remembering everything and is heartbroken, she can't believe that she lost her last chance at happiness and what she considered her salvation. During that whole time Barbara and Marisela managed to become a little close. Santos finds out that she isn't pregnant anymore and gets happy because now there is no obstacle between him and Marisela. Marisela has decided to stay with Gonzalo in order to spy on him after finding out that he and [...] "El Sapo" [...] are allies in drug trafficking. Now, the fear caused by [...] "El Sapo" [...] is bringing Barbara and Marisela back together once more to destroy [...] "El Sapo". Barbara decides to end her war with Sapo once and for all and in order to do so she needs everyone she cares about to be away from her. She makes Marisela believe that she hates her in order to scare her away (which doesn't work) and sends Eustaquia and Juan Primito to live at Danger's house, who is now deceased (killed by Balbino). When Sapo finds out where Eustaquia is staying he decides to pay her a visite and, to get back at Barbara, cuts her veins, when Barbara finds her she is lying on the floor unconscious. Eustaquia dies in her arms but before she tells Barbara that once everything is done she will se everything differently and that at that moment she should go back to the river. After Eustaquias funeral Barbara realises that [...] "Sapo" [...] is watching her and the battle between them starts inside an abandoned church next to the cemetery. During the fight [...] "Sapo" [...] is about to shoot Barbara but Melquiades gets in the way and takes the shot, Barbara runs to him and he professes his love to her and tells her to not let anyone mistreat her physically or emotionally and that if a man doesn't love her like he did that he isn't worth the time, in that moment he dies in Barbara's arms leaving her alone. While her fight with [...] "Sapo" [...] continues Santos arrives making Barbara lose concentration and allowing [...] "Sapo" [...] to capture her. [...] "Sapo" [...] ties both Barbara and Santos but Barbara is able to knock him out with a sleeping dart and unties herself but refuses to untie Santos as she knows he will stop her from doing what she must; kill [...] "Sapo". Once Barbara finishes tying [...] "Sapo" [...] up Santos tries to talk her out of it but she refutes that she owes it to Eustaquia, to Melquiades, to Asdrubal, and to herself, but above it all she owes it to the son she lost because of him. She tells him that he always called her a monster and that now he would really get to see her in action. She then muffles him and continues to wake up [...] "Sapo", she ignores his pleas. When he tells her that she is better than he is and that she can't kill him she responds that she is worse than the devil. She ends everything by setting him on fire. When everything is done she leaves and realizes that even though her vengeance is complete she is not in any more peace as she was before and questions if everything she did was done in vein. The detective who was sent to capture Sapo is now after Barbara but she is able to escape with the help of everyone, Marisela, Santos, etc. as they now understand everything Barbara did and why she did it. Before leaving Barbara demands Santos tell her why he is helping her, she tells him that this is his way of setting everything right since he changed her for her daughter, his way of saving her since he wasn't able to save her soul, he responds that that is not it. She continues to push him until he admits that it's because he loves her, that she is the love he can't have and that he had to get away to save himself from her abyss and that he also loves Marisela because she is his salvation. After finally hearing Santos be completely honest with his feeling to her she leaves.|$|R
