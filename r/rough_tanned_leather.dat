40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the quality of gambier taken from gambier production center in West Sumatra, the characteristic of <b>tanned</b> <b>leather</b> which was <b>tanned</b> by gambier, {{and the relationship between}} gambier quality and <b>tanned</b> <b>leather</b> product. This study was conducted by firstly taking the samples from ten location randomly, secondly analizing some of its characteristics, and later applicating them in <b>leather</b> <b>tanning.</b> The relationship between some gambier parameters with <b>tanned</b> <b>leather</b> was determined by linear regression. The result was finding that the quality was varied among different gambier production centers, comprise of water content, tannin level, cathecin level, ash level and water-insoluble substances. Sixty percent of producton centers had given gambier which was capable to produce leather met the quality requirements. The result also found there were a strong relationship between gambier characteristics and quality of <b>tanned</b> <b>leather,</b> e. g. gambier tannin level and bonded-tannin in <b>tanned</b> <b>leather</b> (r= 0. 980), gambier catechins level and bonded-tannin in <b>tanned</b> <b>leather</b> (r= 0. 967) and gambier ash content and bonded-tannin in <b>tanned</b> <b>leather</b> (r= 0. 852).

The plating was carried out by spraying using spraying-gun one, two, and three times, and repeated three times for each treatment to chrome plated metal, gold plated metal and roasted metal. The smaples were then pinned on a piece of chrome <b>tanning</b> <b>leather</b> and vegetable <b>tanned</b> <b>leather,</b> whereas the test carried out was wet and dry rub fastness. Data from completely randomized design are analyzed by factorial pattern according to Gasperz (1991), showed that there was not significant effect on plating neither metal on chrome and vegetable <b>tanned</b> <b>leather</b> having been stored for one, two, or three months, neither on similar things having not been stored yet.

40|$|Chromium tannage is {{the most}} used {{technology}} in processing of garment leathers. Due to environmental requirements and demands on natural products there is an increasing interest on alternatives to chromium tannage especially on vegetable <b>tanned</b> <b>leathers.</b> Leather properties vary in a very wide range depending on the animal type it is obtained from and the process type and chemicals used in the manufacturing. In this study, the effect of various tanning materials to the sewability of garment leathers was investigated. For this purpose, vegetable, chromium and chromium-vegetable combination <b>tanned</b> garment <b>leathers</b> from the same animal origin were supplied from a garment leather manufacturing factory. Needle penetration force and the sewability values of these leathers were determined by using L&M Sewability Tester. It was found that material properties and sewing properties showed differences regarding to the tanning material used even in same type of raw material. Chromium <b>tanned</b> <b>leathers</b> had sewability values of 13. 4 % horizontal and 14. 2 % vertical which are considered good to fair. Vegetable <b>tanned</b> <b>leathers</b> and chromium-vegetable <b>tanned</b> <b>leathers</b> had sewability values of 38. 2 % horizontal, 49. 2 % vertical and 98 % horizontal, 98. 5 % vertical respectively which are considered poor. The {{results of the study}} conclude that, {{there is a big difference}} in material properties when the tanning technology and material is changed which also affects the sewing properties...|$|R
