After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E

40|$|The {{achievement}} of public sector service delivery objectives {{is crucial to}} citizens, both individually and collectively. While the public depends on local government organisations to deliver mostly essential services (the key services being water, electricity, sewerage, and roads), public sector audit reports, as well numerous and frequently recurring service delivery protests, suggest that local government is failing to achieve its objectives. This study aims to identify the <b>root</b> <b>causes</b> of municipalities’ failure to efficiently and effectively deliver the services they are mandated to deliver. A literature study (academic overview) and a review of key documents (specific reports on local government performance) were conducted to achieve this research objective. The study identified four main themes (<b>root</b> <b>causes)</b> that underlie municipalities’ failure to achieve objectives. These <b>root</b> <b>causes</b> are: inadequate human resources capacity; shortage of skills; unethical organisational culture, and ineffective (or non-existent) performance management systems. Specific <b>root</b> <b>causes</b> and the underlying causative factors linked to these four main themes were also identified. Two allembracing <b>root</b> <b>causes</b> appear to be connected {{with most of the}} identified specific <b>root</b> <b>causes</b> and their underlying factors. These are a lack (or total absence) of leadership commitment, and a management system that is almost completely devoid of consequences for poor performance and wrong-doing.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is a {{critique}} of the <b>root</b> <b>causes</b> approach to migration. More specifically it examines how the approach has been used to formulate policy at a European level and applies a critical appraisal of the <b>root</b> <b>causes</b> approach in general, to this policy, in particular the work of the High Level Working Group on Immigration and Asylum (HLWG). It is argued that a failure to successfully accommodate theories of migration undermines the approach in both theory and practice. A range of theories which could usefully be encompassed within the <b>root</b> <b>causes</b> approach are identified and elucidated. One key area of concern within the <b>root</b> <b>causes</b> approach, rural to urban migration, is examined to provide material for a suggested way forward.

5|$|A {{radiation}} accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing radiation. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of radiation sickness and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear regulatory agency, was notified when doctors came to suspect radiation injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner. Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the radiation source to be the <b>root</b> <b>cause</b> of the accident, which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for radiation injury, three of whom died, {{as well as the}} potentially significant exposure of 1,872 people.|$|E
5|$|He was {{instrumental}} in the decision to purchase the de Havilland Comet, believing the efficiencies and benefits of jet powered military aircraft would be useful if replicated in a civilian environment, and recognising the outdated aircraft the airline would otherwise be left with. The early operation of the de Havilland Comet was characterised by the series of fatal crashes which would result in the resignation of Miles Thomas as chairman in 1955. The <b>root</b> <b>cause</b> was eventually attributed to metal fatigue and no blame was attached to either Smallpeice or indeed to Thomas. Smallpeice would initially retain his position as financial comptroller under the incoming chairman, Gerard d'Erlanger, this would be a temporary arrangement and in 1956 Smallpeice was promoted to the role of chief executive, albeit with the title managing director.|$|E

This {{was the only}} B-1B crash to occur with six crew members aboard. The two crew members in jump seats, {{and one of the}} four crew members in ejection seats perished. The <b>root</b> <b>cause</b> of the accident was thought to be a bird strike on a wing's leading edge during the low-level flight. The impact was severe enough to sever fuel and hydraulic lines {{on one side of the}} aircraft, the other side's engines functioned long enough to allow for ejection. The B-1B fleet was later modified to protect these supply lines.|$|E

5|$|Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham {{say that}} materialist forms of {{feminism}} {{grew out of}} Western Marxist thought and have inspired {{a number of different}} (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the <b>root</b> <b>cause</b> of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the <b>root</b> <b>cause,</b> influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|The umpires {{reported}} Waddington to the cricket {{committee of}} the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals and gestures of displeasure when batsmen were not given out. Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires, finding him guilty of dissent, and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him {{to write a letter}} of apology to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against Surrey, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the <b>root</b> <b>cause</b> of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned {{at the end of the}} season, and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.|$|E

5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the <b>root</b> <b>cause</b> of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E
