5000|$|Journalist {{and author}} <b>Roger</b> <b>Rosenblatt,</b> {{described}} Gray as [...] Spalding the storyteller... Spalding the mystical. Spalding the hilarious. Spalding the self-exposed, the professionally puzzled, the scared, the brave. Spalding the supporting actor. That's {{what he was}} in the movies. But as a writer and a stage performer, he changed the idea of what a supporting actor is. He supported us... He played our part... We tacitly elect a few to be the chief tellers of our tales. Spalding was one of the elected. The specialty of his storytelling was the search for a sorrow that could be alchemized into a myth. He went for the misery sufficiently deep to create a story that makes us laugh... In so doing, he invented a form, a very rare thing among artists. Some called it the 'epic monologue' because first it was spoken and then it was written, like the old epics, and because it consisted of great and important themes drawn from the hero's life...And the one true heroic element in his makeup was the willingness to be open, rapidly open, about his confusions, his frailties." ...|$|E

Dr. <b>Roger</b> <b>Rosenblatt</b> of the University of Washington provided us with data on use of outpatient pulmonary care by Medicare beneficiaries in the state of Washing-ton. Ms. Stephanie Schmid of United HealthCare Corporation also furnished useful measures of outpatient pulmonary visits. Louise Hadden processed the many data files necessary to construct the model. Her skill, speed, and accommodation to constant requests for more rearrangements of the data files were re-markable and most appreciated. Richard Burstein of MIT programmed the simulation model, responding with grace and good humor to continuing requests for new components of the model itself and to the user interface. Dan Sherman, Ph.

40|$|One {{good thing}} {{could come from}} this horror: it could spell {{the end of the}} age of irony, ” Time {{columnist}} <b>Roger</b> <b>Rosenblatt</b> wrote in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001. After two airplanes flew into the World Trade Center, many other pundits also claimed an immediate end to, of all things, irony. A few years prior, the 1990 s saw a flood of books, articles, and concern for the state of civic trust and the rise of citizen cynicism in America. Simultaneously, pop culture was churning out situation comedies, advertisements, and movies drenched in ironic self-awareness, cynicism, and sarcastic knowingness, all of which continue healthily to this day, if not even more intensely. In debates by political pundits, however, cynicism and irony were frequently thrown around as a causes of civic decline; the attitude of ironic disengagement involved a wry, knowing view of the world and a distancing from the moral values of middle-class America. The media and intellectuals were to blame for fomenting this stance. But why were irony and the values of middle-class America so opposed to each other? What relationship does irony have to morality? What is the genesis of this opposition in the American mind? “Inward, Christian Soldiers: Romantic Irony and Civic Trust in the American Mind ” addresse...|$|E
