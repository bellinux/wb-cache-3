5|$|Until 1996, the {{domestic}} situation during Unas' reign {{was thought to}} have been disastrous, based on <b>reliefs</b> from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine. This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar <b>reliefs</b> in the mortuary complex of Sahure, who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty. In addition, research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers, nomads distinguished by their specific hair-style, rather than Egyptians. Thus, these <b>reliefs</b> are now understood to be standard representations of the generosity of the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events.|$|E

It consists of a pyramid with <b>reliefs</b> and statues at the front. Among them is a male statue clutching his penis, with three tortoises with flattened shells. The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5ft) representation of lingga with four testicles; this is now housed in the National Museum of Indonesia.

5|$|Krishna {{is found}} in {{southeast}} Asian history and art, but to a far less extent than Shiva, Durga, Nandi, Agastya, and Buddha. In temples (candi) of the archaeological sites in hilly volcanic Java, Indonesia, temple <b>reliefs</b> do not portray his pastoral life or {{his role as the}} erotic lover, nor do the historic Javanese Hindu texts. Rather, either his childhood or the life as a king and Arjuna's companion have been more favored. The most elaborate temple arts of Krishna are found in a series of Krsnayana <b>reliefs</b> in the Prambanan Hindu temple complex near Yogyakarta. These are dated to the 9thcentury CE. Krishna remained a part of the Javanese cultural and theological fabric through the 14thcentury, as evidenced by the 14th-century Penataran <b>reliefs</b> along with those of the Hindu god Rama in east Java, before Islam replaced Buddhism and Hinduism on the island.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the short- and long-term results of laparoscopic enterolysis {{in patients with}} chronic pelvic pain following hysterectomy. Methods: Forty-eight patients were evaluated at time intervals from 2 weeks to 5 years after laparoscopic enterolysis. Patients {{were asked to rate}} postoperative <b>relief</b> of their pelvic pain as complete/near complete <b>relief</b> (80 - 100 % pain <b>relief),</b> significant <b>relief</b> (50 - 80 % pain <b>relief),</b> or less than 50 % or no pain <b>relief.</b> Results: We found that after 2 to 8 weeks, 39 % of patients reported complete/near complete pain <b>relief,</b> 33 % reported significant pain <b>relief,</b> and 28 % reported less than 50 % or no pain <b>relief.</b> Six months to one year postlaparoscopy, 49 % of patients reported complete/near complete pain <b>relief,</b> 15 % reported significant pain <b>relief,</b> and 36 % reported less than 50 % or no pain <b>relief.</b> Two to five years after laparoscopic enterolysis, 37 % of patients reported complete/near complete pain <b>relief,</b> 30 % reported significant pain <b>relief,</b> and 33 % reported less than 50 % or no pain <b>relief.</b> Some patients required between 1 and 3 subsequent laparoscopic adhesiolysis. A total of 3 enterotomies and 2 cystotomies occurred, all of which were repaired laparoscopically. Conclusion: We conclude that laparoscopic enterolysis may offer significant long-term <b>relief</b> of chronic pelvic pain in some patients...|$|R

Adding <b>relief</b> to the product image seems to be the best choice. Indeed, it enhances brand preference. At the opposite, the <b>relief</b> brand decreases the consumed quantity of product and incites touching competitive smooth media without enhancing brand preference or recall.

5|$|Although Palmyrene art {{was related}} to that of Greece, it had a {{distinctive}} style unique to the middle-Euphrates region. Palmyrene art is well represented by the bust <b>reliefs</b> which seal the openings of its burial chambers. The <b>reliefs</b> emphasized clothing, jewelry and a frontal representation of the person depicted, characteristics which {{can be seen as}} a forerunner of Byzantine art. According to Michael Rostovtzeff, Palmyra's art was influenced by Parthian art. However, the origin of frontality that characterized Palmyrene and Parthian arts is a controversial issue; while Parthian origin has been suggested (by Daniel Schlumberger), Michael Avi-Yonah contends that it was a local Syrian tradition that influenced Parthian art. Little painting, and none of the bronze statues of prominent citizens (which stood on brackets on the main columns of the Great Colonnade), have survived. A damaged frieze and other sculptures from the Temple of Bel, many removed to museums in Syria and abroad, suggest the city's public monumental sculpture.|$|E

Another relief depicts a military campaign, Egyptians armed with bows and daggers attacking Canaanite nomads called the Shasu. Similar <b>reliefs</b> have been found in preceding pyramid complexes, such as that of Sahure, and they may thus be standard themes rather than depictions of actual events.

The objective of the thesis is to summarize the system, possibilities and forms of funding of <b>relief</b> services for handicapped children in the Liberec Region. Within my research, I applied the combination of semi-controlled interviews with the <b>relief</b> service providers and semi-controlled interviews with handicapped childrens parents. I also performed content analysis of documents. The semi-controlled interviews with the <b>relief</b> service providers showed that {{the current status of}} funding of the organizations providing <b>relief</b> services is not systematic. The results of the semi-controlled interviews with handicapped childrens parents indicate that the parents taking care of handicapped children in the Liberec Region barely use <b>relief</b> services. The interviewed parents do not distinguish between <b>relief</b> services and the other types of social services, do not know the organizations providing <b>relief</b> services in the Liberec Region and do not have even a vague idea of service costs. The research results lead to three hypotheses: the <b>relief</b> service providers in the Liberec Region must learn to utilize strategically both domestic and foreign financial resources. The <b>relief</b> service providers in the Liberec Region have the opportunity to start a long-term cooperation with corporate and individual sponsors.
