However, relatively little is known about self-antigens on other types of normal cells, their relation to the development of autoimmune disease, and their possible coexistence as potential tumor rejection antigens on associated tumors. In the current study, we induced inflammatory killing of normal prostate tissue in situ using a fusogenic membrane glycoprotein along with the immune adjuvant hsp 70. We show here that, in the prostate, hsp 70 induces interleukin (IL) - 6, which triggers a CD 4 - and CD 8 -dependent progressive autoimmune reactivity, associated with IL- 17 expression. This autoimmune response was also able to induce the rejection of established prostate tumors, but not other histologic types of tumors, growing elsewhere in the animal.

5000|$|In metazoans, {{defense against}} {{disruption}} of the multicellular life style by such cheaters takes two major forms. First, a consistent feature of the multicellular life cycle is the interposition of a unicellular phase, even among organisms whose major mode of propagation may be via many-celled vegetative propagules. This unicellular phase usually {{takes the form of}} a sexually produced zygote. Passage through a unicellular bottleneck assures that each representative of the next generation of organisms represents a distinct clone. Some offspring will carry a large number of deleterious mutations and will die off, while other offspring will carry few. In this manner, the organism bypasses [...] "Muller's ratchet," [...] the process by which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate deleterious mutations in an irreversible manner. The second defense against cheaters is the development of allorecognition mechanisms that guard against invasion by parasitic replicators. Allorecognition acts as an agent of kin selection by restricting fusion and community acceptance to related individuals. If related individuals fuse, the benefits of fusion will still apply, while the costs of competition for shared resources or reproductive opportunities will be reduced by a fraction proportional to the degree of relatedness between the fusing partners. If unrelated individuals fuse, or if a mutated cell arises within an organism that is distinguishable from self by the allorecognition system, a <b>rejection</b> <b>response</b> will be activated. As a general rule, rejection is mediated by the gene products of highly variable loci, which must match (or nearly match) between organisms for fusion to be successful.|$|E

40|$|Infection with Haemonchus contortus is {{a serious}} disease of livestock, {{particularly}} sheep in both Australia and around the world, and results in production loss and quite often death. However the interaction between H. contortus and the host remains poorly understood. To develop better protection and prevention strategies, further understanding of the host-parasite relationship is required. In this thesis the host response to H. contortus infection was examined with particular focus on immunological mechanisms by which resistant sheep can reject or kill incoming larvae. Contrasting resistance mechanisms were identified based on cellular and molecular profiles in the abomasal mucosa after differing H. contortus immunisation protocols. The data {{suggest that there are}} at least two different immune-based mechanisms utilised by the host to reject or kill incoming larvae. Depending on the immunisation protocol, resistant sheep could mount either a delayed <b>rejection</b> <b>response</b> likely based on mucosal eosinophils, or a rapid <b>rejection</b> <b>response</b> based on mucosal mast cells and globule leucocytes. The delayed <b>rejection</b> <b>response</b> showed a clear type II immune bias with mucosal upregulation of interleukin (IL) - 4, 5, 13 and galectin- 15 mRNA and protein following larval challenge. In contrast, sheep able to rapidly reject H. contortus larvae showed a marked abomasal mucosal mast cell, globule leucocyte and intraepithelial lymphocyte hyperplasia. This was confirmed by an ex vivo tissue explant model showing that resistant sheep with abomasal mucosal mast cell/ globule leucocyte hyperplasia could reject larvae using an immediate hypersensitivity mechanism. Characterisation of intraepithelial lymphocytes in resistant sheep also suggests that these cells may play an important role in the rapid <b>rejection</b> <b>response.</b> In conclusion, this thesis has examined different aspects of H. contortus larval rejection in sheep after hyperimmunisation and has shown some promising results that strongly suggest {{there are at least two}} different immunological mechanisms of H. contortus rejection. The foundations of both an in vivo and ex vivo model of H. contortus infection for use in further research on multiple mechanisms of host resistance to H. contortus have been established, and will provide valuable tools for investigation of these complex areas in both an experimental and field setting...|$|E

So far, however, no study has examined the role of egg arrangement within a clutch on host <b>rejection</b> <b>responses.</b> We predicted that individual females which maintain consistent egg arrangements within their clutch would {{be better able to}} detect and reject foreign eggs than females without a consistent egg arrangement (i. e. whose eggs change positions more often across incubation). We tested this "egg arrangement hypothesis" in blackbirds (Turdus merula) and song thrush (T. philomelos). Both species are suitable candidates for research on egg rejection, because they show high inter-individual variation and individual repeatability in egg <b>rejection</b> <b>responses.</b> As predicted, using our custom-defined metrics of egg arrangement, rejecter females' clutches showed significantly more consistent patterns in egg arrangement than acceptor females' clutches. Only parameters related to blunt pole showed consistent differences between rejecters and acceptors. This finding makes biological sense because it is already known that song thrush use blunt pole cues to reject foreign eggs. We propose that a disturbance of the original egg arrangement pattern by the laying parasite may alert host females that maintain a consistent egg arrangement to the risk of having been parasitized. Once alerted, these hosts may shift their discrimination thresholds to be more restrictive so as to reject a foreign egg with higher probability. Future studies will benefit from experimentally testing whether these two and other parasitized rejecter host species may rely on the use of consistent egg arrangements as a component of their anti-parasitic defence mechanisms.

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that are genetically modified to express CD 19 - or CD 20 -specific, single-chain antibody–derived chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) display HLA-independent antigen-specific recognition/killing of lymphoma targets. Here, we describe our initial experience in applying CAR-redirected autologous CTL adoptive therapy to patients with recurrent lymphoma. Using plasmid vector electrotransfer/drug selection systems, cloned and polyclonal CAR+ CTLs were generated from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells and expanded in vitro to cell numbers sufficient for clinical use. In 2 FDA-authorized trials, patients with recurrent diffuse large cell lymphoma were treated with cloned CD 8 + CTLs expressing a CD 20 -specific CAR (along with NeoR) after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and patients with refractory follicular lymphoma were treated with polyclonal T cell preparations expressing a CD 19 -specific CAR (along with HyTK, a fusion of hygromycin resistance and HSV- 1 thymidine kinase suicide genes) and low-dose s. c. recombinant human interleukin- 2.

Fos data are minimal for the mouse, a species of increasing importance, due to its use in molecular and transgenic studies and taste-evoked oromotor responses are also only incompletely described in these rodents. We investigated these questions in FVB/NJ mice and a related transgenic strain (FVB-Tg(GadGFP) 4507) that expresses green fluorescent protein in a subset of GAD 1 -containing neurons. QHCl, sucrose, or water delivered through intraoral cannulae yielded behavioral profiles that clearly differentiated QHCl from sucrose. Similar to rat, the number of neurons expressing FLI in the medial third of the solitary nucleus was elevated following QHCl compared with the other stimuli. In mice expressing green fluorescent protein, there was a pronounced distribution of GABAergic neurons in the ventral half of the solitary nucleus. Approximately 15 % of solitary neurons expressing Fos were GABAergic, but this proportion did not differ according to stimulus. Key words: brainstem, GABA, anatomy, double labe...|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} studies we {{have demonstrated that}} human normal pancreata were populated by interstitial mononuclear cells constituted by dendritic cells (70 %), macrophages (30 %) and few B cells (less than 1 %). Furthermore, the endocrine parenchyma and the centroacinar cells appeared negative {{for the detection of}} HLA-A,B,C molecules. In the present report, 15 pancreata from cadaver donors were studied by means of immunohistochemical methods. 5 out of 15 organs were found to contain a larger amount of interstitial hematic cells that were constituted mainly by macrophages and B cells, together with a small percentage of granulocytes and T cells. In such "infiltrated" pancreata both endocrine parenchyma and centroacinar cells displayed a positivity for HLA-A,B,C antigens. As HLA-class I antigens have importance in allo-recognition and <b>rejection</b> <b>responses,</b> our data suggest that pre-transplant biopsies may be useful for a better evaluation of the pancreatic tissue immunogenicity...|$|R
