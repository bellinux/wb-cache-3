The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E

All the white <b>rot</b> <b>fungi</b> tested exhibited degradation of phorbol ester during fermentation of JSC without adversely influencing the nutritional properties of the seedcake. Ganoderma lucidum and Trametes zonata were found to degrade phorbol ester in JSC to undetectable levels.

40|$|Specimens {{of birch}} sapwood were decayed {{according}} to the soil jar method. Twelve different fungi commonly found in birch wood were used as test organisms. Every week after the inoculation, the moisture content, the weight loss and the impact bending strength were investigated. Samples with the same incubation time were ground up, and their solubility in 1 % NaOH was calculated. During the course of decay, the moisture content increased more rapidly in samples decayed by brown <b>rot</b> <b>fungi</b> than in samples decayed by white <b>rot</b> <b>fungi.</b> After an incubation time of seven days when, in many cases, the weight loss was negligible, there was already a substantial loss in strength. For high weight losses, the samples decayed by brown <b>rot</b> <b>fungi</b> had lost more of their strength than those decayed by white <b>rot</b> <b>fungi.</b> For low weight losses, however, {{there seemed to be}} little difference in the reduction in strength between samples decayed by white <b>rot</b> <b>fungi</b> and samples decayed by brown <b>rot</b> <b>fungi.</b> The alkali solubility of the samples decayed by brown <b>rot</b> <b>fungi</b> increased steeply during the course of decay, unlike that of the samples decayed by white <b>rot</b> <b>fungi,</b> the solubility of which increased only slightly.

Laccase activity was improved by co-culturing 2 strains of white <b>rot</b> <b>fungi.</b> Combining strain 55 (Trametes trogii) and strain m- 6 (Trametes versicolor) resulted in laccase activity that was many times greater than strain 55 alone and strain m- 6 alone. The observation that laccase activity was 7 times higher after adding strain m- 6 to strain 55 as compared to the activity after adding strain 55 to strain m- 6 suggested that in liquid culture, strain m- 6 was found to be more responsible for the increase of laccase activity after combination. The enzyme-producing conditions of combined strain 55 and m- 6 were found to be optimal at pH 6. 5 and C/N 16 : 1 using 0. 01 % of Tween 80.

40|$|Basidiomycetes {{that cause}} brown rot of wood are {{essential}} biomass recyclers in coniferous forest ecosystems {{and a major}} cause of failure in wooden structures. Recent work indicates that distinct lineages of brown <b>rot</b> <b>fungi</b> have arisen independently from ligninolytic white rot ancestors via loss of lignocellulolytic enzymes. Brown rot thus proceeds without significant lignin removal, apparently beginning instead with oxidative attack on wood polymers by Fenton reagent produced when fungal hydroquinones or catechols reduce Fe 3 � in colonized wood. Since {{there is little evidence that}} white <b>rot</b> <b>fungi</b> produce these metabolites, one question is the extent to which independent lineages of brown <b>rot</b> <b>fungi</b> may have evolved different Fe 3 � reductants. Recently, the catechol variegatic acid was proposed to drive Fenton chemistry in Serpula lacrymans, a brown rot member of the Boletales (D. C. Eastwood et al., Science 333 : 762 - 765, 2011). We found no variegatic acid in wood undergoing decay by S. lacrymans. We found also that variegatic acid failed to reduce in vitro the Fe 3 � oxalate chelates that predominate in brown-rotting wood and that it did not drive Fenton chemistry in vitro under physiological conditions. Instead, the decaying wood contained physiologically significant levels of 2, 5 -dimethoxyhydroquinone, a reductant with a demonstrated biodegradative role when wood is attacked by certain brown <b>rot</b> <b>fungi</b> in two other divergent lineages, the Gloeophyllales and Polyporales. Our results suggest that the pathway for 2, 5 -dimethoxyhydroquinone biosynthesis may have been present in ancestral white rot basidiomycetes but do not rule out the possibility that it appeared multiple times via convergent evolution.
