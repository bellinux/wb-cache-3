40|$|Experimental {{research}} {{is carried out}} to reveal the static frictional behaviors of <b>rubber</b> <b>pipe</b> contact systems. This {{research is}} motivated by deep water pipe-laying operations where rubber blocks are used to clamp the pipe to supply sufficient static friction. Within this context, a friction testing instrument {{has been designed to}} mimic a situation of the beginning of the pipe-laying installation. Using this instrument, the maximum static friction forces (F) of a <b>rubber</b> <b>pipe</b> contact system are tested. The results show that the ultimate values of the static frictions fluctuate due to the increasing rate of the tangential load (FT). The evolution of contact between rubber and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) pipe is observed to identify the formation and propagation of the folds within the apparent contact area. In addition, it is confirmed that the evolution of contact is influenced by the folds and creep of the rubber surface. The creep deformation takes primary effect in accelerating the separation of the interfaces of contact during relative high normal loads (20, 30, 40 N) and low increasing rate of FT; whereas for all of the testing normal loads (10 – 40 N), the propagation of the folds release the energy which is stored in the interface of rubber when the increasing rate of FT is high. Therefore, the fluctuation of the maximum static friction of the contact system can be regarded as a consequence of interaction of the creep and folds. Furthermore, the instability of the coefficient of static friction in this test has been examined, and it indicated that the creep and folds could affect the static friction distinctly within a certain range of a normal load. This research is beneficial for arranging appropriate normal loads and laying speeds to avoid pipes slipping during a pipe-laying operation...|$|E
50|$|In {{areas where}} {{freezing}} is a possibility, freeze-tolerance (the capability to freeze repeatedly without cracking) {{can be achieved}} by the use of flexible polymers. Silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>pipes</b> have been used for this purpose in UK since 1999. Conventional metal collectors are vulnerable to damage from freezing, so if they are water filled they must be carefully plumbed so they completely drain using gravity before freezing is expected, so that they do not crack. Many metal collectors are installed as part of a sealed heat exchanger system. Rather than having potable water flow directly through the collectors, a mixture of water and antifreeze such as propylene glycol is used. A heat exchange fluid protects against freeze damage down to a locally determined risk temperature that depends on the proportion of propylene glycol in the mixture. The use of glycol lowers the water's heat carrying capacity marginally, while the addition of an extra heat exchanger may lower system performance at low light levels.|$|R

40|$|Solar heating {{is one of}} the {{important}} utilities of solar energy both in domestic and industrial sectors. Evacuated tube heaters are a commonly used technology for domestic water heating. However, increasing cost of copper and nickel has resulted in huge initial cost for these types of heaters. Utilizing solar energy more economically for domestic use requires new concept which has low initial and operating costs together with ease of maintainability. As domestic heating requires only nominal heating temperature to the range of 60 – 90 °C, therefore replacing nickel coated copper pipes with any cheap alternate can drastically reduce the cost of solar heater. We have proposed a new concept which utilizes double slope triangular chamber with EPDM based synthetic <b>rubber</b> <b>pipes.</b> This has reduced the initial and operating costs substantially. A detailed analytical study was carried out to design a novel solar heater. On the basis of analytical design, a prototype was manufactured. Results obtained from the experiments were found to be in good agreement with the analytical study. A maximum error of 10 % was recorded at noon. However, results show that error is less than 5 % in early and late hours...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} detect {{distributed}} ground surface deformation, an elastic helical structure Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensing cable {{is shown in}} this paper. This special sensing cable consists of three parts: a silicone rubber rope in the center; a couple of parallel wires coiling around the rope; a silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>pipe</b> covering the sensing cable. By analyzing {{the relationship between the}} impedance and the structure of the sensing cable, the impedance model shows that the sensing cable impedance will increase when the cable is stretched. This specific characteristic is verified in the cable stretching experiment which is the base of TDR sensing technology. The TDR experiment shows that a positive reflected signal is created at the stretching deformation point on the sensing cable. The results show that the deformation section length and the stretching elongation will both affect the amplitude of the reflected signal. Finally, the deformation locating experiments show that the sensing cable can accurately detect the deformation point position on the sensing cable...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{impression}} technique is to overcome the problem associated with restricted mouth opening in association with high arched palate by employing pneumatic impression technique using latex balloon. Methods: A stock tray was modified with auto polymerizing acrylic resin. On the modified tray, a latex balloon was attached with aid of cyanoacrylate. The outlet of the balloon was then connected to a clinical sphygmomanometer bulb with the <b>rubber</b> <b>pipe</b> for air passage which would aid in inflating the balloon. The prepared tray assembly was then equipped for recording the impression. An adequate amount of addition polysiloxane impression material, sufficient to cover the entire area of the balloon was loaded onto the tray. The balloon was then inflated {{with the help of}} a sphygmomanometer bulb which transferred the air only in one direction. On completion of setting time of the impression material, the air pressure was relieved by deflating of balloon which helped in the easy removal of the impression. The impression was subsequently removed from the oral cavity and disinfected. Conclusion: This novel technique was helpful for recording impression in patients presenting with restricted mouth opening and high arched palate...|$|E
40|$|Three indoor, sheeted bag-stack fumigations of {{paddy rice}} using {{aluminium}} phosphide were undertaken in Guangdong Province, southern China. We measured {{the effect of}} two types of sheeting (polyvinylchloride [PVC] or polyethylene [PE]) and two types of floor sealing (clips or fixing into a slot with a <b>rubber</b> <b>pipe)</b> on phosphine concentration and retention. The aim was to test the feasibility of retaining fumigant at a sufficient concentration for long enough to control known resistant insect pests. Each stack was pressure tested and phosphine concentrations measured daily during the fumigation. Cages of test insects in culture medium, including resistant and susceptible strains, were placed inside each stack and could be observed through the clear sheeting. Highest concentrations for the longest period were obtained in a PVC-covered stack that included a ground sheet and wall sheets sealed {{to the floor with}} rubber pipes. A similar PVC-covered stack sealed to the floor with clips instead of pipe did not retain gas as efficiently and required re-dosing. A PE-covered stack, with no ground sheet but also with wall sheets sealed to the floor with pipe, produced an acceptable fumigation. Susceptible Rhyzopertha dominica were controlled in 2 days and the most resistant strain in 15 days. Resistant Cryptolestes ferrugineus survived until day 21. The paddy was still free of insect infestation 7 months later when the bag-stack was opened to mill the rice. Pressure half-lives correlated with gas concentration and retention. Sorption appeared to be a major limiting factor, reducing potential fumigant dosage by about 50 %. The trials demonstrated the feasibility of sealing bag-stacks to a standard high enough to control all known resistant strains...|$|E

The patient owned a rabbit and, before the onset of the disease, repaired some <b>rubber</b> <b>pipes</b> damaged by rodents. At admission, he had a severe clinical picture with fever, hypotension, jaundice, immobility, and pain in leg muscles. Treatment with ceftriaxone was initiated in combination with volume restitution. Renal failure soon ensued. Consequently continuous venovenous hemodiaphiltration therapy was performed. Due to acute respiratory distress syndrome, the patient was mechanically ventilated. The patient’s condition gradually improved and he recovered fully from multi-organ failure. Diagnosis was confirmed by a microscopic agglutination test (MAT) covering 15 leptospira serovars and real-time polymerase-chain reaction (PCR). The first serum sample taken on day 6 tested negative for leptospira, while PCR showed positive results for leptospiral DNA. The second serum sample taken on day 13 tested positive for serovar Canicola serogroup Canicola, serovar Patoc, serovar Grippotyphosa serogroup Grippotyphosa and serovar Tarassovi serogroup Tarassovi (titre 4000, 4000, 1000 and 2000, respectively), while PCR was negative.
