40|$|In several countries, <b>regional</b> <b>surveys</b> {{are carried}} out to detect the {{presence}} of pests and diseases in crops. During these surveys, the incidence of major diseases {{and the presence of}} pests are recorded on various dates during the growing season. In this study, we aim to develop a framework to make better use of these <b>regional</b> <b>surveys</b> to estimate pest and disease dynamics, to analyse their variability across sites and years, and to assess uncertainty. Our framework is illustrated in four case studies: Septoria leaf blotch on wheat, downy mildew on grapevine, yellow sigatoka on banana and weevils on sweet potato. We showed that frequentist and Bayesian generalised linear mixed models gave similar results. This type of models is flexible enough to handle different types of data. They can be used to estimate disease and pest dynamics from observations collected in <b>regional</b> <b>surveys</b> and could help regional extension services evaluate risk levels at the regional scale...|$|R

25|$|A 2012 study, did a <b>regional</b> <b>survey</b> on farmers {{suicide in}} rural Vidarbha (Maharashtra) and applied a Smith's Saliency method to qualitatively rank the {{expressed}} causes among farming families {{who had lost}} someone to suicide. The expressed reasons in order of importance behind farmer suicides were – debt, alcohol addiction, environment, low produce prices, stress and family responsibilities, apathy, poor irrigation, increased cost of cultivation, private money lenders, use of chemical fertilizers and crop failure. In other words, debt to stress and family responsibilities were rated as significantly higher than fertilizers and crop failure. In a different study in the same region in 2006, indebtedness (87%) and deterioration in the economic status (74%) {{were found to be}} major risk factors for suicide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Rainfall-runoff {{models with}} {{only a small number}} of {{parameters}} and modest data needs are useful for assisting with <b>regional</b> <b>surveys</b> and the management of water resources. This paper makes a preliminary assessment of the suitability of a unit hydrograph-based modelling methodology for application to small and medium-sized rivers in south-east Europe. Hydrometeorological data (rainfall, streamflow and air temperature) for four catchments in Bulgaria having contrasting flow regimes are analyzed. Using a previously published model for a catchment in Wales as a reference point, the potential of the unit hydrograph approach for assisting with <b>regional</b> <b>surveys</b> and water resources management in Bulgaria is discussed. In principle, dominant quick and slow flow components of streamflow can be quantified in terms of their characteristic response decay times and relative mean volumetric contributions to streamflow. The paper discusses some aspects of uncertainty in the quick and slow response unit hydrographs. It is suggested that further research is required to establish the structure of a loss module (which precedes the unit hydrograph module) that better represents the hydroclimatological conditions in Bulgaria where, for many catchments, snow is an important component of the annual water balance...|$|R
