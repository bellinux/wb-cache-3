60|$|No sooner did {{the ship}} arrive, but I rewarded my {{faithful}} Captain, by returning him the hundred moidores, {{and not only}} forgiving him all he owed me, I allowed him yearly a hundred more, and fifty to his son, during their lives. And now being resolved to go to England, I <b>returned</b> <b>letters</b> of thanks to the Prior of St. Augustine, and in particular to my old partner, with very suitable presents. By the Captain's advice, I was persuaded to go by land to Calais, and there take passage for England: when, as it happened, I got a young English gentleman, a merchant's son at Lisbon, to accompany me, together with two English, and two Portuguese gentleman: so that with a Portuguese servant, an English sailor, and my man Friday, there were nine of us in number.|$|E
60|$|If {{any doubt}} could exist {{that it was}} Pope who put forth the {{collection}} of 1735, and the Swift collection of 1741, we have still in the quarto of 1737 his own avowed version of {{a large portion of}} his correspondence. He published it with the express object of correcting the corrupt text of spurious editions, and there remains the inquiry whether he published it truly. When he burnt three-fourths of it, and deposited copies of the rest in the library of Lord Oxford, he professed to have preserved the originals from which the copies were taken. Lord Bolingbroke discovered a great number of <b>returned</b> <b>letters</b> among his papers after his death, and told Dr. Heberden that they contained many alterations and corrections, which he supposed had been made with the intention of printing them some time or other.[163] From this it would be inferred that those which had been printed were not part of the collection, and that the poet had found it inexpedient to retain vouchers, which would condemn if they did not acquit him. Unfortunately the whole of the manuscripts were destroyed by Lord Bolingbroke, and beyond the unsatisfactory information conveyed in his remark, nothing can now be known of them. The literal interpretation of his language is favoured by the evidence yet within our reach, and we should conclude that Pope had not kept originals which would have revealed alterations in the published letters of a far more serious nature than any which Bolingbroke appears to have suspected.|$|E
50|$|He excitedly {{shares his}} plans {{for the two of them}} to run off {{together}} and finally be a couple. When Edward tells him something that devastates Peter. He attempts to call Edward back but goes straight to voicemail. We assume Edward tells Peter that they can not be together and that he no longer wants to hear from him. Peter's disappointment is overwhelming. He retrieves his packed suitcase from the trunk of his car, putting his clothes back in the closet and toiletries back in the bathroom. He cleans up the mess from his tantrum the night before, the wasted marinade and the contents of the refrigerator. Then sits to type a letter of apology and suicide to Edward. Peter retrieves a shoebox filled with <b>returned</b> <b>letters</b> written to Edward by Peter returned unopened. He gets all the medications from the bathroom and washes them down with a glass of brown liquor, then goes out to the car where he has taped a hose to the tailpipe and turns on the engine for the car to fill with gas. Unable to keep the pills down he throws them up and appears to decide not to commit suicide after all and turns the engine off.|$|E

40|$|Summary. -A {{study using}} 1800 "lost letters " was {{designed}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that returned responses would be greater in smaller rural communities (population M= 964) than in a city (population = 60, 591) or the suburbs (population = 195, 847) unless the addressee was aff'iated with a pro-abortion group. Returns to control, Committee For Free Abortion, and committee Against Free Abortion aff'iates were 37. 2 %, 24. 0 %, 29. 3 %, respectively. From the city, the number of <b>returned</b> <b>letters</b> was much larger than the number from the suburbs except for those letters with an affilia-tion to the pro-abortion condition. <b>Returned</b> <b>letters</b> from the citv were fewer than those from smaller rural communities exceot those letters aKiated with che oro-abor-tion group. More letters affhated with the pro-abortion condition were returned from the suburbs than from the smaller rural communities. The geographic condition influ-enced over-all rates of return. Rates were higher when letters were addressed to a city P. O. Box than to a rural one. Second, rates were also greater in smaller rural commu-nities for letters bearing "in-town " (Molino) and "out-of-town " (Pensacola) addresses than those from the city bearing an "out-of-town " (Molino) address.

40|$|Age-sex {{registers}} {{were compiled}} and updated {{for the east}} London general practices participating in a screening study for hypertension. Of 1435 addresses in the registers of two practices that were checked, 228 (16 %) were incorrect, according to the return by the post office of the screening invitations and checking the addresses of the non-responders using telephone directories and the medical records. The non-responders to the screening invitation for whom a new address was not found, were visited at the address as recorded on the age-sex register. This showed that the true address error rate from the original age-sex registers was 26 % and thus substantially greater than that calculated from <b>returned</b> <b>letters.</b> It is concluded that the non-acceptance rate of screening in general practice might be exaggerated {{as a result of}} the lack of a correct address for a substantial proportion of the patients on a general practice list...|$|E
40|$|Altruism toward strangers is {{considered}} {{a defining feature of}} humans. However, manifestation of this behaviour is contingent on the costliness of the selfless act. The extent of altruistic tendencies also varies cross-culturally, being more common in societies with higher levels of market integration. However, the existence of local variation in selfless behaviour within populations has received relatively little empirical attention. Using a ‘lost letter’ design, we dropped 300 letters (half of them stamped, half of them unstamped) in 15 residential suburbs of the greater Perth area that differ markedly in socioeconomic status. The number of <b>returned</b> <b>letters</b> was used as evidence of altruistic behaviour. Costliness was assessed by comparing return rates for stamped vs. unstamped letters. We predicted that there is a positive association between suburb socioeconomic status and number of letters returned and that altruistic acts decrease in frequency when costs increase, even minimally. Both predictions were solidly supported and demonstrate that socioeconomic deprivation and elevated performance costs independently impinge on the universality of altruistic behaviour in humans...|$|E
