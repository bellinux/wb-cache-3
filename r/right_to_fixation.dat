40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} claimed that a precise split at the {{vertical}} midline of each fovea causes all words {{to the left and}} <b>right</b> of <b>fixation</b> <b>to</b> project to the opposite, contralateral hemisphere, and this division in hemispheric processing has considerable consequences for foveal word recognition. However, research in this area is dominated by the use of stimuli from Latinate languages, which may induce specific effects on performance. Consequently, we report two experiments using stimuli from a fundamentally different, non-Latinate language (Arabic) that offers an alternative way of revealing effects of split-foveal processing, if they exist. Methods and Findings: Words (and pseudowords) were presented to the left or right of <b>fixation,</b> either close <b>to</b> <b>fixation</b> and entirely within foveal vision, or further from fixation and entirely within extrafoveal vision. Fixation location and stimulus presentations were carefully controlled using an eye-tracker linked to a fixation-contingent display. To assess word recognition, Experiment 1 used the Reicher-Wheeler task and Experiment 2 used the lexical decision task. Results: Performance in both experiments indicated a functional division in hemispheric processing for words in extrafoveal locations (in recognition accuracy in Experiment 1 and in reaction times and error rates in Experiment 2) but no such division for words in foveal locations. Conclusions: These findings from a non-Latinate language provide new evidence that although a functional division i...|$|R
40|$|Switching between tasks {{is assumed}} to be {{accompanied}} by inhibiting currently irrelevant, but competing tasks. A dominant task that strongly interferes with performing a weaker task may receive especially strong inhibition. We tested this prediction by letting participants switch among three tasks that differ in dominance: a location discrimination task with strong stimulus-response bindings (responding with left-hand and right-hand button presses to stimuli presented left or <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the <b>fixation</b> cross) was combined with a color/pattern and a shape discrimination task, for which stimulus-response mappings were arbitrary (e. g., left-hand button press mapped to a red stimulus). Across three experiments, the dominance of the location task was documented by faster and more accurate responses than in the other tasks. This even held for incompatible stimulus-response mappings (i. e., right-hand response to a left-presented stimulus and vice versa), indicating that set-level compatibility (i. e., "dimension overlap") was sufficient for making this location task dominant. As a behavioral marker for backward inhibition, we utilized n- 2 repetition costs that are defined by higher reaction times for a switch back to a just abandoned and thus just inhibited task (ABA sequence) than for a switch to a less recently inhibited task (CBA, n- 2 non-repetition). Reliable n- 2 task repetition costs were obtained for all three tasks. Importantly, these costs were largest for the location task, suggesting that inhibition indeed was stronger for the dominant task. This finding adds to other evidence that the amount of inhibition is adjusted in a context-sensitive way...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{a simple}} genetic model is {{integrated}} with an established method from landscape ecology {{to investigate the}} effect of habitat geometry and availability on genetic drift.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} claimed that, when {{fixating}} a word, a precise split in foveal processing causes all {{letters to the}} left and <b>right</b> of <b>fixation</b> <b>to</b> project to different, contralateral hemispheres (split-fovea theory [...] SFT). In support of this claim, Lavidor et al. (2001; hereafter LES&B) reported that lexical decisions were affected by the number of letters to the left of fixation but not the right, and that this indicates a functional division in hemispheric processing at the point of fixation. Jordan, Paterson, and Stachurski (Cortex, 2009; hereafter JP&S) re-evaluated these claims over 3 experiments using LES&B's original stimuli and procedures and found no support for the findings of LES&B. Following LES&B, JP&S presented stimuli binocularly (i. e., as in normal viewing). However, this procedure has its own complications for SFT (and for assessing the validity of the theory) because the two eyes often do not fixate the same location. Consequently, we report two further experiments which used an eye-tracker <b>to</b> ensure <b>fixation</b> accuracy and monocular viewing to eliminate influences of fixation disparity. Experiment 1 used the same-sized typeface as JP&S, and Experiment 2 used a larger typeface to approximate normal reading size. In line with the findings of JP&S, neither experiment could replicate the findings of LES&B and both experiments showed simply that word recognition was easier when fixations were made towards the beginning of words. Thus, after a total of 5 separate experiments, using binocular and monocular viewing conditions and stimuli presented in a range of sizes, none of these experiments has been able to replicate the findings of LES&B or provide any evidence for a functional division in hemispheric processing at the point of fixation. 1429...|$|R

If μ is of order α^γ, 0 ≤γ≤ 1, the fixation time is ∼ (2 + (1 -γ) Δ) (α) /α, where Δ is the number of migration steps that are needed to reach all other colonies starting from the colony where the beneficial allele appeared.
