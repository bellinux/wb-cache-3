5|$|DNA {{is a long}} polymer {{made from}} repeating units called nucleotides. The {{structure}} of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops, and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled round the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34ångströms (3.4nanometres). The pair of chains has a radius of 10ångströms (1.0nanometre). According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26ångströms wide (2.2 to 2.6nanometres), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3Å (0.33nm) long. Although each individual nucleotide <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions to {{hundreds of millions of}} nucleotides. For instance, the DNA in the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and would be 85mm long if straightened.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} {{structure of the}} <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> can be fine tuned to influence specific properties in the polymer.|$|E
25|$|Of {{particular}} interest are DNA ligases. These molecules have demonstrated remarkable chemoselectivity in RNA branching reactions. Although each <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> in a RNA strand owns a free hydroxyl group, the DNA ligase takes {{just one of}} them as a branching starting point. An accomplishment unattainable with traditional organic chemistry.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{simplest}} <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> {{is that of the}} addition polymer polyvinyl chloride, -CH2-CHCln-, whose <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> is -CH2-CHCl-. In this case the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> has the same atoms as the monomer vinyl chloride CH2=CHCl. When the polymer is formed, the C=C double bond in the monomer is replaced by a C-C single bond in the polymer <b>repeat</b> <b>unit,</b> which links by two new bonds to adjoining <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|More complex <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> {{can occur}} in vinyl {{polymers}} -CH2-CHRn-, if one hydrogen in the ethylene <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> is substituted by a larger fragment R. Polypropylene -CH2-CH(CH3)n- has the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> -CH2-CH(CH3). Polystyrene has a chain where the substituent R is a phenyl group (C6H5), corresponding to a benzene ring minus one hydrogen: -CH2-CH(C6H5)n-, so the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> is -CH2-CH(C6H5)-.|$|R

25|$|The crystal {{structure}} describes the three-dimensional periodic arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a crystal. The unit cell represents the simplest <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> of the {{crystal structure}}. It is a parallelepiped containing a certain spatial arrangement of atoms, ions, molecules, or molecular fragments. From the unit cell the crystal structure can be fully reconstructed via translations.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, 20% to 40% of {{proteins}} contain repeating sequences of amino acids encoded by short sequence repeats. Most {{of the short}} sequence repeats within protein-coding portions of the genome have a <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> of three nucleotides, since that length will not cause frame-shifts when mutating. Each trinucleotide repeating sequence is transcribed into a repeating series of the same amino acid. In yeasts, the most common repeated amino acids are glutamine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid and serine.|$|E
25|$|Most commonly, the {{continuously}} linked {{backbone of}} a polymer {{used for the}} preparation of plastics consists mainly of carbon atoms. A simple example is polyethylene ('polythene' in British English), whose <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> is based on ethylene monomer. However, other structures do exist; for example, elements such as silicon form familiar materials such as silicones, examples being Silly Putty and waterproof plumbing sealant. Oxygen is also commonly present in polymer backbones, {{such as those of}} polyethylene glycol, polysaccharides (in glycosidic bonds), and DNA (in phosphodiester bonds).|$|E
50|$|Polyethylene may be {{considered}} either as -CH2-CH2-n- with a <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> of -CH2-CH2-, or as -CH2-n-, with a <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> of -CH2-. Chemists tend to consider the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> as -CH2-CH2- since this polymer is made from the monomer ethylene (CH2=CH2).|$|R
2500|$|The {{identity}} of the <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> (monomer residues, also known as [...] "mers") comprising a polymer is its {{first and most important}} attribute. Polymer nomenclature is generally based upon the type of monomer residues comprising the polymer. Polymers that contain only a single type of <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> are known as homopolymers, while polymers containing [...] two or more types of <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> are known as copolymers. Terpolymers contain three types of <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some authors, however, define DP as {{the number}} of <b>repeat</b> <b>units,</b> where for {{copolymers}} the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> may not be identical to the monomeric unit. For example, in nylon-6,6, the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> contains the two monomeric units —NH(CH2)6NH— and —OC(CH2)4CO—, so that a chain of 1000 monomeric units corresponds to 500 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> The degree of polymerization or chain length is then 1000 by the first (IUPAC) definition, but 500 by the second.|$|R
25|$|Polymerization is {{the process}} of {{combining}} many small molecules known as monomers into a covalently bonded chain or network. During the polymerization process, some chemical groups may be lost from each monomer. This is the case, for example, in the polymerization of PET polyester. The monomers are terephthalic acid (HOOC-C6H4-COOH) and ethylene glycol (HO-CH2- CH2-OH) but the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> is -OC-C6H4-COO-CH2-CH2-O-, which corresponds to the combination of the two monomers with the loss of two water molecules. The distinct piece of each monomer that is incorporated into the polymer is known as a repeat unit or monomer residue.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} two fractal curves {{described}} above show a type of self-similarity that is exact with a <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> of detail that is readily visualized. This sort of structure can be extended to other spaces (e.g., a fractal that extends the Koch curve into 3-d space has a theoretical D=2.5849). However, such neatly countable complexity is only {{one example of the}} self-similarity and detail that are present in fractals. The example of the coast line of Britain, for instance, exhibits self-similarity of an approximate pattern with approximate scaling. Overall, fractals show several types and degrees of self-similarity and detail that may not be easily visualized. These include, as examples, strange attractors for which the detail has been described as in essence, smooth portions piling up, the Julia set, which can be seen to be complex swirls upon swirls, and heart rates, which are patterns of rough spikes repeated and scaled in time. Fractal complexity may not always be resolvable into easily grasped units of detail and scale without complex analytic methods but it is still quantifiable through fractal dimensions.|$|E
500|$|As the crystal's <b>repeating</b> <b>unit,</b> its unit cell, becomes {{larger and}} more complex, the atomic-level picture {{provided}} by X-ray crystallography becomes less well-resolved (more [...] "fuzzy") for a given number of observed reflections. Two limiting cases of X-ray crystallography—"small-molecule" [...] (which includes continuous inorganic solids) and [...] "macromolecular" [...] crystallography—are often discerned. Small-molecule crystallography typically involves crystals with fewer than 100 atoms in their asymmetric unit; such crystal structures are usually so well resolved that the atoms can be discerned as isolated [...] "blobs" [...] of electron density. By contrast, macromolecular crystallography often involves {{tens of thousands of}} atoms in the unit cell. Such crystal structures are generally less well-resolved (more [...] "smeared out"); the atoms and chemical bonds appear as tubes of electron density, rather than as isolated atoms. In general, small molecules are also easier to crystallize than macromolecules; however, X-ray crystallography has proven possible even for viruses with hundreds of thousands of atoms. Though normally X-ray crystallography can only be performed if the sample is in crystal form, new research has been done into sampling non-crystalline forms of samples.|$|E
40|$|The genus Rattus has {{two related}} {{families}} of satellite DNA: Satellite I consists of tandem arrays of a 370 base pair <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> {{which is a}} dimer of two 185 base pair portions (a, b) which are about 60 % homologous. Satellite I' consists of tandem arrays of a 185 base pair <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> (a') which is about 85 % homologous to a and 60 % homologous to b. R. norvegicus contains only satellite I but R. rattus contains both satellites I and I'. We examined certain aspects of satellite DNA evolution by comparing the spacing at which variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> of each satellite have spread among non-variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> in these two species. With but one exception, in R. rattus, 15 different variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> have spread among non-variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> of satellite I, with a spacing equal {{to the length of}} the (a,b) dimer. Similarly, fourteen different variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> of the monomeric satellite I' have mixed among non-variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> with a spacing equal to the length of the (a') monomer. These results suggest that a mechanism involving homologous interaction among satellite sequences could account for the spread of variant family members. We also found that a sequence variant present in certain portions of the dimeric <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> of satellite I is more efficiently amplified (or less efficiently corrected) than variants occurring in other regions. This was not true for the monomeric <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> of satellite I'...|$|R

2500|$|Polyacetylene (IUPAC name: polyethyne) usually {{refers to}} an organic polymer with the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> (C2H2)n. The name refers to its {{conceptual}} construction from polymerization of acetylene to give a chain with repeating olefin groups. [...] This compound is conceptually important as the discovery of polyacetylene and its high conductivity upon doping helped to launch the field of organic conductive polymers. The [...] high electrical conductivity discovered by Hideki Shirakawa, Alan Heeger, and Alan MacDiarmid for this polymer led to intense interest {{in the use of}} organic compounds in microelectronics (organic semiconductors). This discovery was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000. Early work in the field of polyacetylene research was aimed at using doped polymers as easily processable and lightweight [...] "plastic metals". Despite the promise of this polymer in the field of conductive polymers, many of its properties such as instability to air and difficulty with processing have led to avoidance in commercial applications.|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{structure}} is the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in an amino acid-chain molecule. Proteins are polymers — specifically polypeptides — formed from sequences of amino acids, the monomers of the polymer. [...] A single amino acid monomer {{may also be}} called a residue indicating a <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> of a polymer. Proteins form by amino acids undergoing condensation reactions, in which the amino acids lose one water molecule per reaction in order to attach to one another with a peptide bond. By convention, a chain under 30 amino acids is often identified as a peptide, rather than a protein. To {{be able to perform}} their biological function, proteins fold into one or more specific spatial conformations driven by a number of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, Van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic packing. To understand the functions of proteins at a molecular level, it is often necessary to determine their three-dimensional structure. This is the topic of the scientific field of structural biology, which employs techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and dual polarisation interferometry to determine the structure of proteins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel Plasmodium falciparum gene, denoted cg 2 gene, {{has been}} {{recently}} discovered, and a distinct genotype, characterized by 12 point mutations and 3 size polymorphisms, {{has been shown}} to be associated with chloroquine resistance in laboratory-adapted parasite strains. One of the polymorphic regions, denoted the omega region, consists of 16 tandem <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> in chloroquine-resistant strains, while the chloroquine-sensitive strains have either # 15 or $ 17 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> In this study, the in vivo and in vitro responses were compared with the number of <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> in the omega region of the cg 2 gene for 75 Cameroonian isolates determined either by DNA sequencing or agarose gel electrophoresis. The 16 -repeat units that characterize the resistant strains were found in 10 chloroquine-sensitive isolates (50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50], 100 nM) and 30 chloroquine-resistant isolates (IC 50 $ 100 nM). Thirty-five isolates (28 chloroquine-sensitive isolates and 7 chloroquine-resistant isolates) displayed # 15 or $ 17 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> Of the 18 patients responding with treatment failure, 15 were infected with parasites carrying 16 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> Twenty-eight patients (11 with isolates carrying 16 <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> and 17 with isolates carrying # 15 or $ 17 <b>repeat</b> <b>units)</b> showed an adequate clinical response.
