25|$|The <b>router</b> <b>table</b> {{is usually}} {{oriented}} so that the router bit is vertical and the table over which the work is passed is horizontal. Variations on this include the horizontal <b>router</b> <b>table,</b> in which the table remains horizontal but the router is mounted vertically above the table, so that the router bit cuts from the side. This is an alternative for edge operations, such as panel raising and slot cutting.|$|E
25|$|A router may {{be mounted}} {{upside down in}} a <b>router</b> <b>table</b> or bench. The router's base plate is mounted to the {{underside}} of the table, with a hole allowing the bit to protrude above the table top. This allows the work to be passed over the router, rather than passing the router over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some router operations safer to execute. A <b>router</b> <b>table</b> may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.|$|E
25|$|A simple <b>router</b> <b>table</b> {{consists}} of a rigid top with the router bolted or screwed directly to the underside. More complex solutions can be developed to allow the router to be easily removed from the table as well as facilitate adjusting the router's bit height using a lift mechanism; {{there is a wide}} range of commercially available systems.|$|E

50|$|<b>Router</b> <b>tables</b> {{are used}} {{in one of three}} ways. In all cases, an {{accessory}} is used to direct the workpiece.|$|R
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the routers for different wood works, as Plunge Routers, Fixed Base Wood Routers, Combo Routers, Variable speed Routers, Laminate Trimmer, CNC Wood Routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can also be used as a fixed base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on / off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a <b>router</b> <b>table,</b> this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|E
2500|$|A router [...] ( [...] , also [...] ) {{is a tool}} used to rout out (hollow out) an area in {{the face}} of a {{relatively}} hard workpiece, typically of wood or plastic. The main application of routers is in woodworking, especially cabinetry. The router is most commonly used as a plunging tool and also inverted in a <b>router</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{materials}} {{they are made}} of, bits can be classified as edge bits or non-edge bits, and whether the bit {{is designed to be}} anti-kickback. Edge bits have a small wheel bearing to act as a fence against the work in making edge moldings. These bearings can be changed by using commercially available bearing kits. Changing the bearing, in effect, changes the diameter of the cutting edge. This is especially important with rabbeting/rebating bits. Non-edge bits require the use of a fence, either on a <b>router</b> <b>table</b> or attached to the work or router. [...] Anti-kickback bits employ added non-cutting bit material around the circumference of the bit's shoulders which serves to limit feed-rate. This reduces the chance that the workpiece is pushed too deeply into the bit (which would result in significant kickback from the cutting edge being unable to compensate).|$|E
50|$|Output-sensitive {{algorithms}} arise {{frequently in}} computational geometry applications {{and have been}} described for problems such as hidden surface removal and resolving range filter conflicts in <b>router</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Push Pads {{typically}} {{consist of}} one or two handles and a flat pad with a rubber underside to increase friction with the workpiece. They are typically used with jointers and <b>router</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R

50|$|Finally, {{manufacturers}} {{began selling}} complete packages, {{such as the}} Inverted Pin Router, which ironically {{put them in the}} business of effectively selling wood shapers, the very tool that shop improvised <b>router</b> <b>tables</b> were created as inexpensive substitutes for.|$|R
50|$|<b>Router</b> <b>tables</b> {{evolved as}} shop improvised tools. Individual woodworkers began taking routers, {{mounting}} {{them in an}} inverted position beneath a table, and using the routers' depth adjustment to raise the bit {{through a hole in}} the table surface.|$|R

50|$|A <b>router</b> <b>table</b> is a {{stationary}} woodworking machine {{in which a}} vertically oriented spindle of a woodworking router protrudes from the machine table and can be spun at speeds typically between 3000 and 24,000 rpm. Cutter heads (router bits) may be mounted in the spindle chuck. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the cutters mold a profile into it. The machine normally features a vertical fence, against which the workpiece is guided to control the horizontal depth of cut. Router tables are used to increase the versatility of a hand-held router, as each method of use is particularly suited to specific application, e.g. very large workpieces would be too large to support on a <b>router</b> <b>table</b> and must be routed with a hand-held machine, very small workpieces would not support a hand-held router and must be routed on a <b>router</b> <b>table</b> {{with the aid of}} pushtool accessories etc.|$|E

5000|$|On September 10, 2012, a major {{networking}} failure {{caused by}} corrupted <b>router</b> <b>tables</b> {{resulted in a}} DNS outage intermittently affecting millions of customers' sites {{for a period of}} 4.5 hours.

40|$|Abstract — The network link speeds {{increase}} {{at a higher}} rate compared to processing speeds. This coupled with the increase in size of <b>router</b> <b>tables</b> demand higher levels of parallelism within router hardware. However, such parallelism introduces unintended consequences that potentially may negate some of the performance gains provided by the improved technology. The growth trends of computing speeds, link speeds, and routing table sizes are used to evaluate one such consequence, packet reordering within routers. Results presented show the trends related to the degree of hardware parallelism and packet reordering I...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} data structure–dynamic tree bitmap–for the {{representation}} of dynamic IP <b>router</b> <b>tables</b> that must support very high lookup and update rates. In fact, the dynamic tree bitmap is able to support updates {{at the same rate}} as lookups and is very competitive with other structures–tree bitmap and BaRT–proposed earlier for dynamic tables. Although the dynamic tree bitmap requires more memory than is required by the tree bitmap and BaRT structures, the required memory remains reasonable. The real value of our structure is its ability to support a very high update rate...|$|R

40|$|Two schemes—prefix {{partitioning}} and interval partitioning—are {{proposed to}} improve the performance of dynamic IP router-table designs.

50|$|While the IETF {{document}} BCP 38 on ingress filtering {{does not}} specify {{a method of}} implementing source address filtering, some router vendors have implemented a mechanism which employs lookups in the <b>router's</b> <b>tables</b> to perform this check. (See also reverse path forwarding.) This is often implemented as a lookup in the FIB of the source address of the packet. If the interface has no route to the source address, the packet {{is assumed to be}} part of a denial of service attack, using a false or spoofed source address, and the router discards the packet.|$|R
40|$|Preamble. Packet {{filters are}} rules in IP <b>router</b> <b>tables</b> for {{classifying}} packets {{based on the}} information in their header fields. For forwarding purposes, {{there has to be a}} unique best matching filter which applies to an incoming packet p. In order to avoid ambiguities in the classification, the set of filters must be conflict-free under the tie-breaking rule which is applied. In this report we establish some properties of filters to provide a basis for our future work in this field. Furthermore, we give a review of the accomplishments in this area and outline open problems...|$|R
