5|$|Assiniboine {{returned}} to Canada in June and was briefly {{used as a}} troop transport before a boiler <b>room</b> <b>fire</b> on 4 July effectively ended her career. She was paid off on 8 August and placed on the disposal list. Whilst on tow to the breakers in Baltimore, she ran aground near East Point, Prince Edward Island. Attempts to get her off failed, and she was left to rust until eventually being broken up in place in 1952.|$|E
5|$|After her {{overhaul}} {{was completed}} in June 1944, the ship resumed her former duties in the Skagerrak, although the repairs required after another boiler <b>room</b> <b>fire</b> in August necessitated lengthy repairs in Oslo. She was damaged after colliding with the mole in Frederikshavn, Denmark, on 18 November and became operational again on 7 January 1945. Theodor Riedel remained in Southern Norway and Denmark until the ships there were ordered into the Baltic {{to assist with the}} evacuation of the Hel Peninsula on 5 May. After unloading the refugees in Copenhagen, she made another voyage to Hela and returned to Copenhagen on 7 May. The crew surrendered in Kiel three days later.|$|E

5|$|Almirante Latorre, {{which was}} closer to {{completion}} than its sister, was bought in 1914 and commissioned into British service as HMS Canada in October 1915. The ship spent its wartime service with the Grand Fleet, seeing action in the Battle of Jutland. After the war, HMS Canada was put into reserve before being sold back to Chile in 1920 as Almirante Latorre. The crew of the battleship instigated a naval mutiny in 1931. After several years of inactivity, the ship underwent a major refit in the United Kingdom in 1937, later allowing it to patrol Chile's coast during the Second World War. After a boiler <b>room</b> <b>fire</b> and a short stint as a prison ship, Almirante Latorre was scrapped in 1959. After Almirante Cochrane was purchased by the British in 1918, {{it was decided to}} convert the ship into an aircraft carrier. After numerous delays, Almirante Cochrane was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Eagle in February 1924. It served in the Mediterranean Fleet and on the China Station in the inter-war period, and operated in the Atlantic and Mediterranean during the Second World War before being sunk in August 1942 during Operation Pedestal.|$|E

25|$|Anderida {{was built}} as a train ferry by Trosvik Verksted A/S, Brevik, Norway as Yard Number 95. She was {{launched}} on 11 December 1971. Anderida was delivered on 28 April 1972. Originally ordered by Stena Line, she was sold whilst still under construction. Named after the Saxon Shore Fort, the ship was sold to Carpass Shipping Ltd on 1 May and was chartered to British Rail on 22 August. She entered service on the Dover - Dunkerque route on 28 August. In March 1975, she operated on the Larne - Stranraer route. In May 1976, she was employed on the Holyhead - Dún Laoghaire route, and in October she was put in service on the Heysham - Belfast route. In May 1977, she entered service on the Fishguard - Rosslare route. An engine <b>room</b> <b>fire</b> on 17 February 1979 put her out of service for a month. In December 1980, she returned to Dover and was laid up. In 1981, captains working for Sealink refused to sail Anderida from Dover to Newhaven, East Sussex {{in a bid to}} prevent Sealink laying her up there prior to sale.|$|E
