Results indicate that total integration of personal and corporate taxes would yield an annual static efficiency gain of around $ 4 billion (1973 dollars). Partial integration plans yield less. Dynamic effects are larger, and our analysis indicates that full integration may yield gains whose present value is as large as $ 400 billion or 0. 8 % of the discounted present value of the GNP stream to the U.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{are faced with}} the issue of tariff replacement at an early stage of their development, due to their increased commitments through Free Trade Arrangements with developed countries. As tariff replacement through VAT, or more sophisticated tools such as income tax, is neither practically nor economically desirable in these economies, this paper investigates the effects of an alternative <b>replacement</b> <b>tax</b> that only affects categories of goods not produced locally. This tax, denominated tax with equivalent effects to tariffs (TEET), is indeed a consumption tax as it concerns all goods, whether imported or potentially produced in the country. Based on a simple diagrammatic approach, the study shows that this tool tends to generate more welfare than tariffs if final prices of goods are left unchanged. It shows that a government can continue to maintain its revenues and increase the welfare of consumers through this fiscal replacement. Additionally, the political and economic reserves associated with this tool are discussed. The TEET are therefore useful mainly for small and non-diversified economies. It also remains that the use of this tool is, in practice, conditioned by the level of tolerance of developed countries, which tend to prohibit it in bilateral agreements with developing countries. tariff reform, VAT, welfare, government revenue,...|$|E

40|$|Turkey and the European Union (EU) {{have agreed}} to {{implement}} a customs union. This means Turkey will eliminate its tariffs and levies on imports on manufactured products from the EU. Turkey will also apply EU's"common external tariff"on imports from third countries. Turkey will be obligated by 20001 to provide preferential access to its markets to all countries to which the EU grants such access. Since Turkey is both eliminating tariffs on EU imports and reducing tariffs on imports from third countries, {{it will become a}} rather open economy in nonagricultural sectors. And since preferential access agreements with third countries will typically be reciprocal, Turkish exporters can expect improved access to those markets. According to the authors, Turkey's biggest gains from the customs union arrangement will come from this improved access to third country markets. Using a comparative static computable general equilibrium model of Turkey, they estimate that Turkey stands to gain between 1 and 1. 5 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (GDP) annually from the customs union arrangement with the EU, depending on what complementary policies it adopts. They also estimate that lost tariff revenues will amount to 1. 4 percent of GDP. For Turkey to avoid worsening its fiscal deficit, it must find ways to reduce expenditures or increase revenues. Its best choice is to reduce expenditures through accelerating privatization of state-owned enterprises which will generate a number of macroeconomic and efficiency benefits in addition to the fiscal benefits. If a value-added tax (VAT) is used as a <b>replacement</b> <b>tax,</b> they estimate that VAT rates must increase 16. 2 percent in each sector to compensate for the revenue losses from implementing the full customs union.

40|$|Although trade {{liberalisation}} {{has been linked}} econometrically and through casual empiricism to large income increases, attempts to quantify its impact in static simulation models have shown small estimated gains. This paper shows that when the endogenous dynamic effects of {{trade liberalisation}} are built into simulation models, the estimated gains are indeed very large. In the authors' model, intermediate inputs affect aggregate output through a Dixit-Stiglitz-Ethier function so that additional varieties provide the engine of growth. But complementary regulatory, financial market and macroeconomic reforms are important to realise the largest gains. The authors apply the model to five developing countries. In this model with lump sum revenue replacement, reducing a tariff from 20 percent to 10 percent produces a real income increase (in terms of Hicksian equivalent variation over the infinite horizon) of 10. 7 percent of {{the present value of}} consumption in their central model, where the economy is assumed to be unable to borrow on international financial markets. If macroeconomic and financial reforms are in place that would allow international borrowing, however, the same tariff cut is estimated to result in a 37 percent increase in Hicksian equivalent variation.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesNational {{treasury}} {{is currently}} considering the abolishment of estate duty in South Africa. Tax experts {{have long been}} calling for the repeal of estate duty {{as a result of}} various issues which include the following: - The perceived double taxation at death of an individual if capital gains tax is considered, - With estate duty being classified as a "wealth tax", the wealthy are more inclined to avoid these taxes by setting up trusts and paying for elaborate estate planning advice than any average tax payer. - There are inconsistencies and very little compatibility between wealth taxes in South Africa - Lastly the issue of efficiency, specifically the efficient collection of taxes versus the amount of administration required to accomplish this goal. Since the budget speeches of 2010 and 2011 where former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan announced the review of taxes upon death, National Treasury as well as the Davis Commission have been appointed to investigate the issues sur rounding death taxes, and in particular estate duty in South Africa. The main purpose of the study is to establish whether the abolishment of estate duty is a realistic consideration in light of lessons learned from other countries such as Canada, Ireland, The United Kingdom and Australia. If not, what possible alternatives are available to policy makers with regard to international trends? Should South Africa move to a recipient based system such as the system used in Ireland, or rather adapt the current estate duty act {{to such a degree that}} it is similar to a system used in the UK? Certain similarities were drawn between estate duty in South Africa and similar taxes in other countries. It may be concluded that Treasury's rationale behind the review and possible abolishment of estate duty is not a unique concept in global comparisons, as wealth taxes remain unpopular worldwide. An interesting observation was also that in many cases the driving force behind the abolishment in countries such as Australia was political reasoning. With the rate at which unemployment and the population is growing in South Africa, it is clear that the current contribution estate duty makes to the fiscus, should have a heavy bearing on the factors to be considered before repealing such a tax permanently. It would be impossible to implement a <b>replacement</b> <b>tax</b> which would have to be paid by all South Africans, especially with South Africa's delicate Union situation being close to boiling point. Another wealth tax will have to be considered, a tax which will be applicable only to the rich, thereby not affecting the middle and lower class earners. As global trends are at the moment, the rich are getting richer and poor are getting poorer. There is no better example of this than in South Africa. Therefore Treasury will find it very difficult to justify why a "wealth tax" was repealed in favour of a tax which is levied on all classes of taxpayers. It seems as though revenue collected from a specific tax would not economically justify the repeal of any tax currently. With politicians striving to increase personal wealth rather than focus on growing the economy, one can only hope that economic welfare will prevail over political agendas...|$|E

The Families and Children Study (FACS), {{formerly known as the}} Survey of Low Income Families (SOLIF), originally provided a new baseline survey of Britain's lone-parent families and low-income couples with dependent children. The survey was named SOLIF for Waves 1 and 2, and FACS from Wave 3 onwards. The FACS study has become a 'true panel', whereby 1999 respondents have been re-interviewed in subsequent annual waves in from 2000 to 2004, and new families added in each of these years, to allow representative cross-section as well as longitudinal comparisons. Starting with Wave 3 (2001) the survey was extended to include higher-income families, thereby yielding a complete sample of all British families (and the subsequent name change). From Wave 4 (2002) onwards, longitudinal comparisons can now be made. The main objectives of the survey are to: evaluate the effectiveness of the Government's work incentive measures in terms of helping people into work, improving living standards and improving child outcomes compare the living standards and outcomes for children and for families across the income distribution compare changes in the above across the waves since 1999 FACS also aims to provide commentary on longer-term objectives such as the Government's Public Service Agreement to eradicate child poverty within a generation. Further information, including links to reports and other publications, may be found on the DWP FACS web pages. Users should note that, in addition to the survey name change noted above, some of the documentation for the early waves refers to the survey as the Study of Families with Children. The original deposit of FACS, released in December 2001, contained data and documentation from the first wave. Further waves have been added at subsequent editions in 2003, 2004 (twice), 2005, 2006 and 2007. For the eighth edition (October 2010), three major changes were made to the study: data and documentation for Waves 8 - 10 were deposited for the first time; updated and improved data and documentation for Waves 3 - 7 were deposited to replace previous materials; and updated documentation covering all waves was deposited. Details of improvements to the redeposited Wave 3 - 7 data are included in the all waves user guide. For the ninth edition (January 2011), the Wave 10 technical report was added to the study. Main Topics : The FACS interviews comprise: one hour interview for the main respondent (typically the mother figure in the household) a 20 minute partner interview Topics covered in the main interview include household characteristics, health and well-being, children's schooling, behaviour and childcare provision, use of local services, education and training, employment, family income, in-work support through the use of Working Families' Tax Credits (and its <b>replacement</b> <b>tax</b> credit system), receipt of benefits, child maintenance, money management and savings, housing, and material deprivation. The Wave 7 (2005) questionnaire included a new section on social capital for main respondents and partners. Partners in the household were also interviewed up to Wave 8. For Waves 9 and 10, a short proxy interview was completed with the main respondent. Waves 1 - 3 (1999 - 2001) also included a self-completion questionnaire for the main respondent and their partner, covering morale and various attitudinal questions. This was dropped for Wave 4. Waves 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10 (but not Wave 7) included a short self-completion questionnaire for all children aged 11 to 15 in the family. The children's questionnaire covered leisure time activities, computer access, social participation, sport and organised activities, use of local amenities and attitudes to neighbourhood, alcohol use, smoking, illegal drug use, self-esteem, health and happiness, attitudes to school and schoolwork, relationship with parents, and income. For Waves 5 - 7, SPSS syntax files detailing specifications for derived variables are also available with the dataset...|$|E
