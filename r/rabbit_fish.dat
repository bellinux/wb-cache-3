50|$|Edaphodon {{is similar}} to other rabbit fishes in appearance. Like other chimaeriforms, it fed using six tooth plates (one pair on the lower jaw and two pairs on the upper). Probably, it laid eggs in a {{leathery}} pouch like other <b>rabbit</b> <b>fish,</b> but no occurrences of this have been recorded. Edaphodon had a sloping head and a mouth on its underside, allowing it to graze {{along the bottom of}} the ocean like a land-dwelling herbivore, but actually it was feeding on small benthic animals.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rabbit</b> <b>fish</b> {{lives at}} depths from 40 to(-) 1663 m with most records between 300 and(-) 500 m. They {{generally}} occur {{deeper in the}} southern part of the range than in the northern. Sick or dying fish are sometimes observed in shallow water. Its distribution is the northeastern Atlantic, from Morocco north to northern Norway and Iceland. They are also found in the Mediterranean, although rare in the eastern part and not known from the northern and central Adriatic Sea. Records from South Africa are considered questionable.|$|E
50|$|The {{brothers}} {{tinkered with}} the diet of the fox. In 1915 {{an outbreak of}} rickets had hit their animals. At that time they were feeding the fox a lot of horse meat, but after deboning it. Henry suspected {{that the lack of}} bones caused the rickets. They tried adding ground bones to the diet and the rickets problem faded. By 1922 they had diversified the diet to include beef, mutton, veal, woodchuck, <b>rabbit,</b> <b>fish,</b> eggs, milk, bread, vegetables, and fruit. They were careful about sanitation for their valuable fox. Over time, they decided that one feeding a day was sufficient.|$|E

50|$|Chimaeras live in {{temperate}} ocean floors down to 2600 m deep, {{with few}} occurring at depths shallower than 200 m. Exceptions include {{the members of}} the genus Callorhinchus, the <b>rabbit</b> <b>fish</b> and the spotted ratfish, which locally or periodically can be found at relatively shallow depths. Consequently, these are also among the few species from the Chimaera order kept in public aquaria. They have elongated, soft bodies, with a bulky head and a single gill-opening. They grow up to 150 cm in length, although this includes the lengthy tail found in some species. In many species, the snout is modified into an elongated sensory organ.|$|E
50|$|Malampaya Sound's waters, coral reefs, {{seagrass}} beds, mangrove coastlines {{and surrounding}} lowland forests provide habitat {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. More than 156 fish species are found in its waters including commercially valuable fish such as mackerel, anchovy, crevalle, sea catfish, snapper, frigate tuna, <b>rabbit</b> <b>fish</b> and grouper. Crabs and stingray are also abundant in the sound and is also visited by dugongs and marine turtles like green sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles. The sound is also home to three species of dolphins: the Irrawady dolphin found in the Inner Sound, the bottle-nosed dolphin in the Outer Sound, and Risso's dolphin found at Minapla Bay.|$|E
50|$|Members of this taxon {{preserve}} today some {{features of}} elasmobranch life in Paleozoic times, though {{in other respects}} they are aberrant. They live close {{to the bottom and}} feed on molluscs and other invertebrates. The tail is long and thin and they move by sweeping movements of the large pectoral fins. The erectile spine in front of the dorsal fin is sometimes poisonous. There is no stomach (that is, the gut is simplified and the 'stomach' is merged with the intestine), and the mouth is a small aperture surrounded by lips, giving the head a parrot-like appearance. The only surviving members of the group are the <b>rabbit</b> <b>fish</b> (Chimaera), and the elephant fishes (Callorhynchus).|$|E

They added beans and squash to their crops around 1200. As cultivation of maize, beans, and squash, the [...] "Three Sisters" [...] of Native American agriculture, expanded, use of earlier indigenous crops declined.

5000|$|... (July 15, 22, 2012)Dubbed as [...] "The Queen City of the South", the host, Richard Gutierrez {{revisited}} his hometown, Cebu. He {{takes us}} on {{an exploration of}} the less traveled adventure spots to rediscover the magnificent vistas of the province that he considers his home away from home. A warm welcome at the Rama Compound, the place where his mother's kin have lived for decades, starts off his search for adrenaline-pumping action. He shares a meal of [...] "Bam-I", a type of pancit (noodles) dish that's considered the family heirloom recipe. He also gives a tour of the house as he relives his moments spent vacationing in Cebu. Energized with great memories, Gutierrez {{and the rest of the}} team hies off to their first adventure stop: Matutinao River in the town of Badian, a destination only three hours away from the city and frequented by extreme outdoor enthusiasts.He tries his hand at canyoneering, a sport that involves abseils (rappels) and ropework, technical climbing or down-climbing as well as jumps and swims along canyons and mountain gorges. The arduous physical challenge doesn't stop Richard from admiring the magnificent view and enjoying the company of the local canyoneering group. On the second part episode, the host meets up with the Bugoy Bikers, a group of biking environmentalists founded by Jens Funk, a German national who chose to make Cebu his home 8 years ago. The group endeavours to lessen air pollution by encouraging bike tours around the province, a cause close to Gutierrez's heart. They fuel up with a hearty meal at the start-off point of the tour, [...] "Balay ni Bugoy" [...] (Visayan for Bugoy's House), a bed and breakfast frequented by biking enthusiasts. The biking tour takes them mostly uphill along the roads of Barangay Gaas in the town of Balamban. The difficult yet scenic tour ends in Cantabaco, another adventure destination for locals and tourists who are into the extreme sport of rock climbing. After that, the whole team makes a quick detour, to give a taste of [...] "danggit", sun-dried <b>rabbit</b> <b>fish,</b> and the famous [...] "best roast pig in the world", according to world-renowned chef, Anthony Bourdain. After the food trip, Gutierrez, finds himself in the Cantabaco Rock Climbing Wall, a group of limestone rock formations discovered in 1983 by local mountaineers.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} impact of acute {{exposure}} to crude oil, dispersed oil, and dispersant alone on the liver of the <b>rabbit</b> <b>fish</b> (Siganus canaliculatus). Histopathological effects in the liver were observed at different time points (3 to 21 days) and different concentrations (3 – 100 % water accommodated fraction [WAF]) to simulate a range of possible oil pollution events. The main alterations observed in this study include lipid accumulation, necrosis, bile stagnation, megalocytosis, cholangitis, and spongiosis hepatis. The liver of fish exposed to WAF, dispersed oil, or dispersant showed significant histopathologic alterations compared with the control fish (Mann-Whitney U test; p . 05). The present study indicates that oil pollution can cause important alterations to livers of adult <b>rabbit</b> <b>fish</b> and that the dispersed oil is slightly more toxic than crude oil or dispersant...|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to his earlier works, which focused on demons and death, his recent works frequently feature animals or recurring images of forests.

In “Something With a Chicken,” even a contemptuous myna bird makes an appearance. The denial of human values spurs an interest in “beings that are not human.” His works, which disrupt the distinctions between reality and fantasy, human and inhuman, meaning and non-meaning, {{can be understood as}} scorn towards an absurd social reality. In that sense, his works are frequently compared to Kafka’s.|$|R
