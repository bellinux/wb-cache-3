5|$|According to FN, the 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} has {{an effective}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 200m (219yd) {{and a maximum}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 1,800m (1,969yd) when fired from the P90, and an effective <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 50m (55yd) and a maximum <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 1,510m (1,651yd) when fired from the Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, {{and it is a}} subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The home <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> four {{male and}} five female feral house cats (Felis catus) were studied by radiotelemetry. In the narrow, steep-sided valley the home <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> cats were linear, {{with an average}} length of 6. 34 km for males and 3. 83 km for females; only large males crossed the river. Females with kittens had small home <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> 0. 84 to 2. 0 km. Home <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> animals of the same sex, {{including}} breeding females, overlapped considerably. The social organisation of feral cats at low density differs little from that of higher-density freeranging domestic cats...|$|R

50|$|They {{are very}} agile in {{climbing}} both large vertical tree trunks and bushes, and occasionally jump from stems {{of a young}} tree to that of another as much as 60 cm away. Their climbing is concentrated in lower heights. They frequently scent-mark their territories by chest and anogenital rubbing with a secretion from glands on chest and scrotum. Adult males are more secretory than females and juveniles. In the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, mean home <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> adult males were estimated at 10174 m2, of adult females at 8809 m2, of juvenile males at 7527 m2, and of juvenile females at 7255 m2, with partial overlaps {{between male and female}} ranges varying from 0.4% to 56.8%. Home <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> adult residents of the same sex overlap to a lesser degree than those of opposite sexes. A male’s range may include the <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> two or three females. A high overlap between <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> one adult male and one adult female indicates they form a stable pair. Juvenile <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> either sex adjoin or overlap with <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> adults, suggesting the juveniles are family members. Individuals of the same sex are involved in aggressive territorial chases.|$|R
40|$|Many palaoeclimate {{estimates}} {{are based on}} the climatic <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> the nearest living relatives (NLRs) of fossils. If the climatic <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> the true NLRs of the taxa in a fossil assemblage do not overlap, then the past climatic <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> some of the fossil taxa are different to the <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> their NLRs. Discrepancies between the climatic <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> the inferred NLRs of co-occurring fossils are common, particularly in assemblages older than the Middle Pleistocene. Evidence from Early Pleistocene Tasmania indicates that many anomalies are caused by extinct species, or at least genotypes. It is likely that pre-Quaternary fossil deposits will contain more extinct taxa. Most of the extinct Early Pleistocene taxa have warm climate NLRs, but they appear to have occurred in climates no warmer than modern climates in western Tasmania. Sometimes nearest living relative approaches in climate reconstruction are appear to be biased by extinctions of ecotypes and species, especially ones caused by the Pleistocene glacial/interglacial cycles. Extinctions also mean {{that it is difficult to}} identify palaeoclimates which are different from any modern climate...|$|R

Cats' hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal, being most acute in the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 500Hz to 32kHz. This sensitivity is further enhanced by the cat's large movable outer ears (their pinnae), which both amplify sounds and help detect {{the direction of a}} noise.|$|E
