40|$|Retrovirus receptors {{remain a}} largely {{unexplored}} group of proteins. Of the receptors which allow infection {{of human and}} murine cells by various retroviruses, only three have been identified at the molecular level. These receptors include CD 4 for human immunodeficiency virus, Rec- 1 for murine ecotropic virus, and GLVR 1 for gibbon ape leukemia virus. These three proteins show no homology to one another at the DNA or protein level. Therefore, work to date has not shown any general relationship or structural theme shared by retroviral <b>receptors.</b> Genes <b>for</b> two of these receptors (CD 4 and Rec- 1) and several others which {{have not yet been}} cloned have been localized to specific chromosomes. In order to assess the relationship between GLVR 1 and other retroviral receptors, we mapped the chromosome location of GLVR 1 in human and mouse. GLVR 1 was found to map to human chromosome 2 q 11 -q 14 by in situ hybridization and somatic-cell hybrid analysis.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, many {{retrovirus}} receptors, coreceptors, and cofactors have been identified. These molecules are important for some aspects of viral entry, although {{in some cases it}} remains to be determined whether they are required for binding or postbinding stages in entry, such as fusion.

40|$|Background: The use of {{periodontal}} {{stem cells}} with tissue engineering techniques constitutes an attractive strategy for regenerative periodontal therapy. However, technical difficulties of isolating a large quantity of these cells and problem of immune rejection in allogeneic transplantation limit their dental clinical usefulness. Recently, several groups have successfully reprogrammed adult cells to pluripotent cells by retroviral transduction with four genes - Oct 3 / 4, Sox 2, Klf 4 and cMyc. The resultant induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have proliferative and developmental potentials {{comparable to those}} of embryonic stem (ES) cells. These cells may represent a good stem cell source for regenerative periodontal therapy. As periodontal tissues are easily accessible, it is hypothesised that periodontal fibroblasts may be an alternative cell source for derivation of iPS cells. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} generate and characterise iPS cells from human adult gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts. Methods: Gingival and PDL tissues from around extracted human adult teeth were collected and digested to obtain single cell suspensions of gingival and PDL fibroblasts. The fibroblasts were lentivirally transduced with mouse <b>receptor</b> <b>for</b> <b>retrovirus</b> mSlc 7 a 1, followed by retroviral transduction with four genes (Oct 3 / 4, Sox 2, Klf 4 and cMyc). Six days after retroviral transduction, the fibroblasts were re-plated onto mouse embryonic feeders and maintained with daily medium change. At day 25 - 30, human ES cell-like colonies were harvested for characterisation assays to assess their self-renewal and developmental capacities. Results: Human ES cell-like colonies were observed 25 days after transduction. Cells from these colonies were morphologically similar to human ES cells, expressed ES cell genes assayed by immunostaining and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, showed silencing of exogenous retroviral genes and displayed a normal karyotype. In vitro, these cells formed embryoid bodies with down-regulated expression of ES cell genes and up-regulated expression of ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal markers. Conclusion: iPS-like cells can be generated from human adult gingival and PDL fibroblasts, and gingival fibroblasts can represent an easily accessible source of cells to derive individual-specific iPS cells for regenerative periodontal therapy.

By determining whether human DNA sequences are present or absent in each of the hybrids, localization of single genes may routinely be achieved at ≈ 250 -kb resolution. In this paper we have tested whether similarly precise localization might be achieved by phenotypic screening of the hybrids to facilitate positional cloning of unknown genes. We assayed the susceptibility of each of the hybrid cell lines to transduction by retroviral vectors bearing different retroviral envelope proteins that recognize receptors present on human but not on hamster cells. The results for each of the retroviral vectors were informative and allowed precise localization of the <b>receptor</b> genes <b>for</b> the RD 114 cat endogenous retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia virus, and type C feline leukemia virus. After cloning of the <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> these <b>retroviruses,</b> we found that standard genotypic mapping by PCR gave results that were nearly identical to those from phenotypic mapping. These experiments show that precise gene localization by phenotypic assay of radiation hybrids is practical and was not appreciably impacted by the known instability of such hybrid cells.

Ram- 1 acts as both a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter and a <b>receptor</b> <b>for</b> amphotropic <b>retroviruses.</b> We previously reported detectable Ram- 1 in murine hematopoietic fetal liver cells (FLC) despite resistance of these cells to amphotropic retroviral transduction (infection). We document here that Ram- 1 expression is completely absent in murine yolk sac cells from days 9. 5 through 13. 5 of ontogeny and first appears at low levels in midgestational FLC between days 13. 5 and 14. 5. In addition, Ram- 1 expression is detected only in more differentiated populations within FLC, day 14. 5, and not in those highly enriched for stem cells, indicating developmental regulation of Ram- 1 during murine hematopoiesis. Others have reported the in vitro use of phosphate-free medium as a stimulus to increase levels of Ram- 1 mRNA in nonhematopoietic cells. We now demonstrate that Ram- 1 poly(A) + mRNA increases significantly following culture of FLC in phosphate-free medium. Further, transduction of FLC in phosphate-free medium with an amphotropic retrovirus containing the multiple drug resistance gene leads to gene transfer not observed previously. These data demonstrate that (i) the normal resistance of FLC to amphotropic transduction is most likely due to an insufficient number of Ram- 1 molecules for efficient retroviral recognition and binding, and (ii) Ram- 1 can be upregulated by increasing the need for phosphate transport across the cell membrane...|$|R
40|$|We used {{a genetic}} {{strategy}} {{to isolate the}} chicken gene believed to encode the <b>receptor</b> <b>for</b> subgroup A avian leukosis and sarcoma viruses (ALSV-A). Chicken genomic DNA was transfected into monkey COS- 7 cells, and two independent primary transfectants susceptible to ALSV-A infection were identified by using ALSV-A vectors containing a hygromycin B resistance gene. A second round of transfection and selection in mouse BALB/ 3 T 3 fibroblasts again led to isolation of a transfectant susceptible to infection by ALSV-A. Plasmid DNA sequences linked to chicken DNA during the primary transfection segregated with chicken DNA in the secondary transfectant {{and served as a}} molecular tag to clone the gene conferring susceptibility.

In human cells expressing a jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus Env transgene, the Env protein physically associates with HYAL 2.

We find activated RON in a subset of human bronchioloalveolar carcinoma tumors, suggesting RON involvement in this type of human lung cancer...|$|R
40|$|Acquired immune {{deficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is characterized}} by opportunistic infections and by 'opportunistic neoplasms' (for example, Kaposi's sarcoma). Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) is epidemiologically associated with AIDS, especially in male homosexuals.

Here we have detected cell-surface <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> the AIDS <b>retrovirus</b> (human T-cell leukaemia virus-III (HTLV-III) and lymphadenopathy-associated virus- 1 (LAV- 1) isolates) by testing the susceptibility of cells to infection with pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus bearing retroviral envelope antigens, and by the formation of multinucleated syncytia on mixing virus-producing cells with receptor-bearing cells. Receptors were present only on cells expressing CD 4 antigen; among 155 monoclonal antibodies tested, each of the 14 anti-CD 4 antibodies inhibited formation of syncytia and blocked pseudotypes. Productive infection of CD 4 + cells with HTLV-III or LAV- 1 markedly reduced cell-surface expression of CD 4.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism by}} which retroviral Gag proteins are directed to the plasma membrane {{for the formation of}} particles (budding) is unknown, but it is widely believed that the MA domain, located at the amino terminus, plays a critical role. Consistent with this idea, we found that small deletions in this segment of the Rous sarcoma virus Gag protein completely blocked particle formation. The mutant proteins appear to have suffered only localized structural damage since they could be rescued (i. e., packaged into particles) when coexpressed with Gag proteins that are competent for particle formation. To our surprise, the effects of the MA deletions could be completely suppressed by fusing as few as seven residues of the myristylated amino terminus of the oncoprotein p 6 Osrc {{to the beginning of the}} mutant Gag proteins. Particles produced by the chimeras were of the same density as the wild type. Two myristylated peptides having sequences distinct from that of p 6 Osrc were entirely unable to suppress MA deletions, indicating that myristate alone is not a sufficient membrane targeting signal.

40|$|International audienceTRIM 5 is a RING domain-E 3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase that restricts infection {{by human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - 1 and other retroviruses immediately following virus invasion of the target cell cytoplasm. Antiviral potency correlates with TRIM 5 avidity for the retrovirion capsid lattice and several reports indicate that TRIM 5 has a role in signal transduction, but the precise mechanism of restriction is unknown. Here we demonstrate that TRIM 5 promotes innate immune signalling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC 13 -UEV 1 A (also known as UBE 2 N-UBE 2 V 1), TRIM 5 catalyses the synthesis of unattached K 63 -linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK 1 (also known as MAP 3 K 7) kinase complex and stimulate AP- 1 and NFκB signalling. Interaction with the HIV- 1 capsid lattice greatly enhances the UBC 13 -UEV 1 A-dependent E 3 activity of TRIM 5 and challenge with retroviruses induces the transcription of AP- 1 and NF-κB-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracks with TRIM 5 avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK 1 and UBC 13 -UEV 1 A contribute to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM 5. Thus, the retroviral restriction factor TRIM 5 has two additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively promotes innate immune signalling and it acts as a pattern recognition <b>receptor</b> specific <b>for</b> the <b>retrovirus</b> capsid lattice...|$|R

The viral <b>receptor</b> <b>for</b> ecotropic MLV (eMLV), a classical model <b>for</b> <b>retrovirus</b> infectionmechanisms and pathogenesis, is mouse cationic amino acid transporter 1 (mCAT- 1). Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB 2) is an adaptor protein that has been shown to couple cell surface receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor, to in-tracellular signaling events. Here we examined if GRB 2 could also play a role in controlling infection by retroviruses by affecting receptor function. The GRB 2 RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated suppression of endogenous GRB 2 resulted in a consistent and significant reduction of virus binding andmembrane fusion. The binding between eMLV and cells promoted increased GRB 2 – mCAT- 1 interactions, as detected by immunoprecipitation. Consistently, the increased colocalization of GRB 2 andmCAT- 1 sig-nals was detected by confocal microscopy. This association was time dependent and paralleled the kinetics of cell-virus mem-brane fusion. Interestingly, unlike the canonical binding pattern seen for GRB 2 and growth factor receptors, GRB 2 –mCAT- 1 binding does not depend on the GRB 2 -SH 2 domain-mediated recognition of tyrosine phosphorylation on the receptor. The inhi-bition of endogenous GRB 2 led to a reduction in surface levels of mCAT- 1, which was detected by immunoprecipitation and by a direct binding assay using a recombinant MLV envelope protein receptor binding domain (RBD).

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the methods {{we use to}} derive and characterize human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. We describe in order, first our culture techniques for the starting fibroblast populations and methods <b>for</b> <b>retrovirus</b> preparation and concentration. Subsequently, a detailed iPS derivation protocol suitable for human fibroblast populations is discussed using standard retroviral vectors expressing the classic four or three reprogramming genes. Finally, we elaborate a robust technique for monitoring and identification of potential iPS cells through live staining of reprogrammed cells. We also outline steps for characterization of the resulting iPS cell lines...|$|R
