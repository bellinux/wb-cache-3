40|$|In recent years, organic {{thin-film}} electronics {{have emerged}} as a route towards flexible, low-cost, large area applications, which are unfeasible in the current silicon technology. For example, low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) tags that can be placed on any object, as envisioned by the Internet of Things, for smart labeling, security, monitoring, or tracking purposes. For these applications, a nonvolatile memory functionality is crucial for their intended operation. Therefore, simultaneous {{to the development of}} organic transistors and circuits, progress needs to be made towards a compatible nonvolatile, electrically <b>reprogrammable</b> <b>memory</b> array. In this doctoral research, we aim to realize such an organic memory array that can be integrated with the organic logic circuits on the same, flexible substrate. More specifically, we focus on the device architecture and materials of ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFET) as the basic memory unit. The objective of this work was pursued by a combination of i) technological advancements over the state-of-the-art; ii) further understanding of the device operation; iii) devising a read-and write scheme suited for an array; and iv) use of novel materials and device architectures. By optimizing the processing conditions, we demonstrate high-performance bottom gate - top contact (BG-TC) FeFETs with pentacene as the organic semiconductor, as shown in Chapter 2. These memory devices can switch within a few ms, and can be cycled for at least 10000 times. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate a long term retention data of more than one year. These results make this device highly promising for non-volatile memory applications. Unexpectedly for a bi-stable material, the BG-TC FeFET shows three <b>reprogrammable</b> <b>memory</b> states: OFF, Intermediate and ON state. Using Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy, we elucidate the device operation in this device structure in Chapter 3. These measurements show that the ferroelectric layer in the channel region of the FeFET is not fully polarized in the OFF and Intermediate states. The difference between these two states can be explained by a different injection property of the contacts, caused by the ferroelectric polarization state underneath the source-drain contacts. This refinement clarifies the peculiarities experimentally found in literature, as well as in our own results. To integrate with organic circuits, as well as to fabricate memory arrays, photolithography must be used. In addition, the bottom gate - bottom contact (BG-BC) device architecture needs to be adopted. By further technology development, we realize such a memory FeFET that can be integrated with current state-of-the-art organic circuits on flexible substrates, as demonstrated in Chapter 4. Moreover, we employ this technology to fabricate a passive NAND array, as described in Chapter 5. The NAND architecture was chosen, as it offers the highest possible density of all transistor memory arrays. Despite the fact that passive arrays are more challenging to reliably address all FeFETs, we demonstrate a non-destructive read and write operation in the NAND array. Finally, novel device architecture and materials are explored to improve the memory characteristics in Chapter 6. Replacing pentacene with novel, high mobility semiconductors alone are proven to be unsuccessful to enlarge the memory window in the BG-BC FeFET. On the other hand, by adapting a planar heterojunction structure in the device, the memory window can be significantly enlarged by 30 - 60 %. The heterojunction device architecture is promising for further improvements, as many combinations of organic semiconducting materials are possible.

40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} steps towards {{the development of}} a low-cost wheelchair-mounted manipulator for use by the physically disabled and elderly. A detailed review of world rehabilitation robotics research has been conducted, covering fifty-six projects. This identified the main areas of research, their scope and results. From this review, a critical investigation of past and present wheelchair-mounted robotic arm projects was undertaken. This led to the formulation of the key design parameters in a final design specification. The results of a questionnaire survey of fifty electric wheelchair users is presented, which has for the first time established the needs and abilities of this disability group. An analysis of muscle type actuators, which mimic human muscle, is presented and their application to robotics, orthotics and prosthetics is given. A new type of rotary pneumatic muscle actuator, the flexator, is introduced and through extensive testing its performance characteristics elucidated. A review of direct-drive rotary pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical actuators has highlighted their relative performance characteristics and has rated their efficiency in terms of their peak torque to motor mass ratio, Tp/MM. From this, the flexator actuator has been shown to have a higher Tp/MM ratio than most conventional actuators. A novel kinematic arrangement is presented which combines the best features of the SCARA and vertically articulated industrial robot geometries, to form the 'Scariculated' arm design. The most appropriate actuator for each joint of this hybrid manipulator was selected, based on the criteria of high Tp/MM ratio, low cost, safety and compatibility. The final design incorporates conventional pneumatic linear double-acting cylinders, a vane type rotary actuator, two dual flexator actuators, and stepping motors for the fme control of the wrist/end effector. An ACSL simulation program has been developed which uses mass flow rate equations, based on one-dimensional compressible flow theory and suppressed critical pressure ratios, to simulate the dual flexator actuator. Theoretical and empirical data is compared and shows a high degree of correlation between results. Finally, the design and development work on two prototypes is discussed. The latest prototype consists of a five-axis manipulator whose pneumatic joints are driven by pulse width modulated solenoid valves. An 8051 microprocessor with proportional error feedback modilles the mark to space ratio of the PWM signal in proportion to the angular error of the joints. This enables control over individual joint speeds, <b>reprogrammable</b> <b>memory</b> locations and position monitoring of each joint. The integration of rehabilitation robotic manipulators into the daily lives of the physically disabled and elderly will significantly influence the role of personal rehabilitation in the next century...|$|E

40|$|Evolution {{requires}} {{information storage}} systems with different demands {{with respect to}} persistence. While the genome provides a mechanism for long term, static and accurate information storage, it is incapable of mediating adaptation to short term changes in the environment. Chromatin, however, constitutes a dynamic, <b>reprogrammable</b> <b>memory</b> with different levels of persistence. Moreover, chromatin states carry information not only in 2 D, i. e. {{in the structure of}} the primary chromatin fibre, but also in the 3 D organization of the genome in the nuclear space. The following thesis delves into the new bioinformatic and wet lab protocols developed to map, quantitative and functionally analyze the 3 D architecture of chromatin. The chromatin insulator protein CTCF is a major factor underlying the 3 D organization of the epigenome. We have uncovered, however, that CTCF binding sites within a regulatory region have multiple functions that are influenced by the chromatin environment and possibly the combinatorial usage of the 11 Zn-fingers of CTCF (Paper I). This observation exemplifies that understanding the function of dynamic and transient chromatin fibre interactions requires novel technology that enables the detection of 3 D chromatin folding with high resolution in single cells and in small cell populations. We therefore set out to devise a novel method for the visualization of higher order chromatin structures by combining the strengths of both DNA Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and In Situ Proximity Ligation Assay (ISPLA) technologies (Paper II). The resulting Chromatin in Situ Proximity (ChrISP) assay thus takes advantage of the direct contact detection of ISPLA and the locus-specific nature of FISH and uncovered the existence of compact chromatin structures at the nuclear envelope with unprecedented resolution. To complement ChrISP with a high throughput method capable of quantitatively recovering chromatin fibre contacts in small cell populations, we furthermore innovated the Nodewalk assay (Paper III). The protocol builds on existing ligation based chromosome conformation capture methods, but features significant reduction in the random ligation event frequency, inclusion of negative and positive ligation controls, iterative template resampling, increased signal to noise ratio and improved sensitivity. Using this technique, we have uncovered a cancer cell-specific, productive chromatin fibre interactome connecting the promoter and enhancer of c-MYC to a network of enhancers and super-enhancers. Underpinning this new protocol, I have developed the Nodewalk Analysis Pipeline (NAP) (Paper IV). This suite of tools consists of preprocessing, analysis and post-processing modules designed specifically for the rapid and efficient analysis of Nodewalk datasets through an interactive and user-friendly web based interface. Overall the work described in this thesis advances our understanding of the role of CTCF in nuclear organization and provides innovative wet lab techniques along with specialized software tools. Moreover, this work is an example of an emerging trend where the challenge of understanding chromatin dynamics within the 3 D nuclear architecture demands a close synergistic collaboration between the fields of biology, biotechnology and bioinformatics...|$|E

Exploiting the properties of inkjet printed electronics based on 2 d materials for wearable and textile electronics requires robust, stable and washable printed devices. Here we demonstrate fully inkjet printed 2 d material active heterostructures using graphene and hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) inks, and use them to fabricate all inkjet printed flexible and washable field effect transistors (FETs) on textile, reaching a field effect mobility of μ ~ 91 ± 29 cm 2 V- 1 s - 1 on polyester fabric, at low operating voltages (< 5 V). The devices maintained their performance even under ∼ 4 % strain and showed stable operation for periods up to 2 years, indicating the two-fold role of the h-BN layer as a flexible dielectric and encapsulant. Our graphene/h-BN FETs are washable up to 20 cycles, which is ideal for textile electronics. The viability of our process for printed and textile electronics is demonstrated by fully inkjet printing electronic circuits, such as <b>reprogrammable</b> volatile <b>memory</b> cells, complementary inverters, and OR logic gates with graphene/h-BN FETs.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and design of trusted computing platforms. Trusted computing technology {{is a relatively new}} enabling technology to improve the trustworthiness of computing platforms. With minor changes to the boot process and the addition of a new hardware security component, called TPM (Trusted Platform Module), trusted computing platforms offer the possibility to verifiably report their integrity to external parties (i. e., remote attestation) and to bind information to a specific platform (i. e., sealed storage). The first part of this thesis mainly focuses on the analysis of existing trusted computing platforms. We analyze the functionality provided by the specifications of the TCG (Trusted Computing Group) and purely software-based alternatives. Based on this analysis we present an improvement to a software-based attestation scheme: we propose to measure the execution time of a memory checksum function locally (with the time stamping functionality of the TPM) instead of remotely (over the network). We also study the resilience of trusted computing platforms against hardware attacks. We describe how attacks on the communication interface of the TPM can circumvent the measured boot process. The feasibility of these attacks is investigated in practice. Additionally we explore which operations should be targeted with a side channel attack to extracts the secret keys of a TPM. The second part of this thesis addresses some of the challenges to implement trusted computing technology on embedded and reconfigurable devices. One of the main problems when integrating a TPM into a system-on-chip design, is the lack of on-chip <b>reprogrammable</b> non-volatile <b>memory.</b> We develop schemes to securely externalize the non-volatile storage of a TPM. One scheme relies a new security primitive, called a reconfigurable physical unclonable function, and another extends the security perimeter of the TPM to the external memory with a cryptographic protocol. We propose a new architecture to reset the trust boundary to a much smaller scale, thus allowing for simpler and more flexible TPM implementations. The architecture has two distinctive features: the program code is stored outside the coprocessor and only gets loaded in RAM memory when needed, and the architecture is open by allowing to execute arbitrary programs in remotely verifiable manner. Finally, we study how the TPM can be implemented securely on reconfigurable hardware. This type of implementation is beneficial because it allows for updates of the software {{as well as of the}} hardware of the TPM (e. g., the cryptographic coprocessor) in the field. We examine the implementation options on reconfigurable hardware that is currently available commercially. Next, we propose a novel architecture that can measure and report the integrity of configuration bitstreams. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Background on Trusted Computing 1. 1. 1 Closed Platforms 1. 1. 2 Open Platforms 1. 1. 3 Secure Coprocessor 1. 1. 4 Trusted Computing Platforms 1. 1. 5 Compatibility with Legacy Operating System 1. 2 Thesis Outline and Contributions 2 Remote Attestation 2. 1 Attestation with Trusted Computing Platforms 2. 1. 1 Trusted Platform Module 2. 1. 2 TCG Functionality 2. 1. 3 Application Level Attestation 2. 2 Software-based Attestation on Legacy Platforms 2. 2. 1 Checksum Functions 2. 2. 2 Pioneer 2. 2. 3 Timed Executable Agent System 2. 3 Local Execution Time Measurement with TPMs 2. 3. 1 TPM Time Stamping 2. 3. 2 Improved Pioneer Protocol 2. 3. 3 Proxy Attacks 2. 3. 4 Experimental Results 2. 4 Conﬁguration Identification with Trusted Bootloader 2. 4. 1 Processor Identification 2. 4. 2 Runtime Checksum Performance Measurement 2. 5 Conclusion 3 Hardware Attacks 3. 1 Attacks on Trusted Computing Platforms 3. 1. 1 Attacks on the TPM 3. 1. 2 Attacks on the Platform 3. 2 Attacking the TPM Communication Bus 3. 2. 1 Passive Monitoring 3. 2. 2 Reset Attacks 3. 2. 3 Active Monitoring 3. 2. 4 Transport Session 3. 2. 5 LPC Bus Encryption 3. 2. 6 Integrated TPM 3. 3 Experimental Results 3. 3. 1 Reverse Engineering of TPM Daughterboard 3. 3. 2 Low Pin Count Bus 3. 3. 3 Analysis of Trusted Platform Communication 3. 4 Side-Channel Attacks on TPMs 3. 4. 1 Attacking the Endorsement Key 3. 4. 2 Attacking the Storage Root Key 3. 5 Conclusion 4 Non-Volatile State Protection 4. 1 Introduction 4. 1. 1 Mobile Trusted Module 4. 1. 2 Embedded Trusted Computing 4. 1. 3 Non-Volatile State 4. 1. 4 Monotonic Counters 4. 2 Protection of Non-Volatile State in External Memory 4. 2. 1 Security Requirements 4. 2. 2 Generic Approaches 4. 2. 3 Authenticated Encryption 4. 2. 4 Frequency of State Updates 4. 2. 5 Authentication Tree 4. 2. 6 On-Chip Non-Volatile Memory 4. 3 Physical Unclonable Function-Based Key Storage 4. 3. 1 Physical Unclonable Functions 4. 3. 2 Reliable Key Extraction with Fuzzy Extractors 4. 3. 3 Reconﬁgurable PUFs 4. 3. 4 Non-Volatile State Protection with RPUFs 4. 3. 5 Discussion 4. 4 Extending the Security Perimeter of the Trusted Module 4. 4. 1 Non-Volatile State Protection with External Authenticated NVM 4. 4. 2 Memory Authentication Protocols 4. 4. 3 Practical Aspects 4. 4. 4 Alternative Segregation of Responsibilities 4. 5 Conclusion 5 Flexible TPM Architecture 5. 1 Introduction 5. 1. 1 Related Work 5. 1. 2 Towards an Alternative TPM Architecture 5. 2 µTPM Architecture 5. 2. 1 Design Principles 5. 2. 2 Process Management 5. 2. 3 Memory Management 5. 2. 4 Firmware Integrity Measurement 5. 2. 5 Firmware Integrity Reporting 5. 3 Discussion 5. 3. 1 Implementation Options 5. 3. 2 Memory Externalization 5. 3. 3 Security Considerations 5. 4 Conclusion 6 Reconﬁgurable Trusted Computing 6. 1 FPGA Security 6. 1. 1 Attacker Objectives 6. 1. 2 Attacks 6. 1. 3 Defenses 6. 2 Trusted Computing on Commercial FPGAs 6. 2. 1 Protection of Non-Volatile State 6. 2. 2 Protection of the Bitstream 6. 2. 3 Field Updates 6. 3 Trusted FPGA Architecture 6. 3. 1 Underlying Model 6. 3. 2 Basic Idea and Design 6. 3. 3 Setup Phase 6. 3. 4 Operational Phase 6. 3. 5 TPM Updates 6. 3. 6 Discussion 6. 4 Conclusion 7 Conclusions and Future Work 7. 1 Conclusions 7. 2 Directions for Future Research Bibliographynrpages: 213 + 22 status: publishe...|$|R
