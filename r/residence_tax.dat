50|$|The <b>residence</b> <b>tax,</b> and in turn, the cédula, were {{abolished}} {{with the}} coming of American rule. No such tax would be imposed again until January 1, 1940, when Commonwealth Act No. 465 went into effect, mandating the imposition of a base <b>residence</b> <b>tax</b> of fifty centavos and an additional tax of one peso based on factors such as income and real estate holdings. The payment of this tax would merit the issue of a residence certificate. However, persons who are ineligible to pay the <b>residence</b> <b>tax</b> may be issued a certificate for twenty centavos.

In this framework, we show that differences in <b>residence</b> based <b>taxes</b> do not necessarily distort international ownership patterns. Moreover, tax competition yields globally efficient levels of source based corporate income <b>taxes</b> if <b>residence</b> based <b>taxes</b> on capital income are absent. In contrast, in the presence of <b>residence</b> based <b>taxes</b> on dividends, source based corporate income taxes are inefficiently high. The widespread view that tax coordination is less urgent if <b>residence</b> based <b>taxes</b> are available may therefore be misguided.

50|$|Following Philippine independence, {{the same}} {{provisions}} {{were kept in}} effect. However, the changing socio-political climate necessitated the reform of certain provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 465. Significant amendments to the <b>residence</b> <b>tax</b> law were put into effect first in 1973, following {{the enactment of the}} Local Tax Code, with amendments on the allocation of the <b>residence</b> <b>tax</b> and on who are covered under it, as well as payment provisions. The same provisions from the Local Tax Code were later subsumed into the Local Government Code of 1991. However, following the pull-out of U.S. forces from the Philippines, community tax exemptions on United States military personnel were likewise abolished, and the <b>residence</b> <b>tax</b> and residence certificate were renamed into the current community tax and community tax certificate.|$|E

40|$|Corporate <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> is {{fundamental}} to our federal income tax system. Whether a corporation is classified as “domestic” or “foreign” for U. S. federal income tax purposes determines the extent of tax jurisdiction the United States has over the corporation and its affiliates. Unfortunately, tax scholars seem {{to agree that the}} concept of corporate <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> is “meaningless. ” Underlying this perception are the ideas that corporations cannot have “real” residence because they are imaginary entities and because taxpayers can easily manipulate corporate <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> tests. Commentators try to deal with the perceived meaninglessness by either trying to identify a normative basis to guide corporate <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> determination, or by minimizing the relevance of corporate <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> to the calculation of tax liabilities. This Article argues that both of these approaches are misguided. Instead, this Article suggests a functional approach, under which corporate <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> models are designed to support the policy purposes of corporate taxation. This Article concludes that the U. S. should reform the way it defines “domestic” corporations for tax purposes by adopting a two-pronged <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> test: the place where the corporation’s securities are listed for public trading, or the place of the corporation’s central management and control...|$|R

40|$|Tax {{avoidance}} {{strategies of}} well-known U. S. multinationals such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Hewlett-Packard Co. have received much attention recently. Multinationals 2 ̆ 7 use of foreign shell entities to shift income {{away from the}} United States is subject to scrutiny. The debate is primarily about the sourcing of income, not about the <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> of the corporate entities involved. That is hardly surprising, because many view the <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> of corporations as meaningless. That meaninglessness is occasionally cited to support {{the adoption of a}} territorial system of taxation, in which residence is arguably less relevant for tax outcomes. This report summarizes some conclusions from a forthcoming Boston College Law Review article in which Marian recommends a fresh look at corporate <b>tax</b> <b>residence.</b> Marian argues that the perception of meaninglessness is a result of misguided normative discussion and that it cannot be avoided by adopting a territorial system. In his report, Marian develops a functional model under which corporate <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> tests are designed to support the policy purposes of corporate taxation, and the tests are not independently justified in normative terms. A functional approach suggests that the United States should adopt a corporate <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> test under which domestic corporations for tax purposes are corporations whose securities are listed for public trading in the United States, or whose place of central management and control is in the United States...|$|R
