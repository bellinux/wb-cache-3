2500|$|According to Thomas Kuhn, it was {{not till}} 1908 that Planck more or less {{accepted}} part of Einstein's arguments for physical as distinct from abstract mathematical discreteness in thermal <b>radiation</b> <b>physics.</b> Still in 1908, considering Einstein's proposal of quantal propagation, Planck opined that such a revolutionary step was perhaps unnecessary. Until then, Planck had been consistent in thinking that discreteness of action quanta was to be found neither in his resonant oscillators nor in the propagation of thermal radiation. Kuhn wrote that, in Planck's earlier papers and in his 1906 monograph, there is no [...] "mention of discontinuity, [...] of talk of a restriction on oscillator energy, [...] any formula like [...]" [...] Kuhn pointed out that his study of Planck's papers of 1900 and 1901, and of his monograph of 1906, had led him to [...] "heretical" [...] conclusions, contrary to the widespread assumptions of others who saw Planck's writing only {{from the perspective of}} later, anachronistic, viewpoints. Kuhn's conclusions, finding a period till 1908, when Planck consistently held his 'first theory', have been accepted by other historians.|$|E
