40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{shift to}} quality-based {{marketing}} has challenged the grain-handling industry to meet desired purity levels {{as part of}} identity-preservation programs. Very few resources are available {{for the development of}} management strategies. This study measured commingling during grain transfer as influenced by the receiving configuration of an elevator. The facility, located at Manhattan, Kansas, has three <b>receiving</b> <b>pits</b> and one bucket elevator with a handling capacity of 190 t/h (metric ton per hour). The experiments involved moving soybeans through one of the <b>receiving</b> <b>pits,</b> followed by corn through the same flow path, without special cleaning between the two operations. Corn samples, collected at specific time intervals, were used to calculate commingling, the percentage by mass of soybean kernels mixed in corn. Commingling was greater than 1 % only during the first 135 s (first 2 t, 2 metric ton, received), except for the gravity-type pit configuration where commingling remained in excess of 1 % {{for the duration of the}} test (840 s or 7. 3 t of grain). Measured mean cumulative commingling at the end of operation was 1. 25 %, 0. 30 %, and 0. 23 % for the combined effect of gravity-type pit and elevator leg, combined effect of elevator leg and pit with a drag conveyor, and effect of elevator leg, respectively. ARENA simulation was used to predict commingling using different levels of initial impurities of incoming grain. The model predicted that a 10 -t load through a pit with drag conveyor would result in a cumulative commingling of 0. 28 %, of which 0. 27 % would be from the effect of the elevator leg...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the challenges faced during micro-tunnelling process in Emirates of Dubai. In permeable grounds, {{the loss of}} slurry increases the cutter head torque and reduces penetration rates. Overcut is formed to provide space for converging ground and enables the evenly circulation of lubricant flow on the pipe line, as such buoyancy effects of fluid lubrication act on the pipe to lessen the drag during jacking. Micro-tunnelling techniques are used to reduce penetration resistance within the pipe string by providing sufficient uniform overcut and continuously injecting polymer lubricants. It is also observed that as the Urban area in Dubai is surrounded by built structures and numerous underground services, a special consideration is required to protect these services especially DEWA ED Cables. Also, the high ground water table, fractures within the rock and proximity of creek makes things very difficult to reduce the water table level in launching / <b>receiving</b> <b>Pit</b> and have difficulties in breaking the hard ground within the Pit.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Dust {{emissions}} from grain elevator operations {{can be a}} safety and health risk {{as well as a}} nuisance. Fundamental data on air entrainment and dust emission are needed for designing adequate and effective dust emission control methods. This study measured the amount of entrained air and emitted dust during corn receiving operations at an elevator operated by the USDA−ARS Grain Marketing and Production Research Center in Manhattan, Kansas. Shelled corn (maize) was unloaded from a storage bin, representing a hopper−bottom truck, to the <b>receiving</b> <b>pit</b> at rates of 17 to 262 kg/s and drop heights of 38 to 56 cm. Airflow rates were measured with propeller anemometers. The emission rates of total suspended particulates (TSP) and particulate matter smaller than 10 m aerodynamic diameter (PM 10) were measured with high−volume particulate samplers. The amount of air entrained per unit volume of grain decreased with increasing grain flow rate (0. 26 to 2. 07 m 3 /m 3). The emission rates of TSP (8. 3 to 52. 1 g/metric ton of grain received) and PM 10 (0. 6 to 6. 1 g/t) decreased with increasing grain flow rate and decreasing drop height...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Concern {{about the}} {{possible}} effects of genetically modified crops has increased the demand for segregating grains during handling and processing operations. Research {{on the amount of}} commingling of different grains in an elevator is limited. This study evaluated the level of commingling at a grain flow rate of 51 t/h (2000 bu/h) at the research elevator facility of the USDA-ARS, Grain Marketing and Production Research Center (GMPRC), Manhattan, Kansas. White corn was first loaded in the elevator followed by yellow corn. Samples were taken after the yellow corn had passed the elevator boot, weighing scale, and grain cleaner. Samples were sorted by color and components were weighed to determine commingling, defined as the percentage of unwanted grain in the total grain mass. Residual grain was also collected from each piece of equipment after each replication. Commingling for the first 380 kg (15 bu, approximately 1 % of the leg rate per hour) was approximately 4 %; it decreased to 0. 5 % within the first metric ton of load (2 % of the leg rate per hour). Residual grain in the dump pit and elevator boot amounted to 0. 24 % and 1. 41 % of the total load, respectively.

In {{an effort to}} prevent nodules developing, it has been widespread practice across Europe to irradiate intervention sites postprocedure—a practice known as prophylactic irradiation of tracts (PIT).

40|$|ABSTRACT. Grain {{handlers}} {{have responded}} to an increased use of specialty grain and the resulting need for grain segregation {{without the benefit of}} experimental data in the literature quantifying the commingling that may occur during grain handling. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of handling equipment on commingling and residual grain at an average grain flow rate of 47 t h- 1 (1852 bu h- 1) in the research elevator at the USDA-ARS Grain Marketing and Production Research Center in Manhattan, Kansas. Tests were done by first moving white corn through selected pieces of cleaned elevator equipment followed by moving yellow corn through the same equipment without any special clean out between the two operations. Commingling was calculated as the percentage of white kernels mixed in the yellow corn samples collected at selected time intervals during the second operation. Commingling was greater than 1 % during no more than the first 38 sec and always decreased to less than 0. 5 % within the first metric ton of load (76 sec) for all tested equipment. The highest cumulative commingling for tests of one truckload (ca. 7. 3 t) was 0. 24 % for the grain cleaner. Mean cumulative commingling values for the other handling equipment were 0. 22 %, 0. 01 %, and 0. 18 % for the weighing scale, grain scalper, and the combined effect of dump pit and boot, respectively. The residual grain obtained from cleaning the equipment after the test was highest at the elevator boot (120 kg), followed by the <b>receiving</b> <b>pit</b> (20 kg). The amounts of residual grain collected from the weighing scale, grain cleaner, and grain scalper were negligible (< 1 kg) by comparison...|$|E
40|$|This {{secondary}} {{analysis of}} a trial on brief psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy (PIT) for patients with multisomatoform disorder investigated whether alexithymia moderates the associations between the therapeutic alliance and the outcome of PIT and whether moderating effects of alexithymia remain significant when controlling for depression. Eighty-three patients with multisomatoform disorder <b>receiving</b> <b>PIT</b> were statistically analyzed. Moderation analyses were performed with the SPSS macro PROCESS. The primary outcome (Y), self-reported physical quality of life at 9 -month {{after the end of}} PIT, was measured with the physical component summary (PCS) of the SF- 36 Health Survey. The potential moderator (M) alexithymia was operationalized with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS- 20) at pre-treatment and the predictor (X) the therapeutic alliance was rated by both patients and therapists via the Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAQ) at the end of PIT. Moreover, the PCS at pre-treatment functioned as covariate in all moderation models. When the patients’ alliance ratings were analyzed, alexithymia did not moderate associations between the alliance and the outcome. When the therapists’ alliance ratings were evaluated, alexithymia moderated the relationship between the alliance and the outcome (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) : a stronger alliance in the therapists’ perspective was beneficial for the outcome only for patients scoring above 61 on the TAS- 20. This moderating effect of alexithymia was, however, not statistically significant anymore when adding the pre-treatment depression scores (PHQ- 9) as a covariate to the moderation model. The results underline the importance of a good therapists’ view of the alliance when treating alexithymic patients and highlight the complex interaction between alexithymia and depression.

The invited list of attendees and the meeting attendance sheet are included in attachment 1. The design modifications that were reviewed are documented in ECN 654484 (attachment 2). The requirement that the design is to be verified against is to ''center the transportation cask sufficiently to allow installation of the guide funnel on the cask ({+-} 0. 25 inches or less) ''. The alternatives considered are detailed in attachment 3. Alternative number 4, ''Modify The Pit Guides'', {{was determined to be}} the preferred alternative primarily due to considerations of simplicity, reliability, and low cost. Alternative 1, ''Rotate the impact Absorber 180 {sup o}'', was successfully performed but was considered a temporary fix that was not acceptable for a long term operational mode. The requirement to position the receiving crane accurately enough to lower the transportation cask into the pit with the redesigned guides was discussed and considered to be achievable without undue effort from the operator. The tolerance on the OD of the transfer cask was discussed ({+-} 1 / 8 inch) relative to the clearance with the guides. As-built dimensions for the cask OD will be looked at to verify sufficient clearance exists with the maximum cask OD. The final design thickness of the shims under the guides will be based on the as-built cask OD dimensions and field measurements between the pit guides. The need for a ''plastic'' cover for the guides was discussed and deemed unnecessary. Thermal growth of the cask OD was calculated at 3 - 5 mils and considered insignificant. The possibility of reducing the OD of the guide funnel was reviewed but this was considered impractical due to the requirement for the MCO to miss the edge of the funnel in case of a MCO drop. One of the transportation casks have the lift trunions installed 3 / 8 inch off center. This is not expected to present a problem, but needs to be verified. Operations personnel were not in attendance to discuss the method for lowering the cask into the pit, however it was the consensus of those who observed the lowering operation performed by startup that it is operationally viable. The proposed design will be presented to Operations for review prior to issuance of the ECN. The final conclusion of the attendees is that the design meets the requirement ''center the cask sufficiently to allow installation of the guide funnel. '...|$|E

The fortresses {{at the end of the}} stages are labyrinths with non-scrolling rooms, in which the player must find and defeat a gatekeeper boss. Within a fortress, Pit may buy a check sheet, pencil and torch to guide him through the labyrinth. A single-use item, the hammer, can destroy stone statues, which frees a flying soldier called a Centurion that will aid the player in boss battles. For each of the bosses destroyed, <b>Pit</b> <b>receives</b> one of three sacred treasures that are needed to access the fourth and final stage, the sky temple. This last portion abandons the platforming elements of the previous levels, and resembles a scrolling shooter.|$|R
2500|$|This set {{the stage}} for the final round in Japan. Hunt's late season charge pulled him to just three points behind Lauda. The sliding scale of points for the top six {{finishers}} meant that Hunt needed to finish third (4-points) or better to overtake Lauda coupled with Lauda earning too few points to stay ahead. McLaren team manager Alastair Caldwell had taken advantage of the gap between the final two races to hire the Fuji circuit - a track hosting its first Grand Prix and therefore unknown to all the teams - for an exclusive McLaren test. After a few laps the gearbox seized, bringing the test to a premature close, but the team had had the advantage of acclimatising themselves to the new circuit. Conditions for the race itself were torrentially wet. Lauda retired early on in the race, unable to blink because of facial burns from his accident in Germany. After leading most of the race Hunt suffered a puncture, then had a delayed pitstop and finally <b>received</b> mixed <b>pit</b> signals from his team. But he managed to finish in third place, scoring four points, enough for him to win the World Championship by one point. gives Hunt title."] Ottawa Citizen, 26 October 1976, p. 19. Hunt was the last British Formula One champion until Nigel Mansell won the 1992 championship for Williams. [...] He was, relatively, one of the cheapest F1 World Champions ever, having signed at the last minute for $200,000 – a scenario similar to that of 1982 Champion Keke Rosberg.|$|R
