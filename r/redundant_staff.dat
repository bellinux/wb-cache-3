25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy <b>redundant</b> <b>staff</b> within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{state-owned}} enterprises in competitive profession generally take a separation way that " hang difficult problems up " making the key {{business and the}} relevant good assets peel off, reorganize and get listed on the stock market. The listing part among them is known as continuing enterprises. The problem of continuing enterprises, to a great extent, it is a not thorough result of SOE reform. Because market system is unripe and the supervisory system is imperfect, {{in a situation that}} their reorganized and reformed system has been fulfilled, a considerable amount of {{state-owned enterprises}} adopt discrete scheme of reforming system, isolating a large amount of non-core business, low commercial ability assets and <b>redundant</b> <b>staff</b> from the continuing enterprises to construct "good assets " which can reach the requirements of listing on the stock market. This kind of method has met demand at one o'clock of smooth listing and financing of state-owned enterprise, but has failed to solve the problem fundamentally, so as to make the contradiction must be faced straightly during the deepening of the state-owned enterprise reform concentrated in the continuing enterprises.

Method: This is a cross-sectional definitive study conducted in three general and six specialized SUMS hospitals. The research tool used was a checklist that determines the number of nurses, paraclinic and service employees and finally the decrease and increase of human resources in the departments of the hospitals regarding Iranian Ministry of Health (MOH) issues.
