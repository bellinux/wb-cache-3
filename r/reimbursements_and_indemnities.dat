40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) and commuter rail agencies often share rights-of-way {{with each other and}} with freight railroads. Negotiating agreements that govern the shared use of infrastructure can be challenging, especially on issues such as liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity.</b> As requested, this report discusses (1) the liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions in agreements among passenger and freight railroads, and the resulting implications of these provisions; (2) federal and state court opinions and Surface Transportation Board (STB) decisions related to contractual liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions of passenger and freight railroad agreements; (3) factors that influence the negotiations of liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions among passenger and freight railroads; and (4) potential options for facilitating negotiations of liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions. GAO obtained information from all existing and proposed commuter rail agencies, Amtrak, and major freight railroads through site visits or telephone interviews. GAO analyzed the liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions in agreements between commuter rail agencies, Amtrak, and freight railroads. GAO also reviewed federal and state laws, STB decisions, and court cases related to liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions. The Department of Transportation and STB had no comments on the report. Amtrak provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{first section}} {{describes}} {{the historical development of}} contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity,</b> from {{a contractual obligation}} to a court implied obligation followed by an expansion to various federally regulated fields. The second section investigates the ERISA fiduciary sections, their differences with traditional trust law, their legislative history, and the purposes of ERISA. The third section examines the position of the various federal courts on the issue of contribution or <b>indemnity</b> <b>and</b> their rationales, along with that of the commentators. Since ERISA generally does not permit actions against nonfiduciaries, this article excludes those opinions dealing with contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> between a fiduciary and a non-fiduciary, most of which appeared prior to the Supreme Court's pronouncement with respect to non-fiduciaries. The fourth section provides the solution pursuant to the Supreme Court's directive for finding contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> for a federal statute, finds that the statutory language does not support contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity,</b> <b>and</b> shows that the solution of disallowing contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> comports with the legislative history and the purposes of ERISA...|$|R
