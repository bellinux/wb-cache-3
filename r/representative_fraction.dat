Here we describe a system that allows high channel count recordings from a small volume of neuronal tissue using a lightweight signal multiplexing head-stage that permits free behavior of small rodents. The system integrates multi-shank, high-density recording silicon probes, ultra-flexible interconnects and a miniaturized microdrive. These improvements allowed for simultaneous recordings of local field potentials and unit activity from hundreds of sites without confining free movements of the animal. The advantages of large-scale recordings are illustrated by determining the electro-anatomical boundaries of layers and regions in the hippocampus and neocortex and constructing a circuit diagram of functional connections among neurons in real anatomical space. These methods will allow the investigation of circuit operations and behavior-dependent inter-regional interactions for testing hypotheses of neural networks and brain function...|$|R

The RNA formed in this manner, however, was (i) several times longer than normal transcripts, indicating a defect in chain termination and/or cleavage of nascent RNA, (ii) was not polyadenylylated (although free polyadenylic acid formed), and (iii) was not extruded from the virus cores.

In this study, a two-dimensional purification method based on reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography was successfully applied to purify saponins from leaves of Panax notoginseng. Nine saponin reference standards were used to test the separation modes and columns. The standards could not be resolved using C- 18 columns owing to their limited polar selectivity. However, they were completely separated on a XAmide column in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography mode, including two pairs of standards that were coeluted on a C- 18 column. The elution order of the standards on the two columns was sufficiently different, with a correlation coefficient between retention times on the C- 18 and XAmide columns of 0. 0126, indicating good column orthogonality. Therefore, the first-dimension preparation was performed on a C- 18 column, followed by a XAmide column that was used to separate the fractions in the second dimension.
