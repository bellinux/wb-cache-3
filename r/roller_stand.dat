This paper focus on the analysis of sand casting parameters for casting trash plate applicable for <b>roller</b> <b>stand</b> used in sugar factories. The problems in casting the trash plate from steel of varius grades are porosity,sand sintering,shrinkage,miss run, cold shut and other related defects. In this particular research manganes steel 46 MnSi 4 {{was used as a}} material for the production of the mentioned plate. Thus the objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the parameters affecting the quality of the the trash plate casting in order to establish standars that provide sound casting. To carry out the research mixied (experimental and therotical) methods that include physical observation, photographic analysis, intrview, testing and simulation methods were used. Purposive and convenience sampling technique were used for sample selection and sampling. Modeling of trash plate and gating system elements were first developed using CATIA software and simulation was carried out to show thermal history and solidification process of the plate using ANSYS software. The clay content and GFN of molding sand (silica) used were tested and result was found 6. 983 % and 49. 805 respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Numerous {{conventional}} <b>roller</b> gin <b>stands</b> were {{modified to}} run at high speed in commercial ginning plants in 2005 and 2006. The high-speed stands ginned both Pima and upland cotton. Results from a field test at a commercial ginning plant that compared roller ginning (including one high-speed stand) and saw ginning using one upland cultivar showed that HVI color grade, staple length, uniformity, and fiber value were improved when using the <b>roller</b> gin <b>stands.</b> Results from the 2006 California crop showed similar improvements in staple length and uniformity when comparing roller-ginned upland cotton (which included conventional and high-speed stands) and saw-ginned upland cotton.

40|$|The direct {{operating}} costs of aircraft are highly driven by the structural weight. To achieve lower structural weight the material of selected structures is changed from aluminum to lighter Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP). To fulfill the high demand for new aircraft and thus high production rates, rapid processes for curved CFRP-frames are needed. The Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process has a high potential for fast and cost effective manufacturing of CFRP frames. Within the RTM-Process the preforming is one essential step for high quality components. A new preforming line developed at DLR using roll-forming techniques and Non-Crimp-Fabrics (NCF) provides a highly accurate fiber orientation along the complete length of the preform. This automated and continuous manufacturing process is characterized by draping NCF material with two <b>roller</b> <b>stands</b> rotating at different speeds. To use the full potential of the automation {{a thorough understanding of}} the material behavior is essential for an efficient and appropriate process. Within this paper the material parameters are further characterized by a newly developed draping test emulating the forming process. Parameters of different NCF-Materials were defined and compared to the automated manufacturing behavior. These parameters allow a higher feed rate thus leading to higher production rates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} roller bearing fault {{diagnosis}} method with harmonic wavelet packet and Decision Tree-Support Vector Machine (DT-SVM). The harmonic wavelet packet possesses better performances for its box-shaped spectrum and unlimited subdivision {{compared with the}} conventional time-frequency feature exaction method. Firstly, the proposed method decomposes the roller bearing vibration signal with harmonic wavelet packet and extracts the feature energy with coefficients of each spectrum. After the feature energy is normalized, feature vector are available. Based on multi-level binary tree, this paper designs the multi-classification SVM model due to its superior nonlinear mapping capability. Three two-classifications are incorporated to diagnosis the roller bearing faults. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated with the vibration data from the <b>roller</b> bearing <b>stand</b> of electric engineering lab in case western reserve university. Experimental results illustrate the higher accuracy of the proposed method compared with conventional method...|$|R
2500|$|In September 2012 the Charlotte City Council {{discussed}} {{plans for}} a proposed roller coaster {{in one of its}} meetings and it was revealed the ride would cost approximately $30 million.

On October 18, January 23, 2014, and June 9, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, the owners of Carowinds, filed trademark applications for the names Centurion, Fury, and Fury 325. In February, the Centurion trademark was suspended after another trademark application using the same name was found by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In July, the blueprints for Fury 325 were leaked showing the exact layout of the roller coaster. At the beginning of August, the park sent a beekeeper to deliver a partially burnt bug net with a card saying, [...] "you're gonna need a much bigger net to capture the thrills of the 2015 Carowinds season", to several media outlets in the Charlotte area. On August 12, a microsite on Carowinds' website was found advertising a new ride called Centurion. A similar hoax was conducted by Kings Island leading up to the announcement of Banshee in 2013.|$|R

50|$|Using this walkway {{is similar}} to using any other moving walkway, except that there are special {{procedures}} to follow when entering or exiting at either end. On entering, there is a 10-metre acceleration zone where the 'ground' {{is a series of}} metal <b>rollers.</b> Riders <b>stand</b> still with both feet on these rollers and use one hand to hold the handrail and let it pull them so that they glide over the rollers. The idea is to accelerate the riders so that they will be traveling fast enough to step onto the moving walkway belt. Riders who try to walk on these rollers are at significant risk of falling over. Once on the walkway, riders can stand or walk as on an ordinary moving walkway. At the exit, the same technique is used to decelerate the riders. Users step onto a series of rollers which decelerate them slowly, rather than the abrupt halt which would otherwise take place.|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} results of experiments {{carried out to}} investigate the impact of modelled {{conditions of the vehicle}} operation and its environment on the coefficient of friction in the disc brake friction pair. The influence of these factors on the scatter of values of the coefficient of friction was analysed. The tests were carried out in laboratory conditions on a test stand provided with appropriate instruments and equipment. The friction pair was modelled by a set-up of materials as used in passenger car brakes, consisting of a cast-iron brake disc and composite brake pads. Time histories of the coefficient of friction in the friction pair were tested at various operating conditions (rotational speed of the brake disc, number of braking cycles) and environmental factors (presence of water or brake fluid in the friction area). Changes in the surface roughness of the cast-iron brake disc resulting from the application of various brake pad materials and from different operating conditions and parameters set on the test stand were examined as well. The histories and values of the parameters measured as recorded during the tests were used as input material for analyses. The results of the research work and the conclusions drawn that are applicable to the analysis of criteria of the acceptable differences between the braking forces measured on diagnostic <b>roller</b> test <b>stands</b> have been presented here in a synthetic form...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the lateral {{stability}} for a railway vehicle. Particularly, nonlinear critical speed is investigated via bifurcation anal-ysis. Shooting method and trust region algorithm are applied to calculate the limit cycle of the nonlinear dynamic vehicle model. In case of the investigated vehicle model, the influences of the suspension parameters on the critical speeds are not large. The effects of friction coefficient are also small. However, there is an overall consistency that the nonlinear critical speed is decreased when the stiffness of the suspension is reduced. Study of the excitation conditions where the stable limit cycles occur gives very useful information to understand the nonlinear dynamic behavior of a railway vehicle and to test the vehicle with <b>roller</b> rig test <b>stands.</b> According to the results, the direc-tion of the excitation is very important {{as well as the}} amplitude and frequency to acquire accurate nonlinear critical speed...|$|R
