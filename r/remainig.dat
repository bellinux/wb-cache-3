The fatigue damage is quantified {{in terms of the}} initiation and growth of surface microcracks by means of the replica method. The evolving dislocation and phase microstructures are characterized in a semi-quantitative way. Neither the US-velocities nor the US-critical angle are significantly influenced by the fatigue damage. The same holds for the specific electric conductivity. However, both the US-absorption and the resonance frequency show significant changes with increasing life fraction, which are suggested to be caused by the evolving dislocation microstructure and by surface cracking, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Mobile Adhoc Network {{consists}} {{of a large number}} of mobile nodes that communicate with each other in the absence of any fixed infrastructure. In such an environment each node must work as router to forward the data packets in the network. The principle characteristics of ad hoc network are the dynamic topology and the limited energy of mobile nodes. Nodes in the network are dependent on limited battery power for their operations. One of the major issue in providing QoS in these network. QoS service cannot be guarentted without managing the link failures. One of the reasons for link failure is discharge of battery. Link failure causes packet drop and reinitailization of route finding process which leads to lot of bandwidth consumption, decrese in throughput and increase in delay. Here, in this paper we are proposing a new approach for minimizing the link failure. The basic idea behind the proposed work is to find more stable path from source to destination in terms of <b>remainig</b> life time of battery...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to estimate osteoporotic hip fracture incidence rates, by age and gender, and lifetime fracture risk of women of different age groups over 45 in Spain, and to determine the expected number of fractures and fracture-related person-years of functional impairment, as a basis for estimating the social costs of osteoporosis in Spain and the avoided costs of fractures in future cost-effectiveness analyses. The natural history of disease, recognised from fractures, is described using a Markov model and Monte Carlo simulations. Four cohorts of 10. 000 women, each of a different age group, were simulated. Data were obtained from six hospitals of different size and geographical setting, to allow for diferences in hospital service structure. Patients included were all new cases of hip fracture who were attended in those hospitals in 1995. Results are extrapolated to the spanish population based on 1991 census. Results predict in the group of women aged 50 an over in Spain 968. 000 osteoporotic hip fractures during their <b>remainig</b> lifetime, with a total amount of 1. 013. 000 fractures. Some 135. 000 will become functionally impaired due to the fractures, acconting for 1. 177. 000 person-years of functional impairment.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the frequency of depression in osteoporotic and osteopenic women and to determine the relationship between depression and lifestyle, level of education and some risk factors of osteoporosis. Sixty-one osteopenic or osteoporotic postmenopausal women were included in this retrospective study. Patients’ lifestyle, risk factors, pain and depression levels were evaluated by means of lifestyle questionnaire, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively. The women were divided into two groups as osteopenic and osteoporotic according to WHO criteria. The mean age and menopause duration of the subjects were 61. 7 ± 5. 2 and 18. 9 ± 9. 7 years, respectively. Fourty-six percent of women were found to be osteoporotic and the <b>remainig</b> were osteopenic according to the bone density measurement. As the results of lifestyle questionnaire, 73. 8 % of the patients were housewife, 45. 9 % graduated from primary school, and 14. 8 % were exercising regularly. The mean VAS and BDI scores were 5. 4 ± 2. 01 cm and 17. 2 ± 9. 8, respectively. According to BDI scores, 30. 8 % of women had moderate, and 7. 7 % had severe depression. There were negative correlations between BDI score and education level (r= - 0. 300, p= 0. 031), as well as BDI and history of exercise (r=- 0. 285, p= 0. 041). However, positive correlations were found between exercise and level of education (r= 0. 340 p= 0. 007), and Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) (r= 0. 430 p= 0. 001).

40|$|The {{assessment}} of material mechanical properties degradation {{as a result}} of long-term service at cyclic loading, creep temperatures and/or their combination has been performed on the basis of various non-destructive methods. Nevertheless, their main disadvantage {{stems from the fact that}} these methods can give qualitative (and not quantitative) results and thus the remaining lifetime cannot be exactly evaluated. New methods of mechanical testing were developed recently that are based on making use of miniature test specimens (e. g. Small Punch Test). The most important advantage of these method is the nearly non-destructive withdrawal of test material and small size of test specimen what is interesting in cases of remaining lifetime assessment when a sufficient volume of the representative material cannot be withdrawn of the component in question. In opposite, the most important disadvantage of such methods stems from the necessity to correlate test results with the results of classical test procedures and to build up a database of material data in service. The correlations among the miniature test specimen data and the results of classical tensile tests, fracture toughnesss values and time to rupture characteristics at creep temperatures and, of course fatigue S – N curves are necessary for the <b>remainig</b> lifetime {{assessment of}} structure in long-time service.

40|$|During {{a three-year}} period (1989 - 91), all {{patients}} living in the county of Uppsala, Sweden, with a radiographically verified fracture of the clavicle were prospectively, consecutively followed (n= 245). The epidemiological study (I) was restricted to the two first years with 187 fractures in 185 patients. The short term study (II) with 6 months follow-up included 222 patients. The long term study (III) with 10 years follow-up included 208 patients. The malunion study (IV) included eight patients and the nonunion study (V) 24 patients {{all of whom were}} consecutively operated between 1988 - 2000. Displacement, especially with no bony contact in the initial radiographs, was a statistically significant risk factor for sequelae. Comminute fractures, especially if including transversally placed fragments, were associated with a significantly increased risk of remaining symptoms. An increasing number of fragments was also associated with an increased risk of sequelae. Patients with <b>remainig</b> symptoms after 6 months were on average older at the time of injury as compared to patients without remaining symptoms. Advancing age was also a significant risk factor for sequelae – specifically pain at rest – still after 10 years. There was no difference between gender with respect to the risk of sequelae, except for nonunion. Fracture location did not predict outcome, except for more cosmetic defects (middle part). Shortening defined as overlapping at the fracture site was a significant risk factor for cosmetic defects after 10 years. Patients who experience pain at rest and/or cosmetic defects more than twelve weeks after the fracture have a higher risk for sequelae. The radiographic examination should always consist of two projections: the AP (0 °) view and the 45 ° tilted view. Transversally placed fragments are not seen in the 0 ° view. Removal of excessive callus in patients with persistent symptoms even several years after the fracture showed a good outcome.

In this he uses the statistical data rahter than the empirical results. He analyses the following: global changes in population structure of SR Slovenia, changes in structure of agricultural households, changes in the size of farms, sources and structure of income in agricultural households, as well as the structure of consumption in agricultural and part- -time households. The author has established that in the villages of SR Slovenia a process of dissolving of the agricultural population is talcing place. As the number of pure agricultural households is decreasing, the number of »proletarian« households is increasing. The intermediate stratum of part-time farmes — part- -tirne workers is very numerous. Urbanization is not due to stronger concentration of population in towns, but to the fact that villages are becoming urbanized. The rural population is, namely, leaving agriculture as a profession, and is taking jobs in non-agricu 2 ̆ 7 Itural activities, <b>remainig,</b> however, to live mostly in the village. Therefore, the Slovenian village of today is no more a synonym for a rural settlement. Out of the total of 515 thousands of households in SR Slovenia only 12 percent are agricultural, 14 percent are part-time agricultural and 74 percent are non-agricultural. Agricultural households are rapidly changing into part- -time ones, in order to finally become non-agricultural. The number of active members in agricultural households stagnates, so that today there are mostly elder people. In mixed households women are those, who mostly work on the farm and in the barnyard. Agricultural households, without regard to the existing unfavourable structure of workers, live today much better than before, due to the specialization in agricultural production and placing on market of surplus- goods. The money, earned in this way, is being invested Into agricultural expanded reproduction and furnishing of farms and only after this, into housing construction and savings. The part-time agricultural households (whose financial consumption is larger than in agricultural ones) invest also mostly into furnishing of farms, although less than agricultural households. However, mixed households invest more in the increase of housing standard and in furnishing of households than agricultural ones do, and their installments as well as savings are higher. Shortly, part-time agricultural households in Slovenia live today considerably better than pure agricultural households...|$|E
40|$|Abstract More {{and more}} up-to date {{equipment}} in the health-care sector makes the treatment of fractures possible, especially by means of surgery. However, not every patient is indicated for surgery. Even today, {{we can see a}} patient with the extension at the standard and intensit care units. Therefore, nurses must know {{how to take care of}} this patient and how to prevent the risk of immobilization syndrome in patient with extension that may cause many serious complications. The aims of this study were to identify the negative factors affecting a development of the immobilization syndrome in a patient with the extension, to compare the differences in the use of immobilization devices to prevent the immobilization syndrome in a patient with the extension at the standard and intensive care unit and to determine whether patients with extension are familiar with possibility of the immobilization syndrome. Four hypotheses have been defined. In the first hypothesis we assumed that inconveniently selected positioning affected the emergence of the immobilization syndrome. This hypothesis was confirmed. Inconveniently selected positioning is most often involved in the immobilization syndrome. In the second hypothesis we assumed that inconvenient hygienic care affected the emergence of the immobilization syndrome. This hypothesis was also confirmed. The insufficient hygienic care affects a development of the immobilization syndrome. In the third hypothesis we assumed that the intensive care unit used more up-to-date equipment to take care of a patinet with the extension compared to the standard unit. This hypothesis was also confirmed. The intensive care units used more up-to-date equipment to take care of a patinet with the extension compared to the standard unit. In the fourth hypothesis we assumed that patients with extension had no information about the possibility of the imobilization syndrome. This hypothesis was disproved. The patients with the extension are informed about the possibility of the immobilization syndrome. The nurses at the standard and intensive care units in Hospital České Budějovice, a. s.

40|$|One crucial {{function}} of the ruminant‘s omasum is the absorption of huge amounts of HCO 3 - in exchange with chloride {{in order to prevent}} an excessive formation of gas in the abomasum. Moreover, it guarantees a sufficient drop of the pH in the abomasum. Concerning the effective transepithelial transport of HCO 3 - two requirements must be met: a) effective regulation of the internal pH and b) provision of the apical anion exchanger. The regulation of subapical pHi depends very likely primarily on the activity of Na+/H+ exchange, which is required for the compensation of H+ uptake via HSCFA. The absorption of HCO 3 - in exchange with chloride requires subapical chloride and an according chloride-gradient for the passive anion exchange. This gradient is primarily achieved through NaCl-Cotransport. Thus the activity of NaCl-Cotransport is an important condition for the provision of HCO 3 [...] Transport. Moreover subapical chloride is needed for the activity of the NHE and therefore also for pH-regulation. HCO 3 [...] Transport thus shows an indirect dependence to the electroneutral Na+ transport (NHE and NaCl-Cotransport). The underlying study provides detailed conclusions to the electroneutral Na+ transport investigating its characteristics, kinetics and regulatory mechanisms. 1. Kinetics of the electroneutral Na+ transport a. Electroneutral Na+ transport showed with a pH of 7. 4 as well as with a pH of 6. 4 a saturation kinetic on the mukosal site, according to a Michaelis-Menten type kinetic. Saturation is noticed at a luminal Na+ concentration of about 40 mM. b. pH-dependent stimulation of electroneutral Na+ transport could be inhibited by amiloride. This means the stimulation is realized through a rise in activity of the NHE. Maximum transport (Vmax) was higher at pH-value of 6. 4 than 7. 4. c. The NHE seems to start its activity at a luminal concentration of 12 mM Na+. NaCl-Cotransporter starts its activity at 25 mM Na+. Below these Na+ concentrations, a limitation of the HCO 3 [...] Transport – which depends on a gradient of chloride - could occur. 2. Differentiation of electroneutral Na+ transport a. 1 mM of NHE-inhibitor amiloride and 1 mM of the NaCl-Cotransport-inhibitor hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) showed no additive effect on Na+ transport. b. S 3226, an inhibitor of the NHE 3 -Isoform, showed effects at the omasal epithelia with a concentration of 1 µM. There {{was no significant difference between}} Jnet Na+ and the short circuit current in the presence of this inhibitor. Therefore there was no <b>remainig</b> electroneutral Na+ transport after the addition of 1 µM S 3226 on the mucosal side. This is evidence to the existence of the NHE 3 -Isoform on the apical membrane of the omasum. c. 1 mM amiloride and 1 µM S 3226 showed an additive effect. Amiloride seemed to have a lower sensitivity than S 3226. d. In its effective dosage of 1 µM, S 3226 showed no effect on the serosal side. e. The NHE 1 -Isoform-Inhibitor, HOE 642, showed no effect on the mukosal side. 3. Trafficking a. The addition of 1 nmol wortmannin on the mucosal side showed no effect on the Na+ transport. There was no influence on the stimulation of Na+/H+-exchange through lowering the pH on the mucosal side. There is no evidence for trafficking on the luminal side of the omasum as a possible mechanism for rising of NHE-activity. 4. Correlation of Jms und Jsm Na+ a. Jms and Jsm Na+ could be ‘decoupled’ using a concentration of more than 50 mM Acetat at a pH of 6. 4. This supports the assumption of the possible existence of two parallel working Na+/Na+ exchangers on the apical and serosal membrane. According to this the apical Na+/Na+ exchanger could substitute in a Na+/H+ exchanger. This could be a possible kind of ‘servomechanism’ for the pH-regulation of the cell. b. The increasing difference between Jms und Jsm Na+ while the ‘decoupling’ could be eliminated through 1 µM S 3226. Thus the increase of Jms Na+ is due to a rise of activity of a NHE 3 -Isoform. The specific way of activation needs further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Investigations on {{piroplasmosis}} {{in domestic}} cats in South Africa Domestic cats originating {{from an area}} in South Africa known to be endemic for babesiosis were included in an investigation on feline piroplasmosis. In order to receive some information about the range of species involved, molecular biological methods were used to characterize the causal agents genotypically. Two segments of the rDNA gene, the regions of the 18 S and {{of the first and}} second internal transcribed spacers (ITS) were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Based on these sequence data a modern and sensitive diagnostic test for a specific detection of B. felis, a real-time PCR, was developed and validated. Using this test, 206 blood samples of cats belonging to the patients of a small animal surgery in Port Elizabeth were screened for infections with B. felis and the test results were compared with results of examinations of stained blood smears and an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Sequence analysis of the 18 S rDNA and comparison with available sequence data from the Genbank NCBI demonstrated that at least 2, possibly 3 species are responsible for piroplasm infections in domestic cats in Port Elizabeth. The species B. felis was diagnosed in 11 of the 13 isolates. In one isolate, K 8, the parasites were identified as B. leo, a piroplasm species which had been documented to occur in lions before. This represents the first detection of B. leo in a naturally infected domestic cat. The sequence of the isolate K 68 could not be assigned to any known species, but it was closely related to the other feline piroplasms. The genetic relationship was slightly closer to B. leo with an identity of 98, 3 % than to B. felis where an identity of 97, 8 % was found. Compared to two other feline piroplasms isolated from a caracal, Babesia sp. Caracal Strain A and B, the isolate K 68 shared identities of 96, 8 % and 96, 7 % respectively. Phylogenetic trees clearly separated the isolate K 68 from the other feline piroplasms indicating a separate species status. Furthermore the results of the IFAT support a separation at least from B. felis. The isolate did not show any cross reactions with B. felis antigen. However, the parasites could not be differentiated from B. felis or B. leo in stained blood smears. In phylogenetic analyses including several Babesia and Theileria species all the feline piroplasm species of the present study were grouped together with B. rodhaini, B. microti and T. annae and seperated from the group of the `typical´ babesia and the classical theileria. When sequence analyses of the ITS rDNA of the 13 selected isolates were performed, the 11 isolates diagnosed as B. felis showed a polymorphism rate of 2, 6 % and high pairwise identities between 98, 6 % and 99, 9 %. The sequences of the isolate K 8, already identified as B. leo, and of the isolate K 68 were less homologous with identities of 77, 0 % and 76, 0 % respectively compared with B. felis. In the phylogenetic tree the isolates K 8 and K 68 were clearly separated from each other and from the B. felis – isolates. This supports the existence of three distinct species. For one isolate, the isolate K 60, the intraisolate variation was determined in more detail. 7 different genotypes were found. 6 of them were very similar to B. felis and showed sequence identities between 97, 2 % and 99, 6 %. The sequence of the genotype 7, clone K 60 E. 2, clearly differed from the other genotypes. With an identity of 76, 9 % to B. felis the sequence could not be assigned to any hitherto described species. In phylogenetic analyses this clone K 60 E. 2 was more closely related to B. leo and K 68 than to the B. felis isolates. Based on the sequence data of the ITS rDNA, a real-time PCR method was developed for the specific detection of B. felis. This test was proven to be sensitive and very specific in a blinded, externally controlled evaluation. The specifity was shown to be 100 %. The sensitivity of the test was 75 %. The positive prediction value reached 100 % and the negative prediction value was 82, 1 %. A detection limit of 7 to 77 parasites/µl blood was determined. With this real-time PCR a modern, sensitive and highly specific method for the detection of B. felis is now available. The performance of the real-time PCR were compared with those of stained blood smears and the IFAT by investigating 206 blood samples of domestic cats of a small animal surgery in Port Elizabeth. When the results of the blood smears were compared with the results of the real-time PCR an agreement was found in 94, 6 % (192 / 203) of the results. Identical results of the blood smears and IFAT were demonstrated in 91, 2 % (187 / 205) of the cases. The results of the PCR and the IFAT corresponded in 96, 1 % (196 / 204) of the investigations. The isolates K 8 and K 68, which had been diagnosed as B. leo and a closely related species by 18 S rDNA sequence analyses and which had revealed babesia in stained blood smears, showed a negative test result in the PCR {{as well as in the}} IFAT. 9 isolates that were found to be babesia negative in blood smears gave positive results in the PCR as well as in the IFAT. 8 isolates were positive in the IFAT but negative in the PCR. 7 out of these isolates were also proven negative in the blood smears whereas in the <b>remainig</b> one case the blood smear was not examined. Infections with piroplasms were diagnosed in a high portion of the cats examined. The prevalence of babesia determined by stained blood smear was 32, 2 % (66 / 205). DNA of B. felis was detected in 35, 3 % (72 / 204) of the cats by real-time PCR. B. felis specific antibodies were found in 39, 3 % (81 / 206) of the examined cats in the IFAT. No specific breed predilection was evident. The results of blood smears and PCR did not correlate with the sex or age of the cats. However B. felis specific antibodies were detected more frequently in male than in female animals and in a higher portion of the cats older than 2 years. Concerning the housing conditions, significantly more “indoor/outdoor” cats were affected. DNA of B. felis and specific antibodies were found in a portion above average of the cats coming from the “Walmer” area. Typical clinical signs attributed to feline babesiosis were observed in 28, 8 % (19 / 66) of the cats showing babesia in the blood smear, in 25 % (18 / 72) of the cats with DNA of B. felis detected by PCR and in 22, 2 % (18 / 81) of the cats that showed a positive test result in the IFAT. The part of latently infected was thus very high. No specific breed or sex predilection for clinical affection was evident. However a correlation of the age of the cats with the manifestation of a clinical babesiosis is assumed. In the age group between 0, 5 and 2 years the percentage of infected cats showing clinical signs was above average. Untersuchungen zur Piroplasmose bei Hauskatzen in Südafrika In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden Katzen in einem für Piroplasmen als endemisch geltenden Gebiet in Südafrika untersucht, um Informationen über das Spektrum beteiligter Arten zu erhalten. Dort nachgewiesene Erreger wurden mit Hilfe molekularbiologischer Methoden genotypisch charakterisiert. Dazu wurden zwei rDNA-Genabschnitte, die 18 S-rDNA und die Region der Internen Transkribierten Spacer (ITS) sequenziert und phylogenetischen Analysen unterzogen. Basierend auf erhaltenen Sequenzinformationen wurde dann ein modernes und sensitives Nachweisverfahren, eine Real-time PCR-Methode, zum spezifischen Nachweis von B. felis entwickelt und validiert. 206 Blutproben von Katzen, die aus dem Endemiegebiet und zwar aus dem Patientengut einer Kleintierklinik in Port Elizabeth stammten, wurden mit der entwickelten Real-time PCR auf Infektionen mit B. felis untersucht und die Testergebnisse mit Ergebnissen von Untersuchungen gefärbter Blutausstriche sowie eines indirekten Fluoreszenzantikörpertests (IFAT) verglichen. Die 18 S-rDNA-Sequenzanalysen von 13 ausgewählten Isolaten und Vergleiche mit verfügbaren Genbanksequenzendaten zeigten, dass mindestens zwei, möglicherweise sogar drei Arten für Piroplasmeninfektionen bei den untersuchten Hauskatzen in Port Elizabeth verantwortlich waren. Bei 11 der 13 Isolate wurde B. felis diagnostiziert. Bei einem Isolat, K 8, wurde B. leo identifiziert, eine Piroplasmenart, die bereits bei Löwen beschrieben wurde. Es handelte sich hier somit um den Erstnachweis einer natürlichen Infektion mit B. leo bei einer Hauskatze. Die Sequenz des 13. Isolats, K 68, konnte keiner bisher bekannten Art zugeordnet werden, zeigte jedoch große phylogenetische Verwandtschaft zu den anderen felinen Piroplasmen. Mit einer Identität von 98, 3 % war sie der Sequenz von B. leo am ähnlichsten und mit einer Sequenzidentität von 97, 8 % mit der Art B. felis etwas entfernter verwandt. Im Vergleich mit 2 weiteren felinen Piroplasmen, den beiden artlich nicht festgelegten Babesia sp. Caracal Strain A und B, wurden Identitäten von 96, 8 % bzw. 96, 7 % ermittelt. In phylographischen Darstellungen trennte sich das Isolat K 68 deutlich von den übrigen felinen Piroplasmen ab. Diese Ergebnisse sprechen für einen eigenen Artstatus des Isolats K 68. Eine artliche Abgrenzung zumindest von B. felis wird auch durch Ergebnisse eines IFATs gestützt. Dabei zeigte das Isolat K 68 keine serologische Kreuzreaktivität mit B. felis – Antigen. Im Blutausstrich waren keine morphologischen Unterschiede zu B. felis oder B. leo feststellbar. In dendrographischen Darstellungen phylogenetischer Verwandtschaftsbeziehungen ordneten sich alle in dieser Studie untersuchten felinen Piroplasmen mit B. rodhaini, B. microti und T. annae in einer gemeinsamen Gruppe ein und nicht in die Gruppe der `typischen´ Babesien oder Theilerien. Die ITS-rDNA-Sequenzanalyse der 13 ausgewählten Isolate ergab bei den 11 als B. felis diagnostizierten Erregern eine Polymorphismusrate von 2, 6 % und hohe paarweise Identitäten zwischen 98, 6 % und 99, 9 %. Das als B. leo diagnostizierte Isolat K 8 und das Isolat K 68 zeigten im Vergleich mit B. felis, Identitäten von lediglich 77, 0 % bzw. 76, 0 %. Untereinander wiesen die Isolate K 8 und K 68 eine Identität von 87, 8 % auf. In einer denrographischen Darstellung grenzten sich die beiden Isolate K 8 und K 68 deutlich voneinander und von den 11 B. felis – Isolaten ab. Dies stützt die Auffassung von 3 getrennten Arten. Für ein Isolat, K 60, wurde außerdem die Intra-Isolat-Variabilität genauer untersucht. Dabei wurden 7 verschiedene Genotypen festgestellt, wobei für 6 Genotypen eine hohe Ähnlichkeit mit B. felis und Sequenzidentitäten zwischen 97, 2 % und 99, 6 % ermittelt wurden. Die Sequenz des Genotyps 7, Klon K 60 E. 2, unterschied sich jedoch deutlich von den anderen Genotypen. Sie war nur zu 76, 9 % mit B. felis identisch und ließ sich keiner bisher bekannten Art zuordnen. Im Dendrogramm gruppierte sich der Klon K 60 E. 2 eher zu B. leo und zu K 68 als zu den B. felis – Isolaten. Basierend auf den Sequenzdaten der ITS-rDNA, wurde eine Real-time-PCR – Methode, zum Nachweis von B. felis entwickelt. Sie erwies sich als sensitiv und sehr spezifisch. Eine geblindete, extern kontrollierte Validierung ergab eine Spezifität von 100 % und eine Sensitivität von 75 %. Der positive Vorhersagewert lag bei 100 % und der negative Vorhersagewert bei 82, 1 %. Es wurde eine Nachweisgrenze zwischen 7 und 77 Babesien/µl Blut ermittelt. Mit dieser Real-time PCR steht somit ein modernes, sensitives und sehr spezifisches Nachweisverfahren zur Detektion von B. felis zur Verfügung. Bei der Untersuchung von 206 Katzenblutproben aus dem Patientengut einer Kleintierklinik in Port Elizabeth wurden die Ergebnisse von Real-time PCR, Untersuchung gefärbter Blutausstrichen und IFAT verglichen. Dabei ergab sich eine Übereinstimmung der Ergebnisse des Blutausstriches und der Real-time PCR von 94, 6 % (192 / 203). Beim Vergleich Blutausstrich und IFAT wurden in 91, 2 % (187 / 205) der Fälle übereinstimmende Ergebnisse ermittelt. Bei Betrachtung der PCR- und IFAT-Testergebnissen stimmten 96, 1 % (196 / 204) der Befunde überein. Die beiden Isolate, K 8 und K 68, bei denen im Ausstrich Babesien nachgewiesen worden waren und bei denen in der 18 S-rDNA-Sequenzanalyse zur Artdiagnose nicht B. felis, sondern B. leo und eine verwandte Art diagnostiziert worden war, reagierten sowohl in der PCR, als auch im IFAT negativ. Für 9 im Ausstrich negative Isolate wurde in der PCR ein positives Ergebnis ermittelt. Die 9 Isolate reagierten auch im IFAT positiv. Alle in der PCR positiv beurteilten Proben waren auch im IFAT positiv. Bei den 8 zwar im IFAT positiv, aber in der PCR negativ bewerteten Ansätze wurden in 7 Fällen im Blutausstrich Babesien nicht nachgewiesen, für eine Katze wurde der Blutausstrich nicht untersucht. Bei einem hohen Anteil der untersuchten Katzen wurden Infektionen mit Piroplasmen diagnostiziert. Die Befallsrate mit Babesien lag nach Ergebnissen des gefärbten Blutausstriches bei 32, 2 % (66 / 205). In der Real-time PCR wurde bei 35, 3 % (72 / 204) der Katzen DNA von B. felis nachgewiesen. Der Nachweis B. felis –spezifischer Antikörper im IFAT gelang bei 39, 3 % (81 / 206) der untersuchten Katzen. Eine Rasseprädisposition wurde nicht festgestellt. Aus den Ergebnissen von Blutausstrich und PCR ließ sich ein Einfluss von Geschlecht oder Alter auf das Vorliegen einer Babesieninfektion nicht ableiten. B. felis – spezifische Antikörper im IFAT wurden jedoch häufiger bei männlichen als bei weiblichen Tieren und bei einem höheren Anteil der Katzen in allen Altersgruppen über 2 Jahren nachgewiesen. Katzen mit Freilauf waren signifikant häufiger infiziert. In der PCR und im IFAT wurden bei einem überdurchschnittlich großen Anteil der Katzen, die aus dem Gebiet „Walmer“ stammten, DNA bzw. Antikörper von B. felis nachgewiesen. Eine klinisch manifeste Babesiose wurde bei 28, 8 % (19 / 66) der Katzen mit positivem Blutausstrich, bei 25 % (18 / 72) der Katzen, bei denen in der PCR DNA von B. felis nachgewiesen worden war und bei 22, 2 % (18 / 81) der Tiere mit positivem IFAT diagnostiziert. Der Anteil an latent infizierten Katzen war somit mit 71, 2 %, 75 % bzw. 77, 8 % sehr hoch. Eine Rasse- oder Geschlechtsprädisposition ließ sich bei den klinisch erkrankten Tieren nicht erkennen. Jedoch ist anzunehmen, dass ein Zusammenhang zwischen dem Alter der Katze und der Ausprägung klinischer Erscheinungen besteht. So war der Anteil an klinisch erkrankten Katzen in der Altersgruppe über 0, 5 bis 2 Jahren überdurchschnittlich hoch...|$|E
