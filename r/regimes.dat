40|$|We {{assess the}} {{quantitative}} importance of expectation effects of <b>regime</b> shifts in monetary policy in a DSGE model {{that allows the}} monetary policy rule to switch between a ?bad? <b>regime</b> and a ?good? <b>regime.</b> When agents take into account such <b>regime</b> shifts in forming expectations, the expectation effect is asymmetric. In the good <b>regime,</b> the expectation effect is small despite agents' disbelief that the <b>regime</b> will last forever. In the bad <b>regime,</b> however, the expectation effect on equilibrium dynamics of inflation and output is quantitatively important, even if agents put a small probability that monetary policy will switch to the good <b>regime.</b> Although the expectation effect dampens aggregate fluctuations in the bad <b>regime,</b> a switch from the bad <b>regime</b> to the good <b>regime</b> can still substantially reduce the volatility of both inflation and output, provided that we allow some ?reduced-form? parameters {{in the private sector}} to change with monetary policy <b>regime...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Regime</b> shifts are {{substantial}} reorganizations in system structure, functions and feedbacks, {{which can lead}} to changes in the provision of ecosystem services with significant impacts on human well-being. Recent research has documented cases of <b>regime</b> shifts in local and regional systems and there is mounting concern about <b>regime</b> shifts of global significance.

Management that increases system resilience and lowers the probability of <b>regime</b> shifts is beneficial when <b>regime</b> shifts are likely to reduce human well-being. It may not always be possible to avoid harmful <b>regime</b> shifts, so building capacity to adapt should a <b>regime</b> shift occur is beneficial too.

40|$|Background: Eclampsia is a {{hypertensive}} disorder related to pregnancy, {{in which there}} is occurrence of one or more generalized convulsions and or coma, in the absence of other neurologic conditions. It is a common obstetric emergency. Eclampsia is associated with elevated maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Objectives : To compare the efficacy of low dose magnesium sulphate (Dhaka) <b>regime</b> with Pritchard <b>regime</b> in Eclampsia. Material and Methods : A prospective randomized study of fifty eclampsia cases, treated with magnesium sulphate (25 each from low dose magnesium sulphate (Dhaka) <b>regime</b> and Pritchard <b>regime)</b> was carried out for one year i. e. January 2010 to December 2010 at Pravara Rural Hospital, Loni. Results were analysed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) 13. 0. Results: In the present study, convulsions were controlled in 88 % of eclampsia cases with low dose magnesium sulphate (Dhaka) <b>regime.</b> Two cases i. e. 8 % had single episode of recurrence of convulsion, which was controlled by giving additional 2 grams of 20 % magnesium sulphate intravenous single dose. Perinatal mortality in low dose magnesium sulphate (Dhaka) <b>regime</b> was lesser (24 %) than Pritchard <b>regime</b> (32 %). Conclusion: Low dose magnesium sulphate (Dhaka) <b>regime</b> was equally effective as Pritchard <b>regime</b> in control of eclamptic convulsions.
