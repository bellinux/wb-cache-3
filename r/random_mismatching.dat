40|$|High-speed high-accuracy digital-to-analog {{converters}} (DACs) are {{the crucial}} {{building blocks for}} many signal processing and telecommunication systems. The current-steering architecture is extensively used for these applications. With different decoding schemes [...] binary-weighted, unary-coded, and segment-coded, current-steering DACs are realized by groups of matched current sources. Their performance is limited by many nonlinear mechanisms such as <b>random</b> <b>mismatch</b> errors, gradient effect, code and voltage dependence of finite output impedance, nonlinear settling time, charge injection, and switch timing errors. In this thesis, two nonlinearity compensation techniques are presented to improve the overall performance of the current-steering DACs. The first design technique is a novel digital calibration technique [...] complete-folding, which effectively compensates the <b>random</b> <b>mismatch</b> errors by selectively regrouping current sources into a fully binary-weighted array based on current comparisons after chip fabrication. The implementation only requires an analog current comparator and some digital circuitry. The minimum requirement of analog circuits makes complete-folding calibration suitable for DAC design in the low-voltage process. Statistical results with a behavioral model of a 14 -bit segmented DAC in MATLAB show that complete-folding calibration can reduce the total gate area of current sources {{by a factor of}} almost 1200 compared to the DAC without using any calibration. Additional results also show that this new calibration technique has the superior performance in compensating <b>random</b> <b>mismatch</b> errors as compared to state-of-the-art. The second design technique is a novel output impedance linearization technique that very effectively reduces the code and voltage dependence of finite output impedance. The linearization is achieved by using a small DAC switched with control signals opposite to those for the main DAC. The area and power overhead is less than 5...|$|R

40|$|A {{well known}} problem of time-interleaved analogto-digital {{converters}} is the matching {{between the individual}} channels of the converter. Any mismatch between the channels affects {{the accuracy of the}} converter adversely. The <b>random</b> <b>mismatch</b> between the channels originates mainly from the mismatch of components like transistors and capacitors. To achieve a certain degree of matching between the channels, the sizes of the individual components have to be chosen accordingly. Especially for high-resolution converters, this means that physically large transistors are required, resulting in a large chip area, increased power consumption and reduced conversion speed. Instead of increasing sizes to achieve a certain accuracy, one can also start with an analog circuit that is relatively inaccurate from itself (allowing physically small devices), and use a digital post-correction technique afterwards to correct for the actual deviations of each component. With this method, a high accuracy can be obtained while the requirements for the components are relaxed significantly. Although these techniques have been available for single-channel converters for many years, techniques correcting the mismatch between several channels are scarce.

Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method can improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general calibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation, we propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended statistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES method not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher calibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES based calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is current source calibration {{and the other is}} phase/delay calibration. To verify this proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we designed, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design. The receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving harmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the ESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection ratios. To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a current-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC). The CS-DAC utilizes ESES-based amplitude and timing error calibration for improving linearity performance. Simulation results showed that we can achieve more than one order of magnitude linearity improvement after performing ESES-based calibration in the CS-DAC. Comment: CMU PhD Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) is {{a crucial}} {{building}} block limiting the accuracy and speed of many signal processing and telecommunication systems. To achieve high speed and high resolution, the current-steering architecture is almost exclusively used. Three important issues for current-steering DAC design are addressed in this dissertation. In a current-steering DAC design, {{it is essential that}} a designer determine the minimum required current source accuracy to overcome <b>random</b> current <b>mismatch</b> and achieve high linearity with guaranteed yield. Simple formulas are derived that clearly exhibit the relationship between the standard deviation of unit current sources, the bits of resolution, the INL/DNL, and the soft yield of DAC arrays. It is shown that these formulas are very effective for optimizing the DAC segmentation so as to achieve high performance and high yield with minimal area and power consumption. To overcome <b>random</b> <b>mismatch</b> effects without any trimming, the current source array of a high-accuracy DAC is usually rather large, causing the gradient errors in these arrays to become significant. How gradient errors affect the DAC linearity and how to compensate for them through switching sequence optimization is analyzed {{in the second part of}} this dissertation. To overcome technology barriers, relax the requirements on layout and reduce the sensitivities of DACs to process, temperature and aging, calibration is emerging as an attractive solution for the next-generation high-performance DACs, especially as process feature size keeps shrinking and supply voltage is reduced correspondingly. A new foreground calibration technique suitable for low-voltage environment is presented in the third part of this dissertation. It can effectively compensate for current source mismatches, and achieve high linearity with small die size and low power consumption. The dynamic performance of the DAC is also improved due to the dramatic reduction of parasitic effects.

Fractional-N frequency synthesizers are replacing conventional integer- N frequency synthesizers because of their better performance in terms of settling time and phase noise. However, fractional-N frequency synthesizers suffer from fractional spurs or side bands which increase errorvector magnitude (EVM). To solve the fractional spur problem various techniques are suggested in the literature but have limitations in terms of area and power. To reduce the limitations, two fractional-N phase-locked loop (PLL) architectures are proposed where the phase is locked in each reference cycle unlike conventional sigma delta PLLs. This reduces fractional spurs and increases bandwidth. The proposed architectures are compared with sigma delta, finite impulse response (FIR) filtering based sigma delta and multi-phase voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) based fractional-N PLLs. The proposed architectures and its algorithm to generate many divide-by-N outputs by one divider is proved mathematically and behavioral simulations and full transistor level simulations are done to verify it. Simulations show removal of sigma delta quantization noise which improves both broadband phase noise and fractional spurs. Implementation challenges like deterministic <b>mismatch</b> and <b>random</b> <b>mismatch</b> are also considered and sigma delta modulator and butterfly scrambler are used to compensate mismatch.

The <b>random</b> DOA <b>mismatch</b> of the desired signal are uniformly distributed in [- 7 °, 7 °]. That is to say, the DOA of the signal is uniformly distributed at [- 2 °, 12 °]. The SNR of the desired signal is still 15  dB. Here, the random DOA of the signal changes from run to run but remains fixed from snapshot to snapshot. The output SINR of the aforementioned methods versus the number of snapshots is compared in Figure  2. As shown, the proposed beamformer is always the closest one to the optimal SINR and enjoys much faster convergence rates rather than other beamformers except the Rec-est. beamformer. Although the Rec-est. beamformer has the same convergence rates with the proposed beamformer, its output SINR is always lower than the proposed one. The ESB, whose convergence rate is nearly same with the Capon-est. beamformer but lower than the SMI beamformer and the Capon-est-L. beamformer, always provides a higher output SINR than others except the proposed one and the Rec-est. beamformer.|$|R
40|$|Spiking cochlea models {{describe}} the analog processing and spike generation process within the biological cochlea. Reconstructing the audio {{input from the}} artificial cochlea spikes is therefore useful for understanding the fidelity of the information preserved in the spikes. The reconstruction process is challenging particularly for spikes from the mixed signal (analog/digital) integrated circuit (IC) cochleas because of multiple nonlinearities in the model and the additional variance caused by <b>random</b> transistor <b>mismatch.</b> This work proposes an offline method for reconstructing the audio input from spike responses of both a particular spike-based hardware model called the AEREAR 2 cochlea and an equivalent software cochlea model. This method was previously used to reconstruct the auditory stimulus based on the peri-stimulus histogram of spike responses recorded in the ferret auditory cortex. The reconstructed audio from the hardware cochlea is evaluated against an analogous software model using objective measures of speech quality and intelligibility; and further tested in a word recognition task. The reconstructed audio under low signal-to-noise (SNR) conditions (SNR < - 5 dB) gives a better classification performance than the original SNR input in this word recognition task...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the well known problem of pattern matching under the Hamming distance. Previous approaches have shown how {{to count the}} number of mismatches efficiently especially, when a bound is known for the maximum Hamming distance. Our interest is different in that we wish collect a <b>random</b> sample of <b>mismatches</b> of fixed size at each position in the text. Given a pattern p of length m and a text t of length n, we show how to sample with high probability c mismatches where possible from every alignment of p and t in time. Further, we guarantee that the mismatches are sampled uniformly and that they can therefore be seen as representative of the types of mismatches that occur. ...|$|R
