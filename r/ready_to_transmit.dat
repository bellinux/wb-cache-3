40|$|A {{mosquito}} {{needs to}} bite {{at least twice}} for malaria transmission to occur: once to acquire parasites and, after these parasites complete their development in their mosquito host, once <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> the parasites <b>to</b> the next vertebrate host. Here we investigate the relationship between temperature, parasite development, and biting frequency in a mosquito-rodent malaria model system. We show that the pre-bloodmeal period (the time lag between mosquito emergence and first bloodmeal) increases at lower temperatures. In addition, parasite development time and feeding exhibit different thermal sensitivities such that mosquitoes might not be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> feed at {{the point at which}} the parasite is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>transmitted.</b> Exploring these effects using a simple theoretical model of human malaria shows that delays in infection and transmission can reduce the vectorial capacity of malaria mosquitoes by 20 to over 60 %, depending on temperature.

The average throughput per flow, delay, throughput JFI and service coverage are basically unaffected, and only an improvement in delay JFI is obtained with light and moderate traffic loads. Although not shown in the graphs, when implementing APA strategies, the use of FC also introduces a decrease in power consumption. This {{is due to the}} fact that resources (power and subbands) are only allocated when necessary, that is, when there is enough information in the queues <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>transmitted.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Equipment from {{different}} US manufacturers had similar traits. This was partly dictated by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. The requirement that unauthorized persons be prohibited {{from using the}} radio transmitter meant that many radios were wired so they could not transmit unless the vehicle ignition was on. Persons without {{a key to the}} vehicle could not transmit. Equipment had to be [...] "type accepted", or technically approved, by the FCC before it could be offered for sale. In order to be type accepted, the radio set had to be equipped with an indicator light, usually green or yellow, that showed power was applied and the radio was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit.</b> Radios were also required to have a lamp (usually red) indicating when the transmitter was on.

5000|$|Hyperpolarization {{is often}} caused by efflux of K+ (a cation) through K+ {{channels}}, or influx of Cl - [...] (an anion) through Cl - [...] channels. On the other hand, influx of cations, e.g. Na+ through Na+ channels or Ca2+ through Ca2+ channels, inhibits hyperpolarization. If a cell has Na+ or Ca2+ currents at rest, then inhibition of those currents will also {{result in a}} hyperpolarization. This voltage-gated ion channel response is how the hyperpolarization state is achieved. In neurons, the cell enters a state of hyperpolarization immediately following the generation of an action potential. While hyperpolarized, the neuron is in a refractory period that lasts roughly 2 milliseconds, during which the neuron is unable to generate subsequent action potentials. Sodium-potassium ATPases redistribute K+ and Na+ ions until the membrane potential is back to its resting potential of around -70 millivolts, {{at which point the}} neuron is once again <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> another action potential.|$|E

30|$|Clusters can {{be formed}} {{based on a}} certain {{application}} or a given structure. For example, in an infrastructure network with a multiple-antenna AP, the AP forms clusters of STAs such that it can decode multiple streams in the uplink (for example by successive interference cancellation), or separates them in downlink transmissions (for example by performing zero-forcing). Since in the infrastructure mode all STAs associate with the AP, it is aware of each new STA entering its network or any STA leaving it. The AP can cluster nodes such that neighboured STAs belong to a single cluster or as it will be explained in Section IV-C adaptively allocate STAs which have packets <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>transmitted</b> <b>to</b> one cluster. The maximum size of the clusters {{is determined by the}} number of antennas at the AP.|$|R
5000|$|At the transmitter, {{information}} bits are encoded. Encoding adds redundancy by mapping the {{information bits}} [...] to a longer bit vector - the code bit vector [...] The encoded bits [...] are then interleaved. Interleaving permutes {{the order of}} the code bits [...] resulting in bits [...] The main reason for doing this is to insulate the information bits from bursty noise. Next, the symbol mapper maps the bits [...] into complex symbols [...] These digital symbols are then converted into analog symbols with a D/A converter. Typically the signal is then up-converted to pass band frequencies by mixing it with a carrier signal. This is a necessary step for complex symbols. The signal is then <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>transmitted</b> through the channel.|$|R
5000|$|P-persistent : This is an {{approach}} between 1-persistent and non-persistent CSMA access modes. When the transmitting node is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> data, it senses the transmission medium for idle or busy. If idle, then it transmits a frame with probability p. If busy, then it senses the transmission medium continuously {{until it becomes}} idle, then transmits with probability p. If the node does not transmit (the probability of this event is 1-p), it waits until the next available time slot. If the transmission medium is still not busy, it transmits again with the same probability p. This probabilistic hold-off repeats until the frame is finally transmitted or when the medium is found to become busy again (i.e. some other node has already started transmitting). In the latter case the node repeats the whole logic cycle (which started with sensing the transmission medium for idle or busy) again. p-persistent CSMA is used in CSMA/CA systems including Wi-Fi and other packet radio systems.|$|E

Because radios were costly {{and there were}} fewer radio users, {{it might be the}} case that no one else nearby used the same channel. A transmit and receive crystal had to be ordered for the desired channel frequency, then the radio had to be tuned or aligned to work on the channel. 12-volt mobile, tube-type radios drew several amperes on standby and tens-of-amperes on transmit. Equipment worked ideally when new. The performance of vacuum tubes gradually degraded over time. US regulations required an indicator lamp showing the transmitter had power applied and was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> and a second indicator, (usually red,) that showed the transmitter was on.

50|$|From {{the point}} of entry, the virus is neurotropic, {{traveling}} quickly along the neural pathways into the central nervous system. The virus usually first infects muscle cells close {{to the site of}} infection, where they are able to replicate without being 'noticed' by the host's immune system. Once enough virus has been replicated, they begin to bind to acetylcholine receptors (p75NR) at the neuromuscular junction. The virus then travels through the nerve cell axon via retrograde transport, as its P protein interacts with dynein, a protein present in the cytoplasm of nerve cells. Once the virus reaches the cell body it travels rapidly to the Central Nervous System (CNS), replicating in motor neurons and eventually reaching the brain. After the brain is infected, the virus travels centrifugally to the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, eventually migrating to the salivary glands, where it is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>transmitted</b> <b>to</b> the next host.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{contention-based}} protocol called backoff counter reservation and classifying stations (BCR-CS) for the IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function (DCF). In the proposed scheme, each station has three states: idle, reserved, and contentious. A station {{is in the}} idle state if it has no frame <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit.</b> A station is in the reserved state {{if it has a}} frame <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> and this frame’s backoff counter has been successfully announced through the previous successfully transmitted frame so that other stations know this information.

All the stations in the idle state, the reserved state, and the contentious state form an idle group, a reserved group, and a contentious group, respectively. Two backoff schemes are proposed in the BCR-CS protocol {{based on the number of}} stations in the contentious group including the optimal pseudo-ppersistent scheme. The proposed schemes are compared with the DCF and the Enhanced Collision Avoidance (ECA) scheme in the literature. Extensive simulations and some analytical analysis are carried out.

40|$|Rate {{limiting}} is {{an important}} primitive for managing server network resources. Unfortunately, software-based rate limiting suffers from limited accuracy and high CPU overhead, and modern NICs only support a handful of rate limiters. We present SENIC, a NIC design that can natively support 10 s of thousands of rate limiters— 100 x to 1000 x the number available in NICs today. The key {{idea is that the}} host CPU only classifies packets, en-queues them in per-class queues in host memory, and specifies rate limits for each traffic class. On the NIC, SENIC maintains class metadata, computes the transmit schedule, and only pulls packets from host memory when they are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>transmitted</b> (on a real time basis). We implemented SENIC on NetFPGA, with 1000 rate lim-iters requiring just 30 KB SRAM, and it was able to accu-rately pace packets.

40|$|Why do we {{need new}} {{charging}} mechanisms? Packet-Switched services do not require a dedicated path {{for the duration of}} the call. Instead, they rely on a virtual connection with the network setting up a real connection only when there is data to be sent/received, and then dropping the connection until more data is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>transmitted</b> or received. As a result, network resources are used only when packets are in transmission, and there is thus no clear notion of "the duration of a call". Hence, users may no longer wish to be charged in the traditional duration-based manner. Besides, in contrast to today's dedicated networks, (e. g. PSTN, Frame Relay and even GSM) which carry a single application type at a fixed duration-based price, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and UMTS are multi-service networks. These require flexible pricing models, where price is a function of data volume, QoS provisioned, packet content, etc. For example, voice and video data is more or less continuous, thus requiring network resources more or less for the entire duration of its transfer. Consequently, we can expect voice and video to have a flat per-minute rate, whereas other services, such as, Resource (e. g. file) Access and fax/email applications may be charged on a volume basis, i. e. charged per MB of data transferred. Moreover, voice and video applications require bi-directional latency and bandwidt...|$|R
40|$|Host {{manipulation}} is {{a common}} strategy by which parasites alter the behaviour of their host to enhance their own fitness. In nature, hosts are usually infected by multiple parasites. This {{can result in a}} conflict over host manipulation. Studies of such a conflict in experimentally infected hosts are rare. The cestode Schistocephalus solidus (S) and the nematode Camallanus lacustris (C) use copepods as their first intermediate host. They need to grow for some time inside this host before they are infective and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be trophically <b>transmitted</b> <b>to</b> their subsequent fish host. Accordingly, not yet infective parasites manipulate to suppress predation. Infective ones manipulate to enhance predation. We experimentally infected laboratory-bred copepods in a manner that resulted in copepods harbouring (i) an infective C plus a not yet infective C or S, or (ii) an infective S plus a not yet infective C. An infective C completely sabotaged host manipulation by any not yet infective parasite. An infective S partially reduced host manipulation by a not yet infective C. We hence show experimentally that a parasite can reduce or even sabotage host manipulation exerted by a parasite from a different species...|$|R
