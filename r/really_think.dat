5|$|I find {{it quite}} nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you write}} songs, you don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> about performing in a video. I think it's quite fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E
5|$|The film {{discusses}} {{why some}} people enjoy underground horror films involving fetishes. Although the film is classified as a documentary, there is a fictional subplot which helps advance the film's theme by showing what some people <b>really</b> <b>think</b> about the genre.|$|E
25|$|Ian Meckiff had {{destroyed}} their batting lineup in the just-completed second Test and their bad luck continued when {{two of their}} players were injured in a car smash on their journey up to Wagga from Melbourne. I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> they wanted to play this match at all.|$|E

Though happily married, {{they are}} so anxious to avoid hurting each other's {{feelings}} that they rarely tell each other what they <b>really</b> <b>think.</b> They have a son, Arthur Carlson, Jr., whom they've sent off to military school. During the second season Carmen has a surprise pregnancy and during the third season gives birth to a daughter, Melanie.|$|E
25|$|Starting in May 2017, Rei Kawakubo will be {{the subject}} of one of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's fashion {{exhibitions}} in New York. Vogue magazine and the Metropolitan Museum in New York have announced that the exhibition dedicated to Kawakubo is scheduled for its 2017 season between 4 May 2017 and 4 September 2017. In an interview with Vogue in April 2017, Andrew Bolton, the curator for the Kawakubo exhibit at the Met stated: “I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> her influence is so huge, but sometimes it’s subtle. It’s not about copying her; it’s the purity of her vision... Rei was really involved {{in the design of the}} exhibit”. Bolton also stated that the exhibit in May 2017 will be an austere, all-white maze hosting approximately 150 Comme ensembles. Both the exhibit and accompanying book by Bolton are based upon the recurrent fashion dichotomies concentrating on eight thematic oppositions listed as: (1) fashion/antifashion; (2) design/not design; (3) model/multiple; (4) then/now; (5) high/low; (6) self/other; (7) object/subject; and (8) clothes/not clothes.|$|E

6000|$|... "How refreshing," [...] {{the parents}} would say, [...] "to {{come across a}} man who is not afraid to say what he <b>really</b> <b>thinks.</b> Why are we not all outspoken?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like to {{know what}} Haskers <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> of the shaking up," [...] said Dave. And then he turned over to go to sleep, and the others did likewise.|$|R
500|$|... "Tim and Pete {{tries to}} convey in print what people <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{rather than what}} they should think or what's P.C. My fantasy was to leave readers so infuriated they'd throw down the book and march right out to a gun store {{because they wanted to}} see the finale so bad they realize the only way it'd happen is if they make it happen in real life!" ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{major themes}} of the series include choice and free will. Meyer says that the books are {{centered}} around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or {{what you think you}} have to do; you can always choose something else. There's always a different path." ...|$|E
500|$|Season of the Sparks won the Choice Music Prize for Irish Album of the Year 2009. Crowley {{received}} a prize of €10,000 cheque.

Crowley promised to use the money to fund his music. He was one of eight nominees who performed at the awards ceremony. He is a friend of fellow nominee Valerie Francis.|$|E

6000|$|She drew {{herself up}} a little {{with an air of}} question. [...] "I believe {{everybody}} <b>really</b> <b>thinks,</b> too, and it's your duty to let them find out what they're thinking, by truly saying what you think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Miserable craven!' she exclaimed. 'Has the cowardly tyrant fled? And he <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> that I am to {{be crushed}} by such an {{instrument}} as this! Pah! He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not. Begone, sir!' ...|$|R
500|$|... "I {{rarely do}} collabs, so that's {{just one of}} the ones you {{absolutely}} do. It's like a no-brainer. I didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> about any of it. The last thing on my mind was working with artists who I've held in high esteem for years. [...] I worked with Jay on his solo album before I did the Watch the Throne sessions. The second time I went it was Barry Weiss, Jay, Beyoncé, Kanye, couple other people, it was a pretty heavy room." ...|$|E
500|$|Probably in {{many respects}} most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an {{unconscious}} way. I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, [...] "Oh, that's what I wrote that song about." [...] But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that'. In 'Miles Away' I'm tapping into the global consciousness of people who have intimacy problems.|$|E
500|$|Comments from Darryl McDaniels, AKA DMC of Run-D.M.C., {{make this}} {{connection}} to the underground explicit: [...] "hat's exactly what we did. We didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it was pioneering, we just did what rappers did before us was doing on tapes. When {{a lot of the}} old guys, like Kool Moe Dee, The Treacherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, got in the studio, they never put their greatness on records. Me and Run and Jay would listen ... and we'd say, 'They didn't do that shit last night in the Bronx!' ... So we said that we weren't going to be fake. We ain't gonna wear no costumes. We're gonna keep it real." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{do believe}} Dick <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> he can play. It {{is the same}} with golf. Beginners are {{invariably}} lucky. [...] "I think I shall like it," [...] they tell you; [...] "I {{seem to have the}} game in me, if you understand." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It {{would kill}} him. Don't you see, {{we know that}} it's all nonsense, this idea of his; but he <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> he is the king, and he's so old that the shock of my disobeying him would be too much. Honest, Ted, dear, I couldn't.' ...|$|R
500|$|Kishimoto {{inserted}} villains {{into the}} story to counteract the lead characters' moral values. He stated that this focus on illustrating the difference in values is central to his creation of villains to the point that, [...] "I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> about them in combat". The villains' physical appearances were also embellished to differentiate them from other characters, {{making it easier for}} a reader to follow the story and identify the villains, even in heated battle scenes. Kishimoto noted that making the villains [...] "flamboyant" [...] with a [...] "showy costume" [...] is [...] "one of my guiding principles", as well as making them [...] "more memorable".|$|E
500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] was {{performed}} by Madonna on five of her world tours. She ended The Virgin Tour (1985) with a self-parodying performance of the song. She wore a white tube top and a tight white skirt and carried a bunch of notes in her left hand. At {{the end of the}} performance she asked the audience [...] "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I'm a material girl?...I'm not...Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The performance was included in the VHS release [...]|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{attention}} surrounding the song, the music video garnered much speculation. For {{the first time}} in her career, Carey was featured provocatively dressed, giving viewers a [...] "taste of the freer Mariah." [...] The Puerto Rico-filmed video's concept was created by Carey with Paul Hunter filling in as the director. Serving a James Bond theme, Carey was cast as [...] "the very sexy agent M", a woman who escapes a large mansion in which she has been held captive. Carey said of the video that [...] "I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> the video is overtly sexual, but for me-I mean people used to think I was the nineties version of Mary Poppins!" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, MLB Hall of Fame shortstop and third baseman Cal Ripken, Jr. offered his own {{assessment}} of Tulowitzki: [...] "He {{has a strong}} offensive game, but defensively, he's unbelievable.

5000|$|Valerie Lilley as Mrs. Bates: Where Miss Bates talks non stop, her aged mother, Mrs Bates, never speaks. She sits {{quietly in}} the corner of the room, or is wheeled from place to place by Miss Bates, {{revealing}} very little of what she <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> of their situation.|$|R

500|$|Bolt {{was born}} on 21 August 1986 in Sherwood Content, {{a small town in}} Jamaica, the son of Wellesley and Jennifer Bolt. He has a brother named Sadiki and a sister named Sherine. His parents ran the local grocery store in the rural area, and Bolt spent his time playing cricket and {{football}} in the street with his brother, later saying, [...] "When I was young, I didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> about anything other than sports." [...] As a child, Bolt attended Waldensia Primary, where he first began to show his sprinting potential, running in the annual national primary-schools' meeting for his parish. By the age of twelve, Bolt had become the school's fastest runner over the 100 metres distance.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Mangini joined Dream Theater, Portnoy e-mailed {{the band}} asking to rejoin, but his attempt was rebuffed. Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As I see it, as I look back, I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over. They were in a new place as they looked for a drummer, and I when got the news, after the shock wore off, I knew what I wanted to do – which was just basically come in and try to support where they wanted to go. They had a vision, they had great ideas, and I just wanted to help them achieve those things." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of Héctor Sánchez, Whiteside did not expect to return to the Giants after 2012. [...] "I didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I'd be back with the Giants.

[...] On November 5, 2012, Whiteside was claimed off waivers by the New York Yankees, agreeing to terms with them on a one-year contract worth $625,000 in the Major Leagues and $200,000 in the Minors on November 26. [...] Just two days later, the Yankees designated Whiteside for assignment to make room for Andy Pettitte. On December 3, he was claimed off waivers by the Toronto Blue Jays.|$|E

6000|$|Again {{the vision}} of her sister seemed to float into the room, and she went on desperately: [...] "And, Hilary, I can see Mrs. Hughs <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> you are interested. Of course, she wants to, for if you were, it would mean that a man like her husband could have no chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've been delighted, simply enchanted," [...] said Mrs. Pasmer. And she thought; [...] "Now if Alice were to {{turn round}} {{just as she}} stands, he could see all the best points of her face. I wonder what she <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> of him? What is it you have there; Alice?" [...] she asked aloud.|$|R
