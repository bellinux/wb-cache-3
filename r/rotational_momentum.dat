ECCS piping is integrated with the normal reactor cooling system. In case of total loss of power, the ECCS pumps {{are supposed to be}} powered by the <b>rotational</b> <b>momentum</b> of the turbogenerator rotor for the time before the diesel generators come online. The Chernobyl disaster occurred during a botched test of this system. The ECCS has three systems, connected to the coolant system headers. In case of damage, the first ECCS subsystem provides cooling for up to 100 seconds to the damaged half of the coolant circuit (the other half is cooled by the main circulation pumps), and the other two subsystems then handle long-term cooling of the reactor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notional}} tidal bulges {{are carried}} {{ahead of the}} Earth–Moon axis by the continents {{as a result of}} Earth's rotation. The eccentric mass of each bulge exerts a small amount of gravitational attraction on the Moon, with the bulge on the side of Earth closest to the Moon pulling in a direction slightly forward along the Moon's orbit (because Earth's rotation has carried the bulge forward). The bulge on the side furthest from the Moon has the opposite effect, but because the gravitational attraction varies inversely with the square of distance, the effect is stronger for the near-side bulge. As a result, some of Earth's angular (or <b>rotational)</b> <b>momentum</b> is gradually being transferred to the rotation of the Earth–Moon pair around their mutual centre of mass, called the barycentre. This slightly faster rotation causes the Earth–Moon distance to increase at approximately 38 millimetres per year. Conservation of angular momentum means that Earth's axial rotation is gradually slowing, and because of this its day lengthens by approximately 23 microseconds every year (excluding glacial rebound). Both figures are valid only for the current configuration of the continents. Tidal rhythmites from 620 million years ago show that, over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon receded at an average rate of [...] per year and the day lengthened at an average rate of 12 microseconds per year, both about half of their current values. See tidal acceleration for a more detailed description and references.|$|E

50|$|The {{rotation}} of the Earth affects the direction ocean currents take, and explains which way the large circular ocean gyres rotate in the image above left. Suppose a current at the equator is heading north. The Earth rotates eastward, so the water possesses that <b>rotational</b> <b>momentum.</b> But the further the water moves north, the slower the earth moves eastward. If the current {{could get to the}} North Pole, the earth wouldn't be moving eastward at all. To conserve its <b>rotational</b> <b>momentum,</b> the further the current travels north the faster it must move eastward. So the effect is that the current curves to the right. This is the Coriolis effect. It is weakest at the equator and strongest at the poles. The effect is opposite south of the equator, where currents curve left.|$|E
40|$|The {{maximum limit}} for the {{conversion}} of orbital angular <b>momentum</b> into <b>rotational</b> angular <b>momentum</b> of the mass-gaining component in a close binary system is derived. It is shown that this conversion process does not seriously affect the rate of orbital period change and can be neglected in computing the mass transfer rate. Integration of this limit over the entire accretion process results in a value for the maximum accumulated <b>rotational</b> angular <b>momentum</b> that is 3 to 4 times larger than that implied by the observed underluminosity of stars in such systems as Mu(1) Sco, V Pup, SX Aur, and V 356 Sgr.

[...] Such modified engines have not been given additional balancing systems, but they can have lighter flywheels since the pistons are never simultaneously stationary, so <b>rotational</b> <b>momentum</b> {{does not need to}} be stored up as much to compensate, it is simply transferred between the pistons directly (through the crankshaft). This is a similar principle to that in Yamaha's crossplane four cylinder engines, where the extra two cylinders account for the non-symmetry of piston motion in the upper and lower halves of their strokes, resulting in greater minimisation of the inertial torque caused by changes in <b>rotational</b> <b>momentum.</b>|$|E

Selection rules for magnetic dipole transitions allow transitions between successive members of the triplet (ΔJ = ±1) so that for each value of the <b>rotational</b> angular <b>momentum</b> quantum number N there are two allowed transitions.

Construction took place until July 5, 1991 when Phd Professor Stefan Zarea conducted the final works and inaugurated it. The artistic concept was inspired by the morning dew condensed over a tree sleeve falling down into another one. The sleeves are represented with 576 metal trowels arranged as a 48 by12 matrix in a conical truncated structure that allows the water to create multiple small waterfalls. This huge structure can rotate over its own vertical axis and the movement is produced by a pelton wheel dispose at the lower level of the conical structure.

40|$|The <b>rotational</b> angular <b>momentum</b> of an {{asteroid}} or planet {{and the average}} orbital angular momentum of binary stars for a given mass {{is known to be}} proportional to the 5 / 3 power of the mass of the body or system in question. The average rotational angular momenta for given masses of single stars do not follow this law. It is shown that single stars would follow this law if correction were made for the angular momentum which lies hidden in their planetary systems. This corrective factor leads {{to the conclusion that the}} amount of angular momentum which exists in the planetary systems is on the average proportional to the mass of the star. The infrared spectra of two stars, R Monocerotis and NML Cygnus is interpreted, as being due to preplanetar nebulas which surround the stars and convert most of the visible light into thermally radiated infrared emission. In the case of R Mon, the shape of the spectra is analyzed to determine the mass density distribution of the preplanetary nebula. It is shown that the density falls off as the inverse 1 /-I- power of the distance from the star and that the maximum temperature which the preplanetary grains can withstand is 2400 °K. A theory of the origin of the solar system is presented which is consistent with the information developed in the angular momentum and. the R Mon analysis. It is shown that the sun is braked from a large original <b>rotational</b> angular <b>momentum</b> to its present small value. This braking is caused by magnetic interaction between the sun and the preplanetary nebula which causes the nebula to either co-rotate or partially co-rotate with the sun. Planets are shown to have been braked by the same type of magnetic torque that was applied to the sun. Both component stars of a binary star system are shown to have a common origin. The average eccentricity of a binary star is 0. 6. This is given as evidence that binary stars were formed by neither free fall collapse nor a slow agglomeration process but by a process intermediate between these two. As the stars contract, they transfer angular momentum by magnetic torque to the surrounding nebula.
