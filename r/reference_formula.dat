Numerous methods of breast size determination are currently reported but are limited by methodologic flaws and variable estimations. The authors aimed to develop a unifying predictive formula for volume assessment in small to large breasts based on anthropomorphic values. Methods: Ten anthropomorphic breast measurements and direct volumes of 108 mastectomy specimens from 88 women were collected prospectively. The authors performed a multivariate regression to build the optimal model for development of the predictive formula. The final model was then internally validated. A previously published formula was used as a reference. Results: Mean (+/- SD) breast weight was 527. 9 +/- 227. 6 g (range, 150 to 1250 g). After model selection, sternal notch-to-nipple, inframammary fold-to-nipple, and inframammary fold-to-fold projection distances emerged as the most important predictors. The resulting formula (the BREAST-V) showed an adjusted R- 2 of 0. 73. The estimated expected absolute error on new breasts is 89. 7 g (95 percent CI, 62. 4 to 119. 1 g) and the expected relative error is 18. 4 percent (95 percent CI, 12. 9 to 24. 3 percent).

40|$|Background: Several {{formulas}} predicting optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for obstructive {{sleep apnea}} treatment have been developed and diverse parameters selected as predictive factors in different sleep laboratories using different ethnic groups. This study aimed to validate a constructed predictive formula for the study laboratory and {{to test the hypothesis}} that sleep laboratories should have their own predictive formulas. Methods: Fifty-seven adult subjects with {{obstructive sleep apnea}} syndrome (OSAS) were enrolled in the model-building set and underwent two polysomnography (PSG) studies to diagnose OSAS and titrate for optimal CPAP. A predictive formula, derived from anthropometric and polysomnographic variables, was validated together with two other predictive formulas in 30 subjects by comparing the mean predictive CPAP values, rates of successful prediction, and agreements. Results: Regression analysis showed that apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), SaO 2 nadir (nadir of arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry), and body mass index (BMI) strongly correlated with optimal CPAP. The derived predictive formula for the study laboratory was: CPAPpred (predictive CPAP)  =  6. 380  +  0. 033  × AHI – 0. 068  × SaO 2 nadir +  0. 171  × BMI (R 2  =  0. 335, adjusted R 2  =  0. 298). In Taiwan, different predictive formulas used by different sleep laboratories with different independent predictors led to similar mean predictive CPAP values to the mean observed optimal CPAP values, rates of successful prediction, and agreements with the observed optimal CPAP. There were significant differences between the mean predictive CPAP values and mean observed optimal CPAP values, lower rates of successful prediction, and negatively skewed 95 % confidence interval (CI) when using a predictive formula derived from different ethnic populations. Conclusion: A sleep laboratory may not need to have its own predictive formula for determining the optimal effective CPAP but should adopt the one derived from the same ethnicity of OSAS patients as the <b>reference</b> <b>formula...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{sediment}} transport and sedimentation in estuaries is examined {{in relation to}} the Boyne Estuary situated on the Central Queensland Coast. Bottom material characteristics are examined and the most appropriate formulae for prediction of sediment transport are identified. Estuaries are natural resources that {{play an important role in}} the economic and social development of nations. They offer habitat for fish, sites for harbours, industries, and recreational activities. Sediment transport into estuaries, and the subsequent shoaling of estuaries are important estuarine processes that impact upon the physical condition (shape, depth etc) of the estuary, and therefore the uses to which the estuary can be put. As such, estuaries represent important and complex engineering problems. The sediment transport aspect of these estuarine processes is examined in this thesis with a view to quantifying the sediment transport rate in the Boyne Estuary on the Central Queensland coast of Australia. The estuary was characterised into five distinct zones using the particle size distribution of the bottom materiaL A null point, at which the velocity of the river current is effectively balanced by the velocity of the incoming tidal and coastal current was identified in one of the five zones. Analyses of the sediment transport rate were carried out using the depth of flow, mean velocity of flow, bottom roughness and characteristics of the bottom material ofthe Boyne Estuary. Sediment transport formulae reported in the literature are reviewed for this purpose with six formulae, namely, the Ackers-White formula, the Engelund-Hansen formula, the Inglis-Lacey formula, the Van Rijn formula, the Ranga Raju formula, and the Zanke formula, being selected for detailed study. Three of the six formulae (the Van Rijn formula, the Ranga Raju formula, and the Zanke formula) predict the components of the total sediment transport, namely, the bed load transport, and suspended load transport separately. The other three formulae predict the total sediment transport without any detail on the components. Wash load transport is not considered in any of the formulae.

40|$|Modeling of {{nonlinear}} interference (NLI) {{generated by}} the fiber Kerr effect is a hot topic in coherent optical transmission systems. Four years ago, the Gaussian-noise (GN) model was proposed as an approximate tool for predicting the system maximum reach performance, in realistic optical coherent transmission scenarios, over lumped-amplification dispersion uncompensated links. For this specific use, the GN model has enjoyed substantial validation, both simulative and experimental. The original GN model <b>reference</b> <b>formula</b> (GNRF) only described the simple second-order fiber dispersion. In this thesis, we first extend that formula to take the general dispersive propagation constant into account. We then make a comparison {{with the results of}} the GNRF over various types of fibers with quite different dispersions. It turns out that third-order dispersion has a very substantial effect on nonlinearity, especially near a fiber dispersion-zero. It should be mentioned that the GN model may lose accuracy for fundamental reasons when approaching a dispersion zero. These can be overcome by the enhanced-GN (EGN) model, introduced below. On the other hand, the EGN model has two contributions, one of which is the GN model, so the extension of the GN model that was {{the first part of this}} thesis provides useful results for the EGN model too. The GN model predictions, when used to obtain a detailed picture of NLI accumulation along a link rather than an estimate of the system maximum reach, may be affected by a substantial overestimation error, especially in the first few spans of the link. The error is larger for low-cardinality formats and systems with very short spans, or that use nearly-ideal distributed amplification. In this thesis, we analyze in detail the GN model errors. We discuss recently proposed formulas for correcting such errors and show that they neglect several contributions to NLI, so that they may substantially underestimate NLI in specific situations, especially over low-dispersion fibers. We derive a complete set of formulas accounting for all single-, cross-, and multi-channel effects. This set of formulas constitutes what we have called the EGN model. We extensively validate the EGN model by comparison with accurate simulations in several different system scenarios. The overall EGN model accuracy is found to be very good when assessing detailed span-by-span NLI accumulation and excellent when estimating realistic system maximum reach. The computational complexity vs. accuracy trade-offs of the various versions of the GN and EGN models, and the presence and relevance of phase noise within NLI are discussed. However, although the EGN model is theoretically rigorous, the complexity is substantially larger than that of the GN model, which makes its use difficult for real-time applications. Fortunately, we are able to derive a simple closed-form GN model correction formula based on the EGN model. The GN model, together with the correction formula, provides a low-complexity approximation to the EGN model. Such approximation has limitations, but already in its present form it effectively and rather accurately corrects for the GN model tendency to overestimate NLI, which is carefully validated over a wide range of system scenarios. The correction formula also allows to clearly identify the correction dependence on key system parameter, such as span length and loss. As a reliable model, the EGN model is then employed to evaluate NLI generation in some study-cases: 1. Dispersion pre-compensation over mixed-fiber links: The dispersion pre-compensation impact both on homogeneous links (single fiber type) and inhomogeneous links (links using a mixture of high and low dispersion fibers) is analyzed. All results demonstrate that the EGN model is capable of dealing with the dispersion pre-compensation in mixed-fiber links. 2. Determining the optimum system symbol rate: The system symbol rate impact on NLI generation is studied in detail. The EGN model is found to be quite accurate in identifying the optimum symbol rate, as well as in predicting the related performance improvement. We also derived a simple closed-form formula that very reliably predicts the optimum symbol rate for quasi-Nyquist systems with lumped amplification. 3. NLI modeling for dynamically reconfigurable networks: the variability of NLI accumulation in dynamically reconfigurable networks with re-routing, different formats and accumulated dispersion is investigated. The EGN model can take the propagation history of all channels into account, and correctly assess NLI generation with different link features. Finally, an experiment is carried out to validate the EGN model for the first time. Using a PM-QPSK Nyquist WDM transmission, we confirm the enhanced accuracy of the EGN model comparing maximum reach predictions with those of the GN mode...|$|E
