5|$|A {{centre of}} capitalism, Manchester {{was once the}} scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater {{political}} <b>recognition</b> <b>by</b> the city's working and non-titled classes. One such gathering ended with the Peterloo Massacre of 16 August 1819. The economic school of Manchester capitalism developed there, and Manchester was {{the centre of the}} Anti-Corn Law League from 1838 onward.|$|E

5|$|After a {{new term}} of {{negotiations}} between the parties, IUPAC decided to allow the name seaborgium for element 106 and changed the name of element 102 to flerovium after Georgy Flerov following the <b>recognition</b> <b>by</b> the 1993 report that the element had been first convincingly synthesized in Dubna. However, this compromise was also rejected by the American scientists and the decision was retracted. The name flerovium was later used for element 114.|$|E
5|$|Although the Loons were afforded {{respect as}} {{principal}} peace chiefs, this status was not permanent. The Cranes, led in Buffalo's time by his sub-chief Tagwagane, maintained {{that they were}} the hereditary chiefs. They said the Loons' status as spokesmen hinged upon <b>recognition</b> <b>by</b> the Cranes. A chief's power in Ojibwa society was based on persuasion and consensus; it was contingent, holding only as long as the community of elders, including the women, chose to respect and follow the chief's lead.|$|E
5|$|Before King Gyanendra was {{stripped}} of his powers by the Sansad (Nepalese parliament), there had been hope of official <b>recognition</b> <b>by</b> the state since the king was educated at a Catholic school (St Joseph' College, Darjeeling) and was a pupil of the current Apostoli Vicar, Nepalese Jesuit Father Anthony Sharma.|$|E

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official <b>recognition</b> <b>by</b> the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than <b>recognition</b> <b>by</b> the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E

5|$|The Latter Day Saint {{settlers}} of modern-day Utah {{had established}} a provisional State of Deseret, an enormous swath of territory which had little hope of <b>recognition</b> <b>by</b> Congress. The Taylor administration considered combining the California and Utah territories, but instead opted to organize the Utah Territory.

5|$|The {{practical}} construction {{given by}} the state of New York to the federal constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the Indian tribes, and the <b>recognition</b> <b>by</b> the federal authority of their validity, is very strong evidence that the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting the states from entering into treaties does not preclude a state, having the preemption right to Indian lands, from dealing with the Indian tribes directly, for the extinguishment of the Indian title.|$|E
