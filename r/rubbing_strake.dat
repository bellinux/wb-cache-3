2500|$|On March 26, 2006, Queen of the North {{was located}} by a manned {{submersible}} craft {{at a depth}} of 427 metres. The ship is intact, according to BC Ferries, and it is [...] "resting in silt on the keel and the silt covers the hull up to what's called the <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake</b> and above in some areas." [...] The ship is located at 53° 19.91' N, 129° 14.72' W. Images of the scene were given to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada as part of an ongoing investigation into the cause of the accident.|$|E
50|$|The hull {{is painted}} black with the ship's {{name and the}} Trust's website painted in white at the bow and across the stern. In addition, a large silver fern is painted {{on either side of}} the bow beneath the name. A {{stainless}} steel <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake</b> runs the length of the vessel and circular port holes are visible above the waterline. A wooden rail runs around the edge of the entire deck.|$|E
5000|$|The class {{consisted}} of 93 ships, launched between 1954 and 1959. [...] was the first. They {{were built in}} three slightly different sub-groups, the first sub-group, the 26-group, is distinguished by pennant numbers 26xx, and {{the second and third}} sub-groups, the 27-group, are distinguished by pennant numbers 27xx. The 26-group was of wood and non-ferrous metal composite construction and the 27-group was of all-wood construction. The third sub-group is distinguished by a prominent <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake</b> around the hull and slightly larger dimensions.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 L and GL {{models were}} {{introduced}} and Pampa models received the front from the 4x4 version. For the 1987 model year, the Pampas got the new front from the Del the Rey and the Ghia version {{was added to}} the range with the luxury equipment of the Del Rey Ghia, including electric windows. However air conditioning was only an optional extra. The Pampa in 1989 the larger VW AP-1800 engine became available for the L, GL and Ghia versions although the 1.6 L CHT engine remained in the L and GL 4x4 versions. For 1991, the S version arrived, with the same 1.8 litre motor as the Gol GTS and Escort XR3. This was more powerful and quicker, enabling a top speed of 106 mi/h km/h. Standard equipment included side <b>rubbing</b> <b>strakes,</b> a dipping rear view mirror, optional hydraulic power assisted steering, alloy wheels, front spoiler with integral fog lights and items which were standard on the Ghia version.|$|R
50|$|The Woodchurch {{remained}} in near constant operation up until 1980 {{when she was}} withdrawn from service and laid up in Morpeth Dock for reasons of economy. Up until this period there had been minimal maintenance work carried out on the vessel {{and at one point}} she even lost the forward port side <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake.</b> She was put up for sale, but no buyer was found. During this time she was cannibalised for parts to keep the other ferries running. By 1983, the ferry was re-painted and overhauled and returned to passenger service.|$|E

50|$|Inboard of {{the sheer}} strake the heavier gunwale is {{similarly}} bent in along the line {{of the sheer}}. This part of the work is finished by fitting the breast hook and quarter knees. Swivel or crutch chocks are fitted as appropriate to the gunwale, the thwarts fitted down onto the rising and held in position by knees up to the gunwale and perhaps down onto the stringer. The structure of gunwale, rising, thwart and thwart knees greatly stiffens and strengthens the shell and turns it into a boat. There are several ways of fixing the <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake</b> but in a clinker boat, it is applied to the outside of the sheer strake.|$|E
5000|$|The hull was {{of round}} bilge wooden construction, planked with two diagonally opposed skins {{with a layer}} of oiled calico between them - known as a “double-diagonal” technique. The hull was {{completed}} with frames or “timbers” riveted perpendicularly from the keel to the gunwale {{on the inside of the}} planking, forming a very strong hull. The hull was further strengthened by the addition of longitudinal stringers riveted inside the timbers together with further timbers, known as [...] "web frames". They were fastened inside the stringers opposite every third main timber. HDMLs were fitted with a deeper section <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake</b> aft. Its purpose was to roll depth charges (kept in and delivered from racks on the side decks) clear of the hull and propellers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{uppermost}} continuous strake {{along the}} topsides {{is called the}} sheer strake. In old vessels, a <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake</b> was built in just below a carvel sheer strake. It was much less broad but thicker than other strakes so that it projected and took any rubbing against piers or other boats when the boat was in use. In clinker boats, the <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake</b> {{was applied to the}} outside of the sheer strake. The strakes adjacent to the garboard are referred to accordingly as the first broad and second broad. Each strake thereafter has its own special name such as bottom strakes, lowers, bilge strakes, topside strakes, and uppers. Many current pleasure craft reflect this history by providing the boat with a mechanically attached (and therefore replaceable) rub rail at the location formerly occupied by a <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake,</b> often doubling to cover the joint between a GRP hull and its innerliner.A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape. It is commonly employed in carvel and iron/steel shipbuilding, but there are very few, possibly only one type of, clinker craft that use them."A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape." [...] This statement represents a mis-understanding of what a [...] "stealer" [...] is tasked with accomplishing as a hull is lined-off. After determining the widths of strakes amidships (there are three categories), a quantity can be determined for all these strakes. This quantity is then divided into the height of the stem to determine the width of the average hood-end. This width must be twice the hood-ends thickness or it {{will not be able to}} carry its fasteners. If the hood-ends are not wide enough, the quantity is dropped by one until the resulting revised width is strong enough to carry its fasteners. Stealer is actually a misspelling of the word steeler, the plankers borrowed this word from their peers in the foundry, where forgers would strengthen a piece of metal by steeling a different metal to the original piece. This was analogous to strengthening the hood-end by making it wider, providing more wood mass around each hood-end. Wider meant fewer hood-ends. A device was needed to compensate for the drop in strakes that actually reached the stem. The device was a strake that was stooped short of the stem by burying its forward butt end into a notch chiseled into a through plank. This strake was called a steeler by the plankers and a drop plank by the liners who originated it by counting strakes during the lining off process.|$|E
5000|$|For many years, SS St. Louis was {{prominent}} as {{a passenger}} liner between New York and Liverpool. On 17 March 1917, she was furnished an armed guard of 26 United States Navy sailors and armed with three 6-inch guns, {{to protect her}} from enemy attack as she continued her New York-to-Liverpool service. On 30 May, while proceeding up the Irish Sea and skirting the coast of England, she responded rapidly to the orders, [...] "Hard Starboard," [...] at the sighting of a periscope, and succeeded in dodging a torpedo while apparently striking the submarine which fired it. Later dry-dock examination revealed that 18 feet of her keel <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake</b> had been torn away. On 25 July, her gunners exchanged fire with a surfaced U-boat, some three miles away, and sighted many near misses.On 17 April 1918, St. Louis was delivered to the Navy at New York to be wholly manned and operated by the Navy as a troop transport. She was renamed Louisville (SP-1644), as a cruiser named St. Louis was already in service in the Navy. Louisville was commissioned on 24 April.|$|E
50|$|The ferry was {{the first}} of the fleet to be of {{all-welded}} construction and she is currently the last Mersey Ferry to be built. The Overchurch was popular with its Captains and Mates as its navigation bridge spanned the whole ship, rather than having a wheelhouse and side cabs such as Mountwood and Woodchurch used. A model of the ship by builders Cammel Laird is on display in the Williamson Gallery in Birkenhead. The wheelhouse was spacious with a single binnacle and brass wheel. Most of the ships control instruments were fitted into specially built stand alone units, including the telegraph heads. Unlike Mountwood and Woodchurch, there was no central set of telegraphs next to the helm, so the crew were required to move to either of the bridge wings to control the engines. Her bridge was modern, unlike the compact and relatively cluttered bridges on the Overchurch's two near sisters, where most of the instruments were attached to the bulkheads. It was a handsome vessel, with clean and smooth lines and a stout funnel. Her original livery was Birkenhead's orange and black, with a flame red band above the <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} Wallasey twins, the Mountwood and Woodchurch were highly advanced. They benefited from an {{injection}} of cash from both Birkenhead Corporation and the Joint Tunnel Committee. They were given special Crossley eight-cylinder engines which were fitted with gears and automatic air brakes. New style telegraphs by Chadburns were designed which had a facility for braking the engines for rapid reversal, the telegraphs {{were part of a}} brand known as [...] "Synchrostep" [...] and were all originally unpainted brushed aluminium with shiny brass rimming. Woodchurch had its telegraphs painted blue, but Mountwood's became green and Overchurch had the same telegraph 'heads' however they were fitted into the wings and main control position in specially built units which also had instruments fitted to them. They entered service in 1960 and were an instant hit with ferry passengers. They were light, modern and boasted the latest in marine navigation equipment. They were given an orange and black funnel livery, with a red band just above the <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake.</b> In their early years of service both the ferries carried rope fenders to protect the strakes.|$|E
5000|$|... adhesive, notably epoxy. Traditionally, lands {{were neither}} glued nor was {{anything}} used to bed them. The garboard was bedded onto the hog and keel, and {{the ends of}} the strakes onto the stem and apron using a mixture of white lead and grease. During the World Wars new techniques and materials were developed by the aircraft industry. By the mid-1950s, these were well infiltrated into the boatbuilding trade. New boats in classes of racing dinghy with clinker hulls were built as glued clinker boats. The basic construction was the same but ply planking was used and the lands were glued with no fastenings, except that the ends and garboards were still screwed to apron and hog. The need to prevent the splitting of the planks was removed by the use of ply so no timbers were used. Except for a light gunwale and wide <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake,</b> the longitudinals were omitted too. A short thwart rising and knees were glued to the planking. These boats were all decked and that is how adequate stiffness was achieved. So that the liquid glue could be laid onto the land before the next plank was assembled onto it, they were built upside down.|$|E
50|$|Fairlie {{brought a}} number of other {{innovative}} and highly effective features to the design. For instance, the forestay is bolted right through the hull and secured with a bolt hidden at the centre of a bronze casting of a thistle which becomes a feature of the bow. The shrouds and backstay are secured to u-bolts through the deck, eliminating the need for rigging screws. The u-bolts provide a compression packing that can be screwed down tight, and owners report that they seldom leak. The deck is moulded with a lip that turns up to fit inside the hull moulding, and after being glued and glassed in, the join is covered with a custom-designed vinyl moulding that eliminates the common problem of deck/hull leaks, and also serves as a practical <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake.</b> The mast is deck-stepped on an aluminium channel that sits above the two main internal bulkheads - a solution that allows easy passage below decks to the forecabin, while ensuring a solid base for the mast. Many of the boats were delivered with an outboard engine that was mounted in a cutout in the rear cockpit bench seat and could be removed and stowed below the cockpit - a configuration that was later adopted in other production yachts. These models were also delivered with an arch in the companionway cutout instead of a sliding hatchway, thus simplifying construction, retaining bulkhead strength and removing another possible source of leaks.|$|E
5000|$|Egremont {{differed}} externally to Leasowe in {{that she}} had a canvas awning fitted around her funnel. Early photographs of Leasowe and Egremont show them carrying what look like binnacle shrouds (the brass lids that sit atop of a binnacle) on the roof of their wheelhouses and wing cabs. It is not understood what these were. Some people have said that they were in fact ventilation devices. Upon the bridge there were numerous modern devices. Chadburn synchrostep telegraphs and rudder angle indicators, hydraulic steering telemotor and an automatic whistle control could be found in both the wheelhouse and the navigation boxes. There was also an internal communication system, a ship to shore radio and PA system and three binnacles on the bridge. Similar types of navigation equipment and deck fittings used on these vessels are extant on the Edmund Gardner Pilot Boat at Merseyside Maritime Museum. The Leasowe and Egremont were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers, where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery. When the ferries entered service they all had Wallasey white and black funnel liveries. There was, however, a major design fault with Leasowe and Egremont. In order to reach the bows of the ship when casting off etc., crew members were required to either push through the hordes of commuters and climb down a ladder from the forward promenade deck or walk along the <b>rubbing</b> <b>strake</b> and climb over. In flat calm conditions this was not a problem, but in a force 8 gale with the vessel bobbing around wildly, it could be considerably dangerous. The simple reason for such problems was because there was no door leading from the main saloon to the bow area of the ships! ...|$|E
