The time that catheters required to become blocked was recorded and encrustation was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Results When a manual valve was used to drain urine from the bladder at 2 -hour intervals 4 times during the day, catheters required significantly longer to become blocked than those on continuous drainage (mean 62. 6 vs 35. 9 hours, p = 0. 039). A similar 1. 7 -fold increase occurred when urine was drained at 4 -hour intervals 3 times daily.
