40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present and to analyse the legal {{framework}} for the regulation of prostitution in the Croatian-Slavonian territory in the period of validity of the Criminal Code on Felonies, Misdemeanours and Petty Offenses of 1852. The main characteristic of this period is the reglementaristic attitude of the legislator towards prostitution. Reglementarism perceived prostitution as the “necessary evil” that should have been strictly controlled in order to reduce potential social harm. Local police forces supervised prostitution and decided whether or not to prosecute prostitution, and in some cases they tolerated it. For this purpose, local police issued special regulations that were compulsory for prostitutes, kept an official register of prostitutes and brought them under control by keeping their “indecent profession” <b>registered.</b> <b>Registered</b> prostitutes had to undergo regularly scheduled medical examinations. Because of the complexity of prostitution as a social phenomenon and its numerous implications, in addition to criminal provisions, communities sought to take action against the presence of prostitution within local police regulations and health regulations...|$|E

A vertical shrinkage rod casting with circular cross-section (constant or fixed: tapered) {{has been used}} as a test sample. Two type of experiments have been conducted: 1) on development of the test sample linear dimension changes (linear expansion/contraction), 2) on development of shrinkage stresses in the test sample. By the linear contraction experiments the linear dimension changes of the test sample and the metal test mould as well a temperature in six points of the test sample have been registered. By shrinkage stresses examination a shrinkage tension force and linear dimension changes of the test sample as well a temperature in three points of the test sample have been <b>registered.</b> <b>Registered</b> time dependences of the test bar and the test mould linear dimension changes have shown, that so-called pre-shrinkage extension has been mainly by mould thermal extension caused.
