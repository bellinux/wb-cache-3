5000|$|In Industrial Knitting applications, {{the terms}} [...] "Flat" [...] and [...] "Circular" [...] have very {{different}} meanings to those given above. A [...] "Flat" [...] or Vee Bed knitting machine consists of 2 flat needle beds arranged in an upside-down [...] "V" [...] formation. These needle beds can be up to 2.5 metres wide. A carriage, {{also known as a}} Cambox or Head, moves backwards and forwards across these needle beds, working the needles to selectively, knit, tuck or <b>transfer</b> <b>stitches.</b> A flat knitting machine is very flexible, allowing complex stitch designs, shaped knitting and precise width adjustment. It is, however relatively slow when compared to a circular machine. Knitting speed up to [...]5 m/s or low is considered the low speed in flat knitting which is generally in hand flat machines. The two largest manufacturers of industrial flat knitting machines are Stoll of Germany, and Shima Seiki of Japan. The industrial hand flat knitting machine is considered to be launched by the Isaac Lamb patents.|$|R

50|$|Lacey knits can be {{achieved}} by slipping a stitch, picking up a stitch or knitting two together. On a frame, a tickler wire could realise individual loops and create a run that would be picked up by hand. The frame was modified by adding a tickler bar and a tuck presser, to allow held and tuck stitches. Here the weft was held in the beard and carried up to the next course where two threads were passed together. Messrs Morris and Betts took a patent (807) in 1764 on a <b>stitch</b> <b>transfer</b> devise where threads from one needle were passed to another. With tuck stitches, this a created 'eyelet holes'. Partial <b>stitch</b> <b>transfer</b> produced a marker stitch.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Zigzag wingbox concept {{that allows the}} wing span to be varied by 44 % (22 % extension and 22 % retraction). The Zigzag wingbox consists of a rigid part and a morphing part. The rigid part is a semi-monocoque construction that houses the fuel tank and transfers the aerodynamic loads from the morphing part to the fuselage. The morphing part consists of various morphing partitions where in each partition there are two spars each consisting of two beams hinged together. Each morphing partition is covered by flexible skin and is bounded by two ribs through which the spars are connected. The <b>ribs</b> <b>transfer</b> the loads between the spars of adjacent morphing partitions and serves as the main structure to which the flexible skins are to be attached. The Zigzag wingbox concept is then incorporated in the rectangular wing of a medium altitude long endurance (MALE) UAV to enhance its operational performance and provide roll control. Equivalent modelling and preliminary sizing of the concept are performed to assess its feasibility and quantify its potential benefits...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. In the manufacture of fully-fashioned knitted outerwear, it is usual for the garment sections to be constructed with a lower rib portion on to which is knitted a fashioned section of plain knitting. The majority of fully fashioned knitting machines are capable of producing only the plain fabric section, the rib portion being knitted separately on V-bed machines. In order to knit the plain section of the garment pieces on to the rib, each loop of the <b>rib</b> must be <b>transferred</b> to a corresponding knitting element on the fully fashioned knitting machine. It is common practice within the knitwear industry to perform this transfer manually, each loop of a slack course in the rib being impaled on {{to a point of}} a magazine bar, the excess courses of knitting being unroved as waste. The loops are then transferred from this bar, via a feeding bar on to the knitting elements of the fully-fashioned machine. This manual transfer of the loops is both tedious and expensive in terms of labour. However, there are recently developed machines on the market which will knit the <b>rib</b> and <b>transfer</b> it automatically to a magazine bar but they are both expensive and also render the existing plant obsolete. This thesis describes the concept, design and development of a novel patented automatic <b>rib</b> <b>transfer</b> system which relies on the relatively inexpensive modification of existing V-bed knitting machines. The modifications are aimed at providing a sub-assembly attachment suitable for a variety of V-bed knitting machines. Bars loaded automatically by these modified machines may be fed to any fully-fashioned knitting machine via a specially developed "gauge-changing" device to alter the pitch of the loops from that of the V-bed machine to that of the fully-fashioned machine. These automatically loaded bars may also be used to feed either a modern semi-automatic "linking system", such as the Boehringer Autolinker, or, in certain cases a conventional linking dial. NOTE. The term 'rib transfer' is used {{in the context of this}} thesis to describe the operation of <b>transferring</b> a knitted <b>rib</b> from a V-bed knitting machine to a straight bar knitting machine...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ice {{formation}} next to solid surfaces {{is important}} in many biological, materials, and geological phenomena and may {{be a factor in}} how they impact various technologies. We have used sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy to study the structure of ice as well as the freezing and melting transition temperatures of water in contact with sapphire substrates. We have observed that the structure of ice and water are a function of pH and the surface charge of the sapphire substrate. At low pH, we observed an increase in the SFG signal subsequent to ice formation. Contrary to expectations, at pH 9. 8, corresponding to a negatively charged surface, the intensity of the ice SFG signal is about 10 times lower than that of water. Recent simulation studies have suggested that charge transfer is important for the high intensity of the ice peak at the ice−air interface. We believe that the segregation of sodium ions next to the negatively charged sapphire substrate may be responsible for disrupting the charge <b>transfer</b> and <b>stitching</b> bilayer at high pH, providing a plausible explanation for the experimental observations. Even though the structure of water an...|$|R

In this paper, {{a new generation of}} composite sandwich slab is proposed as a solution for the rehabilitation of slabs in old masonry buildings. An innovative solution was developed during this research formed by four components: a Deflection Hardening Cement Composite (DHCC) layer on the top compression skin, a glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) skin at the bottom tension surface, GFRP <b>ribs</b> to <b>transfer</b> shear from top to bottom layers, and foam core for thermal-insolation purposes. The DHCC layer contributes significantly for the load carrying and deflection capacity due to its stiffness, compressive strength and toughness, offers resistance to the occurrence of buckling phenomena in the GFRP ribs, improves the performance of this structural concept against impact and fire, and constitutes an excellent medium for the application of finishing materials, like ceramics or timber. Two different hybrid composite slabs were developed and tested, and their behavior was assessed under flexural loading. The results showed that the developed hybrid sandwich slabs accomplish all design requisites for serviceability and ultimate limit states, and assure a stiffness/dead-weight and load-capacity/dead-weight ratios much higher than conventional structural slab systems.

40|$|The {{present study}} intends to {{evaluate}} the flexural performance of hybrid sandwich panels through the execution of four point bending tests. The proposed hybrid sandwich panel uses Deflection Hardening Cementitious Composites (DHCC) on the top layer, a GFRP bottom layer and perforated shear connectors in the GFRP <b>ribs</b> to <b>transfer</b> shear stresses between top and bottom layers. The tested hybrid slabs use two types of shear connectors, which include indented and perforated shapes. The tests were performed to study the behaviour of a novel shear connection between the GFRP ribs and the DHCC layer that is here proposed. A comparison on the obtained experimental results was executed to clarify {{the influence of the}} shear connectors’ geometries on the flexural performance of the developed hybrid slabs. The results show that the shear connection mechanical behaviour strongly influences the peak load, the deflection at peak load, the post-peak load carrying capacity and the degree of composite action of the hybrid slabs.

40|$|The {{detailed}} {{heat transfer}} distributions and {{pressure drop in}} the turn region of a U-bend channel with and without ribs have been experimentally investigated using liquid crystal thermography. The Reynolds numbers based on hydraulic diameter of the channel and the bulk velocity are 20, 000 and 26, 000. The ribs are mounted on the outer wall surface in the turn region of the U-bend channel; the rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio is 6 %; the rib pitch-to-height ratio is 12; and the rib configurations studied are transverse (90 °), angled (45 °, 60 °), and V-shaped (45 °, 60 °) with tip facing downstream and upstream. Results indicate that heat transfer on the smooth outer wall {{is dominated by the}} flow impingement. In the presence of <b>ribs,</b> the heat <b>transfer</b> patterns are significantly altered due to the combined effects of the sharp turn and ribs.

40|$|AbstractThe hollow {{cylinder}} shear test is somewhat controversial {{due to its}} non-uniform stresses and strains, and has been analyzed by simple theoretical methods and two-dimensional FE calculations. In this paper, the {{hollow cylinder}} test under strain control was carried out numerically by treating the specimen as a three-dimensional initial-boundary value problem considering the inertial forces. At first, besides the known nonuniform strain, the non-uniformities of excess pore water pressure and overconsolidation ratio {{have been shown to}} benefit from a soil–water coupled analysis that employs the SYS Cam-clay model. Then, the influence of the specimen geometries, including wall thicknesses, heights and outer diameters on the non-uniformity was investigated sequentially. A new method for evaluating non-uniformity was proposed, which is suitable for the three-dimensional analysis. The response under a uniform deformation field, which is indicated by “the perfect path”, was presented to draw a comparison with the apparent behaviors, with non-uniformities taken into consideration. It should be noted that there is a critical height to prevent failure at the specimen ends according to the apparent behavior. Finally, the torque-controlled experiment indicated that 4 <b>ribs</b> could not <b>transfer</b> the torque reliably while 6 or 8 ribs were feasible...|$|R
40|$|Enhancement of {{bottom wall}} forced {{convection}} heat transfer rates in a ribbed cooling channel combined with differently shaped deflectors is investigated numerically. Four deflectors, including the sloping board (Case A), convex curved (Case B), concave curved (Case C), and cylindrical (Case D) deflectors, are {{mounted on the}} upper-downstream side of the <b>ribs.</b> The heat <b>transfer</b> and flow features are analyzed and compared based on the validation of the turbulence model and careful study of the grid independence. The {{results show that the}} flow structures are deeply affected by the deflectors, accompanied by changes in the heat transfer and friction factor. Compared with the ribbed channel with sloping board deflectors, Case B can guide the mainstream fluid to compress the recirculating flow region located on the lee-side regions downstream from the rib and can enhance the heat transfer of the bottom surface, despite the increasing friction factor. It is noted that the decrement ratio of the friction factor in Case D is 7. 0 - 12. 4 %. Based on this remarkable expression, Cases B and D contribute to better overall performance. This is due to their prominent performance in the heat transfer enhancement and diminished flow resistance...|$|R

Computer design involves creation of a mathematical model of a product and analyzing its effectiveness in simulated operation.

Wolverine employees attacked a traditional brake drum problem, the sudden buildup of heat during fast and repeated braking.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, large eddy {{simulation}} {{was used to}} study a variety of wall-bounded turbulent flows using a compressible finite volume formulation. Subgrid scale terms in both momentum and energy equations were modeled dynamically. Furthermore, due to the inhomogeniety of wall-bounded flows, the model was further localized to better represent the physics of the problem. The model was first applied to study the incompressible turbulent flow through a duct with square cross-section. Mean flow, law of the wall, and turbulence statistics were compared with the benchmark results of direct numerical simulation and excellent agreement was achieved. The secondary flow in the cross-section was captured. It is composed of four pairs of counter-rotating cells. The interaction between mean and secondary flow fields creates some important features and they were studied in this work. Based on incompressible duct flow, system rotation was applied to investigate the effects of rotation on the turbulent flow field. The system rotation was found to reduce turbulence level on the leading side, while increase turbulence level on the trailing side. Because of the rotation, the secondary flow field in non-rotating duct {{was found to be}} diminished at weaker rotation and even eliminated at stronger rotation. Instead, a pair of counter rotating cells called Taylor-Görtler vortices, as well as the Taylor-Proudman regime, was found to exist in the cross-section, which is consistent with the results of the literature. Large eddy simulation was also applied to investigate the effects of ribs and system rotation on heat transfer in a channel. It was found that a rib creates recirculation zones near the rib. The turbulence level is at its maximum near the ribs. The existence of <b>ribs</b> enhances heat <b>transfer</b> significantly over the plane channel, as well as creates low-heat-transfer-coefficient region in the recirculation zones.
