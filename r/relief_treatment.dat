500|$|CSF can leak {{from the}} dura {{as a result}} of {{different}} causes such as physical trauma or a lumbar puncture, or from no known cause when it is termed spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak. It is usually associated with intracranial hypotension: low CSF pressure. It can cause headaches, made worse by standing, moving and coughing, as the low CSF pressure causes the brain to [...] "sag" [...] downwards and put pressure on its lower structures. If a leak is identified, a beta-2 transferrin test of the leaking fluid, when positive, is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for CSF leakage. Medical imaging such as CT scans and MRI scans can be used to investigate for a presumed CSF leak when no obvious leak is found but low CSF pressure is identified.

5000|$|Trochleitis is {{diagnosed}} based on three criteria: 1) demonstration of inflammation of superior oblique tendon/ trochlea region, 2) periorbital pain and tenderness to palpation {{in the area}} of the sore trochlea, and 3) worsening of pain on attempted vertical eye movement, particularly with adduction of the eye. It is important to identify trochleitis because it is a treatable condition and the patient can benefit much from pain <b>relief.</b> <b>Treatment</b> consists of a single injection of corticosteroids to the affected peritrochlear region. A specific [...] "cocktail" [...] consisting of 0.5 ml of depomedrol (80 mg/ml) and 0.5 ml of 2% lidocaine can be injected into the trochlea; immediate relief due to the effects of the local anesthetic indicates successful placement. However, great care must be taken as the injection is in the region of several arteries, veins and nerves. The needle should not be too small (so as not to penetrate tiny structures), the surgeon should draw back on the syringe (to ensure not have pierced a vessel), the lidocaine should not contain epinephrine (which could cause vasospasm), and the pressure of the injection must always be controlled. Only a limited number of injections can be made as they would otherwise lead to muscle atrophy. Diagnosis can be confirmed by response to this treatment; pain and swelling are expected to disappear in 48-72 hours. Some patients experience recurrence of trochleitis.|$|E
40|$|Ultra-high {{strength}} steels {{is known}} to be susceptible for hydrogen embrittlement at very low concentrations of hydrogen. In this thesis three methods to prevent or reduce the hydrogen embrittlement in martensitic steel, with tensile strength of 1500 MPa, were studied. First, a barrier layer of aluminium designed to prevent hydrogen to enter the steel, which were deposited by vacuum evaporation. Second, a decarburization process of the steels surface designed to mitigate the induced stresses from cutting. Last, a hydrogen <b>relief</b> <b>treatment</b> at 150 °C for 11 days and 200 °C for 4 days, to reduce the hydrogen concentration in the steel. The effect of the hydrogen embrittlement was analyzed by manual measurements of the elongations after a slow strain rate testing at 5 * 10 - 6 mm/s, and the time to fracture in an in-situ constant load test with a current density of 1. 92 mA/cm 2 in a 0. 5 M Na 2 SO 4 solution. The barrier layer showed an increase in time to fracture, but also a decrease in elongations. The decarburized steel had a small increase in the time to fracture, but not enough to make it a feasible process. The hydrogen <b>relief</b> <b>treatment</b> showed a general decrease in hydrogen concentrations, but the elongation measurements was irregular although with a tendency for improvement. The simplicity of the hydrogen <b>relief</b> <b>treatment</b> makes it an interesting process to reduce the influence of hydrogen embrittlement. However, more investigations are necessary...|$|E
40|$|In this {{investigation}} a DoE (Design of Experiments) analysis of distortion {{for a typical}} manufacturing process of pre-straightened, cold drawn and induction hardened AISI 1045 cylindrical steel bars was carried out.

40|$|Abstract – The {{practice}} of tempering for stress relief before cryogenic thermal treatment in an AISI D 2 tool steel {{has been shown}} to stabilize the retained austenite, nullifying the effect of cryogenic treatment The practice simultaneously enhances the wear resistance of the steel after complete thermal cycling (quench + stress relief + cryogenic treatment + double temper). Cryogenic treatment {{has been shown to}} have a large effect on the properties of heat treated steels, especially tool steels. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of some parts it is necessary to do a prior stress relief heat treatment to avoid cracks and catastrophic failures. In previous work [1] it was verified that the stress <b>relief</b> <b>treatment</b> stabilizes the austenite even when the sample is submerged in liquid nitrogen. The literature [2] suggests that there is a C-curve kinetic behavior for the austenite to martensite transformation at temperatures lower than Ms. In order to confirm those previous work results[1] and test the hypothesis of a C-curve behavior, samples from an AISI D 2 tool steel bar were austenitized at 1040 °C for 40 minutes and then quenched in oil. Half of the samples were submitted to a stress <b>relief</b> <b>treatment</b> at 130 °C for 90 minutes in order to enable comparison between samples with and without stress relief. Afterwards, some samples were submitted to a deep cryogenic treatment (DCT- immersion in liquid nitrogen) and others to a shallow cryogenic treatment (SCT-immersion in dry ice), for 2 and 24 hours...|$|E

40|$|The aim in {{this work}} is to study the {{influence}} of nickel content (as-welded state and after stress <b>relief</b> heat <b>treatment)</b> on the microstructure and toughness of CMn weld metals obtained with submerged arc welding. The nickel content vary between 0. 50 wt. % and 3. 11 wt. %. The microstructures were observed using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The toughness was evaluated by Charpy-V impact testing in samples cut transversally to the weld bead. The impact energy showed that nickel content up to 1 wt. % improves the toughness due to the increase of the acicular ferrite (AF) content and microstructural refinement. On the other hand, higher nickel contents have a deleterious effect on the toughness due {{to the presence of}} the microconstituent martensite- austenite (M-A) in the weld metal. The stress <b>relief</b> heat <b>treatment</b> did not improve too much the weld metal toughness, even the M-A suffering decomposition (ferrite+carbide). This may be explained by the precipitation of carbides along the boundaries of the ferrite...|$|R
