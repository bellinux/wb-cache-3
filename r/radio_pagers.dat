25|$|Technological {{advances}} {{such as the}} Internet, weather <b>radio,</b> <b>pagers,</b> {{and cell}} phones have made spotter activation quick and efficient; however, the basic goal of spotting has remained relatively unchanged to this day. In making these reports, spotters use a specialized set of jargon and slang to describe their observations.|$|E
50|$|When {{available}} for a call, retained firefighters carry <b>radio</b> <b>pagers</b> to alert them to an emergency call. They must live or work a maximum of 4.5 minutes from the fire station at which they serve {{and respond to the}} fire station before manning the fire appliance and attending an incident. The time is dependent on which fire and rescue organisation they work for.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962 the Bell System—the U.S. {{telephone}} monopoly colloquially {{known as}} [...] "Ma Bell"—presented its Bellboy radio paging {{system at the}} Seattle World's Fair. Bellboy was the first commercial system for personal paging. It also marked {{one of the first}} consumer applications of the transistor (invented by Bell Labs in 1947), for which three Bell Labs inventors received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956. Solid-state circuitry enabled the Bellboy pager, {{about the size of a}} small TV remote device, to fit into a customer's pocket or purse, quite a feat at that time. The Bellboy was a terminal that notified the user when someone was trying to call them. When the person received an audible signal (a buzz) on the pager, he found a telephone and called the service centre, which informed him of the caller's message. Bell System Bellboy <b>radio</b> <b>pagers</b> each used three reed receiver relays, each relay tuned to one of 33 different frequencies, selectively ringing a particular customer when all three relays were activated at the same time—a precursor of DTMF. The ReFLEX protocol was developed in the mid-1990s.|$|E

Pb II <b>radio</b> <b>pager</b> H04BNC Series 406-420 MHz, 450-470 MHz (US and Eur). The variety and reliability made the system popular worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The alarm can be {{performed}} by different alarm systems, such as by sirens or pager. In Germany, the alarm via <b>radio</b> <b>pager</b> is on the frequencies of the BOS radio. In Austria, the fire departments have their own frequencies.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{receiving}} an emergency call via <b>radio</b> <b>pager,</b> retained firefghters immediately {{respond to the}} fire station. Unlike many volunteer firefighters in the United States, retained firefighters {{are not permitted to}} use blue lights or sirens on their personal vehicles to get to the station, and they must obey normal road traffic laws at all times whilst en route.|$|R
5000|$|When {{required}} to answer an emergency call, retained firefighters are {{summoned to the}} fire station by a <b>radio</b> <b>pager</b> (also known as a [...] "alerter"). Once at the station, the crews staff the fire engine and proceed to the incident. Retained firefighters are therefore {{required to}} live or work near to the fire station they serve. This allows them to respond to emergencies within acceptable and strict attendance time targets set out by each fire service.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s [...] "ANSAWare" [...] {{software}} {{based on}} the ANSA architecture was used by many organizations ahead of the widespread availability of commercial, CORBA-based products for distributed computing. Notable successes included the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), a European <b>radio</b> <b>pager</b> system and the online customer service system for a major UK utility. As part of his ANSA work, Herbert played {{an active role in}} many standards and consortia for distributed computing including TINA-C, RM-ODP, OSF DCE and OMG CORBA.|$|R

2500|$|An {{occupied}} station {{will usually}} have a station alarm system for receiving and annunciating an alarm, and indications of where and what caused the alarm. However, sometimes the only [...] "alarm" [...] is a telephone that is rung in case of emergency. In a volunteer fire department where volunteers do not staff the station, the firefighters may be summoned to the fire station by siren, <b>radio</b> or <b>pagers,</b> making a station alarm system superfluous.|$|R
50|$|SMS, as used {{on modern}} handsets, {{originated}} from radio telegraphy in <b>radio</b> memo <b>pagers</b> that used standardized phone protocols. These were defined in 1985 {{as part of}} the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) series of standards. The protocols allowed users to send and receive messages of up to 160 alpha-numeric characters to and from GSM mobile handsets. Though most SMS messages are mobile-to-mobile text messages, support for the service has expanded to include other mobile technologies, such as ANSI CDMA networks and Digital AMPS.|$|R
50|$|A few fire brigades {{are experimenting}} with a GSM-based alarm circuit. The {{firefighter}} will then get either a message on his mobile phone or a machine will call him. This method has proven successful in areas, where constant <b>radio</b> contact for <b>pagers</b> can not be guaranteed, e.g. in mountainous areas.|$|R
50|$|The Digital Emergency Alert System (DEAS) was {{a system}} {{managed by the}} Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and {{designed}} to alert first-responders and civilians {{in the event of}} a national emergency. It was based upon and supplemented the Emergency Alert System (EAS) by sending out text, voice, video, and other digital messages to mobile phones, <b>pagers,</b> <b>radios,</b> and televisions.|$|R
50|$|Ambulance {{communications}} functions include 000 Emergency call-taking, non-emergency {{patient transport}} requests, and ambulance dispatch for emergency and non-emergency vehicles. Modern emergency services communications is highly advanced, and communications staff use {{a wide range}} of technologies including digital and analogue <b>radio,</b> telephones, <b>pagers,</b> and advanced computer and GPS systems. Many emergency services vehicles, including ambulances, are fitted with mobile data terminals that enable them to view information, read messages sent by call-takers and dispatchers, and be notified of updates immediately as they become available. A number of communication services used by Ambulance Victoria, such as digital radio and mobile data terminals, are not available outside metropolitan Melbourne.|$|R
40|$|Sensemaking is {{the process}} of {{understanding}} an unfamiliar situation in order to act effectively. Crisis response requires emergency departments and emergency medical services teams to collaboratively make sense of an uncertain and unfamiliar situation. We conducted focus groups to examine how information and communication technologies help collaborative sensemaking across response teams. We found that communication of information was a key aspect of sensemaking and communication tools like the <b>radio,</b> phones, <b>pagers,</b> and paper were preferred to computer-based systems for sensemaking among teams. Our findings highlight the need to develop new information systems, or enhance existing ones, for supporting collaborative sensemaking among geographically-distributed teams engaged in time-critical work...|$|R
50|$|Alpha Dispatch {{service is}} best {{described}} as enhanced numeric paging. It is a service that consists of live operators who answer incoming calls and input the callers' messages on a computer, then transmit the message using the Telocator Alphanumeric input Protocol to the paging provider's <b>radio</b> towers. Alphanumeric <b>pagers</b> receive the messages {{in the form of}} words and numbers. Messages are sequentially numbered and archived for later reference if required to be re-sent. PageNet was one of the larger paging providers who offered this service add-on to their alphanumeric pager customers.|$|R
40|$|Great {{concern has}} been {{demonstrated}} by different aeronautic operators {{about the effects of}} electromagnetic interference in avionics and electronic equipments of airplanes, due to the use of portable electronic devices (PEDs), which can be easily carried by the passengers. Among the suspect devices, there are laptops and palmtops, audio recorders and reproducers, electronic games and toys, laser pointers, cell phones, communication <b>radios</b> and <b>pagers.</b> Uncouplings or automatic pilot deviations, mistaken indications in displays and, even, the unadverted disconnection of the avionics or variations not commanded in the control surfaces are flaws attributed to these devices. In spite of suffering critics, several regulation agencies in aeronautics, all over the world, have prohibited the use of these portable devices, specially in the critical phases of the flight landing and take off. Nevertheless, its getting bigger the passengers desire of using, uninterruptely, laptops and cell phones, what makes necessary the adoption of safety procedures to satisfy this demand. Besides the concern over these dangerous effects, there are yet, doubts over the topic, and, therefore, its indicated the need of more investigations over these phenomenons. In this work, we relate the main accomplished experiments with the intent to clarify how the PEDs, more specifically the cell phones, cause an undesirable electromagnetic interference...|$|R
50|$|A {{volunteer}} fire department is normally {{reached the same}} way as other emergency services, such as by calling 9-1-1 or 1-1-2. A central dispatcher then calls out the VFD, often through equipment such as <b>pagers,</b> <b>radios,</b> or loud signals, such as a fire siren. Average response times are longer than with full-time services because the members must come from different distances to the station or to the incident. Such departments often have a fixed number of firefighters on staff at any given point in time, which sometimes equals the minimal numbers recommended. Some states allow the use of Length of Service Award Programs (LOSAPS) to provide these volunteer departments with a tool to assist in recruiting and retaining members. LOSAPS are simple programs that can be implemented with minimal taxpayer expense.|$|R
25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most common system is by pager, issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a digital system. Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that pager is detected, the pager will sound an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information is being given via <b>radio.</b> The digital <b>pagers</b> will listen on a different channel and once its individual address is transmitted, will prepare to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a short message, providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|R
50|$|Volunteer firefighters carry <b>radios</b> or fire <b>pagers,</b> {{primarily}} the Motorola Minitor, to receive dispatch information where ever {{they are at}} the time a call is dispatched. Some combination departments use Nextel cell phones as well as alpha pagers with priority service contracts to dispatch information to volunteer firefighters. Depending on the response structure of the combination department, the volunteer may respond to the station to pick up an apparatus, or go directly to the scene of an incident in their personal vehicle with a full-time firefighter bringing the needed apparatus and equipment to the incident. Some combination departments also use volunteer firefighters to cover unfilled shifts of the full-time firefighters. Most volunteer firefighters live or work in the community they respond to fire dispatches in, and most combination departments have a requirement for residency within the community or within a certain distance of the community, in which they serve. Depending on the department, volunteer firefighters may respond 24/7 to any dispatched incidents or be split into response shifts. Response to incidents may be required during shifts, or a periodic run percentage may be required to maintain active status on a combination or volunteer department.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} reports {{survey data}} collected from the U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL), Project Hanford Management Contract (PHMC) companies, and the PHMC enterprise companies for purposes of characterizing the Hanford Local Area Network (HLAN) user profile. Telephone, <b>radio,</b> and <b>pager</b> data are also provided. The data reveal that job tasks of the 8, 500 Hanford Site workers who use the HLAN are highly, if not completely, computer dependent. Employees use their computers as their pens and paper, calculators, drafting tables and communication devices. Fifty eight percent of the survey respondents predict 90 to 100 % loss in productivity if they had no access to a computer. Additionally, 30 % of the users felt {{they would have a}} 50 to 80 % loss in productivity without computers; and more than 68 % use their computers between 4 and 8 hours per day. The profile also shows th at the software packages used most heavily are cc:Mail` the Windows version, Hanford Information, WordPerfece, Site Forms and Look-up. Use of Windows-based products is very high. Regarding the productivity tools that are seldom used, 49 % of the respondents say they ``never use`` the Hanford Help and Hints (HUH). The use of the external intemet by Hanford has shown a large increase. The survey indicates that users rate the intranet and the ability to access other sources of information as the fourth most important computer application. The Microsoft System Management Server (SMS 4) data show that more than 60 % of the computers on the HLAN need replacement or upgrades to run the Windows 95 Operating System, which has been selected as the PHMC standard. Although data also show that 77 % of the PHMC machines are running the current standard Windows for Workgroup version 3. 1 1, {{they do not have the}} memory and/or the hard disk space to upgrade to Windows 95. The survey results indicate that telephone system use is also high and regarded as a useful tool. Pager use is very high and has continued to rise even as the numbers of employees dropped. The number of radios is decreasing as the employee numbers drop...|$|R
