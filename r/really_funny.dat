5|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling {{it one of}} the most densely packed pilots on television. He {{mentioned}} that it was entertaining but said that there were many jokes that followed the quality does not win out over quantity saying. He compared Peter to Homer Simpson and he compared the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny jokes while he praised the surreal moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family Guy was a different kind of animated comedy which set out to do jokes that other cartoons couldn’t do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become <b>really</b> <b>funny.</b>|$|E
25|$|I {{think we}} have a way in, making it visual and making it funny. I want it to be <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> and entertaining, and I want you to not realize how much {{information}} is being thrown at you because you're having fun. We've found a couple of ideas on how to bust the form a bit, in order for all that information to reach you in a way that's a little oblique.|$|E

500|$|Marge's raspy {{voice is}} only {{slightly}} different from Kavner's, who has a [...] "honeyed gravel voice" [...] which she says is due to [...] "a bump on [...] vocal cords." [...] While Marge is her most famous character, Kavner's favorite characters to voice are Patty and Selma because [...] "they're <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> and sad at the same time." [...] In The Simpsons Movie, some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving Kavner exhausted.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{complained about}} the episode's length. A Buzzsugar.com review stated that [...] "there was {{something}} off about this week's episode. It's never really a good thing when I'm checking the clock and feeling antsy at the 20-minute mark of an hour-long episode." [...] An IGN review said [...] "while there's some <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> moments in this episode, overall I really started to feel that hour running time. Of course, as always, that doesn't make this a bad episode, just not one of their best." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You May Now Kiss the... Uh... Guy Who Receives" [...] had {{an average}} of 7.8 million viewers and was the eighty-first most watched show of the week. Bob Sassone from TV Squad wrote that he could not stop {{laughing}} throughout the episode, feeling that there is [...] "just something <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> about gay dogs getting married and a giant gold statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks mascot". While reviewing the Family Guy: Volume 4 [...] DVD, Nancy Basile of About.com called the episode [...] "sharp".|$|E

500|$|Although Marge is {{her most}} famous character, Kavner's {{favorite}} characters to voice are her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier because [...] "they're <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> and sad {{at the same}} time". Series creator Matt Groening instructed Kavner to voice the duo as characters who [...] "suck {{the life out of}} everything". Both have similar raspy voices, but Patty's voice is more masculine and has a lower register, while Selma's voice is a little sweeter. Kavner also provides the voices of every other female member of the Bouvier family, including Marge's mother Jacqueline, Great-Aunt Gladys (a dead relative who was introduced on season four's [...] "Selma's Choice"), and an unnamed grandmother seen on the season six episode [...] "Fear of Flying".|$|E

Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg is [...] "very shy". She went on to say, [...] "He doesn't {{want people to know}} about his life or family. He's just a <b>really</b> <b>funny,</b> down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, but I like having my privacy." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning his review, Buddy TV's Oscar Dahl {{declared}} Andy was [...] "one of {{the most}} devastatingly annoying characters on television". Dahl liked Dwight's scenes at Staples, and wrote that series was becoming [...] "more {{and more difficult to}} write about. It's <b>really</b> <b>funny.</b> Consistently funny. Great episodes, week after week, breed {{little in the way of}} discussion [...] We have to appreciate greatness while it's here. The Office is in the midst of a historic run of consistently great episodes. Bask in it." [...] AOL TV writer Michael Sciannamea agreed with Dahl's initial assessment of Andy, and called him the [...] "most obnoxious sitcom character in the last few years". Sciannamea enjoyed seeing more of Angela's and Michael's personalities, and believed Andy was a [...] "short-timer" [...] to the series.|$|E
5000|$|Frances said of Arthur that {{he played}} by ear and [...] "his rhythm wasn't that great." [...] She used to tease him.

5000|$|AllMusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars with its review by Stewart Mason stating, [...] "Some will {{undoubtedly}} find the whole enterprise juvenile and distasteful, and frankly, {{a couple of}} the parodies are a little too obvious to be clever..., but most of the album is <b>really</b> very <b>funny,</b> for those who like this sort of thing".|$|R

500|$|In August 2009, country {{pop singer}} Taylor Swift used Bieber's [...] "One Time" [...] as {{background}} music and music {{that she and}} her friends were dancing to in a tour video diary that she posted on her official YouTube account. In response to Swift using his song, Bieber posted an acoustic rendition of the then never-before heard [...] "Favorite Girl" [...] on his YouTube. When asked about his learning of Swift using his song, Bieber stated, [...] "It was <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> because I heard about it from a fan. I watched it and it was hilarious!" [...] Bieber and Swift then met in person at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and she later invited him to be a special guest on her Fearless Tour when she returned to the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Donnie Fatso {{was written}} by Chris Cluess and {{directed}} by Ralph Sosa. In July 2010, {{it was announced that}} Jon Hamm would make a guest appearance in the episode as an agent for the FBI. In his interview with Entertainment Weekly, showrunner Al Jean was pleased with Hamm's performance, opining: [...] "You gave him one note and he immediately did twelve great things with it. He was <b>really</b> <b>funny.</b> And handsome. He had it all. Hamm stated that appearing on the show was [...] "an incredible experience". In his interview with Access Hollywood, he continued, [...] "I got to work on The Simpsons, which I watched for 20 years and the show is still fresh and still funny and the characters still resonate. It’s one of the best shows on television. It was an honor to be asked {{to be a part of}} it." [...] Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony, and voiced Fat Tony's cousin Fit Tony.|$|E
500|$|The final {{segment is}} based on the Halloween cartoon It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It could not be titled [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] to exactly match its namesake because of a [...] "big legal issue", {{according}} to Al Jean. However, the characters were redesigned to resemble the style of Peanuts, and they also obtained rights to use Vince Guaraldi's music. Jean said in 2011 that [...] "For years we {{had never been able to}} parody Charlie Brown's Halloween special, which is one of the all-time top three animated shows ever. The Vince Guaraldi music is such a huge part of it, so we got to clear it. It was just a dream come true to satirize it. I thought it was a <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> idea that instead of not ever seeing the Grand Pumpkin, it comes to life, and he's really horrified at the way humans cook pumpkins into pies, and eat pumpkin seeds, which are basically pumpkin fetuses...." ...|$|E

500|$|The two directors, Buck and Lee, {{were also}} {{impressed}} by how Kristen and Idina related. [...] "During {{one of our}} early read-throughs, Kristen and Idina sang a ballad to each other which had so much emotion {{that everyone in the}} room was in tears," [...] Buck said. [...] "It not only showed how great their voices were together, but showed the power the music would have in the story." [...] However, Bell wasn't all confidence when recording with Menzel, described the experiences working with her co-star as [...] "nerve-racking". The duo had rehearsed at Idina's house a song called [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings", in which Bell greatly commended Idina's powerful voice. Regarding the songs that she performed in the film, Kristen said, [...] "We're singing the lovely songs of Kristen and Bobby Lopez, who wrote 'Book of Mormon.' So it's really, <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> music. It's really good music. They're amazing to work for." ...|$|E
500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2It {{said that}} even though the episode [...] "was long on uncomfortable and even {{disturbing}} behavior" [...] and [...] "only out-and-out funny in a few spots" [...] he found himself [...] "respecting it a fair amount at the end". BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl said that [...] "the insubordination of Stanley was a necessary plot point to cover" [...] because [...] "without it, too much Stanley being Stanley becomes unbelievable". Furthermore, he wrote that there [...] "was a lot of <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> stuff tonight" [...] and highlighted [...] "the scene between Darryl and Michael" [...] due to Robinson's acting. Aubry D'Arminio from Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "Mike's embarrassment, and his unwillingness at first to admit he is disliked, was very very well played on Carell's part." [...] Furthermore, D'Arminio praised several of the episode's lines of dialogue and wrote [...] "I cannot even come near to picking a favorite quote [...] for this episode" ...|$|E
500|$|Series co-creator Larry David {{wrote the}} episode, which was {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. Since {{the start of the}} show, NBC executives, especially Warren Littlefield, had been pressuring the writing staff to get Jerry and Elaine back together. Larry David had been against this idea from the start. However, brainstorming for an episode idea, he remembered he had once made a deal with a woman to have a purely physical relationship, which he thought [...] "would make a <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> show, even if they had never [...] ". Though Jerry and Elaine are still in a relationship {{at the end of the}} episode, they are no longer together by the end of the season. Seinfeld and David decided that they had satisfied the NBC executives and went back to the original format. Seinfeld and David have also noted that [...] "The Deal" [...] is the only Seinfeld episode ever to contain sincere emotions, during the scene in which Jerry and Elaine discuss the ending of their physical relationship.|$|E
60|$|She was {{interrupted}} by a great rattling on the old stump. Everybody turned to look. There was Prickly Porky backing down as fast as he could, which wasn't fast at all, and rattling his thousand little spears as he did so.

5000|$|Sky Hirschkron, {{writing for}} Stylus Magazine, stated, [...] "Collins is {{perceptive}} to Gretchen’s {{status as a}} loser; {{the problem is that}} he offers nothing to counterbalance it, resulting in a perspective inadvertently as cruel as her tormentors". Film Threats Don Lewis commented, [...] "Gretchen is a <b>really</b> dry, <b>funny</b> and sad film ... The bond between Gretchen and her mother is a sweet touch and without it, one might think Collins was cinematically abusing Gretchen just as everyone else does throughout the film." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Seamus" [...] is {{the fifth}} song on Pink Floyd's 1971 album Meddle. The group {{performs}} it {{in the style of}} a country blues, with vocals, an acoustic slide guitar in an open D tuning, and piano. The song is named after the collie dog (belonging to Humble Pie leader Steve Marriott) who howls throughout the 2:15 piece. [...] Group biographer Nicholas Schaffner calls the tune [...] "dispensable"; David Gilmour added [...] "I guess it wasn't <b>really</b> as <b>funny</b> to everyone else as it was to us".|$|R
500|$|A {{clip from}} [...] "A Clockwork Yellow" [...] was first {{shown at the}} San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014. Executive {{producer}} Al Jean spoke to Entertainment Weekly in September 2014 about the third segment of the episode, and the difference in voices between the older and newer versions of the characters. He said that although Dan Castellaneta’s portrayal of Homer is better remembered for its evolution over time, Nancy Cartwright’s voicing of Bart changed as well, because [...] "it was lower-register, {{and you can see}} in the difference in this segment. It was <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> to get the interplay [...] and for the actors to see the voice evolution. The great thing is we didn’t have to ask—we already had the cast hired for the Tracey Ullman Simpsons." [...] He also revealed that the segment expanded on an earlier episode which implied that the Ullman Simpsons were murdered and buried under the family home, stating [...] "if people want a real Halloween bloodbath, they get it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{introduced}} the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which {{continued to be}} a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season. It also marked a major development in the romantic subplot between Ann and Chris. Rashida Jones said of her character: [...] "I think women over-correct from their last boyfriends, and Chris is very much the opposite from Mark," [...] a reference to Mark Brendanawicz, a character eliminated the previous season. During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler said she and Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, [...] "I think it's <b>really</b> <b>funny</b> how little game (Leslie) has with guys. She's not a fool, it's just not her expertise, so when she talks about how to be sexy or hot to get someone's attention, it's always really crazy." ...|$|E

She closed her review by stating [...] "Overall, this is a <b>really</b> enjoyable, <b>funny</b> installment. It tries to do a LOT, but that's part of what makes Modern Family, well...
