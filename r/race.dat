5|$|About a {{month before}} the <b>race</b> took place, in February 2015, the <b>race</b> organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the <b>race.</b> This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the <b>race</b> logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?").

5|$|After Trump {{withdrew from}} {{sponsoring}} the event, DuPont became the primary sponsor. Between 1991 and 1995, national amateur teams took part alongside professional teams.

In 1996, the Union Cycliste Internationale upgraded it to a 2.1 ranked <b>race,</b> meaning that amateurs could no longer compete. This made the <b>race</b> the highest ranked outside of Europe and the first North American stage <b>race</b> to be ranked 2.1. The 1996 <b>race</b> {{was the subject of}} a number of legal issues, including a dispute over rights to its profits between the <b>race</b> owners, Billy Packer and president of the United States Cycling Federation Mike Plant, which resulted in them suing each other. DuPont itself was involved in a dispute about the anti-homosexual employment policies of the local government in Greenville, South Carolina, with the company insisting that the <b>race</b> organizers exclude the city from the route. After 1996, DuPont dropped its sponsorship and the <b>race</b> has not been run since.|$|E
