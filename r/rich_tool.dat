The frequency with which certain patterns occur is a useful statistic for such series; however, the behavior of the frequency of pattern occurrence is unstudied for most models. We look at the frequency of pattern occurrence in random walks in discrete time and, applying combinatorial methods, we characterize those patterns that have equal frequency, regardless of probability distribution...|$|E

Blogs can facilitate two-way communication and true interaction between citizens and politicians. The article analyses in depth the content, uses, {{and characteristics of}} five weblogs written by Aragonese politicians. Although the study detects some weaknesses in the current political use of blogs, it encourages political parties to use blogs and other online resources, not only during electoral campaigns to improve the reputation of political leaders but also continuously and particularly in situations of special interest for the citizenship. The study shows {{that the use of}} blogs by Aragonese politicians is no longer just a transitory phenomenon and has become a reality. The article also demonstrates that politicians use blogs mostly as a pre-electoral tooland to a much lesser extent as an element of communication to promote democracy.

The originality of this work is to synthesize the two approaches in order to take advantage of the knowledge concerning the adaptability and reactivity performances of humans and of the <b>rich</b> <b>tools</b> and formal concepts available in biped robotics. Indeed, we claim that the theoretical framework of robotics can enhance our understanding of human postural control by formally expressing the experimental concepts used in neuroscience. Conversely, biological knowledge of human posture and gait can inspire biped robot design and control. Therefore, both neuroscientists and roboticists should find useful information in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Sign {{language}} typology is {{the systematic}} {{comparative study of}} linguistic structures across sign languages, and {{has emerged as a}} separate linguistic sub-discipline over the past 15 years. It is situated at the crossroads between linguistic typology and sign language linguistics, the latter itself a relatively young discipline with its roots in the 1960 s and 70 s (McBurney 2001). The cross-fertilisation initiated by the advent of sign language typology is obvious: Typologists gain an entirely new dimension in their study of linguistic diversity, and sign language linguists gain a <b>rich</b> <b>tool</b> box of concepts and methods for discovering typological patterns across sign languages. Beyond theory and methodology, the impact that sign language typology research has on the deaf communities who are the primary users of these languages is discussed in Section 2.

40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{success in}} developing more efficient automated planning algorithms {{there is a}} need to widen the scope of the technology to bring it to a wider user community. In this paper we bring together two strands of research both attempting to address the problem of widening the take up of planning technologies. The first strand of research tries to widen the scope by increasing the expressiveness of the representation languages. The second tries to address the problem by enriching and structuring domain modelling languages to support knowledge engineering and to provide <b>rich</b> <b>tool</b> sets to support the creation of domain models. This paper describes ongoing work in developing PDDL+ to more adequately model planning domains where the duration of actions plays a significant role in the planning problem. We have constructed a prototype plan authoring tool to allow the exploration of domains captured in the underlying PDDL+ model of durative actions. The plan authoring tools has been integrated into our GIPO environment [5] and forms both a plan visualisation tool and a plan construction tool...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of a) our changing understanding of genotypic and phenotypic {{classification of diseases}} and b) the rapid growth and expansion {{of the number of}} entries in two databases targeted toward clinicians resulted in the need to develop a flexible dynamic hierarchical classification system for genetic disorders. The two databases making use of this classification schemas are the GeneClinics (GC) database - www. geneclinics. org and the GeneTests (GT) database - www. genetests. org The GC and GT databases serve respsectively as the users manual and yellow pages of genetic testing. The GeneTests/GeneClinics (GT/GC) classification hierarchy is maintained as a simple set of parent/child relationships in a relational database. The hierarchy is generated in real time in response to a user request. It is not maintained as a set of members with relationships defined by characters that are parsed to determine the structure of the tree.

40|$|Introduction Heart {{failure is}} the second most common cause of ascites after cirrhosis. There are cardiac and noncardiac etiologies of ascites, and the {{multimodality}} imaging approach is a <b>rich</b> <b>tool</b> to redefine the final diagnosis. Case Presentation We present a case-series where 3 patients were referred to our hospital for further hepatology assessment due to severe abdominal ascites and liver failure. Constrictive pericarditis was diagnosed in all of them. Nowadays, constrictive pericarditis is a well-known disease, but sometimes its clinical presentation may delay the treatment and worsen the prognosis. Our 3 cases had similar clinical scenarios and hemodynamic patterns when undergoing right-heart catheterization, but they had different anatomical pericardium-compromise, requiring different surgical strategies. Conclusions Nowadays, multimodality imaging, especially cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and cardiac computed tomography, allows us to study a wide spectrum of the same disease in terms of anatomical compromise and cardiac physiology in order to stratify different prognosis and treatment options. We describe 3 unusual clinical cases where the initial differential diagnosis denoted noncardiac etiologies. The level of serum NT-proBNP proved pivotal to the redefinition of the clinical scenario and differentiation between the cardiac and noncardiac etiologies of new-onset ascites. A multidisciplinary approach in this setting between internists, hepatologists, and cardiologists was helpful to establish the final diagnosis in all the patients...|$|E

First, one can extend the idea of applying SDN-like architectures to different types of networks, e.g., WiFi, LTE, ISP, storage, etc., and solve challenges that are unique to those domains. Second, one can address the paucity of today’s network troubleshooting tools through the design of novel techniques and <b>rich</b> <b>tools</b> that help reason about networking state (analogous to tools that exist in the programming languages area). For example, can a tool automatically ensure that the invariant “no network access to a set of servers hosting sensitive data from a guest network” is never violated through a combination of appropriately setting routing tables and firewall filters? Third, in what may be considered the holy grail in networking, can we synthesize networks and networking-state automatically from a high-level set of policies as specified by the administrator? If we can address this question effectively, then network administrators of the future will perhaps need degrees in law or management rather than computer science! [...]...|$|R
