50|$|One of the {{concerns}} with all powerline systems, when compared to dedicated data wiring, is that {{the route of the}} wiring is not known in advance, and is generally already optimized for power transmission. This means that there will be situations where the system will radiate a significant fraction of the energy, in the form of radio frequency interference, or be vulnerable to the ingress of external signals. Given that the shortwave band is used both by low-power long-range telemetry and high-power broadcast signals, this is a potentially serious drawback. To attempt to minimize the effects of incoming interference and frequency-dependent path losses, the HomePlug standard requires each node to maintain 'tone maps' updates during operation, so the equipment 'learns' to avoid certain troublesome frequencies and to put more data onto those frequencies that exhibit a low loss. However, while this mitigates against ingress, if there is sensitive receiving equipment nearby then there is no easy way to tell the HomePlug apparatus to 'turn down' the <b>radiated</b> <b>interference.</b> In comparison to the received signals in a radio communication equipment, the signal levels in a powerline system are quite high. Typically the power density is −50dBm per Hz, as each carrier occupies a channel of 24 kHz, each carrier is injected at a level of −6.6dBm (220 microwatts), making the total full channel power 24dBm, (250 milliwatts).Typical short wave radio receiver sensitivities are at −100dBm (tenths of a nanowatt) level.|$|E

Firstly, according to the working principle of detection system, effective amplitude is defined, and the computation method of effective amplitude is given by amplitude-frequency response of matching circuit and bandpass filter circuit. Then, the three dimensional surface of effective amplitude is incised by the plane {{at the height of}} sensitivity, and the EMC boundary is obtained.

The tests included {{the measurement of}} noise pick-up by Orbiter S-band, L-band, C-band, and Ku-band antennas located beneath the tiles in a manner simulating their installation on Orbiter. In addition, the radiated field characteristics resulting from the static discharge was determined. The results are analyzed as to their effect on data bus equipment and on Orbiter Communications and Tracking (C&T) receivers. It was concluded that the <b>radiated</b> <b>interference</b> should {{have no effect on}} MDM's. However the CPU, IOP and PMU enclosures require some minor modification to assure immunity from P-static interference. Orbiter antenna tests indicate that the S-band receiver should not be affected by P-static noise. The TACAN and Radar Altimeter performance appears to be adequate but with a small margin.

5000|$|During the 1920s, an {{advantage}} of the TRF receiver over the regenerative receiver was that, when properly adjusted, it did not <b>radiate</b> <b>interference.</b> [...] The popular regenerative receiver, in particular, used a tube with positive feedback operated very close to its oscillation point, so it often acted as a transmitter, emitting a signal at a frequency near {{the frequency of the}} station it was tuned to. [...] This produced audible heterodynes, shrieks and howls, in other nearby receivers tuned to the same frequency, bringing criticism from neighbors. [...] In an urban setting, when several regenerative sets in the same block or apartment house were tuned to a popular station, it could be virtually impossible to hear. [...] Britain, and eventually the US, passed regulations that prohibited receivers from radiating spurious signals, which favored the TRF.|$|R
40|$|The {{increment}} {{of the use}} {{of electric}} vehicles leads to a worry about measuring its principal source of environmental pollution: electromagnetic emissions. Given the complexity of directly measuring vehicular radiated emissions in real traffic, the main contribution of this PhD thesis is to propose an indirect solution to estimate such type of vehicular emissions. Relating the on-road vehicular radiated emissions with the driving profile is a complicated task. This is because {{it is not possible to}} directly measure the vehicular <b>radiated</b> <b>interferences</b> in real traffic due to potential interferences from another electromagnetic wave sources. This thesis presents a microscopic artificial intelligence model based on neural networks to estimate real traffic radiated emissions of electric vehicles in terms of the driving dynamics. Instantaneous values of measured speed and calculated acceleration have been used to characterize the driving profile. Experimental electromagnetic interference tests have been carried out with a Vectrix electric motorcycle as well as Twizy electric cars in semi-anechoic chambers. Both the motorcycle and the car have been subjected to different urban and interurban driving profiles. Time Domain measurement methodology of electromagnetic radiated emissions has been adopted in this work to save the overall measurement time. The relationship between the magnetic radiated emissions of the Twizy and the corresponding speed has been very noticeable. Maximum magnetic field levels have been observed during high speed cruising in extra-urban driving and acceleration in urban environments. A comparative study of the prediction performance between various static and dynamic neural models has been introduced. The Multilayer Perceptron feedforward neural network trained with Extreme Learning Machines has achieved the best estimation results of magnetic radiated disturbances as function of instantaneous speed and acceleration. In this way, on-road magnetic <b>radiated</b> <b>interferences</b> from an electric vehicle equipped with a Global Positioning System can be estimated.
