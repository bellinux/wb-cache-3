40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the interrelati 6 nships among recordings <b>in</b> nine different <b>running</b> performances varying <b>in</b> <b>distance</b> from 50 m to 10 km, and the contribution of physique and physical fitness elements to each running performance. A total of 43 test items representing running ability (9 items), physique (7 items), and physical fitness (20 items) was examined on 167 healthy young boys aged 15 to 18 years. The major findings are summarized as follows: 1) The average running speed declined remarkably from 7. 0 m/s in l 00 m running to 3. 7 m/s <b>in</b> 12 min <b>running</b> (x= 2639 m) as the running distance increased, whereas the mean speed <b>in</b> <b>distance</b> <b>running</b> longer than 12 min running was almost constant. The mean speed in 12 min, 5 km, and l 0 km running was approximately 50 % of the mean speed of 50 m running. 2) The correlation coefficients of 50 m running performance decreased remarkably from r= 0. 84 with l 00 m running performance to r= 0. 37 with 12 min running performance as the <b>running</b> <b>distance</b> increased. <b>In</b> contrast, the correlation coefficients of 10 km running performance ranged from r= 0. 40 with l 00 m to r= 0. 90 with 12 min. 3) The contribution of physique to running performances seemed to be somewhat greater <b>in</b> <b>distances</b> shorter than 400 m than <b>in</b> <b>distances</b> longer than 600 yards. Particularly, the contribution of body bulk to running performances was relatively large [...] 4) The overall contribution of physical fitness elements to <b>running</b> performances <b>in</b> shorter <b>distances</b> (≦ 600 yeards) was relatively greater as compared with those <b>in</b> longer <b>distances</b> (≧ 800 m). 5) The contribution of power to running performances decreased progressively up to 600 yards, while that of muscular endurance was almost constant throughout the range of distance. However, the relative contribution of muscular endurance among physical fitness elements seemed to increase progressively as the distance became longer. 6) Static strength and flexibility showed rather low relationships with <b>running</b> performance <b>in</b> <b>distances</b> shorter than 600 yards. Cardiorespiratory element related significantly with running performances longer than 400 m, and the contribution of this element was relatively greater to <b>running</b> performances <b>in</b> longer <b>distances</b> (≧ 1500 m) than to those <b>in</b> shorter <b>distances</b> (≦ 800 m). 7) Agility, balance, and coordination were also found to contribute significantly to each running performance.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if exercise reduces body weight {{and to examine}} the dose-response relationships between changes in exercise and changes in total and regional adiposity. Methods and Results: Questionnaires on weekly running distance and adiposity from a large prospective study of 3, 973 men and 1, 444 women who quit running (detraining), 270 men and 146 women who started running (training) and 420 men and 153 women who remained sedentary during 7. 4 years of follow-up.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the effect {{graduated}} compression socks had on lower leg muscle swelling and soreness after a 2 hour (hr) run at a speed eliciting a heart rate (HR) 10 - 15 % lower than their HR at lactate threshold established during a baseline assessment. Compression socks were worn during the run and for 8 hrs after the completion of the run. Baseline lower extremity (LE) volumes were measured using water displacement prior, immediately post and 24 hrs after the 2 hr run. Muscle discomfort was measured using an algometry prior to the 2 hr run and approximately 24 hrs after. Compression socks decreased LE volume measurements during and after long <b>distance</b> <b>running</b> <b>in</b> moderately trained <b>distance</b> runners but insignificantly. They also limited muscle soreness, but insignificantly. The results of this study support that compression stockings fail to enhance performance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Public health {{policies}} for preventing obesity need guidelines for active {{individuals who are}} at risk due to exercise recidivism. Methods: Changes in adiposity were compared to the running distances at baseline and follow-up in men and women whose reported exercise increased (N= 4, 632 and 1, 953, respectively) or decreased (17, 280 and 5, 970, respectively) during 7. 7 years of follow-up. Results: Per Delta km/wk, decreases <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>distance</b> caused over four-fold greater weight gain between 0 - 8 km/wk (slope+-SE, males: - 0. 068 + - 0. 005 kg/m 2, females: - 0. 080 +- 0. 01 kg/m 2) than between 32 - 48 km/wk (- 0. 017 +- 0. 002 and - 0. 010 +- 0. 005 kg/m 2, respectively). In contrast, increases <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>distance</b> produced the smallest weight losses between 0 - 8 km/wk and statistically significant weight loss only above 16 km/wk in males and 32 km/wk in females. Above 32 km/wk (30 kcal/kg) in men and 16 km/wk (15 kcal/kg) in women, weight loss from increasing exercise was equal to or greater than weight gained with decreasing exercise, otherwise weight gain exceeded weight loss. Substantial weight gain occurred in runners who quit running, which would be mostly retained with resumed activity. Conclusion: Public health recommendations should warn against the risks of irreversible weight gain with exercise cessation. Weight gained due to reductions in exercise below 30 kcal/kg in men and 15 kcal/kg in women may not be reversed by resuming prior activity. Current IOM guidelines (i. e., maintain total energy expenditure at 160 percent of basal) agree with the men s exercise threshold for symmetric weight change with changing exercise levels...|$|R
