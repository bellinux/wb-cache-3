25|$|A {{military}} tunic {{is a type}} {{of medium}} length coat or jacket, the lower hem of which <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to the thighs all the way round. It is named after the tunic, a garment of similar length worn in Ancient Rome.|$|E
25|$|The {{second level}} of the pyramid is {{relaxation}} (looseness). Signs of looseness in the horse may be seen by an even stride that is swinging through the back and causing the tail to swing like a pendulum, looseness at the poll, a soft chewing of the bit, and a relaxed blowing through the nose. The horse makes smooth transitions, is easy to position from side to side, and willingly <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> into the contact as the reins are lengthened.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{dress of}} the Monpa {{is based on}} the Tibetan Chuba. Both men and women wear headwear made of yak hair, with long tassels. The women tend to wear a warm jacket and a sleeveless chemise that <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to the calves, tying the chemise round the waist with a long and narrow piece of cloth. Ornaments include those made of silver, corals and turquoise. One can see a person wearing a cap with a single peacock feather round their felt hats.|$|E

25|$|The Tripuris live on {{the slopes}} of hills in a group of five to fifty families. Their houses in these areas are built of bamboo or ua as it is called in Kokborok and raised five to six feet height to save {{themselves}} from the dangers of the wild animals. Nowadays a considerable section of this community are living in the plains and erecting houses like the plains people, adopting their methods of cultivation, and following them in other aspects of life, such as dress, manners, and cosmetics. Tripuri women wear a scarp, called rignai, which <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> just below the knee. They weave in their loin-loom a small piece of cloth, which they call risa, and they use this small piece of cloth as their breast garment.|$|E
25|$|N-alkanes {{are also}} known to {{preserve}} detailed information of source material. Li et al. studied oils from the marine-derived Upper Cretaceous Second White Speckled Shale and found strong depleted signal around -180‰ in C12-C18. The low δD of this marine samples was {{explained by the}} discharge of a large high latitude river. Schimmelmann et al. found that the δD of the oil sampled from coaly facies of the Crayfish group <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to -230‰ where as those sampled from algal facies of the same group are around -100‰. Such huge variation is hard to be explained by any other causes than Australia splitting from the Antarctic continent during late Cretaceous. Another special case reported by xiong et al. studied Ordovician carbonates from Bohai Bay Basin. They found big differences between δD of n-alkanes exists, reflecting that the original signal is preserved rather than being homogenized. The result is not obvious as the sample is very mature(inferred vitrinite reflectance R0 up to 2.3). Thus this is a strong evidence that carbonate systems have much lower catalytic efficiency of hydrogen exchange on hydrocarbons. Strong enrichment(~40‰) in odd carbon numbered alkanes to even carbon numbered alkanes {{is also found in}} some subset of samples and the reason is unclear at this point. This odd-even effect is also observed in immature clastic sediments.|$|E
25|$|The {{adductor}} {{muscles of}} the thigh are innervated by the obturator nerve, {{with the exception of}} pectineus which receives fibers from the femoral nerve, and the adductor magnus which receives fibers from the tibial nerve. The gracilis arises from near the pubic symphysis and is unique among the adductors in that it reaches past the knee to attach on the medial side of the shaft of the tibia, thus acting on two joints. It share its distal insertion with the sartorius and semitendinosus, all three muscles forming the pes anserinus. It is the most medial muscle of the adductors, and with the thigh abducted its origin can be clearly seen arching under the skin. With the knee extended, it adducts the thigh and flexes the hip. The pectineus has its origin on the iliopubic eminence laterally to the gracilis and, rectangular in shape, extends obliquely to attach immediately behind the lesser trochanter and down the pectineal line and the proximal part of the linea aspera on the femur. It is a flexor of the hip joint, and an adductor and a weak medial rotator of the thigh. The adductor brevis originates on the inferior ramus of the pubis below the gracilis and stretches obliquely below the pectineus down to the upper third of the linea aspera. Except for being an adductor, it is a lateral rotator and weak flexor of the hip joint. The adductor longus has its origin at superior ramus of the pubis and inserts medially on the middle third of the linea aspera. Primarily an adductor, it is also responsible for some flexion. The adductor magnus has its origin just behind the longus and lies deep to it. Its wide belly divides into two parts: One is inserted into the linea aspera and the tendon of the other <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to adductor tubercle on the medial side of the femur's distal end where it forms an intermuscular septum that separates the flexors from the extensors. Magnus is a powerful adductor, especially active when crossing legs. Its superior part is a lateral rotator but the inferior part acts as a medial rotator on the flexed leg when rotated outward and also extends the hip joint. The adductor minimus is an incompletely separated subdivision of the adductor magnus. Its origin forms an anterior part of the magnus and distally it is inserted on the linea aspera above the magnus. It acts to adduct and lateral rotate the femur.|$|E

500|$|Kīlauea has two rift zones {{radiating}} from its summit, one leading [...] {{out to the}} east, the other [...] long and trending towards the southwest. A series of fault scarpes connecting the two rift zones form the Koa'e Fault Zone. Tectonic extension along both rift zones is causing Kīlauea's bulk to slowly slide seaward off its southern flank {{at a rate of}} about [...] per year, centered on a basal décollement fault [...] beneath the volcano's surface. [...] The eastern rift zone in particular is a dominant feature on the volcano; it is almost entirely covered in lava erupted in the last 400 years, and at its crest near the summit is [...] wide. Non-localized eruptions, typical of rift zone activity, have produced a series of low-lying ridges down the majority of the east rift zone's length. Its upper segment is the most presently active section of the volcano, and is additionally the site of a number of large pit craters; its lower extremity <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> Kīlauea's submerged flank to a depth of more than [...] By contrast, the much smaller southwestern rift has been quiet since a rifting episode in 1974, and to date has not been involved in the current eruptive cycle at all. The southwestern rift zone's extremity is also underwater, although its submarine length is more limited. The southwestern rift zone also lacks a well-defined ridge line or a large number of pit craters, evidence that it is also geologically less active than the eastern rift zone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first player}} tosses the marker also called a [...] "lucky" [...] unto the court. This object should {{land in the}} square without bouncing, sliding, or rolling out. It is {{typically}} a small flat stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm. The marker must land completely within the square without touching the line. The player then hops through the course, skipping the square with the marker in it. Single squares must be hopped on one foot. For the first single square, either foot may be used. Side-by-side squares are straddled, with the left foot landing in the left square, and the right foot landing in the right square. Optional squares marked [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest" [...] are neutral squares, and may be hopped through in any manner without penalty. After hopping into [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest", the player must {{then turn around and}} return through the course (square 9, then squares 8 and 7, next square 6, and so forth) on one or two legs depending on the square until reaching the square with the marker. The player stops in the square before the marker and <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to retrieve the marker and continue the course as stated, without touching a line or stepping into a square with another player's marker.|$|E
2500|$|At first glance, the Pharaoh Hound appears both {{graceful and}} elegant {{as well as}} {{powerful}} and athletic. Its build is one of strength without bulkiness or excessive musculature. [...] Its head is elegant without being fine or extreme. [...] The skull resembles a blunt wedge, and is long and chiseled with only a slight stop and a snout of good length. [...] Its eyes are oval with a keen, alert, and intelligent expression. Their eyes are commonly amber-colored. [...] It has a long, lean, and muscular neck that is slightly arched. It has a deep chest that extends down to the elbows and a moderate tuck up. Its shoulders are long and well laid back. Its front legs are long and straight. The back legs are moderately angled, parallel to each other, and must be balanced with the forelegs. It has a long, fine, straight tail that <b>reaches</b> <b>down</b> to a bit below {{the point of the}} hocks, and has a whip-like shape. [...] The tail is carried down when relaxed. [...] When the dog is in motion or is excited, the tail is carried up; either level with, or loosely curled above, the back. Its dewclaws may be removed. The Pharaoh Hound's ears are very large and point upward when alert. They usually come in tan or chestnut colors. A white tail-tip is admired. Most commonly seen is any solid white spot on their neck, back, or shoulders. Mainly seen on the back or sides of the dog.|$|E

[...] It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although {{much has been made of}} the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of [...] "Hound Dog", all of the songs on this show were ballads. [...] "Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows", Greil Marcus says, Elvis [...] "stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out.
