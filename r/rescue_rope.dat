25|$|Firefighters often carry {{personal}} self-rescue ropes. The ropes {{are generally}} 30 {{feet long and}} can provide a firefighter (that has enough time to deploy the rope) a partially controlled exit out of an elevated window. Lack of a personal <b>rescue</b> <b>rope</b> is cited {{in the deaths of}} two New York City Firefighters, Lt. John Bellew and Lt. Curtis Meyran, who died after they jumped from the fourth floor of a burning apartment building in the Bronx. Of the four firefighters who jumped and survived, only one of them had a self-rescue rope. Since the incident, the Fire Department of New York City has issued self-rescue ropes to their firefighters.|$|E

50|$|Cave rescue borrows {{elements}} from firefighting, confined space <b>rescue,</b> <b>rope</b> rescue and mountaineering techniques but has also developed {{its own special}} techniques and skills for performing work in conditions that are almost always difficult and demanding. Since cave accidents, on an absolute scale, are a very limited form of incident, and cave rescue is a very specialized skill, normal emergency staff are rarely employed in the underground elements of the rescue. Instead, this is usually undertaken by other experienced cavers who undergo regular training through their organizations and are called up at need.|$|E

50|$|A Prusik-Minding-Pulley {{is common}} in <b>rope</b> <b>rescue.</b> The <b>rope</b> to be pulled is passed through a pulley, and a Prusik is tied on the loaded side. When the rope is pulled, the Prusik rides against the pulley, and the rope slides through it; but when the rope is relaxed, the Prusik slides away from the pulley and grabs the rope. Thus, the {{combination}} acts as a ratchet.|$|R

After some 24+ hours they {{had been able to}} move him two feet upward, and lower down food and water, when a part of the <b>rescue</b> <b>rope</b> system failed dropping him fully back into the wedge. It was after this that he became much too weak to help the rescuers in their efforts and he died shortly thereafter. Following this, it was decided by the family and landowner to leave his body in place and seal the cave permanently.|$|E

50|$|A heavy {{rescue vehicle}} {{is a type}} of {{specialty}} firefighting or emergency medical services apparatus. They are primarily designed to provide the specialized equipment necessary for technical rescue situations such as traffic collisions requiring vehicle extrication, building collapses, confined space <b>rescue,</b> <b>rope</b> rescues and swiftwater rescues. They carry an array of special equipment such as the Jaws of life, wooden cribbing, generators, winches, hi-lift jacks, cranes, cutting torches, circular saws and other forms of heavy equipment unavailable on standard trucks. This capability differentiates them from traditional pumper trucks or ladder trucks designed primarily to carry firefighters and their entry gear as well as on-board water tanks, hoses and equipment for fire extinguishing and light rescue. Most heavy rescue vehicles lack on-board water tanks and pumping gear, owing to their specialized role, but some do carry on-board pumps in order to broaden their response capability.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rescue</b> Applications <b>Rope</b> <b>rescue</b> teams, {{such as in}} swiftwater rescue or in high-angle {{technical}} rescue, use a Prusik hitch as a 'ratchet' or progress capture device. A prusik with a prusik minding pulley is used to hold a load while tensioning a line. The pulley advances the prusik up {{the line}} and prevents it from going back out. This {{can be used to}} raise a patient or tension a highline for a Tyrolean traverse, or in boat-on-tether and similar rescue operations.|$|R
50|$|Written in the Victorian era, {{the story}} {{is set in the}} fictional village of West Poley where water from a small river is used to run a watermill, but the miller's {{apprentice}} (a child) is badly beaten. The apprentice and two other children enter nearby caves and discover a previously unknown passage leading to a place where the river can easily be diverted into a different channel. After diverting it, they find the river now flows through another village (East Poley) and the West Poley mill can no longer operate. The children then stage a magic trick for the children of East Poley, claiming to be able to redirect the river at will. However, they discover that not all is well in East Poley after the redirection (for example a landowner tries to turn a poorer lady's garden into a mill pond) and so they decide to divert the river down a third channel and permanently seal off the first two channels so that the river will flow through neither village. The third channel however {{turns out to be a}} cul de sac and the cave begins filling with water. The children decide they have been meddling too much and begin removing their stones but are unable to complete this work before the water traps them. The miller arrives (together with the shoemaker) via an alternative entrance that was not previously known to be connected to the same cave; the miller falls into the water and nearly drowns, and his apprentice saves him after making him promise not to beat him again. Next the miller wishes to have priority on the <b>rescue</b> <b>rope,</b> which the child grants in exchange for his complete release. All are saved, and then the pressure of the accumulating water becomes strong enough to forcibly reopen its original channel and everything goes back to normal. However the details of the cave are now public knowledge, and the adults of the two villages proceed to engage in their own squabbles over the river, redirecting it several times. To end this, one of the original children obtains a small amount of gunpowder and, using his intimate knowledge of the cave to position it effectively, seals both access routes beyond all hope of being re-opened. All then settle down to a quiet life.|$|E
40|$|Objective: There {{is a lack}} of data to {{establish}} minimal requirements for technical alpine climbing skills needed by rescue teams involved in alpine helicopter rescue operations to perform such operations safely. Methods: A year of rescue operations (N = 2731) were investigated for the technical difficulties of the terrain. The difficulties were graded according to the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA) scale for rocky terrain and steepness for ice slopes. Results: For 99. 7 % of the operations, the terrain could be accurately evaluated. In at least 30. 7 % of all rescue operations, personal advanced alpine climbing skills were required for the rescue personnel, and in 6. 0 %, the difficulties of the rocky terrain correspond to UIAA scale grade III with another 2. 4 % to UIAA grade IV or above. About 1. 5 % of all operations took place in ice faces steeper than 50 °. Conclusions: To be able to manage 90 % of all operations safely, all crew members, except the pilot, must be competent at climbing rock terrain of UIAA scale grade IV and ice of 50 ° steepness using appropriate <b>rescue,</b> <b>rope,</b> and belaying techniques. These recommendations include a technical safety margin for adverse conditions, such as bad weathe...|$|E

A Rocket Brigade was a shore to ship rescue team who deployed rocket technology to deliver a <b>rescue</b> <b>rope</b> to a ship in distress up to 500 yards offshore. This technology was originally developed in Britain in the mid- 19 th Century and was subsequently deployed in the Colonies. Rocket Brigades were volunteer units which took over from Naval operations – no longer funded for this purpose. Rocket Brigades were often successful in saving the lives of many passengers and crew from stricken vessels who would have otherwise perished. This technology was last used in Australia in 1974.

Most are stamped with a “Not For Climbing” or similar warning due to a common lack of load-testing and safety standards in manufacturing. While from an etymological perspective any metal attaching link with a spring gate is technically a carabiner, the strict usage among the climbing community specifically refers only to those devices manufactured and tested for load-bearing in safety-critical systems like rock and mountain climbing.|$|R
