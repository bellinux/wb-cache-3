Coke, limestone flux, and iron ore (iron oxide) are charged into the top of the furnace in a precise filling order which helps control gas flow and the chemical reactions inside the furnace. Four [...] "uptakes" [...] allow the hot, dirty gas high in carbon monoxide content to exit the furnace throat, while [...] "bleeder valves" [...] protect the top of the furnace from sudden gas pressure surges. The coarse particles in the exhaust gas settle in the [...] "dust catcher" [...] and are dumped into a railroad car or truck for disposal, while the gas itself flows through a venturi scrubber and/or electrostatic precipitators and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the cleaned gas.|$|E

2500|$|Glass {{containers}} are 100% inspected; automatic machines, {{or sometimes}} persons, inspect every container {{for a variety}} of faults. Typical faults include small cracks in the glass called checks and foreign inclusions called stones which are pieces of the <b>refractory</b> <b>brick</b> lining of the melting furnace that break off and fall into the pool of molten glass, or more commonly oversized silica granules (sand) that have failed to melt and which subsequently are included in the final product. [...] These are especially important to select out {{due to the fact that}} they can impart a destructive element to the final glass product. [...] For example, since these materials can withstand large amounts of thermal energy, they can cause the glass product to sustain thermal shock resulting in explosive destruction when heated. Other defects include bubbles in the glass called blisters and excessively thin walls. Another defect common in glass manufacturing is referred to as a tear. [...] In the press and blow forming, if a plunger and mould are out of alignment, or heated to an incorrect temperature, the glass will stick to either item and become torn. [...] In addition to rejecting faulty containers, inspection equipment gathers statistical information and relays it to the forming machine operators in the hot end. Computer systems collect fault information and trace it to the mould that produced the container. This is done by reading the mould number on the container, which is encoded (as a numeral, or a binary code of dots) on the container by the mould that made it. Operators carry out a range of checks manually on samples of containers, usually visual and dimensional checks.|$|E

50|$|RUL is a {{critical}} property for <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks,</b> which basically reflects the service temperature of the bricks, raw materials, etc. (Refractoriness Under Load) RUL values(T0.6 @0.2MPa) for fireclay-based <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> are usually below 1500 °C. for medium duty fireclay bricks only at about 1300 °C, high duty fireclay bricks at 1350 to 1420 °C, superduty fireclay bricks between 1420 and 1500 °C (sometimes even higher than 1500 °C).

40|$|Various organic pore {{agents are}} used for the {{production}} of insulating <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> (IRB). Most times, the deficiencies of the respective pore agents appear to be ignored by the makers of the bricks, and the users. Sawdust, for instance, which is about the most commonly used organic pore agent is known to have high water absorption rates. This is in addition to the inability of the user to have it from one grade of wood-hard wood which is preferred. These factors amount to various drawbacks in the insulating <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> produced with it. In order to curb this problem, this study identified palm kernel shells (PKS) as a potential alternative pore agent in IRB bodies. The focus of the work was on the water absorption rate of PKS. The study employed studio experimentation method. It showed that the water absorption rate of PKS is insignificant and, therefore, is recommended for use as pore agent in insulating <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the high}} {{temperature}} applications, {{mostly in the}} molten metal casting industries, the carbonaceous <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> had been widely used due to its better thermal shock resistance and well appreciated mechanical properties.

The bricks located in zones characterized by higher working temperatures are mainly degraded by Na 2 O and V 2 O 5, while SO 3 represents the most important contaminant at lower working temperatures. Two series of different mixtures were prepared, taking into account the significant increase in the contaminant contents of the <b>refractory</b> <b>bricks</b> exposed to fuel oil products. V 2 O 5, Na 2 O and SO 3 were added to as-received aluminosilicate refractory and to a mullite-cristobalite mixture.

5000|$|A fire brick, firebrick, or <b>{{refractory}}</b> <b>brick</b> is a {{block of}} refractory ceramic material used in lining furnaces, kilns, fireboxes, and fireplaces. A <b>refractory</b> <b>brick</b> is built primarily to withstand high temperature, but will also usually have a low thermal conductivity for greater energy efficiency. Usually dense firebricks are used in applications with extreme mechanical, chemical, or thermal stresses, such as {{the inside of a}} wood-fired kiln or a furnace, which is subject to abrasion from wood, fluxing from ash or slag, and high temperatures. In other, less harsh situations, such as in an electric or natural gas fired kiln, more porous bricks, commonly known as [...] "kiln bricks" [...] are a better choice. They are weaker, but they are much lighter, easier to form, and insulate far better than dense bricks.
