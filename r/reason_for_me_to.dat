60|$|My {{baseball}} career held some proud moments, {{but this}} one, wherein I realized {{the success of}} my matchmaking plans, was certainly the proudest one.

60|$|Now I didn't know {{anything}} about the coming of the police; and when I saw the sudden eruption of brass-buttoned, helmeted bulls, each of them reaching with both hands, all the forces and stability of my being were overthrown. Remained only the automatic process to run. And I ran. I didn't know I was running. I didn't {{know anything}}. It was, as I have said, automatic. There was no <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> run. I was not a hobo. I was a citizen of that community. It was my home town. I was guilty of no wrong-doing. I was a college man. I had even got my name in the papers, and I wore good clothes that had never been slept in. And yet I ran--blindly, madly, like a startled deer, for over a block. And when I came to myself, I noted that I was still running. It required a positive effort of will to stop those legs of mine.|$|E

40|$|The {{criminal}} {{protection and}} responsibility of persons in authority The topic of this thesis is the criminal protection and responsibility of persons in authority. Owing {{to the fact}} that since 1 / 1 / 2010 the new penal code has come into effect, the aim of this thesis is to analyse the new legislation of issues in question comprehensively, and to compare this new legislation to the protection and responsibility legislation of persons in authority, which was included in the preceding penal code. Primarily, my general interest in criminal law and also the awareness that particularly the definition of persons in authority was shifted, compared to the older definition of public agents, were the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> choose this topic. The reality of the person in authority definition shift unquestionably deserves attention and a proper analysis. The thesis is divided into five chapters which - as a whole - should provide a complex description of the criminal protection and responsibility of persons in authority. The first chapter deals with historical contexts of the criminal protection and the responsibility of persons in authority in our territory, refers to the main developmental turning points and tries to compare them to current legislations. The second chapter is focused on the analysis of defining a person in [...] ...|$|R

The thing I mention about riding the Gawler line train to a rap battle is all true. I remember being ridiculously confident like nobody could beat me that night even though I had no idea who I was up against (the wonders of teenage self-delusion).

[...] Fincher stated: [...] "There is no <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> disclose my tax returns. These attacks are because Herron is losing and he can't handle it.

50|$|I {{grew up in}} New Mexico, {{and there}} wasn't a whole lot as far as youth culture is concerned. Especially when I started to get {{interested}} in straight edge and wasn't doing drugs anymore, there was really nothing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do. So {{that was like a}} big <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I suppose, <b>to</b> become really productive. Also, I've never been a really social person. So there's not a lot of time taken up by my social life. And music has always been a very very big part of my life. I guess just a combination of those factors is why everything got started so early.|$|R
40|$|With the aim {{of healing}} the earth and sustain a healthy {{ecosystem}} for all life forms, not humankind alone, ecoaesthetics emerges as a critique of Enlightenment mentality and of modern aesthetics as it is embodied in it. This mentality contributes greatly to the global ecological crisis and to other problem areas, such as population, economic, political and religious ones. In my understanding of aesthetics, ecoaesthetics {{is defined as the}} theory of ecological aesthetic appreciation. [1] With ecoaesthetics as my research horizon, {{there are at least two}} <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pay special attention to American philosopher Arnold Berleant’s conception of aesthetic engagement and his aesthetic theory based on it, an aesthetics of engagement. The first is our shared theme, which is the critique of modern aesthetics. The second reason is more complex for it involves the crucial question of the proper manner of aesthetic appreciation. From the perspective of ecoaesthetics, the contemplation of objects by a separated perceiver, an approach that is based on the modern philosophical dualism of subject and object, is unsatisfactory and inadequate. Berleant’s aesthetic engagement is a more satisfactory account of appreciation that is aesthetic and ecological. This emphasizes the ecological continuity or interrelatedness between the human appreciator and objects. Of course, any theory can occasion critique and development. Based on Berleant’s idea of aesthetic engagement, I would like to propose Ecosophy C. This can be contrasted with Ecosophy T proposed by the Norwegian, Arne Naess, and with traditional Chinese aesthetic wisdom. In contrast with these, I would like to develop my own view of ecological understanding. In order to construct a more comprehensive and reasonable ecoaesthetics, my Ecosophy C contains eight points that are crucial in building an ecological model of aesthetic appreciation for this period of ecological crisis...|$|R
