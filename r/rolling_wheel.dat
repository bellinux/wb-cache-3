5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the <b>rolling</b> <b>wheel</b> until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E

2500|$|The Romans learned hoop {{driving from}} the Greeks and {{generally}} held {{the sport in}} high regard. The Latin term for hoop is also trochus, at times {{referred to as the}} [...] "Greek hoop." [...] The stick was known as a clavis [...] or radius, had the shape of a key, and was made of metal with a wooden handle. Roman hoops were fitted with metal rings that slid freely along the rim. According to Martial, this was done so that the tinkling of the rings would warn passers by of the hoop's approach: [...] "Why do these jingling rings move about upon the <b>rolling</b> <b>wheel?</b> In order that the passers-by may {{get out of the way}} of the hoop."(14. CLXIX) He also indicates that the metal tires of wooden cart wheels could be used as hoops: [...] "A wheel must be protected. You make me a useful present. It will be a hoop to children, but to me a tyre for my wheel."(14. CLXVIII) Martial also mentions the sport was practised by Sarmatian boys, who rolled their hoops on the frozen Danube river. According to Strabo, one of the popular Roman venues for practising the sport was the Campus Martius, which was large enough to accommodate a wide variety of activities.|$|E

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate observers' abilities to judge rolling motions. The {{experiments were}} designed to assess whether two important aspects of such motions are appreciated: the kinematic coupling of rotation and translation, and the dynamic effects of gravity. Different motion contexts of <b>rolling</b> <b>wheels</b> were created using computer-generated displays. The first experiment involved <b>wheels</b> <b>rolling</b> down an inclined plane. Observers spontaneously appreciated the anomaly of wheels that failed to accelerate, {{but they were not}} able to differentiate between different acceleration functions. Moreover, their judgements were almost exclusively based on the translation component of the rolling motion, neglecting the rotation component. In a second experiment it was found that observers could accurately estimate the perimeter of various objects. Thus, their inability to consider rotation information is not attributable to misperceptions of the geometry of wheels. In a third experiment the finding that <b>rolling</b> <b>wheels</b> appear to overrotate was replicated; however, findings from this experiment also showed, together with those from a fourth experiment, that observers are able to make very accurate judgments about translation-rotation coupling in <b>rolling</b> <b>wheels</b> when information is provided about the orientation of the wheel and the texture of the surface on which it rolls...|$|R

50|$|A {{cassette}} adapter {{is shaped}} like a cassette tape. However, instead of having reels of tape inside, it has a transmitting head where the tape is normally read by the reading head. This transmitting head {{is connected to the}} input cord, which connects the head to the audio source. A cassette adapter must also include a mechanism that simulates tape movement. Modern cassette players monitor tape movement to detect when the tape ends. This is done using a <b>rolling</b> <b>wheel</b> that rides against the tape. To simulate tape movement, a system of gears or a drive belt connects the tape player's drive motor (via the take-up spindle) to a wheel inside the adapter. This wheel rides against the detection wheel to simulate tape movement. Because the wheel never stops spinning, the deck never senses an end-of-tape and never tries to reverse the tape. Some adapters contain a one way locking mechanism, to stop the detection wheel if the tape is played in the wrong direction (and thus reading {{the wrong side of the}} head). The stopped wheel then would cause the cassette player to either stop the tape, or reverse the direction if the player supports it.|$|E

Myca, who has become Case's girlfriend, tells Vega she quits. Case begins to think as he is wrapped up for the fight. However, he realizes how he can stop Vega and goes to Braga's locker room, confronting him. As Braga heads to the ring, Case stops him and asks him why if he is so tough it took two punches to knock out his wife. Braga, in total rage, begins to attack Case. The two go to blows outside of the ring, to the delight of the crowd and to the chagrin of Vega. When Braga gets the best of Case, Case resorts to using Kyokushin again, this time using a Nakadaka Ken (Extended Middle Knuckle Punch) that damages Braga's ribs. Case {{continues}} using traditional karate techniques and knocks Braga out with a Mawashi Kaiten Geri (<b>Rolling</b> <b>Wheel</b> Kick) to his head. Vega threatens to sue, but Case tells Vega that they have the proof of him causing Brody's injury and that suing could cost Vega millions of dollars. To make matters worse, Vega must pay back everyone who came to see the fight, to which he storms off in anger, knowing he has been defeated. Case, Myca, Brody, Matty, Taj, Creech, and Creech's new love interest, Jeeja (seen earlier training and beating up a fighter who beat Creech up badly in the ring) leave the ring arena knowing they have achieved victory.|$|E

5000|$|The {{operator}} {{of the machine}} passes the sheet metal between the anvil wheel and the <b>rolling</b> <b>wheel.</b> This process stretches the material and causes it to become thinner. As the material stretches, it forms a convex surface over the anvil wheel. This surface is known as [...] "crown". A high crown surface is very curved, a low crown surface is slightly curved. The rigidity and strength in {{the surface of a}} workpiece is provided by the high crown areas. The radius of the surface, after working, depends on the degree that the metal {{in the middle of the}} work piece stretches relative to the edge of the piece. If the middle stretches too much, the operator can recover the shape by wheeling the edge of the piece. Wheeling the edge has the same effect in correcting mis-shape due to over-stretching in the middle, as does shrinking directly on the overstretched area by the use of heat shrinking or Eckold-type shrinking. This is because the edge holds the shape in place. Shrinking the edge prior to wheeling aids the formation of shape during wheeling, and reduces the amount of stretching and thinning needed to reach the final shape. Shrinking processes reduce the surface area by thickening the sheet metal. Shrinking by hand is harder to do and slower than stretching using panel beating tools or wheeling, because of this it should only be used when absolutely necessary. Aluminium sheet should be annealed before wheeling because rolling at the mill during its production work hardens it.|$|E
5000|$|The Tokyo Metropolitan Police later {{come and}} take Curaçao into custody, {{transferring}} her to the Police Hospital, but {{they are forced to}} surrender her to the PSB as the Bureau believes Curaçao was the spy infiltrating the Bureau Office the day before. The Bureau becomes aware that Curaçao appears to react to certain events in the Tohto Aquarium, and decides to take her back to the Aquarium. The same night, the Black Organization, who arrived by the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, knocks out the electricity for the entire aquarium and plan to intercept Curaçao when the ferris wheel reaches the top. After Curaçao regains her memory by looking at the specific color patterns of the projected lights like she did earlier before, Yuya Kazami, who boarded the ferris wheel with her, is knocked unconscious by her and she escapes. The Black Organization attempts to detonate the bomb planted at the ferris wheel, but the bomb is disarmed by Rei after he is informed of its existence through Conan. The organization then change plans and instead fire from the V-22, trying to kill Curaçao and destabilize the wheel so that it will fall and roll. Akai, with the help of Conan and Rei, are able to shoot down the V-22, and Conan attempts to stop the <b>rolling</b> <b>wheel</b> before it crushes to the aquarium. Curaçao, having noticed that the Detective Boys are in the rolling ferris wheel, crash a crane truck into the wheel, stopping it and saving the Detective Boys but her actions cause the ferris wheel to crush her to death. Before her death, Curaçao admits to Vermouth that the mail tampered by Conan and sent from her broken cell phone that reads [...] "Bourbon and Kir are clean" [...] was sent on her own; thus the two are able to maintain their cover in the Black Organization.|$|E
