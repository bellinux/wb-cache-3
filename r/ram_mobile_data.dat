40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> usage in South African townships. In contrast to previous studies, which have studied <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> usage in developing regions (including South Africa), we focus our study on two townships in South Africa; the extremely resource-constrained nature of townships sheds light, for the first time, on how people in these communities use <b>mobile</b> <b>data.</b> We perform a mixed-methods study, combining quantitative network measurements of mobile app usage with qualitative survey data to gain insights about <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> usage patterns and the underlying reasons for user behavior concerning <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> usage. Due to the limited availability of public free Wi-Fi and despite the relatively high cost of <b>mobile</b> <b>data,</b> we find that a typical township user's median <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> usage is significantly more than Wi-Fi usage. As expected, and consistent with observations of <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> usage in parts of South Africa with better resources, users tend to favor using Wi-Fi for streaming video applications, such as YouTube. Interestingly, however, unlike users in less resource-constrained settings, township users also consume significant <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> to update <b>mobile</b> applications, as opposed to relying on Wi-Fi networks for application updates. These behaviors suggest that network and mobile application designers must {{pay more attention to}} data usage patterns on cellular networks to provide mobile network architectures that provide more cost-effective mechanisms for tasks such as application update...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{advances}} in the Internet and wireless technologies, a ubiquitous computing world is becoming a reality {{in the form of}} mobile computing. At the center of this phenomenon is <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> services which arise from the convergence of advanced mobile communication technologies with data services. Despite the rapid growth in <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> services, research into consumers' usage behavior is scarce. This study attempts to identify and empirically assess the factors that drive consumers' acceptance of <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> services. A research model based on the decomposed theory of planned behavior and incorporating factors that represent personal needs and motivations in using <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> services is presented. The model is tested via an online survey of 811 consumers of four categories of <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> services (i. e., communications, information content, entertainment, and commercial transactions) associated with different usage contexts. We found that attitude, social influence, media influence, perceived mobility, and perceived monetary value influence consumers' intention to continue usage of <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> services. In addition, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived enjoyment influence attitude toward continued usage of <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> services. Finally, separate analysis of the different categories of <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> services highlights the influence of individual usage context on consumers' behavior...|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor network, {{energy efficiency}} {{is a major}} concern as the sensors have minimum energy capacity. As the sensor energy consumption plays a vital role in determining the network lifetime, many strategies have been proposed for energy conservation. One of them is <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> gathering (MDG). In <b>Mobile</b> <b>Data</b> Gathering either the sink can go on tour to collect the <b>data</b> or a <b>Mobile</b> <b>Data</b> Collector (MDC) can collect the data from sensors and drops them back to the static sink. In this paper, static sink with <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> collector is considered for the topic of interest. The <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> collector will reach the cluster of sensors at some appropriate locations called as anchor points. For the formation of clusters, many algorithms have been proposed so far, two of them, Square Grid based Clustering (SGC) and Sensor Transmission based Clustering (STC) are analysed here for the selection of anchors in the anchor based <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> gathering approach...|$|R

50|$|Rules {{triggering}} {{the mobile}} offloading action {{can be set}} by either an end-user (mobile subscriber) or an operator. The code operating on the rules resides in an end-user device, in a server, or is divided between the two. End users do data offloading for data service cost control {{and the availability of}} higher bandwidth. The main complementary network technologies used for <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> offloading are Wi-Fi, femtocell and Integrated Mobile Broadcast.

40|$|To {{cope with}} {{explosive}} traffic demands on current cellular networks of limited capacity, Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) {{is used to}} offload traffic from cellular networks to high capacity and free device-to-device networks. Current DTN-based <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> offloading models are based on simple and unrealistic network assumptions which do {{not take into account}} the heterogeneity of <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> and <b>mobile</b> users. We establish a mathematical framework to study the problem of multiple-type <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> offloading under realistic assumptions, where (i) <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> are heterogeneous in terms of size and lifetime; (ii) mobile users have different data subscribing interests; and (iii) the storages of offloading helpers are limited. We formulate the objective of achieving maximum <b>mobile</b> <b>data</b> offloading as a submodular function maximization problem with multiple linear constraints of limited storage, and propose three algorithms, suitable for the generic and more specific offloading scenarios, respectively, to solve this challenging optimization problem. We show that the designed algorithms effectively offload data to the DTN by using both the theoretical analysis and simulation investigations which employ both real human and vehicular mobility traces...|$|R
