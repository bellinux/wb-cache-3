40|$|Neutrophils from cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) patients {{have been shown}} previously to be defective in their response (beta-glucuronidase exocytosis, NADPH oxidase activation) to the chemotactic peptide FMLP. In this work, we attempted to identify the defective step in this response. We showed that stimulated CF and control neutrophils do not differ {{in the formation of}} inositol phosphates. On the other hand, direct stimulation of protein kinase C with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) revealed a subnormal stimulation of beta-glucuronidase exocytosis in CF neutrophils. Furthermore, <b>retroinhibition</b> exerted by PMA-activated protein kinase C on stimulated inositol phosphates or on beta-glucuronidase exocytosis was marginal or absent in CF neutrophils, whereas it was significant in the case of control neutrophils. Our observations suggest that the CFTR gene is expressed in neutrophils and is involved in protein kinase C-mediated actions. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|At {{the heart}} of central carbon metabolism, {{pyruvate}} is a pivotal metabolite in all living cells. Bacillus subtilis is able to excrete pyruvate {{as well as to}} use it as the sole carbon source. We herein reveal that ysbAB (renamed pftAB), the only operon specifically induced in pyruvate-grown B.  subtilis cells, encodes a hetero-oligomeric membrane complex which operates as a facilitated transport system specific for pyruvate, thereby defining a novel class of transporter. We demonstrate that the LytST two-component system is responsible for the induction of pftAB in the presence of pyruvate by binding of the LytT response regulator to a palindromic region upstream of pftAB. We show that both glucose and malate, the preferred carbon sources for B.  subtilis, trigger the binding of CcpA upstream of pftAB, which results in its catabolite repression. However, an additional CcpA-independent mechanism represses pftAB in the presence of malate. Screening a genome-wide transposon mutant library, we find that an active malic enzyme replenishing the pyruvate pool is required for this repression. We next reveal that the higher the influx of pyruvate, the stronger the CcpA-independent repression of pftAB, which suggests that intracellular pyruvate retroinhibits pftAB induction via LytST. Such a <b>retroinhibition</b> challenges the rational design of novel nature-inspired sensors and synthetic switches but undoubtedly offers new possibilities for the development of integrated sensor/controller circuitry. Overall, we provide evidence for a complete system of sensors, feed-forward and feedback controllers that {{play a major role in}} environmental growth of B.  subtilis...|$|E
