These comprise hydroclastic explosions due to near-surface interaction of the rising particle/volatile mixture with seawater and water-saturated lime mud. Other external factors contributing to diatreme formation include regional and local tectonics (graben formation in pull-apart motion) combined with lateral pipe enlargement by bedrock-spalling and <b>radial</b> <b>block</b> subsidence into the diatreme pipe.

40|$|Thermoplastic {{elastomers}} {{based on}} a triblock copolymer styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) with different butadiene/styrene ratios, block structure and carbon nanotube (CNT) content were submitted to accelerated weathering in a Xenontest set up, in order to evaluate their stability to UV ageing. It was concluded that ageing mainly depends on butadiene/styrene ratio and block structure, with <b>radial</b> <b>block</b> structures exhibiting a faster ageing than linear block structures. Moreover, the presence of carbon nanotubes in the SBS copolymer slows down the ageing of the copolymer. The evaluation {{of the influence of}} ageing on the mechanical and electrical properties demonstrates that the mechanical degradation is higher for the C 401 sample, which is the SBS sample with the largest butadiene content and a <b>radial</b> <b>block</b> structure. On the other hand, a copolymer derivate from SBS, the styrene-ethylene/butadiene-styrene (SEBS) sample, retains a maximum deformation of ~ 1000 % after 80 h of accelerated ageing. The hydrophobicity of the samples decreases with increasing ageing time, the effect being larger for the samples with higher butadiene content. It is also verified that cytotoxicity increases with increasing UV ageing with the exception of SEBS, which remains not cytotoxic up to 80 h of accelerated ageing time, demonstrating its potential for applications involving exposition to environmental conditions.

Inspired by American architectural concepts about the construction of hospitals, Vijverdal arose as a huge complex with a nine storey <b>radial</b> <b>block</b> of flats: a unique building in Dutch psychiatry. The first reactions were very positive. The imposing flat expressed psychiatric optimism and therapeutic promises. However, confronted by the dynamic developments in psychiatry {{at the end of the}} seventies, the hospital more and more appeared to be a therapeutic monstrum: the flat became a symbol of alienation and medical detachment. Adapting it to the new ideas about differentiation and de-concentration appeared difficult, however. Only in 2000 Vijverdal started a fundamental renovation. The flat will be torn down in 2006. This changing evaluation of Vijverdal makes us wonder about the biography of this psychiatric hospital. Which intentions and which psychiatric concepts inspired Vijverdal to be built? How functioned the building environment of Vijverdal in practice? Could the hospital be accommodated to the new notions and wishes about psychiatric care? Moreover, in what way did the architecture determine the history of Vijverdal? And eventually, how are new conceptions about psychiatric care translated in the present renovation and reconstruction of Vijverdal? Do therapeutic promises play a role again?

Then transverse sections of 15 - to 20 -μm thickness were sectioned on a sliding microtome (Yamatokohki, Saitama, Japan). The transverse sections were stained with 1 % safranin solution, mounted on glass slides, fixed with resin (Entellan New; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and covered with coverslips [17]. Images were recorded from each slide under the light microscope with the digital camera. Three digital images of transverse-sectional area of 35.3  ×  103  μm 2 were taken in each radial position to measure the fiber wall area (%), fiber wall thickness and fiber diameter. Fiber wall area (%) was defined as the ratio of total area of fiber wall per total area of measured image. Rays were excluded from total area of measured image. For the measurements of vessel lumen area (%), vessel diameter and vessel frequency (number of vessels/mm 2), three digital images of transverse-sectional area of 8.1  ×  106  μm 2 from each radial position were observed. The percentage of vessel lumen area was determined by calculating the ratio of total area of vessel lumens per total area of observed image.

40|$|The neural {{drive to}} a muscle and its biomechanical {{properties}} determine the force at a joint. These factors may be centrally linked. We studied {{the relationship between the}} ability of first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) to generate index flexion force around the metacarpophalangeal joint and the neural drive it receives in a voluntary contraction. The role of FDI was assessed in two thumb postures, thumb ‘down’ (thumb abducted) and thumb ‘up’ (thumb extended), and at different thumb carpometacarpal angles. These postures were designed to change acutely the flexion moment arm for FDI. The flexion twitch force evoked by supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve was measured in the two postures and the change in moment arm was assessed by ultrasonography. Subjects also made voluntary flexion contractions of the index finger of ∼ 5 N in both postures during which neural drive to FDI and the long finger flexor muscles was measured using surface EMG. Recordings of FDI EMG were normalized to the maximal M wave. Five of the 15 subjects also had a <b>radial</b> nerve <b>block</b> to eliminate any co-contraction of the extensor muscles, and extensor muscle EMG was monitored in subjects without <b>radial</b> nerve <b>block.</b> Compared to thumb up, flexion twitch force was ∼ 60 % greater, and the flexion moment arm was ∼ 50 % greater with the thumb down. There was minimal effect of altered carpometacarpal angle on flexion twitch force for either thumb posture. During voluntary flexion contractions, normalized FDI EMG was ∼ 28 % greater with thumb down, compared to thumb up, with no consistent change in neural drive to the long flexors. Hence, the contribution of FDI to index finger flexion can be altered by changes in thumb position. This is linked to changes in neural drive to FDI such that neural drive increases when the mechanical contribution increases, and provides a central mechanism to produce efficient voluntary movements...|$|R

30|$|The {{trial was}} carried out in a {{randomized}} complete block design. Two trees from each stocking density with a total of sixteen trees from the two clones were sampled. The trees were cut at a height of 15  cm above the ground level. A cross-sectional disc of approximately 50  mm in thickness collected from each tree at 1.3  m above ground level was used in the determination of radial anatomical component characteristics. The discs were labeled, wrapped in black plastic bags and transported to the laboratory of wood anatomy for further analyses. Owing to indistinct growth rings in the samples, the radial variation in fibers, vessels, and wood ray cells for each disc was analyzed on a strip running from pith to bark [14, 15]. <b>Radial</b> <b>blocks</b> with precise dimensions of 15  ×  15  ×  15  mm with no intervals between them were cut from each strip. After removing the pith, 4 blocks from SD I and 3 blocks from SDs II, III, and IV were prepared, depending on the diameter at breast height of sampled trees and the radius of the strips. These blocks would enable detection of the gradual radial change in wood anatomical features. All blocks were properly numbered. Almost the middle part of each block was chosen for sectioning. Transverse and tangential microsections with thicknesses of 20 – 25  μm were obtained from each small block using a sledge microtome. To determine the fiber cell features, the maceration process used followed the TAPPI Standard T 233 -Su- 64 [16]. The fiber length (μm), fiber diameter (μm), fiber lumen diameter (μm), and fiber wall thickness (μm) of randomly selected fibers were measured by image processing software calibrated with a stage micrometer. Fiber diameter, fiber lumen diameter and fiber wall thickness were measured with a magnification of × 400 and for fiber length, vessel and ray cell components, a magnification of × 100 was used. A preliminary study was conducted to determine the number of fibers to be measured. High values of standard deviations were obtained with < 30 readings for each of the features recorded. Therefore, the final countable number was increased to 50 readings for every single component. Crosswise sectional microscopic images were measured using an Image Analyzer Microscope (Leica Qwin model). The vessel density (mm− 2), vessel diameter (the average of radial and tangential diameter, μm), and vessel area (%) were determined in every field under microscope. Likewise, ray density (mm− 2), ray height (number of parenchyma cells in every single ray cell), and ray area (tangential surface occupied by ray cells, %) were calculated in tangential section.|$|R

The {{mechanisms by which}} such coordinated movements are achieved are a focus of interest from the standpoints of neurobiology and robotics, because ophiuroids appear to lack a central nervous system that could exert centralized control over five arms. To explore the underlying mechanism of arm coordination, we {{examined the effects of}} selective anesthesia to various parts of the body of ophiuroids on locomotion. We observed the following: (1) anesthesia of the circumoral nerve ring completely blocked the initiation of locomotion; however, initiation of single arm movement, such as occurs during the retrieval of food, was unaffected, indicating that the inability to initiate locomotion was not due to the spread of the anesthetic agent. (2) During locomotion, the midsegments of the arms periodically made contact with the floor to elevate the disc. In contrast, the distal segments of the arms were pointed aborally and did not make contact with the floor. (3) When the midsegments of all arms were anesthetized, arm movements were rendered completely uncoordinated. In contrast, even when only one arm was left intact, inter-arm coordination was preserved. (4) Locomotion was unaffected by anesthesia of the distal arms. (5) A <b>radial</b> nerve <b>block</b> to the proximal region of an arm abolished coordination among the segments of that arm, rendering it motionless.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{study the}} process of denervation-reinnervation in {{multifocal}} motor neuropathy with persistent conduction blocks in clinically affected and unaffected muscles.  METHOD—Volitional single fibre electromyography (SFEMG) was performed in the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) of seven patients. The jitter, the fibre density, and the mean interpotential interval were determined. The results before and after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) between the unaffected EDC and affected EDC examined during the same SFEMG session were also compared. In addition the values of jitter, fibre density, and mean interpotential interval were analysed for correlation with the strength score on the MRC scale, {{the duration of the}} neuropathy, the number of IVIg treatment periods, and the <b>radial</b> nerve conduction <b>block</b> values.  RESULTS—Mean jitter, percentage of jitters> 60 µs, and impulse blocking percentage, were higher than normal in both the affected EDCs and to a lesser degree in unaffected EDCs. Jitter decreased significantly after IVIg and correlated only with the MRC score. Fibre density and mean interpotential interval were higher than normal equally in the affected EDC and unaffected EDCs, but no correlation was found with strength, duration of the neuropathy, number of treatment periods, and conduction block values.  CONCLUSION—The major finding is the presence of SFEMG abnormalities in clinically unaffected EDCs. This shows a process of denervation-reinnervation {{even in the absence of}} clinical symptoms, probably more frequent than commonly supposed in this neuropathy. The rapid clinical improvement after IVIg infusions could be due to remyelination after demyelination and to an interference of IVIg with the blocking effect of antibodies on the Na+ channels at the motor nerve endings. ...|$|R

Fibrous septa may divide the perivascular space into compartments, leading to inadequate diffusion of the anaesthetic solution. The aim of our study was to obtain good anaesthesia and less complications using high volume of low concentration anaesthetic solution, overcoming the obstacle of the septa with a double approach to the scalene sheath. Methods: Sixty patients scheduled for shoulder capsuloplasty received both Winnie interscalene brachial plexus block and Pippa proximal cranial needle approach. The patients {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups. A constant dose of local anaesthetic was administered to each group: Group I (30 patients) received high volume (60 mL of anaesthetic solution) and Group II (30 patients) received low volume of solution (30 mL of anaesthetic solution). Sensory and motor block in the upper limb and complications were evaluated. Results: In all the patients the quality of anaesthesia obtained at the surgical site was excellent. In Group I also the areas supplied by the medial cutaneous nerves of the arm and forearm, ulnar, median and <b>radial</b> nerves were <b>blocked</b> (P < 0. 002). Complications were only observed in Group II and consisted of bradycardia and hypotension (66 % of the patients) and phrenic nerve paresis (27 %, of the patients). Conclusions: The lower concentration of the anaesthetic solution avoids complications while increased volume provides good analgesic cover. The combination of the Winnie interscalene plexus block and the Pippa proximal cranial needle approach should contribute to fill up the scalene sheath overcoming the septa obstacles...|$|R
40|$|A {{parts of}} the {{contemporary}} rotary compressors are supported as by revolving crankshaft (rotor, roller, etc.), so by the housing (stator, pump, suction accumulator, etc.). Such dual supporting structure complicates assembly of a compressor due to the necessity of precision axial and radial positioning of the pump parts, motor rotor and stator. Developed novel rotary compressor provides a unitary assembly, in which a rotor of the driver -external rotor electric motor, is integrated with concentrically situated pump and rotatably arranged on stationary crankshaft. Stationary crankshaft is fixedly connected to the hermetic housing and supports as the fixed to it motor stator, so the rotor block and the piston block revolving around it. The single structure supporting the motor stator, the rotor block, the piston block and housing simplifies compressor assembly, and allows precision, reliable setting of the parts due to the common single reference - axial line. The piston block and the rotor block have only one line rolling contact, where tangential velocities of blocks are unidirectional and equal in magnitude. It means that the sliding frictional losses at the line contact are minimal. The frictional losses between the rotor <b>blocks</b> <b>radial</b> surfaces and facing surfaces of the piston block heads are also minimal due to the low relative rubbing speed between synchronously revolving in one direction contacting surfaces. Suction system of the novel rotary compressor excluded direct delivery of the refrigerant to the suction chamber by positioning a suction input cavity and a motor cavity in between the suction intake located {{at the top of}} the housing and suction port inlet {{at the top of the}} motor cavity. The arrangement of a refrigerant delivery eliminates external accumulator, increases the liquid refrigerant storage capacity and provides cooling of the compressor motor during and after its duty cycle. The vapor will be delivered substantially free of liquid refrigerant into the suction chamber under higher pressure (supercharged) due to the action of the impeller positioned in the motor cavity. The rotation of the piston block is due to the distributed forces which have been transmitted from an external rotor of the motor through the direct, no sliding line contact between both blocks and through a mechanical link – vane, which is rigidly fixed in the piston block wall. Another advantage of the novel rotary compressor is that the discharge gas will be tangentially ejected in form of one or more high-speed jets in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation. It creates a reaction forces acting in the direction of rotation and added to the forces revolving the piston block. The design modifications described above, employment of an external rotor motor as a driver, elimination of the roller, reciprocating movement of the vane, vane spring, and external accumulator, utilization of new developed tubular discharge valve improve performance of novel rotary compressor, make it compact, (smaller package space), reliable, and reduce manufacturing cost. *) Dreiman N.

40|$|The Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is a Generation-IV {{design in}} the {{conceptual}} pre-licensing phase for potential construction by 2030 - 2050. It is graphite moderated, helium cooled reactor that operates at an exit temperature of up to 1273 K, making it ideal for generating electricity at a plant thermal efficiency upwards of 48 % and the co-generation of process heat for hydrogen production and other industrial uses. Extensive thermal-hydraulics and safety analyses of VHTRs are being conducted using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and heat transfer codes, in conjunction with experiments and prototype demonstrations. These analyses are challenging, {{largely due to the}} 3 -D simulation of the helium flow in the 10 m long coolant channels in the reactor core and the need {{to examine the effects of}} helium bypass flow in the interstitial gaps between the core fuel elements. This research, performed at the UNM-ISNPS, developed an effective thermal-hydraulics analyses methodology that markedly reduces the numerical meshing requirements and computational time. It couples the helium’s 1 -D convective flow and heat transfer in the channels to 3 -D heat conduction in graphite and fuel compacts of VHTR fuel elements. Besides the helium local bulk temperature, the heat transfer coefficient is calculated using a Nusselt number correlation, developed and validated in this work. In addition to omitting the numerical meshing in the coolant channels, the simplified analysis methodology effectively decreases the total computation time by a factor of ~ 33 - 40 with little effect on the calculated temperatures (< 5 K), compared to a full 3 -D thermal-hydraulics analysis. The developed convective heat transfer correlation accounts for the effect of entrance mixing in the coolant channels, where z/D < 25. The correlation compares favorably, to within + 12 %, with Taylor’s (based on high temperature hydrogen heat transfer) and to within + 2 % of the calculated results for full 3 -D analyses of a VHTR single channel module and multiple channels in the fuel elements. The simplified methodology is used to investigate the effects of helium bypass flow in interstitial gaps between fuel elements and of the helium bleed flow in control rod channels on calculated temperatures in the VHTR fuel elements. Thermal-hydraulics analysis of a one-element high and of a full height VHTR 1 / 6 core are also conducted. Results show that the interstitial bypass flow increases the temperatures near the center of the core fuel elements by 10 - 15 K, while reducing the temperatures along the edges of the elements by ~ 30 K. Without bypass flow, hotspots may occur at the location of burnable poison rods in the fuel elements, depending on the assumed volumetric heat generation rate in the rods. The helium bleed flow through the control rod channels reduces temperatures near them by 2 - 5 K, and only slightly increases the temperatures within the rest of the core fuel elements. In the VHTR 1 / 6 core thermal-hydraulics analysis, the helium bypass flow decreases the heat transfer from the core fuel elements to the adjacent <b>radial</b> graphite reflector <b>blocks.</b> Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology and its potential use in future thermal-hydraulics design and in the safety analyses of VHTRs.
