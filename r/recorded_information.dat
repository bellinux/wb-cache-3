She also said she would contact them when she returned. At 2:05 pm she called a number which provides <b>recorded</b> <b>information</b> about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.|$|E
5|$|There is no <b>recorded</b> <b>information</b> on the Lānai hookbill's {{breeding}} behavior. However, {{the other}} Hawaiian honeycreepers are remarkably uniform in their breeding behavior, {{and it is}} therefore likely that the hookbills also bred from early winter {{through the end of}} summer in August, with pair bonding being completed by January or February. The males likely defended a territory that moved along with his bonded female and became a centered around the nest after the female constructed it. It is hypothesized that the hookbill laid two to three eggs and that its young were altricial.|$|E

Although fragmentary and ambiguous, the French accounts are the only historic documents of Natchez society before 1730. Natchez oral traditions have also been studied. The first modern ethnographic study was done by John R. Swanton in 1911. Swanton's interpretations and conclusions are still generally accepted and widely cited. Later researchers have addressed various problems with Swanton's interpretation. Some researchers have proposed modifications of Swanton's model, while others have rejected most of it.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{entities}} {{in possession}} of medical records are required to maintain those records for a given period. In the United Kingdom, medical records are required for the lifetime of a patient and legally {{for as long as}} that complaint action can be brought. Generally in the UK, any <b>recorded</b> <b>information</b> should be kept legally for 7 years, but for medical records additional time must be allowed for any child to reach the age of responsibility (20 years). Medical records are required many years after a patient’s death to investigate illnesses within a community (e.g., industrial or environmental disease or even deaths at the hands of doctors committing murders, as in the Harold Shipman case).|$|E
25|$|Into this divided community, {{the mine}} owners hired spies {{to monitor and}} {{undermine}} the union. Spies supplied {{thousands of pages of}} daily reports on the internal workings of the CCMU; its divisions, its plans, its weaknesses. Although everyone knew that there were spies in the union (the details of secret union leadership meetings were printed the following day in the Leadville Herald Democrat), they never guessed their identities. Spies were entrusted with union security responsibilities, even with the responsibility of detecting possible spies. The spies faithfully <b>recorded</b> <b>information</b> about ethnic rivalries and philosophical disputes among die-hard and disillusioned unionists, militants and pacifists, optimists and pessimists, and the spy agencies passed that information on to the mine operators. With comprehensive daily reports on secret union meetings and the union's tactical plans, mine owners were able to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlast the strikers.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, Seeadler encountered another steamship, which {{refused to}} identify itself. The German ensign was raised and a shot fired across {{the bow of}} the Lundy Island, which was carrying sugar from Madagascar. The steamer still refused to heave to, and Luckner fired four rounds directly at her. The steamer then hove to and lowered her boats, but her captain ignored an order to come to Seeadler. A German boarding party was sent over and discovered that the crew had abandoned ship when the first shots were fired, leaving the captain alone on board. Captain Bannister later told Luckner that he had previously been captured by a German raider and had given his parole, which he had broken; thus, he was not anxious to be a prisoner of war again. Luckner continued his voyage southwards, and by 21 January he was in mid-Atlantic between Brazil and West Africa when he found the 2,199 ton French three-masted barque Charles Gounod, which was loaded with corn. She was quickly dispatched, but her log book <b>recorded</b> <b>information</b> about other ships she had met and their intended route.|$|E
25|$|The {{conservation}} measures undertaken in Bhutan {{to preserve and}} conserve the cranes are unique; in fact more and more crane habitat areas are being brought under the protected area concept. The Royal Society for Protection of Nature (RSPN) established in 1987, which has the mandate for conservation and nature education {{has been involved in}} monitoring the winter visitors to the Phobjika valley and other habitats such as Bomdeling Valley. According to <b>recorded</b> <b>information,</b> 141 cranes visit Bomdeling valley (Phobjika reports a count of about 400 now) every year. RSPN has a Visitor Centre at the Phobjikha Valley, which provides information on cranes and the environment of the valley. The information Centre is a very modern decagonal building, next to a stream, with high-tech equipment. There is an observatory for birdwatchers, a mini theatre with mural painting with narration. The center staff provides services such as narration, facilitation and presentation of the valley and cranes in Bhutan. The Society has also produced a documentary (1989 : On the wings of prayer and 2014: Heavenly Bird with A german TV comapny) film on the cranes visiting Bhutan every year. Further, in Phubjika the Observation Towers have been so located that they cause the least disturbance to the crane habitats. Tourists are allowed to observe the cranes through the two or three high tech “spotting telescopes’’ and spotted on the watch the behaviour of the crane as described in the RSPN pamphlet titled “Field Guide to Crane Behaviour”, from a safe distance under the strict supervision of forest officials. Farmers are also advised to replace the barbed wire fencing with wooden and stone fencing to reduce harm to the cranes. Collisions with powerlines cause mortality to many crane species and when electricity was to be provided to the valley, the power cables were laid underground to avoid any mortality. The work was taken up during summer when the birds do not use the area.|$|E
500|$|The new {{library was}} remodeled on several occasions, {{with a new}} wing added in 1941. The 1918 {{building}} was located on {{the southeast corner of}} Campus Way and Waldo Place and after the 1941 addition, had about [...] of space spread over three floors and a full basement. Designed in the neoclassical style, the exterior was made of bricks and contained decorative plaques constructed of concrete, with the gabled roof covered with tile. The original design had two-story reading rooms, which were converted to single-story rooms in the 1950s. A mural painted by J. Leo Fairbanks was added to the main reading room in 1929 as a gift from the school's class of 1925. The mural was titled <b>Recorded</b> <b>Information</b> and was the second mural in that room by Fairbanks, who was the longtime head of the school's art department.|$|E

40|$|QUESTION 1. Archivists {{long have}} been distressed at non-use of archival {{resources}} by those who, as archivists see them, could benefit readily and substantially from {{making use of}} this category of <b>records</b> <b>information.</b> Write an essay in which you: (1) define and exhibit a strong {{understanding of the nature}} and purpose of <b>records</b> <b>information</b> and archives, and (2) indicate the ways in which concepts of non-use of information might be applied effectively in the archival environment with the goal of achieving greater benefit to the public for its investment in archives.

2500|$|... 190x (not to be {{confused}} with 0198) is the prefix for premium rate services (e.g. <b>recorded</b> <b>information,</b> competition lines, psychics, phone sex, etc.).

The latter method is most often used for fax-back services, where a timed charge is not appropriate. Costs of 190 calls for competitions involving chance are also often limited by state legislation to $0.55 per call.
