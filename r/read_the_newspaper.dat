25|$|While {{traditional}} media, like {{newspapers and}} television advertising, are largely overshadowed {{by the rise of}} social media marketing, there is still a place for traditional marketing. For example, with newspapers, readership over the years has shown a decline. However, readership with newspapers is still fiercely loyal to print-only media. 51% of newspaper readers only <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> in its print form, making well-placed ads valuable.|$|E
25|$|Princess Galyani Vadhana {{had liked}} {{reading and writing}} from an early age. While {{studying}} Prathom 1 to Prathom 3, she read as many Thai language books as she could find. However, children’s books in Thai were then rare so she often <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper.</b> She remembered once reading {{a story in the}} original French—the 1878 novel Sans Famille—while studying in Switzerland, which she later found again.|$|E

25|$|Raymond's son, David Belle, {{was born}} in 1973. He experimented with {{gymnastics}} and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> clippings that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that {{would be useful to}} him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, {{when he was}} 21 and {{a student}} at the University of California, Berkeley, London searched for and <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> {{accounts}} of his mother's suicide attempt and the name of his biological father. He wrote to William Chaney, then living in Chicago. Chaney responded that he could not be London's father because he was impotent; he casually asserted that London's mother had relations with other men and averred that she had slandered him when she said he insisted on an abortion. Chaney concluded by saying that he was more to be pitied than London. London was devastated by his father's letter; in the months following, he quit school at Berkeley and went to the Klondike during the gold rush boom.|$|E
25|$|Months later, {{after the}} {{forensic}} testing had been inconclusive, FBI agent Ron Butkiewicz <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> story, contacted O'Malley, and they toured the location together on April 6, 1992. Upon re-interviewing Lodzinski's friends and family, Butkiewitz {{learned that she}} had once worked and taken frequent walks at the Raritan Center complex, within a few blocks of the sneaker's discovery, although Lodzinski herself omitted just this location when investigators had asked for her complete employment history. On April 23–24, 1992, law enforcement teams conducted a full search of the area. They quickly located a matching second sneaker in Timmy's size, and then found the boy's partial skeletal remains in and around a truck tire in Red Root Creek, near pieces of his clothing, a Ninja Turtles balloon, and a blue blanket. His identity was confirmed through dental records, and his death was ruled a homicide, although the time, location, and medical cause of death could not be determined due to advanced decomposition.|$|E

500|$|The {{beauty of}} his Villa des Fleurs {{home and the}} warm {{reception}} he received in French Algeria pleased Rainilaiarivony and contributed to a positive impression of his new life in Algiers. He quickly developed an excellent reputation among the local high society, who perceived him as a kind, intelligent, generous and charming figure. The Governor-General of French Algeria regularly invited him to diplomatic balls and social events where Rainilaiarivony danced with the enthusiasm and endurance of a much younger man. When not busy with diverse social engagements, Rainilaiarivony avidly <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> and corresponded with contacts in Madagascar. As an insurrection in Madagascar emerged against French rule, {{the former prime minister}} wrote a letter published in a Malagasy newspaper on 5 July 1896 that condemned the participants as ungrateful for the benefits that contact with the French would bring to the island. His last outing in Algiers was on 14 July 1896 to watch the Bastille Day fireworks show. As he walked through the streets to join other spectators in his party, he was greeted with cheers and calls of [...] "Vive le Ministre!" [...] ("Long live the Minister!") from admiring onlookers.|$|E

2500|$|Breuning {{attributed}} {{much of his}} longevity to his diet. Shortly {{after his}} wife died, Breuning started eating out at restaurants. Eventually, he stopped eating out, but continued eating two meals a day. He ate a big breakfast and a hearty lunch but skipped an evening meal, snacking on fruit instead. Breuning drank lots of water through the day plus a cup {{and a half of}} coffee with breakfast and one cup with lunch. He got up every day at 6:15am and had breakfast at 7:30am. He then took a stroll around The Rainbow for exercise and could then be found sitting in the lobby chatting with fellow residents and his many visitors. Breuning would retire to his room in mid-afternoon to listen to radio and when his vision allowed him, <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> and his many letters received from {{people from all over the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|One day in 1691 he went, {{according}} to his custom on a post-day, to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper</b> at a coffee-house in Stamford, and there, to his surprise, he read that the king had nominated him to the bishopric of Peterborough. The bishop elect was scarcely known at court, and he had resorted to none of the usual methods of advancing his temporal interest. [...] "Being then sixty years old," [...] says his great-grandson, [...] "he was with difficulty persuaded to accept the offer, {{when it came to}} him from authority. The persuasion of his friends, particularly Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at length overcame his repugnance; and to that see, though very moderately endowed, he for ever after devoted himself, and resisted every offer of translation, though repeatedly made and earnestly recommended. To such of his friends as pressed an exchange upon him he was accustomed to reply, that Peterborough was his first espoused, and should be his only one." [...] He discharged his new duties with energy and kept up his episcopal visitations till his eightieth year.|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, Dina Thanthi (Daily Telegraph) {{was started}} in Madurai with {{simultaneous}} editions in Madras, Salem and Tiruchirappalli. [...] It was founded by S.P. Adithanar, a lawyer trained in Britain. He modeled Thanthi on the style of an English tabloid- The Daily Mirror. He aimed to bring out a newspaper that ordinary people would read, and which would encourage a reading habit even among the newly literate. In the past, the daily newspaper which was printed in Madras reached the southern Tamil region after at least one day. Thanthi used the public bus system to distribute the paper throughout the south Tamil region and capitalized on the hunger for war news that arose after Singapore fell to the Japanese. Due to financial constraints, its Salem and Tiruchirappalli editions had to be closed down for a while. Thanthi emphasized local news, especially crime and the courts. It used photographs extensively and brought banner headlines to Tamil journalism. It could fit one story on an entire broadsheet page, mainly filled with large easy-to-read headlines. One of its biggest scoops was {{the murder of the}} editor of a scandalous film magazine by two actors. Thanthi covered the trial in Madras in detail, and its reporters phoned the daily account to the printing centre in Madurai. Thanthi was the first Tamil paper to understand the people’s fascination with crime and film stars. The paper was popular and it was said that Tamils learned to read in order to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>newspaper.</b>|$|E
