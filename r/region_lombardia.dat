Of these 56. 3 positive blood coltures / 1000 patients were observed. Data were similar as 1997. In total 3063 episodes of bacteriemia were observed (6. 98 BI / 1000 hospital patients). 53 % of cases correlated to hospital infection. Organism identification of causative organisms resulted 22. 5 % for E. coli and 10. 6 % for KES; 17. 7 % S. aureus, 4. 5 % Yeast. Anaerobic bacteria resulted involved in 3. 4 %. Among the frequency of isolates difference was noted in different wards In intensive care unit E. coli was pathogenic in 5. 9 % of patients, but KES in 25. 5 % of cases.

40|$|Connected {{government}} {{implies that}} citizens and enterprises can interact with government {{as with a}} single entity rather than {{with a number of}} different public authorities. In countries characterized by a highly fragmented system of Local Government, connected government at the local level can be achieved only through a process of progressive integration on a wider area of systems of local government already integrated at the local level. In the chapter, the author argues that this process should be based on a maturity model and a reference model that define the technological and organizational conditions that allow the establishment of more and more integrated aggregations of municipalities. With reference to a study funded by the <b>Region</b> <b>Lombardia</b> (Italy), the chapter introduces the concept of Integrated System of Local Government (ISLG) and describes the process that leads to the establishment of ISLGs as an intermediate step toward connected government at the local level.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{highlight}} one possible use of administrative archives in decision making processes. The phenomenon we want to analyse is the carpal tunnel syndrome surgery treatment. Nowadays, from an operative point of view, two different ways coexist in treating the problem: the day hospital (DH) and the ordinary hospitalization (OH) surgery. Causes of this dichotomy are not so clear. In particular, because of the simplicity of the intervention we can hypothesize that, given the effects of some observed factors, no other significant differences should be observed between different hospitals. We extract 16431 observations from the administrative archive of <b>Region</b> <b>Lombardia</b> Data used for this analysis refer to year 2002. The observations are clustered in 128 hospitals. The binary response variable, the hospitalization regimen, is modelled with a logistic regression. Fixed all the other observed variables (referred both at hospital and at patient level), we identify by a random coeffcient a signicant hospitals effect. Day hospital treatment presents lower costs for the national health service. The suspect of the administration is that DRG reinboursement system can create the premise for acting opportunistically. Administrations of hospitals are induced to choice OH instead of DH in order to obtain major reinboursement. The identication of hospitals presenting higher probability (resulting from the random effect values) in deciding for a OH instead of the more common DH could be useful for the administrative control system. Maximum likelihood results will be presented and different methods of estimation of random effects will be compared...|$|E
40|$|Background: Statins, due {{to their}} {{well-established}} pleiotropic effects, have noteworthy benefits in stroke prevention. Despite this, {{a significant proportion of}} high-risk patients still do not receive the recommended therapeutic regimens, and many others discontinue treatment after being started on them. The causes of non-adherence to current guidelines are multifactorial, and depend on both physicians and patients. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the factors influencing statin prescription at Stroke Unit (SU) discharge. Methods: This study included 12, 750 patients enrolled on the web-based Lombardia Stroke Registry (LRS) from July 2009 to April 2012 and discharged alive, with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and without contra-indication to statin therapy. By logistic regression analysis and classification trees, we evaluated the impact of demographic data, risk factors, tPA treatment, in-hospital procedures and complications on statin prescription rate at discharge. Results: We observed a slight increase in statins prescription during the study period (from 39. 1 to 43. 9 %). Lower age, lower stroke severity and prestroke disability, the presence of atherothrombotic/lacunar risk factors, a diagnosis of non-cardioembolic stroke, tPA treatment, the absence of in-hospital complications, with the sole exception of hypertensive fits and hyperglycemia, were the patient-related predictors of adherence to guidelines by physicians. Overall, dyslipidemia appears as the leading factor, while TOAST classification does not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: In our <b>region,</b> <b>Lombardia,</b> adherence to guidelines in statin prescription at Stroke Unit discharge is very different from international goals. The presence of dyslipidemia remains the main factor influencing statin prescription, while the presence of well-defined atherosclerotic etiopathogenesis of stroke does not enhance statin prescription. Some uncertainties about the risk/benefit of statin therapy in stroke etiology subtypes (cardioembolism, other or undetermined causes) may partially justify the underuse of statin in ischemic stroke. The differences that exist between current international guidelines may prevent a more widespread use of statin and should be clarified in a consensus...|$|E

40|$|In January 2013 a novel type of {{multicomponent}} protein-based vaccine against group B meningococcal {{disease was}} {{licensed by the}} European Medicines Agency. With {{the widespread use of}} the meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccines, serogroup B remains now the major cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia in young children in Europe. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the health and the economic outcomes of MenB vaccine introduction into the Italian routine mass vaccination programme. The present work is structured in two main parts. Firstly, we assess the epidemiological burden of group B meningococcal disease using official hospitalisation and notification data from two of the most populated Italian <b>regions</b> (<b>Lombardia</b> and Piemonte) during a 6 -year study period (2007 - 2012). Secondly, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the immunisation programme in Italy from the public health payer perspective under base case parameters assumptions and performing a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness and the uncertainty of our model results. MenB serotype is responsible for 59 % of the 341 cases of Invasive Meningococcal Disease in Lombardia and Piemonte. Incidence rate for MenB infection is estimated to be 0. 21 / 100, 000 /y resulting at the highest level in children ≤ 4 years of age. Although the new MenB vaccine can potentially prevent about one third of the disease cases in the Italian population, model results show this strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective (ICER value over € 350, 000 /QALY) with a vaccine that prevents disease only. These results are robust under most of the sensitivity scenarios except when allowing for lower discount rates. The introduction of the novel vaccine into the routine immunisation schedule needs to be carefully evaluated. The new MenB vaccine has the potential to reduce the disease burden at the population level. However, from the Italian Health Service perspective, the immunisation programme is unlikely to be cost-effective at the current incidence levels and vaccine price...|$|R
