40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{model of the}} leucine zipper GCN 4 built from its amino acid sequence had been reported previously by us. When the two alternative x-ray structures of the GCN 4 dimer became available, the root mean square (<b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.)</b> shifts between our model and the structures were determined as approximately 2. 7 A on all atoms. These values {{are similar to the}} <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> shift of 2. 8 A between the two GCN 4 structures in the different crystal forms (C 2 and P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1)). CONGEN conformational searches were run to better understand the conditions that may determine the preference of different conformers in different environments and to test the sensitivity of our current modeling techniques. With a judicious choice of CONGEN search parameters, the backbone <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> deviation improved to 0. 8 A and 2. 5 A on all atoms. The side-chain conformations of Val and Leu at the helical interface were well reproduced (1. 2 A <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.),</b> and the large side-chain misplacements occurred with {{only a small number of}} charged amino acids and a tyrosine. Inclusion of the crystal environment (C 2 symmetry), as a passive background, into the side-chain conformational search further improved the accuracy of the model to an <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> deviation of 2. 1 A. Conformational searches carried out in the two different crystal environments and employing the AMBER protein/DNA forcefield, as implemented in CONGEN, gave the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> values of 2. 2 A (for the C 2 symmetry) and 2. 5 A (for the P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1) symmetry).

40|$|Surface {{granular}} flow, comprising {{granular material}} flowing {{on the surface}} of a heap of the same material, occurs in several industrial and natural systems. The rheology of such a flow was investigated by means of measurements of velocity and number-density profiles in a quasi-two-dimensional rotating cylinder, half-filled with a model granular material - monosize spherical stainless-steel particles. The measurements were made at the Centre of the cylinder, where the flow is fully developed, using streakline photography and image analysis. The stress profile was computed from the number-density profile using a force balance which takes into account wall friction. Mean-velocity and root-mean-square (<b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.)</b> -velocity profiles are reported for different particle sizes and cylinder rotation speeds. The profiles for the mean velocity superimpose when distance is scaled by the particle diameter d and velocity by a characteristic shear rate gamma(C) = [g sin(beta(m) - beta(s)) /d cos beta(s) ] 1 / 2 and the particle diameter, where beta(m) is the maximum dynamic angle of repose and beta(s) is the static angle of repose. The maximum dynamic angle of repose is found to vary with the local flow rate. The scaling is also found to work for the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity profiles. The mean velocity is found to decay exponentially with depth in the bed, with decay length lambda = 1. 1 d. The <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity shows similar behaviour but with lambda = 1. 7 d. The <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity profile shows two regimes: near the free surface the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity is nearly constant and below a transition point it decays linearly with depth. The shear rate, obtained by numerical differentiation of the velocity profile, is not constant anywhere in the layer and has a maximum which occurs at the same depth as the transition in the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity profile. Above the transition point the velocity distributions are Gaussian and below the transition point the velocity distributions gradually approach a Poisson distribution. The shear stress increases roughly linearly with depth. The variation in the apparent viscosity eta with <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity u shows a relatively sharp transition at the shear-rate maximum, and in the region below this point the apparent viscosity eta similar to u(- 1. 5). The measurements indicate that the flow comprises two layers: an upper low-viscosity layer with a nearly constant <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity and a lower layer of increasing viscosity with a decreasing <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> velocity.

Recent diagnostics obtained from numerical geodynamo models indicate that the magnitude of the dipole field at the surface of a fluid dynamo is about ten times weaker than the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> field strength in its interior, which would yield an intensity of the order of several millitesla within the Earth's core. However, a 60 -year signal found in the variation in the length of day has long been associated with magneto-hydrodynamic torsional waves carried by a much weaker internal field. According to these studies, the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> strength of the field in the cylindrical radial direction (calculated for all length scales) is only 0. 2 mT, a figure even smaller than the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> strength of the large-scale (spherical harmonic degree n<= 13) field visible at the core-mantle boundary. Here we reconcile numerical geodynamo models with studies of geostrophic motions in the Earth's core that rely on geomagnetic data. From an ensemble inversion of core flow models, we find a torsional wave recurring every six years, the angular momentum of which accounts well for both the phase and the amplitude of the six-year signal for change in length of day detected over {{the second half of the}} twentieth century. It takes about four years for the wave to propagate throughout the fluid outer core, and this travel time translates into a slowness for Alfvén waves that corresponds to a <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> field strength in the cylindrical radial direction of approximately 2 mT. Assuming isotropy, this yields a <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> field strength of 4 mT inside the Earth's core...|$|R
