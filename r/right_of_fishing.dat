5000|$|The {{states and}} {{citizens}} of Maryland and Virginia had long disputed who had rights to {{fish in the}} mouth of the Pocomoke River (known as [...] "Pocomoke Sound") where it emptied into Chesapeake Bay. Maryland occupied the sound's northern side, while Virginia occupied its southern side. In 1785, the two states entered into a compact, which declared Pocomoke Sound, the Potomac River (which they also shared as a common border), and the Chesapeake Bay a common waterway, and each state pledged not to interfere with the other's water-borne traffic via tax, duty, prohibition, or restraint. The seventh clause of the Compact of 1785 provided that [...] "the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> in the [...] shall be common to and equally enjoyed by the citizens of both states, provided that such common right be not exercised by the citizens of the one state to the hindrance or disturbance of the fisheries on the shores of the other state, and that the citizens of neither state shall have a right to fish with nets or seines on the shores of the other." [...] The eighth clause addressed both the Potomac and Pocomoke Rivers, and provided that all [...] "laws and regulations which may be necessary for the preservation of fish, or for the performance of quarantine in the River Potowmack, or for preserving and keeping open the channel and navigation thereof, or of the River Pocomoke, within the limits of Virginia, by preventing the throwing out ballast or giving any other obstruction thereto, shall be made with the mutual consent and approbation of both states." [...] Under the compact's tenth clause, crimes committed on these common waterways were to be tried thusly: Virginians committing offenses against Marylanders should be tried in Maryland courts, Marylanders committing offenses against Virginians should be tried in Virginian courts, and citizens of neither state committing crimes against either Marylanders or Virginians should be tried in Virginian courts.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{historical}} survey sweeps {{across a}} thousand years, divided into five very unequal stages. Over {{most of the}} stages property in tide-water fisheries was lost. Fishers {{lost control of the}} fishstock and of the markets they served. Governments responded with fishing regulations, which have served as a basis for regaining property rights. These reforms have been allowing fishermen once again to take control of their own fishstocks and to tailor management {{to the demands of the}} market. In the first of my five stages, around the Norman Conquest, most English fishing was in rivers, using fixed gear. Grants of tidal fisheries had also been common. But from AD 1215 there followed centuries of the “public <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing.</b> ” But this was an age of mercantilism. Some privacy was protected by charter, monopoly and very local regulations. It is not realised today that al...|$|E

40|$|As {{interest}} in the potential of shellfish aquaculture increases nationwide {{in the next several}} years, conflicts over access to and use of the intertidal zone undoubtedly will increase as well. In Massachusetts and Maine these conflicts {{are likely to be more}} pronounced because of an atypical division of public and private rights and responsibilities in that zone. In contrast to most other areas of the country, where the state owns title to land between the high and low water marks, Massachusetts and Maine riparian property owners hold title in fee down to the low water mark. That grant of title, however, originally conveyed under the Colonial Ordinance of 1641 - 47, is subject to public rights of fishing, fowling, and navigation. As a result, clam aquaculture, which must be conducted within the intertidal zone, will test the boundaries of public rights as they are currently understood in those states. In two recent cases, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court addressed the issue of private and public rights in the intertidal zone as related to clam aquaculture. In Town of Wellfleet v. Glaze, the court held that the superior court lacked the authority to enjoin a defendant littoral property owner from mooring his boats on an aquaculture site. Although the majority did not address the issue of whether aquaculture should be construed as within the public <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing,</b> a concurring justice wrote: “[The right to fish cannot reasonably be construed to include the right to plant, cultivate, and propagate fish on the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s tidal fiats. ” This pronouncement was given the force of law eight years later in Pazolt v. Director of the Division of Marine Fisheries, when the court held that aquaculture could not be conducted on the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s intertidal property without her permission. These cases raise important questions about the decision-making authority of state legislatures in Massachusetts and Maine and the role that aquaculture can play in the conservation of the clamming industry in these states. This Comment will address three topics. It will begin with a discussion of the Pazolt decision in detail, examining three problems in the analysis the court employed. It will then review the respective roles the legislatures and judiciary have played in defining public rights in the intertidal zone in both states. Finally, it will consider the potential for conflict over tidal lands in Maine and suggest a means of mitigating that concern. In the process, this Comment will argue that the legal framework pertaining to aquaculture in Maine is distinguishable from that of Massachusetts, making the holding of Pazolt inapplicable in this state...|$|E
40|$|An anti-British satire, {{reflecting}} American enragement at Britain's {{tightening of}} restrictions on territorial waters open to American fishermen {{off the coast}} of Canada. In July 1852, England notified the United States of its intention, contrary to previous understandings, to curtail American fishing within a three-mile limit of the Canadian provinces, and to close off the Gulf of St. Lawrence and much of the Bay of Fundy altogether. This threat to their fishing industry was particularly alarming to Americans in the northeastern United States. Clay's cartoon features a stout figure of John Bull (center) draped with lines of fish, confronted by Brother Jonathan near the home of an unemployed fisherman. Jonathan holds out a document "Treaty of Ghent. <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> in the Bay of Fundy" toward John Bull, and snarls, "Why consarn you, you tarnal old critter, looke'e here, you wont deny your own hand writin will you [...] And haven't we been fishin in the Bay for thirty years without any muss [...] I want to know [...] Du tell?" John Bull replies, "Don't talk to me about treaties and rights! When did I ever keep a treaty when it suited me to break it? and as to other peoples rights, they may look out for themselves, I can take care of my own!" To the right of John Bull stand a gentleman and frontiersman. The gentleman holds his nose, commenting on the Englishman's scent, "A very ancient and fish like smell! About as musty as his claim for the Navigation of the Mississippi:" The frontiersman wears buckskins and a coonskin cap, and holds a long rifle. He expounds, "May I be kicked to death by grasshoppers if he aint the greediest old shark I ever saw. By the Eternal! as the old General [i. e., Andrew Jackson] used to say, he'll want another New-Orleans lesson!" On the left, a sailor sits forlorn near the door to his cottage, his wife and child consoling him. His nets are hung out. He laments, "There goes my poor old fishing smack; taken by that d [...] d Britisher [...] All I can do, Sally, is to go on board a man [of] war, and pay them back in bullets!"

(2) The survey shows the present operational systems <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels are: 58 % of them belong to shareholding cooperative system, 23 % belong to individual ownership system, the rest 9 %, 8 %, 1 %, 1 % belong to fishermen’s cooperative system, leasehold systems, company system and partnership system respectively. (3) This gradual market-oriented transition process {{is a process of}} privatization <b>of</b> property <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels.

Specifically, the shareholding cooperative system, which was piloted in the middle eighties of the 20 th century and promoted in the large-scale in the middle nineties, well suited the economic development level <b>of</b> the <b>fishing</b> villages <b>of</b> that period, contributed to the breakthrough of financial limits of fishermen within relatively short period of time, made relatively clear the property <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishing</b> vessels, and promoted the rapid development of the fishery economy in this region.
