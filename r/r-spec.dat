50|$|When Car and Driver took a 2013 Genesis Coupe 3.8 <b>R-Spec</b> to Virginia International Raceway for its yearly Lightning Lap time trial, they {{posted a}} time of 3:13.9 around VIR's Grand West configuration, 0.1 second slower than the 306-hp 2011 Genesis Coupe 3.8 <b>R-Spec</b> and slower than the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Ford Mustang V6, Chevrolet Cobalt SS and Nissan NISMO 370Z. They were {{unsettled}} by its tendency to power oversteer, and its brake fade.|$|E
50|$|The Track trims {{combine the}} enthusiast <b>R-spec</b> {{features}} with the Premium / Grand Touring features. In addition, the trims further add HID headlights, fog lights, and rear spoiler.|$|E
50|$|The <b>R-spec</b> 2.0T is {{a version}} of the Genesis Coupe 2.0T Track with fewer factory options, {{resulting}} in it being 68 pounds lighter than the 2.0T Base/Premium models.|$|E
50|$|In some {{countries}} Hyundai Genesis Coupe {{will also be}} sold as Hyundai Genesis <b>R-Spec,</b> which comes with both the 3.8-liter and 2.0T engine and features some sport-oriented options.|$|E
50|$|US {{model was}} {{released}} as 2012 model year vehicle. Engine choices include 3.8 Lambda GDi, 4.6 Tau MPi (390PS), 5.0 Tau GDi for <b>R-Spec.</b> The transmission {{was changed to}} 8-speed automatic with SHIFTRONIC.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} performance, the Rally Edition has no {{difference}} in performance characteristics to its standard Turbo counterpart. The Rally Edition does feature a retuned suspension, and calibrated driver selectable power-steering (the same as the <b>R-Spec)</b> for stiffer steering response.|$|E
5000|$|... 4 limited editions GT's were {{released}} during the FG series, the first being the GT 5th Anniversary, celebrating 5-years {{since the start}} of FPV. The [...] "Black Edition" [...] followed, and the <b>R-Spec</b> and GT-F arriving in the MkII update.|$|E
5000|$|The Yamaha Bolt (also {{known as}} Star Bolt and XV950) is an entry level cruiser and café racer {{motorcycle}} introduced in 2013 as a 2014 model. It has a 58-cubic-inch (942cc) air cooled 4-stroke, 4-valve SOHC V-twin engine. An optional <b>R-Spec</b> model has reservoir shocks. The 2015 Yamaha Bolt, C-Spec and <b>R-Spec</b> were released in July 2014. In 2015 the XV950SCR (Scrambler) was released and the C Spec model was {{dropped from the}} lineup.The Bolt is very well supported by the aftermarket and {{has proven to be}} a very customizable platform, lending itself well to the bobber, chopper, brat and scrambler styles among others. In addition to the large aftermarket companies several smaller companies are also marketing a wide range of parts for these bikes.|$|E
5000|$|The FPV GT <b>R-spec</b> is a {{range of}} {{enhanced}} FPV vehicles characterised by an upgraded handling package fitted to the standard GT and F6 Typhoon models. At {{the time of its}} production, the FG-based GT [...] "R-spec" [...] was the quickest Australian production car ever produced.|$|E
5000|$|Motor Trend was {{critical}} of the revised 2.0T <b>R-Spec,</b> placing it last in a comparison test between it, a Ford Mustang V6, a Volkswagen Golf GTI, a Scion FR-S, a Subaru BRZ, and a Mazda MX-5 Miata. They praised its smooth ride and extra power, but criticized its [...] "peaky power delivery", vague shifter and interior ambience.|$|E
5000|$|Reception to {{the revised}} Genesis Coupe has been mixed. Edmunds praised the 3.8 <b>R-Spec</b> as [...] "the most {{interesting}} car that Hyundai makes". They also praised the improved transmission, uprated engine and more balanced suspension, but lamented [...] "we {{could get into}} a V6-equipped Mustang or Camaro for less money". They also criticized the slow-moving tachometer and the brief loss of power after high-rpm upshifts.|$|E
5000|$|... 300 R Spec model Typhoons were {{produced}} in 2007, these had different Ardent Dark Silver colour accents on wheels and spoilers, leather upholstery, R spec floor mats, Brembo 4-pot front brakes, ten of these <b>R-Spec</b> Typhoons were exported by Ford Australia into Ford New Zealand, of that ten, one was {{fitted with a}} 6-speed manual transmission and the other nine were equipped with 6-speed automatic transmissions.|$|E
5000|$|FPV {{released}} the track focused {{version of the}} <b>R-spec</b> in 2012, using the current GT with its 335 kW/570Nm supercharged 5.0-litre V8 engine, creating Australia’s fastest accelerating production car.5 It is {{seen by many as}} the spiritual successor the famed [...] "HO" [...] series of GT's, that ended with the Ford XY Falcon GT. Ford (FPV) however, is reluctant to use the [...] "HO" [...] tag on a modern-day equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2011 Melbourne motor show, FPV {{displayed}} the [...] "FLPV concept" [...] (commonly {{known as the}} [...] "Black Edition"), based on the just released supercharged 335kW GT series. It featured an all-black appearance, and a unique front bumper and staggered wheel design at the time considered to be available on future FPV products. However, these failed to make an appearance, with only the use of wider rear wheels making the <b>R-spec</b> and GT-F limited editions.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, FPV {{presented}} the GT [...] "Black" [...] at the Sydney Motorshow,. The car featured {{not only a}} new look but wheels and suspension changes. The car that went on sale unfortunately {{was reduced to a}} simple blacked out paint job and a new matte black strip kit. It wasn't until the <b>R-Spec</b> arrived a year later that the concept changes started to appear.In 2012 FPV released codename [...] "Panther", a new track-focused [...] "GT R-Spec", using the current [...] "GT" [...] with its 335 kW/570Nm supercharged 5.0-litre V8 engine, in so doing creating Australia’s fastest accelerating production car. Although rated at 335 kW, actual engine outputs were closer to 420 kW, with many production models running up 330 kW at the rear wheels when dyno-tested. For many enthusiasts, this GT [...] "R-Spec" [...] is seen as the spiritual successor of the original [...] "GT-HO" [...] models that ended with the 1971 Ford XY Falcon GT. Ford (and FPV), however, have always remained reluctant to recycle the [...] "HO" [...] nameplate on its modern-day products. The GT <b>R-Spec</b> is still the fastest ever Australian produced Ford over the 1/4mile.|$|E
5000|$|The GT-F 351 {{marked the}} end for the Ford Falcon GT / FPV GT model lines, the [...] "F" [...] {{standing}} for Final, and [...] "351" [...] paying homage to Falcon GTs of the 1960s and 1970s. It features a retuned version of the Coyote 5.0 litre V8 to produce 351kW of power, with over 400kW available through over-boost when the conditions allow, the GT-F also gain's the handling upgrades from the <b>R-spec.</b> The exterior is identified through black highlights on the mirrors, spoiler and door handles, {{as well as a}} unique stripe package including a stripe running {{over the top of the}} car.|$|E
5000|$|A raft {{of changes}} {{included}} a launch control system, stiffer engine and transmission mounts and retuned suspension. The suspension gained stiffer {{upper control arm}} bushes, stiffer upper strut mounts and retuned dampers at the front, with the rear gaining higher spring rates, retuned dampers, a larger anti-roll bar and reinforced lower control arms. The rear also gained a 9-inch wider wheel package shod with 275/35 R19 tyres and revised toe-link settings. This [...] "R-Spec" [...] also ended up being a louder car than the regular GT and GT-P despite no particular changes to that effect. The <b>R-Spec</b> split public and owners on not only looks but the package as well. For {{the first and only}} time Ford/FPV produced a car with major changes in drive and handling. Many existing FPV owners were quick to down play what was actually quiet a good package which significantly improved drive and performance.|$|E

5000|$|Presented in June 2014, the GT-F 351 is {{the last}} ever Falcon-based GT sedan and last FPV model (along with the Pursuit Ute), with a total {{production}} of 500 reserved for Australia at $77,990 and another 50 for New Zealand. Its nomenclature was chosen to mean [...] "F" [...] for final whereas [...] "351" [...] is this GT-F's engine output in kW {{as well as a}} homage to the iconic 351 cuin L engine capacity of the 1970s GT Falcon (XW to XB series). Mechanically, the GT-F features launch control, standard Brembo six-piston front and four-piston rear brakes, the suspension and 275/35 R19 Dunlop Sports Maxx 9in rear tyre package from the limited edition GT <b>R-spec</b> and a retuned version of the supercharged Coyote [...] "Miami" [...] 5.0 L V8 (embossed [...] "GT-F 351" [...] instead of [...] "Boss 335") developing a minimum of [...] of power (or, depending on prevailing conditions, over [...] for 15-20 seconds thanks to a transient overboost function) but an unchanged 570 Nm of torque that is, however, available across a broader range. Inside, the GT-F is characterised by darker finishes, orange accents throughout (e.g. trim stitching, instrument facia and GT-F seat embroiding) and a build number plate complemented by a certificate. The exterior features stealth or black accents (specifically, the headlight and foglight bezels are black, as are the external mirrors, door handles, rear spoiler and diffuser, alloy wheels) and a unique GT-F stripe package (including over the roof of the car) that is available in different colours depending on exterior paints, which are Winter White, Silhouette (black), Kinetic (blue), Octane (orange) and Smoke (grey).|$|E

We {{consider the}} problem of whether there exists one optimal strategy at the smoother which minimizes the playback delay and the receive buffer size, given the traffic envelope σ and the service curve β. We show that there does exist such an optimal smoothing, and give an explicit representation for it. We also obtain a simple expression for the smallest playback delay and playback buffer size which can be achieved over all possible smoothing and playback strategies. We show that the computation of optimal smoothing and minimum playback delay do not depend on the past. We show that separate delay equalization is optimal in the CBR case, but not otherwise. We also apply the theory to the analysis of which T-SPEC should be requested by a source-destination pair, given some playback delay and buffer constraint, and given the path characteristics advertised in RSVP PATH messages...|$|E
