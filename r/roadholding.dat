25|$|The U13 Bluebird was {{introduced}} in New Zealand in early 1993, and was produced at Nissan's assembly plant in South Auckland from CKD packs imported from Japan until 1997, when it {{was replaced by the}} Primera. The model came in for lots of praise for its handling <b>roadholding,</b> with some models benefitting from the Attesa's passively steered rear wheels. New Zealand models were; S (base model, not available until later), SE (mid-spec), SES (sport) and SEL (luxury). Several versions of the sedan, including the first local Bluebird to have standard factory-fitted air conditioning (automatic climate control in this case) and optional locally supplied leather upholstery. At launch, some local motoring writers criticised Nissan NZ's decision to fit luxury equipment items instead of airbags in top versions but the company insisted there was not yet sufficient retail or fleet buyer demand.|$|E
500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon {{was a little bit}} quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't think I could have caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. What can you do in these conditions? Okay, the car's <b>roadholding</b> is not bad. We must work very hard now. But at least I finished, that's something." ...|$|E

5000|$|Its [...] "chassis and {{suspension}} provide suitable {{handling and}} <b>roadholding</b> on all routes" [...] during travels.|$|E
50|$|When first introduced, it was {{relatively}} rare for British cars to have independently sprung rear wheels, most production cars {{of the time}} using live axles. Independent suspension systems offer the advantage of lower unsprung weight to improve <b>roadholding,</b> and when properly designed, the ability to maintain the roadwheels perpendicular to the road surface during cornering {{and in response to}} uneven road surfaces, further improving <b>roadholding.</b> The reduction in transfer of vertical undulations in road surface to the vehicle body also provides a smoother ride.|$|E
50|$|The M Series was {{regarded}} by contemporary reviewers as being loud and fast and having excellent <b>roadholding.</b> This {{came at the}} expense of unusual ergonomics, and heating and ventilation systems that were sometimes problematic.|$|E
50|$|The car had all-round {{independent}} suspension by coil springs {{and in spite}} of the tiny engine gave remarkably good performance owing to its light weight (kerb weight 605 lb) and excellent <b>roadholding.</b> Girling hydraulic brakes with 7 in drums were used.|$|E
5000|$|The Infiniti EX35 {{produces}} 0-60 mph {{times of}} 5.8 - 6.2 seconds. The quarter mile is 14.6 seconds at 98 mi/h km/h, and top speed (Gov. limit) is 144 mi/h km/h. 70 mi/h km/h - 0 braking is a 166 ft. <b>Roadholding</b> is [...]83g.|$|E
5000|$|The 1992 {{edition of}} the Daily Mail Motor review, edited by Michael Kemp {{described}} the styling as [...] "modern but sometimes awkward." [...] The [...] "high speed <b>roadholding</b> is disappointing", but the XM was a [...] "well equipped and comfortable luxury car with fine engine options." ...|$|E
50|$|Michelin {{therefore}} {{decided to}} introduce the world's first tire and roadwheel system, where the two were designed together. This would enable both lower sidewall height, (for better <b>roadholding)</b> whilst retaining comfort due to better stress distribution within the tire, enabled by the redesigned wheel rim and tire bead.|$|E
50|$|Further {{modifications}} to the suspension a year later included 'recambering the rear springs' to improve ride and <b>roadholding,</b> but from the outside {{there was little to}} distinguish the later Rileys from the models as they had appeared in 1959, and the car continued very little changed until its withdrawal in 1969.|$|E
50|$|The new {{powertrain}} {{gives the}} 2015 WRX a different character than the car it replaces, but its acceleration times are virtually unchanged. The biggest performance gains {{come from the}} 2015 redesigned chassis. Structural stiffness and spring rates are up 40 to 60 percent, raising <b>roadholding</b> numbers by about 0.80 G.|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} Director of GMH Engineering, George Roberts {{had insisted}} that the Statesman have a high standard of ride comfort (at the expense of ultimate <b>roadholding).</b> (Roberts previously had been the Chief Engineer of the GM Cadillac Division). Prior to HZ, the Statesman's Cadillac style of ride was not to everyone's taste.|$|E
50|$|Expedition Platinum {{averaged}} 39.2 mph in a 610 ft slalom run {{and pulled}} 0.78g in <b>roadholding</b> skidpad testing. High speed emergency braking from 70 mph to 0 (full stop) {{was completed in}} 170 ft. In comparison, the Expedition's main rival took a full 10 feet longer, completing the same emergency brake test in 180 ft.|$|E
5000|$|Valiant and Regal sedans also {{benefited from}} the 1978 {{introduction}} of Radial Tuned Suspension (code-named ME II) in response to Holden's having marketed their suspension as particularly suited to radial tyres. RTS improved the car's handling and <b>roadholding</b> significantly, and [...] "Modern Motor" [...] magazine proclaimed that the Valiant offered a better drive than the Holden.|$|E
5000|$|Although its {{performance}} figures on paper {{were a little}} underwhelming, the testers were impressed with the roominess and <b>roadholding</b> of the Austin 2200. They found it quiet and comfortable, the driving position in particular representing a vast improvement over the car's predecessor. They mentioned in passing that the boot/trunk on the test car [...] "leaked slightly", but did not labour the point.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Pellandine marketed an all-new {{version of}} his Pelland Sports in 1989. It also used a GRP {{monocoque}} but with bespoke double-wishbone suspension and a mid-mounted Alfa Romeo Alfasud powertrain. It was available in both roadster and coup√© versions with traditional-style doors, rather than the gullwings of earlier projects. The car's <b>roadholding</b> was described as [...] "superb" [...] by Kitcars International magazine.|$|E
50|$|In the event, however, he was proven wrong, as the Oka's overall {{acceptable}} {{operating characteristics}} and low price resulted in some 700,000 examples rolling off {{the assembly line}} over a period of nearly two decades. During test drives on roads and in the Caucasus Mountains the car proved to have good handling, <b>roadholding</b> and, surprisingly for a vehicle of its size, excellent off-road capabilities.|$|E
50|$|On {{return to}} Australia in 1968, {{he started his}} own company, Bowin Designs Pty. Ltd., which {{designed}} and built racing cars for sale in Australia. Fifty-six cars were built in total between 1968 and 1976. During this period, he carried out several projects for Ford Motor Company and Leyland Motors on suspension design, to improve <b>roadholding</b> of Ford Falcon, Ford Escort and Leyland Marina cars.|$|E
50|$|A {{suspension}} lift is a modification, often done by Jeep, truck, SUV and offroad enthusiasts {{to raise}} the ride height of their vehicle. Suspension lifts (also referred to as lift kits or leveling kits) enable steeper approach, departure, and breakover angles, higher ground clearance, and helps accommodate larger wheels and tires. Due to the raised center of gravity, maximum safe operating angles are reduced and <b>roadholding</b> is often significantly impaired with a lift kit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{suspension}} system gave the 4200 pound (1900 kg) car {{the benefits of}} a both a smooth ride and handling that allowed it, in the words of automotive journalist David E. Davis, to be [...] "tossed about like a Mini." [...] The car also featured a model W3B 050 three-speed automatic transmission unique to the 6.9 and a standard ZF limited slip differential both for enhanced <b>roadholding</b> performance on dry pavement and enhanced traction in inclement weather.|$|E
5000|$|... 1998 {{also saw}} {{the launch of the}} Probe's replacement: the Cougar. Like its predecessor, the Cougar was built in America and used 2.0 and 2.5 petrol engines. Unlike its predecessor, it was based on the front-wheel drive chassis of the Mondeo. It was very spacious for a coupe, and offered superb <b>roadholding</b> and {{cruising}} ability. Sales were relatively low in Europe and it was dropped in Europe after 2000, with sales limited to its home market.|$|E
50|$|The Jensen 541S was Jensen Motors luxury GT {{model of}} the Jensen 541 series with wider track. Four inches wider than the 541R the {{increase}} allowed the new car's interior to be roomier and improved the <b>roadholding.</b> It was announced in mid-October 1960. The 541S had a conventional radiator grill (as opposed to the flap of the 541) {{to allow for the}} extra heat given by a proposed new V8 engine, and a Salisbury limited slip differential for the extra torque demanded.|$|E
5000|$|Highway mileage was {{improved}} from 19 mpg to 21 to 22 mpg {{with the}} addition of Active Fuel Management cylinder deactivation. For 2009, the 6.2 L engine in the Yukon Denali got a power increase to , while a [...] 6.2 L was added as an option for the Tahoe LTZ. A 6-speed 6L80 automatic transmission replaced the 4-speed on all trucks except 2WD models with the 4.8 L engine. The 2011 model has a NHTSA rollover risk of 24.6%, and a lateral <b>roadholding</b> of 0.79g.|$|E
5000|$|The next Mantis, the {{four-seater}} M70, {{was launched}} in 1970 and had a fuel-injected 2.5-litre Triumph TR6 six-cylinder injected engine mated to a four-speed gearbox. The promotional brochure says the styling [...] "gives high all round visibility", and [...] "a low centre of gravity together with an extremely wide track ensures superb <b>roadholding.</b> The luxurious interior seats four in comfort, and the boot, with a capacity of 10 cubic feet, makes the Mantis ideal {{for the man who}} is going places and wants to travel in style." ...|$|E
50|$|Performance numbers {{vary from}} {{publication}} to publication. Testing from Car and Driver, Road & Track and Motor Trend has produced 0-60 mph {{times as fast}} as 4.8 seconds and as slow as 5.5 seconds. It runs the quarter-mile anywhere from 13.6 sec @ 102 mph to 14.0 sec @ 98 mph. (CVT-equipped WRXs are about a half-second slower to 60 mph and through the quarter-mile.) On the skidpad, <b>roadholding</b> numbers range from 0.92 G to 0.96 G. Braking from 70 mph results in stops as short as 156-166 feet.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1975 Car {{magazine}} {{tested the}} 604 against the BMW 528 and Jaguar XJ 3.4. The test concluded the 604 was faster at cornering than the BMW 528 and was quieter and more comfortable. Car viewed the 604s <b>roadholding</b> {{the equal of}} the Jaguar in the dry and superior in wet conditions and, as a limousine, was more successful than the Jaguar. Car concluded that [...] "the Jaguar is still a brilliant car, but in some respects Peugeot have managed to better it. And that takes some doing".|$|E
5000|$|The 'S' prefix letter has {{signified}} Audi's sporting high-performance {{production models}} {{since the early}} 1990s. The S4 was the high-performance version of the Audi 100 saloon, and was known originally as the Audi 100 S4. It featured a 20-valve, 5-cylinder turbocharged engine and quattro permanent four-wheel drive, providing outstanding traction and <b>roadholding</b> in all weathers. Befitting its status {{at the top of}} the Audi 100 series, it was luxuriously appointed and featured as standard a lot of equipment that was optional on lesser models. The car was available in saloon/sedan and Avant (estate/wagon) versions.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, the British auto {{magazine}} The Autocar {{tested a}} 1959 model whose odometer showed 27124 mi, and recorded a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù cruising speed of 60 mph, ‚Äúfairly high‚Äù oil consumption of 125 miles per pint, ‚Äúadequately good‚Äù <b>roadholding,</b> ‚Äúpronounced understeer‚Äù in cornering, ‚Äúgood directional stability,‚Äù ‚Äúdecidedly vague steering,‚Äù a turning circle that was ‚Äústately {{for such a}} small car,‚Äù brakes that were ‚Äúeffective,‚Äù and remarked on the ‚Äúunnecessarily high position of the steering-wheel,‚Äù which interfered with the driver‚Äôs view of the road. The test car accelerated from 0-60 mph in 22.4 seconds, and its time for the standing-start quarter-mile was 21.9 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Tested by Autocar in late 1929 the car seemed {{capable of}} a 70 mph top speed though weather {{conditions}} prohibited a formal measurement. The engine's smoothness was fine except under load at speeds below 20 mph in top gear. The car seemed geared for speed and not fuel economy. The single wiper was mounted {{at the foot of}} the windscreen to provide the widest possible view. The steering column was nearer horizontal than usual. <b>Roadholding</b> was fair but springing when with two persons aboard needs further adjustment of the shock absorbers. The style of the body is original and to many people attractive.|$|E
5000|$|The final major update {{arrived in}} 1961 with the A110 Westminster. This version had an {{extended}} (by 2 in/51 mm) wheelbase, which allowed more {{space in the}} rear compartment as well as improving the <b>roadholding,</b> a floor-mounted gear lever. 13 in wheels were substituted in 1964's Mark II models. Wolseley produced a 6/110 version, {{and there was a}} Vanden Plas Princess Mark II with the C-Series engine, now uprated to [...] The same basic body was also used for a Rolls Royce-engined Vanden Plas Princess 4 Litre R, and the body even formed part of a prototype Bentley.|$|E
50|$|It was a water-cooled, {{front wheel}} drive design in a {{hatchback}} body style. It featured firmly sprung and damped, independent MacPherson strut front suspension and semi-independent twist-beam rear suspension, that gave crisp handling and good <b>roadholding,</b> without being too uncomfortable. A very important model was the Golf Diesel, which appeared in late 1976. This was remarkable in how unremarkable it was, with performance {{very similar to that}} of a petrol 1100. The 1.5-litre engine used the petrol engine's crankshaft, bearings, and connecting rods, combined with the recently discontinued 1471 cc cast-iron engine block. As with the Golf GTi, the Golf Diesel more or less created a new class of car.|$|E
5000|$|While the derated Traction avant 4 {{cylinder}} {{engine and}} the unsophisticated 3 speed gearbox (non syncromesh on first gear) only gave a modest {{top speed of}} just under 100 km/h, the chassis and suspension layout provided remarkable <b>roadholding</b> qualities, specially on the short wheelbase version: Low slung chassis, engine and drivetrain well behind the front wheels axles, with very little overhangs, combined with sophisticated totally independent suspensions (the front ones used double torsion bars instead of conventional coil springs) were features scarcely found on period passenger cars. Like the contemporary Citro√´n 2 CV, the H type van could often be driven [...] "pedal to the metal" [...] on winding rural roads.|$|E
5000|$|The US 1983 model Vision fixed {{most of the}} '82's faults, with an {{improved}} carburetor eliminating the stumble, air adjustable front forks firming up the ride and improving the <b>roadholding.</b> A non-optional full fairing, with adjustable hot and cold air vents, effectively shielded the rider. With the improved carburetor and minor internal adjustments, the engine's strengths became apparent: it had enormous torque at all revs, and would pull from idle in top gear. Despite the 10,000 R.P.M. redline, the oversquare bore and short stroke kept the piston speed low, {{with the result that}} the engine always sounded relaxed, even at peak revs. The exhaust note has been compared to that of a Ferrari Testarossa (which came out several years later.) With its unique [...] "hang support" [...] frame, whereby the engine is suspended beneath the frame for lighter weight, the Vision's performance and <b>roadholding</b> were far ahead of its time. Unfortunately, so too was the cost. The motorcycling boom of the Seventies was already receding before the XZ550 hit the showroom floors, and rival motorcycle companies offered cheaper motorcycles without the quirks. The model was discontinued from sale in the U.S. in 1983, though it maintains cult status online. In current times, the XZ550 {{has been found to be}} one of the easiest motorcycles to modify to the owner's personal taste. There are [...] "bobbers", full touring bikes, cafe racers, and general sport bikes in all areas of the world. The online forum for the Vision,www.ridersofvision.net, is a very informative and most complete location for finding repair information, rider help, ride reports and information known to this date.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} by no means silent. Exhaust and tappet noise with a {{continuous}} if subdued howl of pinions all merge with other unidentifiable sounds but there is no suggestion these noises may not be maintained so long as the driver wishes with unflagging regularity for hour after hour. The seat puts the driver up high and its easy to underestimate road speed. It is one thing to go fast in a straight line but quite another to cover a distance at high average speed. This car has truly amazing <b>roadholding,</b> it is high and narrow yet it passes through roundabouts almost as if there were none there. It is the designer's perfect balance of the whole chassis which makes this phenomenon possible.|$|E
5000|$|A {{contemporary}} {{road test}} by Autosport magazine [...] was typical {{in describing the}} [...] "on paper" [...] performance of the 3.8 S-Type as slower than the 3.8-litre Mark 2 but its actual cross-country performance as faster. Despite its extra weight, the S-Type's independent rear suspension allowed it to corner faster than the Mark 2, especially on uneven surfaces. Other benefits ascribed to the rear suspension were better traction and a much smoother ride for rear seat passengers. Some enthusiasts rued {{the loss of the}} Mark 2's [...] "driftability" [...] and noted that the S-Type suffered more body roll during high speed cornering but the consensus was that the S-Type provided significant improvements over the Mark 2 in <b>roadholding,</b> safety and ride comfort.|$|E
