However, compared to dirt roads, all-weather gravel highways are quite expensive to build, as they require front loaders, dump trucks, graders, and <b>roadrollers</b> to provide a base course of compacted earth or other material, sometimes macadamised, covered {{with one or more}} different layers of gravel. Graders are also used to produce a more extreme camber compared to a paved road to aid drainage, as well as to construct drainage ditches and embankments in low-lying areas. Cellular confinement systems can be used to prevent the washboarding effect.|$|E
