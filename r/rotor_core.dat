40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} such as wind, solar, {{geothermal}} and tides have increasingly been used to generate electricity. Among these energy sources wind power has gained enormous attention {{in many parts of}} the world where no fossil fuels exist and energy requirements are highly demanded. The efficiency of wind power mainly depends on wind produced and a generator converting wind power to electricity. The efficiency of a typical wind power generator are usually related with its magnetic performance based on magnetic core geometry. Furthermore, this geometry usually has an effect on flux density distribution hence in some cases the flux overlaps in regions near the corners of the stator and the rotor cores; thereby leading to an increase of magnetic losses and decrease of magnetic performance. In this paper, conventional magnetic core geometry of a directly driven and modular permanent magnet low power generator is reshaped using 2 -D magnetic field analysis and a genetic algorithm method. This has allowed us to obtain improved core geometry on flux distribution especially the magnetic performance of the generator from various aspects. The simulation results have indicated that under no load conditions, flux distribution in optimized stator and <b>rotor</b> <b>cores</b> has slightly been improved with respect to that in conventional stator and <b>rotor</b> <b>cores,</b> in particular, the magnetic flux density in the air gap...|$|R
40|$|The {{distortion}} due to {{the mechanical}} stresses from manufacturing issues and the operation of electrical machines {{are known to have}} adverse effect on the magnetic properties of electrical iron core and {{due to the}} stress dependency of iron core losses, it is therefore imperative that we account for the stresses from the different conditions causing mechanical stresses in a rotating electrical machine. This work presents a 2 -D FE-analysis of the mechanical stresses due to shrink fitting, centrifugal forces and the magnetic forces in a 4 -pole, 3 -phase synchronous reluctance machine at rated frequency of 50 Hz. The stresses due to shrink fitting and centrifugal forces were computed by solid mechanics method, while the stresses due to magnetic forces were computed using both magnetic field method and solid mechanics method. The total mechanical stress distributions from all stress sources were obtained using a weakly coupled approach. It was found that shrink fitting causes a very large tensile stress at the <b>rotor</b> <b>core</b> and compressive stress in most part of the stator yoke, but have almost no effect at the stator teeth. The centrifugal forces also contribute to the total tensile stress of the <b>rotor</b> <b>core.</b> The magnetic forces have the least effect on the total stress distribution of the machine. The combined stresses obtained are mostly tensile at the <b>rotor</b> <b>core</b> and compressive at most part of the stator yoke, while the stator teeth were under low tensile stress due to the magnetic forces. The presence of flux barriers between flux paths at the <b>rotor</b> <b>core</b> causes large stresses to distribute at the bridge between flux barriers near the fit interface. Increase or decrease of the radial interference and/or frequency increases or reduces the total mechanical stress distribution of the machine...|$|E

Direct current (DC), from an external exciter or from a diode bridge mounted on the rotor shaft, produces a magnetic field and energizes the rotating field windings and alternating current energizes the armature windings simultaneously.|$|R

30|$|Due to high performance, high {{efficiency}} and high power density, permanent-magnet (PM) machines {{are becoming more}} and more popular [1 – 3]. Consequently, these devices are currently broadly used in applications as robotics, hybrid vehicles, computer peripherals and so on, see, e.g., [4 – 8]. However, the PM machines suffer by construction from a considerable level of mechanical vibration and acoustic noise. More precisely, the interaction of the air-gap harmonics (stator slot driven) and the magnetomotive force harmonics (magnet driven) produces a high cogging torque (CT). On the other hand, the torque ripple is primarily provoked by the CT and higher harmonics of back-electromotive force (EMF). Also the magnetic saturation in the stator and the <b>rotor</b> <b>cores</b> [9] as well as the controller-induced parasitic torque ripples [10] might further disturb the electromagnetic torque [11].|$|R

40|$|Motors for Dual Clutch Transmission {{system are}} {{required}} to minimize its size because of limited space on transmission. Characteristics, low cost and high productivity are essential to DCT motor for competitiveness of mass production. Hence, concentrated flux type ferrite magnet motor is suggested {{to meet the needs}} of DCT motor. Because concentrated flux type permanent magnet motor has a high torque density, it is possible for ferrite magnet motor to achieve air-gap flux as high as a rare earth magnet motor. The most important thing for the design of concentrated flux type motor is to reduce flux leakage. Increase of magnetic reluctance of flux leakage path is necessary to reduce the flux leakage. Accordingly, segmented <b>rotor</b> <b>core</b> is required for the size reduction of motor. In case of segmented <b>rotor</b> <b>core</b> type, it is necessary to have complex mechanical structure to maintain circular rotor shape and fix to shaft.
