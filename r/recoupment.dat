40|$|ELIMINATION OF STATE NONINDUSTRIAL DISABILITY INSURANCE. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Prohibits state {{involvement}} in nonindustrial disability insurance payments (e. g., wage replacement payments for non-work-related illness, injury or pregnancy).

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Decreased special fund revenues and expenditures in the range of 2 billion to 3 billion annually from eliminating the Disability Insurance Program. A one-time revenue increase of 1. 7 billion from the transfer of the residual balance of the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund to the General Fund.

50|$|<b>Recoupment</b> is the practice, {{common in}} the music industry, of {{claiming}} an advance provided to an artist back from that artist rather than (or, as well as) from related sources.

50|$|If {{the charge}} is not {{substantiated}} by auto-adjudication or receipts, the FSA or HRA provider must recoup the charge and suspend the card until it is recouped.

5000|$|<b>Recoupment.</b> Where {{one person}} {{discharges}} the debt of another, {{he or she}} may be able to sue the debtor and thereby recoup the loss. Historically, this was a quasi-contractual action known as an action for money paid, laid out and expended to the defendant's use.|$|E

50|$|<b>Recoupment</b> deals {{primarily}} involve new artists, {{or those}} without a proven sales history, so selling 200,000 copies would be fairly unusual. More typically, 10,000 or fewer copies are sold {{by a new}} artist.

5000|$|In Exall v Partridge, Mr Exall {{left his}} {{carriage}} on Mr Partridge's property for repair. Partridge's landlord later seized Partridge's coachbuilding shop and the property inside, include Exall's carriage. In order {{to end the}} distress, Exall paid the rent, discharging Partridge's liability to his landlord. Exall then brought an action for money paid to the defendant's use. The Court of King's Bench held that the money could be recovered. Grose J said 'the law implies a promise by the three defendants to repay'. The law now recognises that the implication of a request by Partridge and a promise to pay Exall for the benefit (namely, the discharge of the liability) is fictitious. The case illustrates that one's discharge of a liability of another can constitute an 'enrichment' {{for the purposes of}} the law of unjust enrichment. In modern language, this was a claim for <b>recoupment.</b> Whether the principle underlying <b>recoupment</b> and contribution is 'unjust enrichment' remains a controversial question.|$|E
5000|$|An oligopoly's interdependent pricing {{may provide}} a means for {{achieving}} <b>recoupment,</b> and thus may {{form the basis of}} a primary-line injury claim. Predatory pricing schemes, in general, are implausible, and are even more improbable when they require coordinated action among several firms. They are least likely to occur where, as alleged here, the cooperation among firms is tacit, since effective tacit coordination is difficult to achieve.|$|E

50|$|Outside {{of these}} {{categories}} exist a range of doctrines which also provide restitutionary or analogous remedies. Academic commentators have sought to rationalise these in terms of unjust enrichment, with various degrees of success. It is now generally accepted that unjust enrichment has a part {{to play in the}} doctrine of subrogation. Actions for <b>recoupment</b> (historically speaking, an action for money paid to the defendant's use) and contribution have also been said to reverse unjust enrichment. Certain statutory frameworks providing for restitutionary remedies have been said to rest on the principle of unjust enrichment.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, {{after paying}} out under {{a policy of}} {{indemnity}} insurance, an insurer may be entitled to sue the insured where the insured has already made good his loss. That is, the insurer has a claim against the insured so as {{to ensure that the}} insured does not get double recovery. This situation might arise if, for example, an insured claimed in full under the policy, but then started proceedings against the third party tortfeasor, and recovered substantial damages. Strictly speaking, this is not a case of subrogation; it is a case of <b>recoupment.</b>|$|E
50|$|With <b>recoupment,</b> {{the label}} {{advances}} the band $250,000 as before. As before, the band (or the label, on the band's behalf) spends substantially {{all of the}} advance to produce an album meeting the label's specifications. The album again sells 200,000 copies at $10 each, yielding $2m. The record company takes 100% of the first $250,000 in sales (recouping the $250,000 advance to the band), and 90% of all further sales, as agreed. The band's net is effectively reduced to 0% of the first $250,000 in sales and 10% of the further $1.75m, leaving them {{with a total of}} $175,000.|$|E
