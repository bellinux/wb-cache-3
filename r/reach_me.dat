5|$|When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> {{follows a}} sixth-grade protagonist, Miranda. She {{lives with her}} single mother who has a {{kindhearted}} boyfriend, Richard. Miranda's best friend Sal, whom she has known {{since she was a}} small child, had recently started ignoring Miranda after he had been punched in the stomach by another boy, Marcus.|$|E
5|$|Julianna Helt {{from the}} Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda {{constantly}} wonders how time travel could be possible. In When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me,</b> Marcus helps Miranda {{realize that the}} three old ladies from A Wrinkle in Time lied to Meg by promising they would return five minutes before they left. Marcus explains:"So the garden is where they appear when they get {{home at the end}} of the book. Remember? They land in the broccoli. So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left, like those ladies promised they would, then they would have seen themselves get back. Before they did".|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Miranda, and the laughing man (Marcus). Stead began writing When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> in 2007 after reading {{an article in}} The New York Times gave her {{an idea for a}} novel about traveling in time to save someone's life. The article was about a man who woke up in Denver suffering from amnesia, having forgotten who he was or why he was there. Many people worked with the man to help him regain his memory. Under hypnosis, he spoke about his apparent wife, Penny, and two daughters who died in a car crash. However, when he and Penny reunited, the man found out she was only his fiancée— and they had no children. Upon reading this, Stead wondered if somehow the man had returned to the past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along the way. In addition, the article reminded Stead of a strange old man, called the 'laughing man', who lived near her house as a child.|$|E

5|$|When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> is a Newbery Medal-winning {{science fiction}} and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, {{published}} in 2009. It {{takes place in}} the Upper West Side in New York during 1978 and 1979 and follows the protagonist, Miranda Sinclair. She receives a strange note asking her to record future events and write down the location of her spare key. As the novel progresses, Miranda receives three more notes with requests. The novel contains three story lines— the appearance of Miranda's mom on the game show, The $20,000 Pyramid, Miranda's best friend Sal suddenly not talking with Miranda, and the appearance of a laughing man. Central themes in the novel include independence, redemption and friendship. Stead also wanted to demonstrate the possibilities that she saw in time travel. The author hoped to show her children what New York was like in her childhood, and demonstrate how in an earlier time children were more independent.|$|E
500|$|When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> was {{inspired}} by a newspaper article about a man suffering from amnesia, and by parts of her childhood and her favorite book, A Wrinkle in Time. After completing much of the novel, Stead gave the draft to her editor, Wendy Lamb, who liked it. They expanded on the initial concepts and published When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> on July 14, 2009, under Wendy Lamb Books, an imprint of Random House. The book was well received by critics, who praised its realistic setting and the author's deft handling of small details. The novel has reached the best-seller lists of The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today. In addition to receiving the 2010 Newbery Medal, When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> [...] won several Best Book of the Year awards.|$|E
500|$|When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> is {{classified}} in the science fiction and mystery genres, but includes features of some other genres. Monica Edinger of The New York Times found When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> to be [...] "a hybrid of genres, it is a complex mystery, a work of historical fiction, a school story and one of friendship, with a leitmotif of time travel running through it." [...] Augusta Scattergood of the Christian Science Monitor wondered, [...] "Is When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> science fiction? Time travel? A highly imaginative girl's completely conceived experience? Maybe it's historical fiction. After all, it is set in 1979." [...] According to Mary Quattlebaum of The Washington Post, the novel is of the science fiction and time travel genres. Quattlebaum found that, unlike the usual time travel stories, When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> does not involve [...] "cheesy time travel machines and rock-'em-sock-'em action [...] far surpasses the usual whodunit or sci-fi adventure to become an incandescent exploration of 'life, death, {{and the beauty of}} it all.'" [...] Both Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly found that despite the book's science-fiction devices, the setting was still [...] "firmly rooted in reality." ...|$|E

500|$|First Light {{has been}} made in an {{audiobook}} containing six disks and a length of seven hours and six minutes. The audiobook was released by the Listening Library and read by David Ackroyd and Coleen Marlo for the parts of Peter and Thea, respectively. Kathy Miller from School Library Journal praised the two readers for their performance which [...] "engages listeners, and they are both adept at creating a different voice for each character and moving seamlessly between them". Miller also found the novel useful for starting a discussion on topics such as [...] "political subterfuge and propaganda to global warming". A review from Horn Book Review by Jenifer Brabander praised the easy shifts from American to English accents made by both narrators. Brabander also found the tone given to Thea appropriate and compared the novel to Stead's second work, When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me,</b> feeling that [...] "hough First Light doesn't reach the excellence of Stead's second novel, the Newbery-winning When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me,</b> this audio will nevertheless draw listeners in with its narrators' strong talent".|$|E
500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: she {{wondered}} if she had focused the novel too much on her own personal life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked as an antidote to Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me.</b> Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E
500|$|After Aaliyah's death, the German {{newspaper}} Die Zeit published {{excerpts from}} an interview done shortly before her death, {{in which she}} described a recurring dream: [...] "It is dark in my favorite dream. Someone is following me. I don't know why. I'm scared. Then suddenly I lift off. Far away. How do I feel? As if I am swimming in the air. Free. Weightless. Nobody can <b>reach</b> <b>me.</b> Nobody can touch me. It's a wonderful feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|Stead won {{the annual}} Newbery Medal {{recognizing}} When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> as the year's [...] "most distinguished contribution to American literature for children". The judges chose the novel {{for making the}} small details important to the plot. Chairwoman of the Newbery committee Katie O'Dell felt that [...] "Every scene, every nuance, every word is vital both to character development and the progression of the mystery that really is going to engage readers and satisfy them". The committee was [...] "very excited about this book because it is exceptionally conceived, finely crafted and highly original".|$|E
500|$|The {{audiobook}} adaption of When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> {{was released}} by Listening Library and contains four disks. In praise of Cynthia Holloway's performance of Miranda, M.V.P from Horn Book Magazine stated that her tone [...] "emphasized the novel's interpersonal aspects". The reviewer found it beneficial that the chapter titles {{were added to the}} audio, since they seemed to add more detail about the book, but can be easily skipped over when reading. M.V.P criticized the voicing of Miranda's mom. AudioFile praised Halloway for [...] "a strong reading... makes listeners curious about this story's nonlinear structure" [...] and for managing the different elements of the story.|$|E
500|$|When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> {{takes place}} during the 1978-1979 school year of Miranda, the main character. Stead placed Miranda's home in the Upper West Side, New York City, where Stead grew up. Many parts of the novel explore [...] "the same streets where Stead grew up, and riffs on some of her experiences". Stead was {{inspired}} to use this setting because she moved into an apartment near her childhood home early {{in the development of}} the story. There she had experienced her first independence while exploring the streets, only to find a scary man near her house. Wondering why he was there, Stead later used this encounter as [...] "the anchor as she wrote When You Reach Me".|$|E

500|$|Reviewers praised how Stead {{made every}} small detail matter. Augusta Scattergood of the Christian Science Monitor [...] enjoyed the {{detailed}} work: [...] "The beauty of Stead's writing {{is found in}} the way she weaves subplots and settings together seamlessly. Richard's stolen shoe drops into place. A reference to forbidden grapes is tied up sweetly. Stolen $2 bills? Another part of the enigma explained by the end." [...] Edginer agreed, commenting that despite the small size of the novel compared to other popular books, When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me</b> is a [...] "taut novel, every word, every sentence, has meaning and substance." [...] Publishers Weekly added that even the smallest of details—Miranda's name, her strange habits and why she carries A Wrinkle in Time with her—have a reason for their inclusion {{by the end of the}} novel.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the story, {{the main}} {{character}} Miranda is often reading Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, Stead's favorite book as a child; she read and reread it multiple times. She recalls that L'Engle was the only author she met in her childhood. Stead described the novel as a talisman for Miranda; she included {{it in the first}} draft and planned to remove it, [...] "because you can't just toss A Wrinkle in Time in there casually". Her editor suggested leaving it in if it could be better tied into the story. Stead was aware that she did not want A Wrinkle in Time to have too big an influence on When You <b>Reach</b> <b>Me.</b> Keeping this in mind, she reread A Wrinkle in Time through the perspective of different characters, which enabled her to develop new connections and ideas in her own work.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a [...] "melancholic and mature farewell" [...] to a failed {{relationship}}. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone wrote Rihanna [...] "slow-boiling" [...] interprets the line [...] "What you did to me was a crime". According to Jude Rogers of BBC Music the lyrics of the song hint towards her failed relationship with Brown. A reviewer of Plugged In wrote that the lyrics that allude to this are [...] "And I let you <b>reach</b> <b>me</b> one more time/But that’s enough." [...] According to the reviewer, she later admits that the she was blind by her emotional confusion, [...] "your love ain’t the kind you can keep." [...] Jon Pareless of The New York Times wrote that Rihanna compares her love to a crime scene in the [...] "elegiac" [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] which features the couplet [...] "Prints, pictures and white outlines / Are all that's left {{at the scene of}} a cold case love".|$|E
