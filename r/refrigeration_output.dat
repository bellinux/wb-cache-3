40|$|A {{combined}} {{power and}} refrigeration cycle is proposed, which combines the Rankine cycle and the absorption refrigeration cycle. This combined cycle uses a binary ammonia-water mixture as the working fluid and produces both power output and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output</b> simultaneously {{with only one}} heat source.

40|$|In this study, a new {{combined}} {{power and}} refrigeration cycle is proposed, which combines the Rankine and absorption refrigeration cycles. Using a binary ammonia-water mixture as the working fluid, this combined cycle produces both power and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output</b> simultaneously by employing only one external heat source. In {{order to achieve}} the highest possible exergy efficiency, a secondary turbine is inserted to expand the hot weak solution leaving the boiler. Moreover, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to simulate the thermodynamic properties {{and the relationship between}} the input thermodynamic variables on the cycle performance. It is shown that turbine inlet pressure, as well as heat source and refrigeration temperatures have significant effects on the net power output, <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output</b> and exergy efficiency of the combined cycle. In addition, the results of ANN are in excellent agreement with the mathematical simulation and cover a wider range for evaluation of cycle performance...|$|E
40|$|A solar-powered {{adsorption}} {{air-conditioning system}} {{was designed and}} installed in the green building of Shanghai Research Institute of Building Science. The system contained 150 Â m 2 solar collectors and two adsorption chillers with nominal refrigeration capacity of 8. 5 Â kW. Based on performance characteristics of the adsorption chiller, the operation mode of the solar-powered air-conditioning system was optimized by maintaining a phase shift of 540 Â s between the two adsorption chillers. Thereafter, the whole system realized stable operation by the balance of heat consumption and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output.</b> From June to August of 2005, the solar-powered air-conditioning system continuously ran between 9 : 00 and 17 : 00. The operation performance of the system under representative working condition showed that the average <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output</b> of the solar-powered air-conditioning system was 15. 3 Â kW during an 8 Â h operation and the maximum value exceeded 20 Â kW. Solar fraction for the system in summer was 71. 7 %, which corresponded to the designed cooling load (15 Â kW). Compared with the ambient temperature, it was deduced that solar radiant intensity had a more distinct influence {{on the performance of}} solar-powered air-conditioning system.

40|$|Adsorbents are {{important}} components in adsorption refrigeration. The diameter of an adsorbent {{can affect the}} heat and mass transfer of an adsorber. The effect of particle diameter on effective thermal conductivity was investigated. The heat transfer coefficient of the refrigerant and the void rate of the adsorbent layer can also affect the effective thermal conductivity of adsorbents. The performance of mass transfer in the adsorber is better when pressure drop decreases. Pressure drop decreases with increasing permeability. The permeability of the adsorbent layer can be improved with increasing adsorbent diameter. The effect of adsorbent diameter on <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output</b> power was experimentally studied. Output power initially increases and then decreases with increasing diameter under different cycle time conditions. Output power increases with decreasing cycle time under similar diameters...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{simplified}} two-dimensional computational model {{for studying the}} entropy generation characteristics of thermoacoustic heat exchangers with plane fins is presented. The model integrates the equations of the standard linear thermoacoustic theory into an energy balance-based numerical calculus scheme. Relevant computation results are the spatial distribution of the time-averaged temperature, heat fluxes and entropy generation rates within a channel of a parallel-plate stack and adjoining heat exchangers. For a thermoacoustic device working in the refrigeration mode, this study evidences as a target <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output</b> level can be achieved selecting simultaneously the heat exchangers fin length and fin interspacing for minimum entropy generation and that the resulting configuration {{is a point of}} maximum coefficient of performance. The proposed methodology, when extended to other configurations, {{could be used as a}} viable design tool for heat exchangers in thermoacoustic applications...|$|E
40|$|In {{an era of}} {{heightened}} awareness of energy efficiency and the associated environmental impacts, many industries, worldwide, are exploring ``environmentally friendly`` technologies that provide equivalent or improved performance while reducing or eliminating harmful side effects. The refrigeration and air conditioning industry, due to its reliance on CFCs and HCFCs has invested in research in alternatives to the industry standard vapor compression machines. One alternative technology with great promise is chemical absorption. Absorption chillers offer comparable <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output</b> with reduced SO{sub 2 }, CO{sub 2 }, and NO{sub x} emissions. Additionally, absorption chillers do not use CFCs or HCFCs, refrigerants that contribute to ozone depletion and global warming. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide an introduction for those new to absorption technology as well as a discussion of selected high efficiency cycles and environmental impacts for those familiar with absorption. The introduction will include a brief history of absorption and a description of the basic refrigeration cycle, while the advanced sections will discuss triple-effect technology and a life-cycle or ``systems`` approach to evaluating global warming impacts...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method was}} put forward for {{improving}} the energy efficiency of air-cooled water chiller plant operating on part load conditions. The conventional multiple-chiller plant was proposed to be integrated into one refrigeration cycle, by connecting those separate compressors, condensers and evaporators in parallel, respectively. The integrated multiple-chiller plant uses the electronic expansion valve to control refrigerant flow, achieving variable condensing temperature control. A prototype composed of four reciprocating compressors (including one variable-speed compressor), with total nominal cooling capacity of 120 kW was simulated and experimented. Both the simulative and experimental results indicated that applying this novel energy-saving method, the air-cooled chiller plant could get a significant performance improvement on various part load ratio (PLR) conditions, due to the apparent decrease of condensing temperature and some increase of evaporating temperature. Under the same outdoor temperature of 35 °C, when the PLR decreased from 100 % to 50 %, the COP increased by about 16. 2 % in simulation and 9. 5 % in experiment. Also, the practical <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output</b> ratio of the system was 55 % {{on the condition of}} 50 % PLR. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{adsorption}} refrigeration {{systems are}} attracting much research interest {{because they have}} numerous advantages, such as using low grade thermal energy and being environment friendly. In recent decades many efforts have been put into developing various prototypes. The adsorption refrigeration tube (ART) is one such development. Through better system integration, a module consisting {{of a number of}} individually working ARTs can achieve significant refrigeration capacity, which may solve the vacuum leaking problem that besets large adsorption systems. In order to propose a feasible ART, this thesis undertakes a study of adsorptive properties of three types of activated carbon/methanol working pairs and modelling of the adsorption refrigeration cycle. In this examination of adsorptive properties, three activated carbon samples, Calgon 207 C, 207 EA and WS- 480, were used to test and determine their pressure-temperature-concentration (P−T−x) relationship with methanol as the adsorbate. Based on the experimental data, three adsorption state equations, Langmuir equation, Freundlich equation and Dubinin-Astakov (D-A) equation, were compared in terms of their agreement with experimental data and their format impact on calculating coefficient of performance (COP) and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>output</b> (Qr), if one of the formats was used for presenting experimental data. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to reveal the parameters’ sensitivity to calculation of COP and Qr. It was found in this study that the D-A equation is the best state equation for presenting the adsorptive properties of the tested activated carbon/methanol working pairs in terms of the best agreement of P−T−x correlation and least sensitivities to parameters’ errors. A 1 -D dynamic model was established and validated experimentally, in which a local non-equilibrium treatment and dynamic boundary condition were introduced to the mathematical model. Regarding thermal non-equilibrium treatment, the temperatures of the local solid phase (activated carbon and adsorbed methanol) and local fluid phase were treated separately. Due to this non-equilibrium treatment, i. e. a two temperature treatment, convective heat transfer within the transport pores of activated carbon can be considered in the mathematical model. Moreover, a mathematically defined function was introduced to present the transient pressure process at the beginning of an adsorption process. Using this function, the temperature jump phenomenon can be well predicted by the mathematical model. After the mathematical model had been established and validated, a parametric analysis was conducted using the mathematical model. The effects of the cylindrical activated carbon column’s diameter and evaporating temperature on cycle time, COP and specific cooling power (SCP) were examined. Furthermore, a case study of cycle time optimisation was conducted. Finally, based on the parametric analysis, a practical solution using integrated groups of individual ART was proposed for home or domestic application. A preliminary economics analysis was also conducted to evaluate the potential of this application. Thesis (M. Eng. Sc.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Mechanical Engineering, 201...|$|E
