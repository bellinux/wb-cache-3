5|$|Because Andrew Wilson {{was given}} a death sentence, his case was not <b>reviewable</b> on the same grounds by the Appellate Court, and it went {{directly}} to the Illinois Supreme Court. In April 1987, the Supreme Court overturned Andrew's conviction with a ruling that his confession had been coerced involuntarily from him while under duress. It ordered a new trial.|$|E
5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} <b>reviewable,</b> despite it having been established under prerogative powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law (or the prerogative) rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially <b>reviewable,</b> and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions was unfair, this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable.|$|E
5|$|However, the Attorney-General may not {{consent to}} lend {{his name to}} a relator action. This matter lies entirely within his discretion, and his {{decision}} is not considered <b>reviewable</b> by the courts. In addition, it has been forcefully argued that since the Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor of the executive, it is overly idealistic to expect his consent to an action against the Government. This makes a relator action an uncertain, and hence an unsatisfactory, means of obtaining relief.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{subjective}} test applied in Karam Singh and Lee Mau Seng, {{the exercise of}} discretion by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA is not open to review. The court cannot enquire about the grounds and the facts justifying the executive's decision. In contrast, under the objective test, the exercise of discretion is <b>reviewable</b> by {{a court of law}} and the executive has to satisfy the court that there are objective facts justifying the executive's decision.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all <b>reviewable</b> errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} the {{exercises}} of discretion by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA are <b>reviewable</b> by the courts because the subjective test that had been adopted in the 1969 Malaysian case Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia, which had been adopted locally in 1971 in Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, {{could no longer be}} supported and should be replaced by an objective test. Furthermore, although a court would not question the executive's decision as to what national security required, the court could examine whether the executive's decision was indeed based on national security considerations.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially <b>reviewable</b> by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion– that is, power without legal limits– is contrary to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|E

25|$|The Australian Democrats {{have said}} they will appeal the AEC decision, which under the {{legislation}} is <b>reviewable.</b> However the party does not appear on the AEC Current Register of Political Parties and could not contest the 2016 Federal Election.

25|$|Any {{restraining}} order issued cannot exceed two years. However, an order may be extended before its expiration {{for a further}} period or periods not exceeding two years at a time. Any order made or extended is <b>reviewable</b> by the Minister every 12 months or less, with {{the date of the}} first review being not more than 12 months after the date the order was made or extended. The Minister may at any time revoke any {{restraining order}}.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{concluded}} that, as the sentencer's discretion {{was limited}} in an objective fashion and directed in a <b>reviewable</b> manner, Florida's scheme also adequately narrowed {{the class of}} defendants eligible for the death penalty. The Court noted that Florida's scheme came closest to the Model Penal Code's recommendation of an ideal sentencing scheme, as it used a weighing scheme whereas Georgia's scheme did not, thus allowing for individual sentencing. Thus, Florida's death penalty scheme also complied with the Furman requirements and was thus also approved by the Court.|$|E
25|$|In the July 2 Cases, the Court's {{goal was}} to provide {{guidance}} to states {{in the wake of}} Furman. In Furman only one basic idea could command a majority vote of the Justices: capital punishment, as then practiced in the United States, was cruel and unusual punishment because there were no rational standards that determined when it was imposed and when it was not. The question the Court resolved in these cases was not whether the death sentence imposed on each of the individual defendants was cruel, but rather whether the process by which those sentences were imposed was rational and objectively <b>reviewable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Olsen {{introduced}} the Legislative Transparency Act during the 2012 Legislative Session {{which would have}} required potential legislation to be <b>reviewable</b> online for public viewing at least 72 hours prior to being voted on. Olsen's bill would have stopped the popular practice utilized by Assembly and Senate Democrats where legislation is introduced and passed simultaneously thus nullifying the normal vetting and public review process. This process has been utilized to pass bills with wide ranging and substantial policy effects in recent years. Assembly Democrats defeated the bill in the Elections Committee hearing on a 2-2 vote with 2 committee members abstaining.|$|E
25|$|Tampa Bay {{responded by}} moving {{the ball to the}} Oakland 9-yard line on their ensuing drive, {{featuring}} a 24-yard run by Pittman, but they came up empty after Tupa fumbled the snap on a field goal attempt. A few plays later, Gannon threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Rice with 6:06 left in the game, cutting the Raiders deficit to 34–21. Rice became the first player to catch a touchdown pass in 4 different Super Bowls, and third overall to have TDs in 4 Super Bowls (Thurman Thomas and John Elway). The two-point conversion failed when Jerry Porter caught the ball and was forced out of bounds; while the official did not judge it to be a force-out, (judgement call) hence, that part of the play was non <b>reviewable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{probation}} {{is a form}} of punishment, {{once the}} sentence of probation has commenced, the court will run afoul of the double jeopardy clause if it increases the penalty. Probation's primary objective is to protect society by rehabilitating the offender. A person placed on probation is considered a probationer of the court as a whole, and not that of a particular judge thereof. When a defendant is placed on probation, he expressly agrees to be subject to supervision appropriate to a probationer, to avoid the more onerous regimen of a prisoner; accordingly, the defendant retains those rights of an ordinary citizen that are compatible with probationary status, although certain rights, such as the right against self-incrimination, are impaired. There is no requirement that probation must be granted on a specified showing. Probation is considered a privilege and not a right. The action of a district court in refusing to grant probation is not <b>reviewable</b> on appeal except possibly for arbitrary or capricious action {{on the part of the}} District Court amounting to abuse of discretion.|$|E
25|$|Tiwari was lead {{counsel in}} three major public inquiries: the 1978 {{inquiry into the}} {{explosion}} and fire aboard the Greek tanker S.T. Spyros that killed 76 people; the 1984 commission of inquiry into the collision of the drillship Eniwetok into the Sentosa cableway, causing the deaths of seven people when two cable-cars fell into the ocean; and the inquiry into the collapse of Hotel New World in 1988. As Deputy Senior State Counsel, he also represented the state {{in a number of}} important cases. In 1985, he successfully argued before Justice T. S. Sinnathuray in the High Court that since the Military Court of Appeal was a superior court of record, its jurisdiction and the exercise of its powers to hear appeals from subordinate military courts could not be challenged in the High Court by way of judicial review. He also acted for the Government in the 1988 habeas corpus applications of persons detained under the Internal Security Act during Operation Spectrum before the High Court in De Souza Kevin Desmond v. Minister for Home Affairs and Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs, and in the appeal from those judgments to the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs. In the latter case, the Court of Appeal held in a landmark decision that the executive's decision to detain a person under the Act on national security grounds was <b>reviewable</b> by the courts. The effect of this decision was legislatively reversed in 1989, and Tiwari also represented the Government in challenges to the legality of the amending legislation in the case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs.|$|E
25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and <b>reviewable.</b> However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was reasonable for Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E

500|$|Prior to 1968, {{courts in}} the United Kingdom drew a {{distinction}} between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. An error of law that affected the jurisdiction of a decision-maker to exercise its statutory powers was judicially <b>reviewable</b> by the court, whereas an error of that did not go towards jurisdiction was not <b>reviewable.</b> However, the House of Lords is regarded as having effectively done away with the distinction in Anisminic Ltd. v.

500|$|Traditionally at common law, the {{prerogative}} of mercy– that is, {{the power of}} the executive government to pardon or to grant clemency to a convicted criminal– was regarded as outside the courts' supervisory jurisdiction and hence non-justiciable. This changed with the Divisional Court's decision in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley (1993), which held that the {{prerogative of}} mercy is <b>reviewable</b> in some circumstances. This case was considered by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), Chief Justice Chan expressing the opinion that the case [...] "clearly decided that the prerogative of mercy would be <b>reviewable</b> if it were exercised based on an error of law (in that case, the Home Secretary’s misconstruction of the type of pardon which the Home Office could grant), or based on arbitrary and/or extraneous considerations", though courts still cannot review the merits of any clemency decision.|$|E
500|$|Such {{a stance}} has wide implications: the High Court and Court of Appeal {{would not be}} bound by Lee Mau Seng. They could rule that {{situations}} involving mala fides are judicially <b>reviewable,</b> or completely re-adopt the legal position stated in Chng Suan Tze. The justification is that [...] "if Parliament intended to render judiciary law impossible, it has only to issue its laws in a more detailed shape, {{so that in the}} vast complexity of human affairs there may always be at hand a rule sufficiently precise and definite to meet each particular case".|$|E
500|$|In Chandler v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1962), Lord Devlin stated: [...] "It is {{the duty}} of the courts to be as alert now as they have always been to prevent any abuse of the prerogative."

Department of Trade (1976) and held that prerogative powers were as <b>reviewable</b> as any other power and could not be used by the Government to protect themselves when they were removing the protection granted to parties under a statute. He stated, obiter, as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the current}} law in Singapore {{holds that the}} Home Affairs Minister's {{decision}} is subjective and not judicially <b>reviewable,</b> there is uncertainty whether there are exceptional situations in which the courts may still step in to practice judicial review even though the ISA deals with national security matters. A possible exception is when the Minister's decision was made mala fides, that is, in bad faith. Such decisions would involve the clear abuse of power, such as being [...] "detained solely for having red hair or for failing a professional examination or for having acted as a lawyer against the Government".|$|E
500|$|This {{middle ground}} {{approach}} was discussed in ex parte Page when their Lordships dealt with whether the court can intervene and review {{a decision made}} by a visitor (overseer) of a university. Lord Browne-Wilkinson {{found that there were}} two reasons why the general rule that all errors of law are <b>reviewable</b> does not apply to visitors. First, the reason why courts can intervene in a normal case where the decision is considered ultra vires is because the law applicable to a decision made by such a body is the general law of the land. The visitor in ex parte Page did not apply the general law of the land but, rather, a [...] "domestic law" [...] (the university's charter and statutes) of which he was the sole arbiter and over which the courts had no cognizance. Therefore, the visitor [...] "cannot err in law in reaching [...] decision since the general law is not the applicable law".|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be <b>reviewable</b> under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Counsel for the {{appellant}} {{argued that}} this was not a case of a decision <b>reviewable</b> on ordinary administrative law grounds, but rather a case where the exercise of the power depended [...] "upon the precedent establishment of an objective fact". However, the House of Lords disagreed with the argument. It held that the nature and process of the decision conferred upon immigration officers was inconsistent with the requirements for the establishment of any precedent facts. This was because the immigration officer had to consider a [...] "complex of statutory rules and non-statutory guidelines and other documentary evidence whose genuineness is doubtful, statements which cannot be verified, misunderstandings as to what was said, practices and attitudes in a foreign state which have to be estimated. There is room for appreciation, even for discretion." [...] On the other hand, the court was not well placed to determine which of several conflicting statements made by the appellant were true, or to decide if other factors were material to the immigration officer's decision. The court had to determine the case based on affidavit evidence and, though cross-examination on such evidence was permissible, this did not usually occur in practice. As the case did not fall into the precedent fact category, the court was unable to judicially review the decision.|$|E
500|$|Later {{cases have}} treated Anisminic as {{implying}} that any action committed in error by an administrative agency or body is deemed {{to affect the}} jurisdiction of the body to carry out the action, and hence is <b>reviewable</b> by a court of law despite the ouster clause. The blurred distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law was recognized and discussed in R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page (1992). The House of Lords reviewed the development of general principles of judicial review since Anisminic and concluded that the courts will intervene to ensure that the powers of public decision-making bodies are exercised lawfully. In his judgment, Lord Browne-Wilkinson referred to O'Reilly v. Mackman (1983) and opined that [...] "the decision in [...] rendered obsolete the distinction between errors of law {{on the face of the}} record and other errors of law by extending the doctrine of ultra vires." [...] Thus, an ouster clause is ineffective when the decision-maker has acted unlawfully, whether the unlawfulness is jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional in nature. This is because [...] "Parliament had only conferred the decision-making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis: a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires".|$|E
500|$|The most noted {{prerogative}} {{power that}} affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy, which has two elements: the granting of pardons and the granting of nolle prosequi. Pardons may eliminate the [...] "pains, penalties and punishments" [...] from a criminal conviction, though they do not remove convictions themselves. This power is commonly exercised {{on the advice of}} the Secretary of State for the Home Department; the monarch has no direct involvement in its use. Exercises of this power may also take the form of commutations, a limited form of pardon where the sentences is reduced, on certain conditions. The granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review, as confirmed by Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, but the courts have chosen to criticise its application or lack thereof, as in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley. Granting nolle prosequi is done by the Attorney General of England and Wales (or the equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland) {{in the name of the}} crown, to stop legal proceedings against an individual. This is not <b>reviewable</b> by the courts, as confirmed by R v Comptroller of Patents, and does not count as an acquittal; the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date.|$|E
