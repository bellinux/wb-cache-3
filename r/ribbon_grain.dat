40|$|The {{microstructure}} and crystallographic {{preferred orientation}} (CPO) of quartz were quantified in 17 samples of natural monomineralic tabular veins. The veins opened and were deformed, up to shear strain γ > 15, {{in a small}} temperature window (about 25 °C) above 500 °C, as established by Ti-in-quartz thermometry. The veins filled a set of fractures within the Adamello tonalite (southern Alps, Italy) and localized homogeneous simple shear during postmagmatic cooling. The local (square millimeter scale) and bulk (square centimeter) CPO were investigated by computer-integrated polarization microscopy (CIP) and X-ray texture goniometry. Weakly deformed veins (WDV: γ < 1) consist of millimeter- to centimeter-sized crystals with a strong CPO showing a c-axis girdle slightly inclined, mostly with the shear sense, to the foliation (XY) plane and a strong maximum close to the lineation (X). Moderately deformed veins (MDV: 2 < γ < 3) consist of elongated nonrecrystallized <b>ribbon</b> <b>grains</b> and most have a CPO showing a strong Y maximum of c axes some with weak extension into a YZ girdle. Strongly deformed veins (SDV: γ = 4 to 15) are pervasively to completely recrystallized to fine (34 – 40 μm grain size) aggregates with a strong CPO {{similar to that of}} MDV. The slip systems during plastic deformation were dominantly prism 〈a〉 with subordinate rhomb and basal 〈a〉 slip. Recrystallization occurred rather abruptly for 3 < γ < 4. In contrast to dislocation creep experiments in quartz (and other minerals), a steady-state recrystallized fabric is achieved at early stages of deformation (γ ≈ 4) as there is no evidence, with increasing strain, of strengthening of the CPO, of rotation of the fabric skeleton, or of change in grain size. WDV represent weakly deformed relicts of veins with an initial CPO believed to have developed during crystal growth but unsuitably oriented for prism 〈a〉 slip during subsequent shear. MDV and SDV appear to derive from veins different from WDV, where the vein crystals grew with orientation favorable for prism 〈a〉 slip. The relationship between the initial growth CPO and the kinematic framework suggests that veins opened at a temperature close to that at which there is a switch between the activity of prism 〈c〉 and prism 〈a〉 slip, with the temperature of growth causing growth of crystals well oriented for slip. The initial CPO of veins, from which quartz mylonites are commonly derived, plays a critical role in the fabric evolution. The strong growth- and strain-induced CPOs of these sheared veins inhibited significant reworking during lower temperature stages of pluton cooling when basal 〈a〉 slip would have been dominant...|$|R

When annealing temperature T i is lower than T g, the M s increases slightly as a result of relaxation of the internal stress of the as-quenched amorphous alloy. When T i is in between T x and T p 1, the M s significantly increases due to the partial crystallization of amorphous precursors to create a homogeneous distribution of α-Fe(Co) nanocrystals within a residual amorphous matrix. When T i is higher than T p 1, the M s drops rapidly, which may be caused by the grain growth and the formation of paramagnetic phase.

Effect {{of grain}} size on microstructure, {{transformation}} characteristics and shape recovery {{has been studied}} in Fe- 24 %Mn- 4 %Si- 5 %Cr- 5 %Co shape memory ribbons fabricated by melt spinning. Mean grain size of the ribbons could be controlled by wheel speed; in case of ribbon manufactured in the wheel speed of 10 m/sec, mean grain size {{was more or less}} 20 µm, while the mean grain size in 50 m/sec was about 1 µm. Thermal ε-martensite in the shape of plate could be observed in austenite matrix and the volume fraction of that decreased in smaller grains because of grain constraint. As a grain size decreased, one-way and two-way shape recoveries were increased. A change in shape recovery of ribbons was closely related to deformation mode i. e., transformation-induced plasticity or slip according to grain size; it could be confirmed that reversible ε-martensite was induced in preference to irreversible slip in the <b>ribbon</b> with smaller <b>grains</b> during deformation by X-ray diffractometry.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{research}} performed {{under the auspices of}} this grant changed several times during the lifetime of the project. The initial activity was an investigation of irradiation-induced amorphization of ordered intermetallic compounds, using energetic protons as the bombarding species. Two significant events stimulated a change of direction: (1) the proton accelerating facility that the authors had been using at the California State University at Los Angeles became unavailable late in 1988 because of a personnel matter involving the only individual capable of operating the machine; (2) they learned that disordering and amorphization of intermetallic compounds produced interesting effects on their mechanical properties. Loss of access t the local accelerator prompted a collaboration with Dr. Droa Pedraza of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), enabling access to the accelerator at ORNL. The influence of disordering and amorphization on mechanical properties ultimately stimulated the development of a miniaturized disk-bend testing (MDBT) facility, the intent of which was to provide semiquantitative and even quantitative measures of the mechanical behavior of ion-irradiated ordered intermetallic alloys. The second phase of the project involved the perfection and usage of the MDBT, and involved exploratory experiments on unirradiated materials like amorphous alloy <b>ribbons</b> and brittle <b>grain</b> boundaries in Ni{sub 3 }Al.

Melt-bearing HT-mylonitic orthogneiss displays solid-state fabrics with coarse quartz <b>ribbons</b> and sutured <b>grain</b> boundaries. K-feldspar is often fractured and shows peripheral myrmekite. The textures typically become magmatic at the contacts with the Espinho Branco anatexite. Zircon crystals from two samples of the leucosome show Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2. 2 Ga) inherited cores that are enveloped by recrystallised Neoproterozoic rims. These zircon grains define a discordia with lower intercept ages of 558 and 562 Ma but with large analytical errors. A leucogranite with transitional contacts with host diatexites provides a well-constrained zircon mean age of 566 ± 6 Ma (n = 15, 95 % conf.), which is considered the best estimate for the peak metamorphic conditions. The transition from HT-mylonites to fine-grained mylonites and ultramylonites {{is marked by a}} progressive grain size reduction assisted by recrystallisation.

These results suggest a diachronic evolution in which an initial HT northern domain was deformed by intracrystalline slip and melt-assisted granular flow, followed by medium- to low-temperature solid-state creep in the southern shear zone domain.

In the first study, kinematic analysis was aimed at determining the relative contributions of pure and simple shear strain in the ~ 100 m thick quartzite-dominated detachment shear zone, using quartz microstructures (quartz <b>ribbons</b> and recrystallized <b>grains)</b> and crystallographic preferred orientation (measured by electron backscatter diffraction) {{as well as the}} shape preferred orientation of feldspar porphyroclasts. Results from quartz microfabric suggest a pure shear contribution of 0 - 70 %, which likely reflects the spatial and temporal distributions of crustal thinning in this detachment system. Vorticity derived from feldspar shape fabrics indicates that an initial, pure-shear dominated fabric was overprinted by an increment of simple shear dominated strain (g ~ 1. 0) that rotated feldspar clasts "in mass" out of their average orientation, likely during the formation of C' shear planes. In the second study, apatite fission-track ages were obtained from 13 samples from two subvertical profiles on the steep flanks of Skagit Gorge and Ross Lake in the North Cascades, in order to construct age-elevation relations. Results from this study are combined with previous apatite and zircon U-Th/He ages from the same samples to provide some new information about the cooling history. The Ross Lake traverse displays an enigmatic reversal of slope of age-elevation curves, possibly owing to thermal resetting from volcanic flows at ~ 15 Ma.
