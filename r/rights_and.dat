On the other hand, the brain mask corresponding to the brain template was eroded (IDL 8.4 erode function with 4.0 [*]×[*] 4.0 [*]×[*] 4.0 [*]mm structuring element) to generate a brain mask with minimal contribution of the PET signal from extra cerebral bone and soft tissue regions, surrounding the brain (“inBrain” mask).|$|R
