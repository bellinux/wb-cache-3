40|$|Abstract: This paper {{outlines}} {{past and}} future work on the topic <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> systems. This project focuses on the performance <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> systems {{from a range of}} perspectives. The recyclability of products, separation efficiencies for recycling processes and systems built from these processes, and economic factors contributing to the success <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> enterprises are all considered. The goal of this project is to develop a basic understanding of the factors effecting the performance <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> systems, with the eventual ambition of developing techniques for predictive analysis of these systems. These analysis techniques will allow us to evaluate the economic, ecological, and energy impact <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> systems. This increased understanding will help guide the design <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> systems. 1. Introduction: I...|$|R

5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{magnetosphere}} and {{the extremely}} thin atmosphere of Mars are a challenge: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a gaseous state). Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> exhaled gases. The {{volume of}} gas used is reduced {{compared}} to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|E

5|$|The Senate {{nonetheless}} rejoiced at {{the death}} of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed damnatio memoriae on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records. Domitian and, over a century later, Publius Septimius Geta were the only emperors known to have officially received a damnatio memoriae, though others may have received de facto ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the Cancelleria Reliefs, were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> previous material. Yet {{the order of the}} Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.|$|E
5|$|Establishing a {{partnership}} with Robert Stirling Newall in 1850, Bell set up the first factory {{in the world with}} machines able to manufacture steel rope and submarine cable. Two years later his brothers Thomas Bell and John Bell joined him to build a major iron works at Port Clarence, Middlesbrough on the north bank of the River Tees. By 1853 there were three blast furnaces, each with a capacity of just over 6000 cubic feet, making them the largest in Britain at the time. The works produced iron for bridges and steel rails for railways across the British Empire including the North Eastern Railway company, of which Bell was a director from 1864 onwards, and deputy chairman from 1895 until his death. The Bell brothers' company operated its own ironstone mines at Normanby and Cleveland, and its own limestone quarries in Weardale, employing about 6000 men in mining and manufacturing. By 1878 the firm was producing 200,000 tons of iron per annum. Bell was a professional metallurgist and industrial chemist, constantly pioneering processes such as the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> heat from escaping flue gases, and trialling many process improvements.|$|E

5|$|The Capitol Hill station's {{design was}} {{finalized}} in 2007 and 2008, during {{a series of}} public hearings and meetings with the city's design commission. Businesses and residents at the station site were moved after Sound Transit acquired properties in 2008, leaving vacant buildings that were temporarily filled with pieces of art coordinated by Sound Transit. Salvaging and <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> materials in the vacant buildings began in late 2008, including a community event to remove small plants for re-planting by neighborhood residents; approximately 90 percent of material was recycled, and proceeds {{from the sale of}} scrap metal were used to provide hot meals to the homeless. Demolition of buildings on the station site began in March 2009, shortly before the formal groundbreaking for the University Link project, and was completed by August. Among the 20 demolished buildings were a three-story apartment building, a used book store, the Espresso Vivace coffee shop, a nail salon, and a copy shop. Many of the displaced and nearby businesses moved to the northern end of the Broadway district during construction, relying on mitigation funds from Sound Transit and the neighborhood's chamber of commerce.|$|E
