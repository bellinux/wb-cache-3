There was no evidence of progressive ventilatory stimulation despite increasing stimulus. Additionally, these children had no subjective sensation of dyspnea or discomfort.

The breathing reflex is triggered by CO2 concentration in the blood, not by the oxygen concentration, therefore even a small buildup of CO2 in the inhaled gas quickly becomes intolerable; if a person tries to directly <b>rebreathe</b> their exhaled breathing gas, they will soon feel an acute sense of suffocation, therefore rebreathers must chemically remove the CO2 in a component known as a carbon dioxide scrubber.|$|R

From a biological point of view, exhaled air by infectors contains airborne infectious particles that cause airborne infectious diseases such as tuberculosis in confined spaces.

Furthermore, we compute the quantity of carbon dioxide as a marker of exhaled air, which can be inhaled in the room with high likelihood of causing airborne infectious disease given the presence of infectors.

40|$|Background: Pulmonary system {{dysfunction}} is {{a hallmark}} of cystic fibrosis (CF) disease. In addition to impaired cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein, dysfunctional β 2 -adrenergic receptors (β 2 AR) contribute to low airway function in CF. Recent observations suggest CF may also be associated with impaired cardiac function that is demonstrated by attenuated cardiac output (Q), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac power (CP) at both rest and during exercise. However, β 2 AR regulation of cardiac and peripheral vascular tissue, in-vivo, is unknown in CF. We have previously demonstrated that the administration of an inhaled β-agonist increases SV and Q while also decreasing SVR in healthy individuals. Therefore, we aimed to assess cardiac and peripheral hemodynamic responses to the selective β 2 AR agonist albuterol in individuals with CF.

Carbon dioxide measurements were performed between October and December of 2011. Environmental risk, reflected in the <b>rebreathed</b> fraction of air, was highest in minibus taxis and lowest in trains; however, the average number of passengers sharing an indoor space was highest in trains and lowest in minibus taxis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite an {{improvement}} in the overall TB cure rate from 40 - 74 % between 1995 and 2011, TB incidence in South Africa continues to increase. The epidemic is notably disquieting in schools because the vulnerable population is compelled to be present. Older learners (age 15 - 19) are at particular risk given a smear-positive rate of 427 per 100, 000 per year and the {{significant amount of time}} they spend indoors. High schools are therefore important locations for potential TB infection and thus prevention efforts. Methods and FINDINGS: Using portable carbon dioxide monitors, we measured CO 2 in classrooms under non-steady state conditions. The threshold for tuberculosis transmission was estimated using a carbon dioxide-based risk equation. We determined a critical <b>rebreathed</b> fraction of carbon dioxide () of 1 · 6 %, which correlates with an indoor CO 2 concentration of 1000 ppm. These values correspond with a ventilation rate of 8 · 6 l/s per person or 12 air exchanges per hour (ACH) for standard classrooms of 180 m 3. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high smear positive rate of high-school adolescents in South Africa, the proposal to achieve CO 2 levels of 1000 ppm through natural ventilation (in the amount 12 ACH) will not only help achieve WHO guidelines for providing children with healthy indoor environments, it will also provide a low-cost intervention for helping control the TB epidemic in areas of high prevalence...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} 1) if stable heart-failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have elevated extravascular lung water (EVLW) versus healthy control subjects, and 2) the effect of acute β 2 AR agonist inhalation on lung fluid balance. Methods: Twenty-two stable HFrEF patients and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were studied. Lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), alveolar-capillary conductance (DmCO), pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc) (via <b>rebreathe)</b> and lung tissue volume (Vtis) (via computed tomography) were assessed before and within 30 min of administration of nebulized albuterol. EVLW was derived as Vtis – Vc. Results: Pre-albuterol, Vtis and EVLW were greater in HFrEF vs. control (998 ± 200 vs. 884 ± 123 ml, P = 0. 041; 943 ± 202 vs. 802 ± 133 ml, P = 0. 015, respectively). Albuterol decreased Vtis and EVLW in HFrEF (− 4. 6 ± 7. 8 %, P = 0. 010; − 4. 6 ± 8. 8 %, P = 0. 018) and control (− 2. 8 ± 4. 9 %, P = 0. 029; − 3. 0 ± 5. 7 %, P = 0. 045). There was an inverse relationship between pre-albuterol values and the pre- to post-albuterol change for EVLW (r 2 = − 0. 264, P = 0. 015) and DmCO (r 2 = − 0. 343, P = 0. 004) in HFrEF only.

40|$|Key {{elements}} for determining alveolar-capillary membrane conductance (Dm) and pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc) from the lung diffusing capacity (Dl) for carbon monoxide (DlCO) or for nitric oxide (DlNO) are the reaction rate {{of carbon monoxide}} with hemoglobin (θCO) and the DmCO/DlNO relationship (α-ratio). Although a range of values have been reported, currently {{there is no consensus}} regarding these parameters. The study purpose was to define optimal parameters (θCO, α-ratio) that would experimentally substantiate calculations of Dm and Vc from the single-inspired O 2 tension [inspired fraction of O 2 (FiO 2) ] method relative to the multiple-FiO 2 method. Eight healthy men were studied at rest and during moderate exercise (80 -W cycle). Dm and Vc were determined by the multiple-FiO 2 and single-FiO 2 methods (<b>rebreathe</b> technique) and were tabulated by applying previously reported θCO equations (both methods) and by varying the α-ratio (single-FiO 2 method) from 1. 90 to 2. 50. Values were then compared between methods throughout the examined α-ratios. Dm and Vc were critically dependent on the applied θCO equation. For the multiple-FiO 2 method, Dm was highly variable between θCO equations (rest and exercise); the range of Vc was less widespread. For the single-FiO 2 method, the θCO equation by Reeves and Park (1992) combined with an α-ratio between 2. 08 and 2. 26 gave values for Dm and Vc that most closely matched those from the multiple-FiO 2 method and were also physiologically plausible compared with predicted values. We conclude that the parameters used to calculate Dm and Vc values from the single-FiO 2 method (using DlCO and DlNO) can significantly influence results and should be evaluated within individual laboratories to obtain optimal values...|$|R

Central hemodynamic evaluation during exercise testing provides critical {{information for the}} clinical classification of reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) heart failure (HF) patients. Recent and encouraging observations suggest that non-traditional indices of central hemodynamics can robustly describe cardiac function and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics in healthy individuals and in HF. Therefore, because of emerging evidence in favor of non-traditional indices to describe central hemodynamics in HF, {{it is unclear what}} index or indices best describe cardiac function and the heart-lung hemodynamic interaction in HF. Moreover, contributing to the complexity of the pathophysiology underlying the HF syndrome, it is becoming more recognized that neural mechanisms originating within skeletal muscle likely contribute to impaired cardiovascular function and symptoms of these patients. However, it remains unclear what role this neural feedback from skeletal muscle ergoreceptors has in the impaired central hemodynamic response frequently observed during exercise in HF. Therefore, the aims of this dissertation focused on investigating factors to better understand the central hemodynamic response to exercise in HF. In this series of studies we observed that non-traditional measurement of cardiac and pulmonary hemodynamics could describe the central hemodynamic response to exercise in HF. Also, experimental manipulation of neural feedback from skeletal muscle ergoreceptors resulted in observations which suggest pulmonary hemodynamics could be influenced by this mechanism, whereas cardiac function may not be similarly influenced by this pathway in HFrEF. Equally important and relevant to both clinical and research settings, it was observed that non-invasive measurement of stroke volume at peak exercise could be reliably estimated using echocardiography, acetylene <b>rebreathe,</b> and oxygen pulse in HF...|$|R
