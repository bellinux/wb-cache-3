[...] With careful {{selection of the}} gradation, {{it is possible to}} achieve high bulk density, high physical stability, and low permeability. [...] This is important because in pavement design, a workable, stable mix with <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> is important. [...] With an open gradation, the bulk density is relatively low, {{due to the lack of}} fine particles, the physical stability is moderate, and the permeability is quite high. [...] With a rich gradation, the bulk density will also be low, the physical stability is low, and the permeability is also low. [...] The gradation can be affected to achieve the desired properties for the particular engineering application.|$|E

40|$|Mycorrhizal soybean (Glycine max L. Merr. var. Harosoy- 63) {{plants have}} lower <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> {{transport}} than nonmy-corrhizal plants after 4. 5 weeks of growth. Although resistances of whole plants differ by 40 %, {{there were no}} differences in the resistances of stems plus leaves, indicating that the major effect of the mycorrhizae was <b>to</b> reduce the <b>resistance</b> of the roots. Since the fungitoxicant, p-chloronitrobenzene, had no effect on <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> transport, reduced <b>resistances</b> were probably not caused by a direct modification of the transport pathway by the fungus. Differences in resistance between mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal soybean were essentialy eliminated by the application of nutrients to the soil. Thus, lowered resistances of mycorrhizal roots growing in soil with low levels of nutrients probably resulted from the enhanced nutrient status of the plant brought about by the fungus. Mycorrhizal infection increased growth at both low and high nutrient levels...|$|R
