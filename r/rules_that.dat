5|$|Alongside fractals, {{chaos theory}} ranks as an {{essentially}} universal influence on patterns in nature. There {{is a relationship}} between chaos and fractals—the strange attractors in chaotic systems have a fractal dimension. Some cellular automata, simple sets of mathematical <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably Stephen Wolfram's Rule 30.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1926, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court {{issued a}} divided opinion {{in which two}} judges <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> the Lieutenant-Governor could appoint more than twenty-one Councillors, and two <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> he could not. While {{three of the four}} judges <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> the Councillor's tenure of office was at {{pleasure}}, only two <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> it was at the pleasure of the Lieutenant-Governor; the third judge <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> they served at the pleasure of His Majesty the King. (The fourth judge <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> Councillors served for life.) With the court effectively evenly divided on all issues, there was no majority decision, and so Rhodes would have to wait for an appellate verdict before he could abolish the Legislative Council.|$|R

5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|Burke {{was arrested}} and tried for {{manslaughter}} but was acquitted. Following the death in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, also known as Brighton Bill, the London Prize Ring Rules were introduced to more clearly define the rules of prize fighting and to introduce certain safety measures, <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> still {{form the basis for}} the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{firearms}} possession {{is not a}} politicized {{issue that}} would be debated during Czech elections. The 2014 European Parliament election became an exception {{in connection with the}} Swedish European Commissioner Cecilia Malmström's initiative to introduce new common EU <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> would significantly restrict the possibilities of legally owning firearms.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E
5|$|In a tour {{match against}} the Englishmen, Woodfull made 275 not out for Victoria, his highest score for his state. During the match, Woodfull was captain and had agreed with English captain Chapman to vary <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> {{had been laid}} by the Australian Board of Control. The two men agreed to cover the pitch {{throughout}} the match and to bowl overs of six balls instead of eight. The Australian Board of Control reacted by reprimanding the Victorian Cricket Association. The match was a high-scoring draw.|$|E
5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink {{in the course of}} several generations. His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E
50|$|The Court of Appeal <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> {{the actual}} loss was not $35,007, but instead only $8,000. However, the court <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> the {{limitation}} clause was valid, {{and reduced the}} damages award to $1,250.|$|R
50|$|Thus the <b>rule</b> <b>that</b> the {{new owner}} of hired {{property}} may not eject a lessee should be balanced by the <b>rule</b> <b>that</b> the lessee is required {{to abide by the}} terms of the lease.|$|R

5|$|Many LARPs have game <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, what can be done with various objects that exist in the setting, and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} track {{athletics}} or of track events in athletics as observed in most international athletics competitions are {{set by the}} Competition Rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).

5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, the Central Labor Relations Commission in Tokyo <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> the JR Group had {{to either}} rehire or {{compensate}} {{workers who were}} not hired when JNR was privatized. The Labor Commission <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> it was an Unfair Labor Practice as the members of Kokuro had been targeted, and anti-union discrimination is illegal under article seven of Japan's Trade Union Act. It also <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> the JR Group companies, not the defunct JNR, were responsible.|$|R

A total of 9,185 plug-in passenger cars were registered in the first three quarters of 2016, consisting of 6,567 plug-in hybrids and 2,618 all-electric cars. The market share of the plug-in car segment captured 3.2% of new car sales during the period. , the Outlander P-HEV remained as the all-time top-selling plug-in car in the country with 25,984 units registered, followed by the Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid (15,804), Volkswagen Golf GTE (10,691), Volkswagen Passat GTE (7,773), Mercedes-Benz C 350 e (6,226), and the Tesla Model S (6,049).|$|E
5|$|At this congress, Kim Il-sung {{designated}} his son Kim Jong-il as his successor. The {{move was}} {{criticized by the}} South Korean media and ruling communist parties of the socialist states in Eastern Europe and Asia because it was considered nepotist. The congress also saw the WPK and North Korea move away from orthodox communism by emphasizing the Juche idea over Marxism–Leninism, giving the party a nationalistic bent. The next party congress was not convened before 2016, despite party <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> stipulated that a congress had to be held every fifth year.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 elbows on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused to sanction any set of <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> didn't prohibit them.|$|E

5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> {{there were}} {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators {{of the crimes}} outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> there were grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|R

5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Reynolds v. Sims that state {{legislative}} seats must be apportioned {{on the principle}} of one man, one vote. A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, and the court <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
