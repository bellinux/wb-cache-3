In the 1870s, the small hamlet became better known as [...] "Highland Park", a name derived from the suburban housing development although the area adjacent to the railroad tracks {{continued to be}} called [...] "East New Brunswick."1870 was also the year in which Highland Park was annexed to the newly formed township now called Edison, but at the time called Raritan Township.Highland Park had its own school district and on March 15, 1905, the Borough of Highland Park was formed. Highland Park's drive for independence from Raritan Township arose over the issue of public schooling. Residents wanted an independent school system and there was a <b>related</b> <b>dispute</b> over school taxes. The fire department, which had formed in 1899, also wanted more local control over their affairs. The 1905 New Jersey census counted 147 dwellings in the new borough. In 1918, Robert Wood Johnson II was appointed to the Highland Park Council and became mayor in 1920. His summer house and estate was located on River Road, just north of the railroad tracks.|$|E

40|$|Today, the {{employment}} {{relationship in the}} public service is regulated {{by a number of}} sources of law: the law of contract forms the basis of the employer-employee relationship; labour legislation, most notably the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (LRA), directs fairness in the employer-employee context; and the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 2 of 2000 (PAJA), which codifies administrative law, steers due process and rationality in the public service.
