25|$|Frequency {{multiplication}} {{can also}} be attained by locking the VCO output to the Nth harmonic of the <b>reference</b> <b>signal.</b> Instead of a simple phase detector, the design uses a harmonic mixer (sampling mixer). The harmonic mixer turns the <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> into an impulse train that is rich in harmonics. The VCO output is coarse tuned {{to be close to}} one of those harmonics. Consequently, the desired harmonic mixer output (representing the difference between the N harmonic and the VCO output) falls within the loop filter passband.|$|E
25|$|Analog scopes do not {{necessarily}} include a calibrated reference grid for size measurement of waves, {{and they may not}} display waves in the traditional sense of a line segment sweeping from left to right. Instead, they could be used for signal analysis by feeding a <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> into one axis and the signal to measure into the other axis. For an oscillating reference and measurement signal, this results in a complex looping pattern referred to as a Lissajous curve. The shape of the curve can be interpreted to identify properties of the measurement signal in relation to the <b>reference</b> <b>signal,</b> and is useful across a wide range of oscillation frequencies.|$|E

25|$|Most EPR {{machines}} are reflection spectrometers, {{meaning that the}} detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation {{coming back from the}} cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the circulator which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source.

25|$|Suppose the <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> is 100kHz, and the divider can be preset to {{any value}} between 1 and 100. The error signal {{produced}} by the comparator will only be zero when {{the output of the}} divider is also 100kHz. For this to be the case, the VCO must run at a frequency which is 100kHz x the divider count value. Thus it will produce an output of 100kHz for a count of 1, 200kHz for a count of 2, 1MHz for a count of 10 and so on. Note that only whole multiples of the reference frequency can be obtained with the simplest integer N dividers. Fractional N dividers are readily available.|$|E

This means that pink noise would have equal {{power in the}} frequency range from 40 to 60Hz as in the band from 4000 to 6000Hz. Since humans hear in such a proportional space, where a doubling of frequency (an octave) is perceived the same regardless of actual frequency (40–60Hz is heard as the same interval and distance as 4000–6000Hz), every octave contains {{the same amount of}} energy and thus pink noise is often used as a <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> in audio engineering. The spectral power density, compared with white noise, decreases by 3 dB per octave (density proportional to 1/f). [...] For this reason, pink noise is often called [...] "1/f noise".|$|E

2500|$|However {{given that}} the {{location}} of different NMR signals {{is dependent on the}} external magnetic field strength and the reference frequency, the signals are usually reported relative to a <b>reference</b> <b>signal,</b> usually that of TMS (tetramethylsilane). Additionally, since the distribution of NMR signals is field dependent, these frequencies are divided by the spectrometer frequency.

This operation therefore gives a locator number called the [...] "chemical shift" [...] with units of parts per million. In general, chemical shifts for protons are highly predictable since the shifts are primarily determined by simpler shielding effects (electron density), but the chemical shifts for many heavier nuclei are more strongly influenced by other factors including excited states ("paramagnetic" [...] contribution to shielding tensor).|$|E

The same measurements that are made for the target signal, DTO and DFO, are made for the <b>reference</b> <b>signal.</b> The key to a <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> is that the transmit location of that signal is known. By comparing the DTO of the <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> and the DTO of the target signal a result known as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) can be calculated.
