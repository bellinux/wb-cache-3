2500|$|While {{with the}} T.I. Group Dolphin invented and {{patented}} a 'Jumping apparatus' {{consisting of a}} tubular post with footrests supported by a spring on a post, mounted on a three-wheeled carriage. [...] The user would have to {{jump up and down}} to 'establish a forward drive to wheels through a free-wheel device'. More successful was his invention of an exercising machine [...] consisting of 'a flywheel <b>rotatably</b> <b>mounted</b> in fixed bearings, a winding spool fixed to rotate with the flywheel and a cable one end of which is connected to the core of the spool {{in such a way that}} on rotation of the flywheel with the cable fully unwound, the cable winds onto the spool in one or other direction depending on the direction of rotation of the flywheel.' From the patent it can be seen that this was the principle used for rowing machines and exercise equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea of an}} {{automatic}} washing machine had been around for many years but these were crude mechanical efforts that typically involved a manually operated crank or similar design. [...] In many ways, the patent of the new Thor washer sounds modern, even today. The patent states that a 'perforated cylinder is <b>rotatably</b> <b>mounted</b> within the tub containing the wash water'. A series of blades lifted the clothes as the cylinder rotated. After 8 rotations on one direction, the machine would reverse rotation to 'prevent the cloths from wadding up into a compact mass'. [...] Drive belts attached to a Westinghouse motor connected to three wheels of different sizes, which moved the drum during operation. The design also included a clutch, which allowed the machine to switch direction, and an emergency stop rod. The new Thor washer was mass marketed throughout the United States beginning in 1908.|$|E
