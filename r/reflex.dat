5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring Sights HC-14-62 <b>reflex</b> sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, {{and it can be}} used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the <b>reflex</b> sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided {{on each side of the}} <b>reflex</b> sight housing.|$|E

5|$|The diving <b>reflex</b> is a {{response}} to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving <b>reflex.</b> The diving <b>reflex</b> is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Cerebral palsy is a motor {{disorder}} {{caused by}} non-progressive brain damage dueto {{the incidence of}} lesions in {{the central nervous system}} and usually is associated with otherdisorders. Abnormal <b>reflexes</b> such as abnormal oral <b>reflexes</b> are common in spastic cerebral palsy. Thisstudy was conducted {{to examine the relationship between}} oral <b>reflexes</b> and the number of affected limbsin these children. Materials and methods: Forty-five children with spastic cerebral palsy (four and two limbs affected; 5 - 10 years) were participated in this study. Oral <b>reflexes</b> including lip, tongue, rooting, biting, chewing,swallowing, suckling, gag, open of mouthing were evaluated through direct assessment and observation. Inclusion criteria were: no sign of visual, auditory, intelligence and oral structure (such as cleft palate) problems. Results: Results showed an existence of abnormal oral <b>reflexes</b> in two groups. There was a significantrelationship between the number of affected limbs (two and four limbs) and the frequency of abnormalbiting, tongue, and swallowing <b>reflexes,</b> such that frequency of these abnormal <b>reflexes</b> are higher in fouraffected limb children than two affected ones. No significant relationships were found in other oralreflexes and number of affected limbs. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicated an existence of abnormal oral <b>reflexes</b> in two groups.

5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass <b>reflex</b> designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} {{the importance of}} upper airway <b>reflexes</b> to anaesthesia and discuss the anatomy and physiology relating to normal upper airway function and protective airway <b>reflexes.</b> The measurement of upper airway <b>reflexes</b> has not previously been fully investigated in humans and I describe the background to the measurement of the sensitivity of upper airway <b>reflexes</b> and outline a technique to measure the sensitivity of upper airway <b>reflexes.</b> Using this technique I have explored {{the changes in the}} sensitivity of upper airway <b>reflexes</b> that occur due to ageing and following administration of drugs. Smokers are known to have an increased incidence of coughing and laryngospasm on induction of anaesthesia. The effect of cigarette smoking and the changes in the sensitivity of upper airway <b>reflexes</b> which occur on stopping smoking were investigated. Benzodiazepines are commonly used for premedication and intravenously to produce sedation, the effects of these drugs on the sensitivity of upper airway <b>reflexes</b> was examined as well as the effect of the reversal agent flumazenil. Patients who have consumed ethyl alcohol may readily aspirate gastric contents with fatal consequences. The effect of ethyl alcohol on the sensitivity of upper airway <b>reflexes</b> is measured and the relevance to anaesthetists providing emergency anaesthesia is discussed. The inhalation of nitrous oxide and oxygen mixtures is frequently used for analgesic purposes in groups of patients known to have full stomachs and who are at risk from aspiration of gastric contents. I have studied the effects of nitrous oxide and oxygen mixtures on upper airway <b>reflexes.</b> The final chapter of this thesis uses a fibre-optic method of measuring the movements of the vocal cords on induction of anaesthesia, to examine the actions of two commonly used anaesthetic induction agents on the sensitivity of upper airway <b>reflexes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Joint {{disease is}} common in adults and in adolescents. It {{particularly}} affects the knee joints. In young people, joint disease {{has a number of}} causes including: genetic factors, defects in joint cartilage and sports related injuries. In particular, overtraining and traumatic injuries are common in many sports Participation in sports has expanded during the last two decades {{in many parts of the}} world. This has led to an increased number of injuries. Our knowledge of the role of ligaments in the control of movements and how they should be managed after injuries needs to expand as fast as participation rates. The aims of the current study were firstly, to investigate if <b>reflexes</b> can be elicited by electrical stimulation of ligaments. Secondly, to investigate if different muscles are affected differently by these <b>reflexes.</b> The final aim was to investigate if these <b>reflexes</b> can be modulated by posture or muscle activity. A total of 44 volunteers participated in a series of experiments. These experiments were designed to elicit <b>reflexes</b> following electrical stimulation of the collateral knee ligaments during sitting, standing and walking on treadmill. The <b>reflexes</b> were observed in averaged rectified electromyograms from Rectus Femoris, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Lateralis, Lateral and Medial Gastrocnemius and Soleus. Muscle activity was essential if <b>reflexes</b> were to be elicited. No <b>reflexes</b> were elicited in relaxed muscles. During the first series of experiments <b>reflexes</b> in Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis and Vastus Medialis were investigated while the <b>Reflexes</b> were identified as changes in the averaged rectified electromyograms (EMG). The EMG in the immediate post stimulus period was compared with the pre-stimulus control. Inhibitory and excitatory <b>reflexes</b> were elicited following ligament stimulation in all three sets of experiments. The mean latency in quadriceps for early excitation was 57 +/- 6 msec and 67 +/- 10 msec for early inhibitions. The equivalent means were 70 +/- 6 msec and 77 +/- 6 msec for triceps. The shortest latency recorded in quadriceps was 46 msec. Longer latency <b>reflexes</b> were frequently observed. The mean latency in quadriceps for late excitation was 102 +/- 6 msec and 113 +/- 11 msec for late inhibitions. The equivalent means were 110 +/- 6 msec and 119 +/- 11 msec for triceps. There was no significant difference in the latencies of <b>reflexes</b> from MCL and LCL. The latencies in triceps were approximately 10 msec longer (90 msec for quadriceps a 100 msec for triceps) than those in quadriceps and this can be attributed to their longer conduction pathway. The <b>reflexes</b> were also recorded during gait. During walking, the latencies of both excitations and inhibitions were significantly longer than they were during sitting and standing. The mean latency of excitatory <b>reflexes</b> in Vastus Lateralis after LCL stimulation were 71 +/- 5 msec. For inhibitory <b>reflexes</b> the mean latency was 87 +/- 1 msec. The mean latency for excitation <b>reflexes</b> in Lateral Gastrocnemus was 82 +/- 2 msec and for inhibition <b>reflexes</b> was 94 +/- 3 msec. In each set of experiments the shortest latencies were consistent with slow group II or group III afferents excited by relatively strong stimulation. Control experiments using topical cutaneous anaesthesia minimised the possibility of cutaneous contributions to the observed <b>reflexes.</b> It is also possible that the electrical stimulation excited capsular afferents located close to the ligaments. This cannot be settled by the experiment reported in this thesis and the observed <b>reflexes</b> are best described as ligamento-muscular <b>reflexes.</b> These observed effects are consistent with recent results already published by Kim et al in 1995.
