5000|$|A {{synthetic}} CDO tranche may {{be either}} funded or unfunded. Under the swap agreements, the CDO could {{have to pay}} {{up to a certain}} amount of money in the event of a credit event on the <b>reference</b> <b>obligations</b> in the CDO's reference portfolio. Some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches. Typically, the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing. Until a credit event occurs, the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in high-quality, liquid assets or placed in a GIC (Guaranteed Investment Contract) account that offers a return that is a few basis points below LIBOR. The return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches. When a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required, the required payment is made from the GIC or reserve account that holds the liquid investments. In contrast, senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower. Unlike a cash CDO, investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the CDO when entering into the investment. Instead, the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the CDO in the event the portfolio's losses reach the senior tranche. Funded synthetic issuance exceeded $80 billion in 2006. From an issuance perspective, synthetic CDOs take less time to create. Cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed, and the CDO's tranches can be precisely structured.|$|R

40|$|The {{structured}} credit linked notes (hereafter CLNs) can be {{issued by the}} protection buyer such as the financial institutions who own the <b>reference</b> <b>obligation</b> or the special purpose vehicle (henceforth SPV). With the intersection of market and credit risk, the first contribution {{of this paper is}} to derive the analytic formulas of the CLNs and the (leveraged) total return CLNs issued by an SPV or the protection buyer, respectively. The value of an SPV is determined by the price difference in the notes issued by an SPV or the protection buyer. The second contribution is to prove that the values of structured CLNs issued by an SPV are higher than the ones issued by the protection buyer and hence it is reasonable that the structured CLNs are usually issued through SPVs in practice. Furthermore, when the credit quality of the <b>reference</b> <b>obligation</b> and protection buyer becomes worse or the leverage effect is higher, it is a superior solution for the structured CLNs issued through an SPV. Third, the empirical results for the characteristics of credit spreads do not incorporate the correlation coefficient of spot rate and market index into their regression models and show that they are positively correlated with the volatilities of spot rate and return on market index. However, we provide a new insight that the relationship among them depends on the sign of correlation coefficient of spot rate and equity index market.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the most actively traded types of credit derivatives within a unified pricing framework {{that allows for}} multiple debt issues. Since firms default on all of their obligations, total debt is instrumental in the likelihood of default and therefore in credit derivatives valuation. We use a single factor interest rate model where the exponential default frontier is based on total debt and is made coherent with observed bond prices. Analytical formulae are derived for credit default swaps, total return swaps (both fixed-for-fixed and fixed-for-floating), and credit risk options (CROs). Price behaviors and hedging properties of all these credit derivatives are investigated. Simulations document that credit derivatives prices may be significantly affected by terms of debt other {{than those of the}} <b>reference</b> <b>obligation.</b> The analysis of CROs indicates their superior ability to fine-tune the hedging of magnitude and arrival risks of default.

That is why organizations attempt to design systems and strategies to improve the job involvement levels. For it benefits both the organization and its employees at the same time. In the current research, we try to discover the relations between staff’s job involvement and manager’s power resources throughout the public hospitals of Yazd in 1392. Methods: This was an analytic-descriptive study. The sample size was 160 individuals. Power forcing and job involvement questionnaires used in the study. The data was analyzed with SPSS 16 using T-test and Spearman. Results: Among the power resources, {{the highest level of}} mean belongs to specialization power (5 / 09) from 8 score, the second rank is legal power, and the others are <b>reference,</b> <b>obligation,</b> and remuneration in respect. Job involvement’s mark is higher than average (% 62 / 89). Age has direct relationship with the legal power, and a reverse relationship with the specialization power and job involvement. Official background has direct relationship with obligation power. Conclusion: It was found during the study that there is no relationship between the employees’ job involvement and the managers’ power resources. This reduction of efficiency is {{because of the lack of}} appropriate use of the resources by managers.

40|$|Many of the {{consequences}} of issuing and purchasing options on publicly traded property have been well understood since Black and Scholes developed a model for option pricing. No model of options, however, provides an accurate economic analysis of the actual transactions that issuers and purchasers engage in when options are bought and sold. One consequenceof this gap in understanding is that the rules for taxing options remain poorly developed. This Article provides a transactional analysis of option sales for the first time. The focus is on covered options, but the analysis also has implications for options in which the underlying property serves merely as a <b>reference</b> <b>obligation</b> and is owned by neither party to the transaction. The analysis demonstrates that while all options have as one component a swap of variable risks or returns on the underlying property for a fixed payment, 2 ̆ 2 in the money 2 ̆ 2 options involve, in addition, a forward transfer of the benefits and correlative burdens of a part of the underlying property that is equivalent to a forward sale of that part. Commentators have not identified this embedded forward sale because the payment arrangement between the parties to the option transaction obscures it; however, a comparison of option prices derived under the Black-Scholes model with the theoretical prices of such forwards demonstrates that the transactions are identical. The analysis also illuminates the relationships between options and other common financial transactions, such as collars, and it permits a clear assessment of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} possible tax rules for financial options...|$|E

This type of performance has always been the subject of a debate on the legal doctrine focus on the legal classification and is the center of the "classical" dichotomy “duty of best efforts” and “duty to achieve a certain result”. This distinction in today's legal debate has perhaps lost consistency but which is still very dear to the case law, in particular with <b>reference</b> to the <b>obligation</b> of the lawyer.

40|$|Credit default swaps (CDSs) pose {{a number}} of risks to {{institutions}} and markets, {{many of which are}} not unique. These risks include counterparty credit, operational, concentration, and jump-to-default risks. CDSs also pose other risks and challenges. For example, CDS markets generally lacked transparency, which may have compounded market uncertainty about participants’ overall risk exposures, the concentration of exposures, and the market value of contracts during the recent crisis. Further, regulators note that the potential existed for market participants to manipulate certain CDS prices to profi t in other markets that CDS prices might infl uence, such as the equity market, and that the lack of transparency could contribute to this risk. Others also raised concerns about the use of CDSs for speculative purposes, including concerns about uncovered or “naked” CDS positions – the use of CDSs for speculative purposes when a party to a CDS contract does not own the underlying <b>reference</b> entity or <b>obligation.</b> While regulators and market participants note that over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, to varying degrees, pose some similar risks, particularly equity derivatives, the US regulatory structure for CDSs does not provide any one regulator with authority over all participants in the CDS market, thereby making monitoring and managing potential systemic risk diffi cult. ...|$|R
