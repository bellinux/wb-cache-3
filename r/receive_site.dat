The terrestrial air link comprises a transmit site located on Mount Pack Monadnock in Temple, New Hampshire, and a <b>receive</b> <b>site</b> 42. 2 km away in Westford, Massachusetts.

The typical video network may consist of video source signals {{on the ground}} as well as airborne while the <b>receive</b> <b>site</b> is usually ground based. Examples of system issues which will be described and analyzed are listed below. * Multi-mode operation: It is likely that a single <b>receive</b> <b>site</b> must be able to rapidly switch between video sources having different bit rates and modes of operation. One technique to achieve this capability will be presented and discussed. * Error sensitivity: It is important that the coding compression technique be resilient to transmission errors. Techniques to achieve this robustness for both synchronization and data signals will be discussed. * Data Multiplexing: From a system point of view, it is extremely efficient to multiplex other digital signals (e. g. audio, IRIG time code) with the video signal to form a single stream for encryption and transmission. A particularly efficient multiplex technique will be presented. * Diagnostics: Video telemetry systems are more effective when they contain carefully designed built-in diagnostics.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the OLYMPUS-propagation experiment attenuation measurements at 12. 5, 20 and 30 GHz were performed at the <b>receive</b> <b>site</b> Darmstadt of the Deutsche Bundespost Telekom Research Centre. Thus, the requirements for an adaptive up-link power control system to compensate rain attenuation can be investigated. By way of example for single rain events, it will be shown, that due to the variation of the instantaneous attenuation ratio uncertainties have {{to be taken into account}} in estimating the attenuation at the normally higher up-link frequency from the down-link attenuation at the normally higher up-link frequency from the down-link attenuation. The error bounds are given for the frequency pairs 12. 5 #-># 20 GHz and 20 #-># 30 GHz. The adequate reaction time for up-link power control depends on the attenuation range to be controlled. The use of an up-link power control system depends on the needed availability of the communication system. For the three years 1990 - 1992 the exceedance probability of attenuation as well as the diurnal variation are given for the <b>receive</b> <b>site</b> Darmstadt. The dynamics of rain attenuation are shown for the three frequencies and for different attenuation ranges.
