5|$|In 1857, {{the cattle}} {{industry}} in Puerto Rico began having difficulties, {{when the number}} of animals diminished significantly.

5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E

5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several {{challenges for}} the developers. LucasArts requested the game to be produced for both DOS and Macintosh with the same system requirements, specifically the random-access memory (RAM). The Mac OS runs a graphical user interface which uses up RAM while DOS does not, meaning the Macintosh version has less RAM available for Dark Forces to use. Aaron Giles, who was the Macintosh programmer for Dark Forces, explained that to <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> problem the memory had to be managed more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|Restricted driver {{visibility}} {{due to the}} air-smoothed casing {{and soft}} steam exhaust from the multiple-jet blastpipe. The exhaust problem was never adequately resolved, and smoke continued to beat down onto the casing while moving, obscuring the driver's vision. There was much experimentation in order to <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> problem, {{with varying degrees of}} success, and photographic evidence shows the many guises of this project.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Jubilee Bridge was widened in {{the mid-1970s}} by bolting a new {{pedestrian}} way {{to the side of}} the original structure and widening the roadways over the old footpaths. It is a bottleneck and becomes congested at peak travel times, and in the event of a breakdown or accident on the bridge, traffic in the area comes to a standstill. To <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> problem, a second crossing of the Mersey is planned, to be known as the Mersey Gateway.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1839, Ranjang Pande was made the sole mukhtiyar. However, knowledge about Ranjang's war preparations and his communication with other princely states of India, fomenting anti-British sentiments, alarmed the Governor-General of the time, Lord Auckland, who mobilized some British troops near the border of Nepal. In order to <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> diplomatic fiasco, Bhimsen was recalled from Gorkha {{and the rest of}} his confiscated property was also released. Bhimsen suggested some of the battalions under Ranjang's command to be given to other courtiers, thus severely weakening Ranjang's military power, and in the process convincing the British that Nepal was not on the path to war. The King agreed to this arrangement; however this aroused a strong suspicion in Samrajya Laxmi, who determined to eradicate Bhimsen's influence permanently.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain {{of the life of}} Hieronymus Bosch or of the {{commissions}} or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history.|$|E
5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's {{argument}} failed {{to establish an}} explicit logical contradiction between God {{and the existence of}} evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an explicit contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> by offering two further points.|$|E

5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences {{when compared with}} the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> dispute, the Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Carl Ludwig Hablitz in 1783 as Colymbus caspicus, from {{a bird in}} Bandar-e Anzali. This was originally {{thought to be a}} synonym for the horned grebe, until Erwin Stresemann discovered that the description applied more to the black-necked grebe in 1948. Before this, the earliest description was thought to be by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, who gave this bird its current scientific name of Podiceps nigricollis from a German bird. To <b>resolve</b> <b>this,</b> the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature suppressed the name C. caspicus. The genus name Dytes is sometimes used for this species, a placement which was formalized by Robert Ridgway in 1881.|$|E

5|$|To {{support the}} lambeosaurine affinities of Eolambia, Kirkland {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis; the tree recovered by his analysis, which accordingly places Eolambia {{as the most}} basal lambeosaurine, is reproduced below. Despite the evidence he cited {{in support of this}} position, Kirkland also noted a seemingly inconsistent trait. As observed in the juvenile ilium he initially described, the antitrochanter – a projection on the ilium that limits the greater trochanter of the femur – is more poorly developed than would be expected for a basal hadrosaurid. Michael Brett-Surman noted that adults may have had a better-developed antitrochanter. On the other hand, the derived lambeosaurine Hypacrosaurus has a well-developed antitrochanter even at the hatchling stage. Kirkland noted the possibility that basal hadrosaurids developed their antitrochanter later in life than derived hadrosaurids such as Hypacrosaurus. He thus remarked that adult Eolambia specimens would <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> issue.|$|E
5|$|Under severe {{pressure}} from his ministers to <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> issue, Field travelled to England in March 1964 to pursue sovereign statehood, but returned empty-handed a month later. He resigned {{his position on}} 13 April; this {{came as no surprise}} to many government insiders, but appeared sudden to most sections of the general public. Smith promptly accepted the cabinet's invitation to take over, though he expressed surprise at the nomination. A farmer and erstwhile British Royal Air Force pilot from the rural town of Selukwe, Smith was Southern Rhodesia's first native-born head of government. He immediately promised to take a harder line on independence than his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E

5|$|Having {{identified}} the culprit as Adachi, the party chases and locates him within the TV world. Adachi explains that his actions {{were out of}} both boredom {{and the belief that}} humanity is better off believing what it wants; his claims are dismissed by the party as the rantings of a madman. After fighting Adachi, he is possessed by Ameno-sagiri, the Japanese God of Fog, who reveals that the fog is harmful to people and will eventually cause humanity to fall into a permanent state of ignorance and transform into Shadows. Upon his defeat, he agrees to lift the fog, congratulating the party on their resolve. Defeated, the wounded Adachi agrees to assume responsibility for his actions and turns himself in. The game moves forward to the day before the protagonist must travel home. If the player returns to the Dojima residence, the game ends with the party sending the protagonist off as he departs Inaba. Alternatively, should the player be able to identify the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to <b>resolve</b> <b>this</b> plot element, the protagonist meets with the party, and together they decide to end the case for good.|$|E
