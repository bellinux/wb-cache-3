25|$|Lenore E. Walker {{presented}} {{the model of}} a cycle of abuse which consists of four phases. First, there is a buildup to abuse when tension rises until a domestic violence incident ensues. During the <b>reconciliation</b> <b>stage,</b> the abuser may be kind and loving {{and then there is}} a period of calm. When the situation is calm, the abused person may be hopeful that the situation will change. Then, tensions begin to build, and the cycle starts again.|$|E

These variations are corrected in the information <b>reconciliation</b> <b>stage</b> by applying error correcting codes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis chapter proposes an {{approach}} to generate predictions for decision support issues. It relies on case-based and reconciliation methods, using an ontology. The objective of the chapter is to {{provide an overview of}} the state of the art, but also to describe the proposed method and to illustrate it on a concrete application. In this approach, a <b>reconciliation</b> <b>stage</b> identifies groups of rules expressing a common experimental tendency. A prediction stage generates new rules, using both experimental tendencies obtained in the previous stage and new experimental descriptions. The method has been tested within a case study concerning food quality management. It has been compared to a classic predictive approach, leading to promising results in terms of accuracy, completeness and error rate...|$|E
40|$|Reconciliation can {{be divided}} into stages, each stage {{representing}} the performance of a mining operation, such as: long-term estimation, short-term estimation, planning, mining and mineral processing. The gold industry includes another stage which is the budget, when the company informs the financial market of its annual production forecast. The division of <b>reconciliation</b> into <b>stages</b> increases the reliability of the annual budget informed by the mining companies, while also detecting and correcting the critical steps responsible for the overall estimation error by the optimization of sampling protocols and equipment. This paper develops and validates a new reconciliation model for the gold industry, which is based on correct sampling practices and the subdivision of <b>reconciliation</b> into <b>stages,</b> aiming for better grade estimates and more efficient control of the mining industry`s processes, from resource estimation to final production...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMimicking {{research}} and practice that demonstrates the importance of seemingly mundane acts for resolving protracted conflicts, this article enquires into the potential contributions of food-related practices to post-conflict reconciliation. Based on fieldwork with a Japanese–South Korean reconciliation initiative (Koinonia), the argument is made that food-related practices can create the spatio-temporal conditions necessary to mitigate successfully situations that may otherwise be characterised by misunderstandings, animosity and an unwillingness to move beyond dividing lines. It is demonstrated that food-related practices {{have the capacity to}} influence reconciliation positively throughout the three stages that are perceived as vital for building lasting relationships between conflicting parties: encouragement of participation in <b>reconciliation</b> events (<b>stage</b> 1), encouragement of positive interaction during <b>reconciliation</b> events (<b>stage</b> 2) and sustainability of reconciliation events after participants re-enter daily life and the likely negative perceptions of the Other therein (stage 3) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOur work {{is related}} to the general problem of {{constructing}} predictions for decision support issues. It relies on knowledge expressed by numerous rules with homogeneous structure, extracted from various scientific publications in a specific domain. We propose a predictive approach that takes two stages: a <b>reconciliation</b> <b>stage</b> which identifies groups of rules expressing a common experimental tendency and a prediction stage which generates new rules, using both descriptions coming from experimental conditions and groups of reconciled rules obtained in stage one. The method has been tested with a case study related to food science and it has been compared to a classical approach based on decision trees. The results are promising in terms of accuracy, completeness and error rate...|$|E

30|$|Once the <b>reconciliation</b> <b>stage</b> concludes successfully, {{only then}} does the CMP {{proceed to the}} final stage, where a {{psychologist}} informs {{the family of the}} missing regarding the outcome. The family is invited to the CAL, where a team of scientists present the findings to the relatives and explain each stage of the process that led to the identification. The affected relatives are always supported by a psychologist throughout the identification process, especially during the viewings, as it affects them considerably (Moyssi et al. 2016). The psychological support provided to the relatives and the active participation of the CMP scientists until the release of the remains can be considered an integrated system that meets the needs of a humanitarian investigation and the affected families, a critical element that exists in other international examples (Keough et al. 2004).|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} data {{warehousing}} architecture for effective risk analysis in a banking scenario. The {{core of the}} architecture consists in two data mining tools for {{improving the quality of}} consolidated data during the acquisition process. Specifically, we deal with schema reconciliation, i. e. segmentation of a string sequence according to fixed attribute schema. To this purpose we present the RecBoost methodology which pursuits effective <b>reconciliation</b> via multiple <b>stages</b> of classification. In addition, we propose a hashbased technique for data reconciliation, i. e. the recognition of apparently different records that, as a matter of fact, refer to the same real-world entity. ...|$|R
40|$|Religious {{leaders and}} {{organizations}} can play {{important roles in}} all stages of a rebellion, from providing (1) inspiration for political mobilization to (2) justifications for or against political violence to (3) facilitation of peace talks and to (4) implementation of post-conflict <b>reconciliation.</b> In each <b>stage,</b> the well-intentioned efforts of the relevant faith-based organizations often produce surprisingly negative unintended consequences. This paper examines these multiple, inter-linked social dilemmas by outlining an informal framework for analysis based upon rational choice institutionalism (or institutional analysis). Basic {{strengths and weaknesses of}} this framework are examined, and preliminary suggestions are made towards the definition of questions for subsequent research and policy evaluation...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} {{large-scale}} global MRIO databases such as Eora, EXIOBASE, WIOD, and GTAP [see Tukker and Dietzenbacher (2013)] were developed over recent years. These databases require {{large amounts of}} input data from varying sources. This inevitably leads to conflicting information during the data processing stage. Due {{to the amount of}} data to be considered during the reconciliation and the—compared to RAS-type approaches—relatively high complexity of van der Ploeg’s QP approach, the developers of these databases have so far employed QP-type approaches—if at all—only for subproblems during the data <b>reconciliation</b> <b>stage.</b> For example, EXIOBASE, EXIOBASE 2, and EXIOBASE 3 were compiled using multi-step reconciliation processes. Some of the intermediate steps in this processes were completed using QP-type algorithms, with the final global balancing step being carried using a RAS-type algorithm (Wood et al. 2014, 2015; Stadler et al. 2018).|$|E
40|$|The secure {{distribution}} of the secret random bit sequences known as "key" material, is an essential precursor to their use for the encryption and decryption of confidential communications. Quantum cryptography is a new technique for secure key distribution with single-photon transmissions: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle ensures that an adversary can neither successfully tap the key transmissions, nor evade detection (eavesdropping raises the key error rate above a threshold value). We have developed experimental quantum cryptography systems based on the transmission of non-orthogonal photon states to generate shared key material over multi-kilometer optical fiber paths and over line-of-sight links. In both cases, key material is built up using the transmission of a single-photon per bit of an initial secret random sequence. A quantum-mechanically random subset of this sequence is identified, becoming the key material after a data <b>reconciliation</b> <b>stage</b> with the sender. Here we report the most recent results of our optical fiber experiment {{in which we have}} performed quantum key distribution over a 48 -km optical fiber network at Los Alamos using photon interference states with the B 92 and BB 84 quantum key distribution protocols.
