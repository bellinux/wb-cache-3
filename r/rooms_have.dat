5|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} remodelled since the National Trust {{took over the}} property in 1966, to accommodate visitors and to enable the display {{of a large number}} of Churchillian artefacts. In particular, a number of guest bedrooms have been amalgamated, to allow the construction of the Museum room and the Uniform room. Nevertheless, the majority of the principal <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> been reconstructed and furnished as they were in the 1920s–30s and are open to the public, with the current exception of Churchill's own bedroom.|$|E

Several of the <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> wall paintings which have been uncovered and restored since the National Trust were given the building in 1970. The house belonged to the Bishop of Bath and Wells and at one time was used to store the Great Seal of the Realm when John Langton was the chancellor of England.|$|E
5|$|Two of the <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> large {{tapestries}} {{on their}} walls depicting historical figures and scenes. Those {{in the drawing}} room contain scenes from Roman history and were based on designs by Peter Paul Rubens, who supervised the work in Brussels. These tapestries were initially made for Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester, Zouche's brother-diplomat, but in the end he rejected them for another set; how the first set came to Bramshill is not known. Rubens' sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in the Munich gallery, Alte Pinakothek.|$|E
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and molding throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice molding and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E
50|$|Through artistic {{talents of}} staff and students, Christian High has large murals in almost every classroom, {{relating}} to the subject taught in each classroom.

5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Originally a garden, {{the demand}} for more {{accommodation}} for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by Bishop Robinson {{at the suggestion of}} his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, {{as a result of a}} benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them — only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819, they were joined up to the Front quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> been incorporated – the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of Basil Champneys, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the Provost's Lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Some of Belton's many <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> {{been altered}} {{over the last}} 300 years both in use and design. One of the {{principal}} rooms, the Marble Hall (1), {{the first of the}} large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors.|$|E

5|$|The palace, like Windsor Castle, {{is owned}} by the reigning monarch in right of the Crown. It is not the monarch's {{personal}} property, unlike Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle. Many of the contents from Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace, and StJames's Palace are part of the Royal Collection, held in trust by the Sovereign; they can, on occasion, be viewed by the public at the Queen's Gallery, near the Royal Mews. Unlike the palace and the castle, the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in World WarII. The palace's state <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> been open to the public during August and September and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its state rooms. In the year to 31 March 2016, 519,000 people visited the palace, and 194,000 visited the gallery.|$|E
