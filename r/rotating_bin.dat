40|$|Weeds in row crops {{compete for}} {{resources}} available to crop plants and thus will affect crop yield and quality. However, consumers show a growing interest in organic food or foods produced with fewer agricultural chemicals. Therefore, a need exists to develop alternative weed control methods. A tine mechanism for an autonomous weeding machine was developed, and the interaction of a single tine and a rotating tine mechanism with the soil was investigated. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a laboratory methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of a tine and rotating tine mechanism in disturbing weed plants simulated by individual wood pieces. Two experiments were performed using the tine and tine mechanism under a controlled environment. Soil in a large <b>rotating</b> <b>bin</b> was processed and sieved to a maximum size of 5 mm. The soil was then conditioned with water to produce the desired moisture content. A single tine was used in the first experiment. The experimental factors for this test were the tine diameter, tine depth and the speed that the tine moved through the soil. For the second experiment, four tines were attached to a disk that rotated about a vertical axis. The rotational tine mechanism was tested at different working depths and disk rotational speeds. All of these tests were conducted in a rotating soil bin with a controlled speed. The orientation of each simulated weed was observed in each trial. The observations were captured in a Mean Likelihood of Control (MLC) parameter which was intended to indicate the mean likelihood of simulated weed being controlled. In the first experiment, significant differences were observed in MLC across tine diameter, tine working depth and travel speed. There was evidence of a significant interaction between tine diameter and tine working depth. As for the second experiment, significant differences were observed in MLC across tine working depth and rotational speed of tine mechanism. Evidence of a significant interaction between working depth and tine mechanism rotational speed was observed. All of the factors tested were important and could be used to determine machine settings in the field...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{solid waste}} bin {{detection}} and waste level classification {{system that is}} rotation invariant is presented. First, possible locations and orientations of the bin are detected using Hough line detection. Then cross correlation is calculated to differentiate the true bin position and orientation from those of other similar objects. Next, features are extracted {{from the inside of}} the bin area and together with detected bin corners they are used to determine the bin's waste level. A few features are also obtained from the outside of the bin area to check whether there is rubbish littered outside the bin. The proposed system was tested on shifted, <b>rotated</b> and unrotated <b>bin</b> images containing different level of waste. In the experiment, bin detection was treated separately from waste level classification. For bin detection, if 95 of the opening area is captured then the bin is considered detected correctly. The waste level classification is only considered for the correctly detected bins where the waste level is classified as empty, partially full or full. The system also checks the presence of rubbish outside the bin. In training, only images containing unrotated bin were used while in testing images containing both unrotated and <b>rotated</b> <b>bin</b> were used in equal number. The system achieves an average bin detection rate of 97. 5 and waste level classification rate of 99. 4 despite variations in the bin's location, rotation and content. It is also robust against occlusion of the bin opening by large objects and confusion from square objects littered outside the bin. Its low average execution time suggests that the proposed method is suitable for real-time implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The Data Cell {{made use}} of 3 {{concurrently}} operating separate seeking systems; a servo-hydraulic one to <b>rotate</b> the <b>bins</b> to select the proper subcell, and two solenoid driven ones; one to select the correct strip tab of the 10 in the subcell, {{and the other to}} select one of the 5 head positions, for the 20 element head (100 tracks per strip). The hydraulic fluid, Mobil DTE Light, a machine tool circulating oil, was pressurized at 1500 psi and despite a lot of folklore about oil leaks, they were very rare. The oil sump held 5 gal.|$|R

The CSeries cabin features large, <b>rotating</b> overhead storage <b>bins,</b> allowing each passenger to stow a sizeable carry-on bag overhead. Bombardier claims that compared to the cabins of current in-service narrowbody aircraft, the CSeries provides airlines with the highest overhead bin volume per passenger and a wider aisle that allows for faster boarding and disembarkation of passengers.|$|R

The volunteer firemen of Engine Company No. 33 (called [...] "Black Joke," [...] after an 1812 warship) halted the draft selection by smashing {{the window of the}} office and breaking the <b>rotating</b> lottery <b>bin.</b> When a gathering mob set the office on fire, Decker and Black Joke foreman Peter Masterson (a sometime city alderman and state representative) cleared a passage through the mob and enabled the Black Joke to put out the blaze before it burned down neighboring tenements.|$|R
