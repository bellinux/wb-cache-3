To {{raise the}} market {{competition}} ability <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> <b>helicopter,</b> it {{is required to}} have high technical content in RMS including reliability, maintainability, safety, supportability and testability for the new generation <b>civil</b> <b>helicopter.</b> To meet the requirements <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> <b>helicopter,</b> it is decided to follow strictly the maintenance matrix from the preliminary design phase of the transmission system. To decrease the maintenance cost, the structure will be optimized during the detail design phase and checked by DMU (Digital Mockup) in VPM (Virtual Product Model) system. And to get the high safety and reliability, some advanced design technical are applied and substantiated by some new test methods. This paper explains design concept application on RMS for tail drive system <b>of</b> the <b>civil</b> <b>helicopter</b> by showing some practice for an example. It can provide the method and reference for the development <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>helicopter</b> transmission system...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{helicopter}} interior noise on passenger annoyance for both reverie and listening situations was investigated. The relative effectiveness of several metrics for quantifying annoyance response for these situations was also studied. The noise stimuli were based upon {{recordings of the}} interior noise <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>helicopter</b> research aircraft. These noises were presented at levels ranging from approximately 70 to 86 d with various tonal components selectively attenuated to give a range of spectra. The listening task required the subjects to listen to and record phonetically-balanced words presented within the various noise environments. Results indicate that annoyance during a listening condition is generally higher than annoyance under a reverie condition for corresponding interior noise environments. Attenuation of the tonal components results in increases in listening performance but has only a small effect upon annoyance for a given noise level...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} use <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{the problem}} <b>of</b> noise emission of helicopters {{become more and}} more important within the last decade. Therefore, helicopter noise has been subject of many research projects (1). Blade Vortex Interactions (BVI) are known as a major source of impulsive noise. As BVI-noise is governed by the induced velocities of tip vorticies, it depends on vortex strength and miss-distance, which itself depends on vortex location and orientatioand convection speed relative to the path of the advancing blade. Therefore, the study of these phenomena is of particular interest for progress towards quieter helicopters. Such vortical structures at a helicopter rotor model in a wind tunnel has been studied by optical measurement techniques, since only non-intrusive techniques are capable to obtain velocity data within the rotor plane. Measurements of local flow vectors at positions close to the rotor blade tips were performed by three component Laser Doppler Velocimetry (3 D-LDV) and conventional (two component) Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) ...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{increasing}} accident rates in Army helicopters in hover and low speed flight, a study {{was made in}} 1999 of accidents which {{could be attributed to}} inadequate stability augmentation. A study <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>helicopter</b> accidents from 1993 - 2004 was then undertaken to pursue the issue of poor handling qualities in helicopters which, in almost all cases, had no stability augmentation. The vast majority of the mishaps studied occurred during daylight in visual meteorological condition, reducing the impact of degraded visual environments (DVE) on the results. Based on the Cooper-Harper Rating Scale, the handling qualities of many of the helicopters studied could be described as having from "very objectionable" to "major" deficiencies. These costly deficiencies have resulted in unnecessary loss of life, injury, and high dollar damage. Low cost and lightweight augmentation systems for helicopters have been developed in the past and are still being investigated. They offer the potential for significant reductions in the accident rate...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{helicopter}} interior noise on passenger annoyance were studied. Both reverie and listening situations were studied {{as well as}} the relative effectiveness of several descriptors (i. e., overall sound pressure level, A-weighted sound pressure level, and speech interference level) for quantifying annoyance response for these situations. The noise stimuli were based upon recordings of the interior noise <b>of</b> a <b>civil</b> <b>helicopter</b> research aircraft. These noises were presented at levels ranging from approximately 68 to 86 dB(A) with various gear clash tones selectively attenuated to give a range of spectra. Results indicated that annoyance during a listening condition is generally higher than annoyance during a reverie condition for corresponding interior noise environments. Attenuation of the planetary gear clash tone results in increases in listening performance but has negligible effect upon annoyance for a given noise level. The noise descriptor most effective for estimating annoyance response under conditions of reverie and listening situations is shown to be the A-weighted sound pressure level...|$|R
40|$|Hazardous weather {{conditions}} significantly limit the operational capability <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>helicopters.</b> This limitation {{arises from the}} crew's inability to determine the location of obstacles in the environment by sight. In order to assist the crew in these circumstances a range of equipment and sensors may be installed in the helicopter. However, with multiple sensors on board, the problem of efficiently assimilating {{the large amount of}} imagery and data available generates a significant workload. A reduction of the workload may be achieved by the automation of this assimilation (sensor fusion) and the design of a system to guide the pilot along obstacle free paths. In order to provide the guidance to avoid obstacles a system must have knowledge about the obstacles' possible positions and likely future positions relative the system's own aircraft. Since the information being provided by the sensors will not be perfect, (i. e. it will have some uncertainty associated with it), and since the process model, which must be used to predict any future positions, will also be uncertain, the required positions must be estimated. As the dynamics of moving obstacles will be a priori unknown, {{it will be necessary to}} learn process models for them. The dynamics of the obstacles cannot be guaranteed to be linear, therefore these process models must be capable of reflecting this non-linear behaviour. The uncertain information produced by the various sensors will be related to required knowledge about the obstacles by a sensor model, however this relationship need not be linear, and may even have to be learned. Currently used estimation techniques (e. g. the ordinary extended Kalman filter) are inadequate for estimating the uncertainty involved in the obstacles' positions for the highly non-linear processes under consideration. Neural network approaches to non-linear estimation have recently allowed process and sensor models to be learned (sometimes implicitly), however these approaches have been quite ad hoc in their implementation and have been even more negligent in the estimation of uncertainty. The main contributions of this research are the design of non-linear estimators which may use process and sensor models that result from learning processes, and the use of the output of these estimators to determine guidance for obstacle free paths through the environment in 3 dimensions...|$|R
