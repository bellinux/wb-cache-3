5000|$|In epidemiology, the {{absolute}} risk reduction, <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> or absolute effect {{is the change}} in the risk of an outcome of a given treatment or activity in relation to a comparison treatment or activity. [...] It is the inverse of the number needed to treat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> (RD), {{sometimes}} called absolute risk reduction, {{is simply the}} difference in risk (probability) of an event between two groups. It is a useful measure in experimental research, since RD tells you {{the extent to which}} an experimental interventions changes the probability of an event or outcome. Using the example above, the probabilities for those in the control group and treatment group passing is 2/3 (or 0.67) and 6/7 (or 0.86), respectively, and so the RD effect size is 0.86 − 0.67 = 0.19 (or 19%).

40|$|If {{an effect}} measure is more {{homogeneous}} than others, then its value {{is more likely}} to be stable across different subgroups or subpopulations. Therefore, it is of great importance to find a more homogeneous effect measure that allows for transportability of research results. For a binary outcome, applied researchers often claim that the <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> is more heterogeneous than the risk ratio or odds ratio, because they find, based on evidence from surveys of meta-analyses, that the null hypotheses of homogeneity are rejected more often for the <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> than for the risk ratio and odds ratio. However, the evidence for these claims are far from satisfactory, because of different statistical powers of the homogeneity tests under different effect scales. For binary treatment, covariate and outcome, we theoretically quantify the homogeneity of different effect scales. Because when homogeneity holds the four outcome probabilities lie in a three dimensional sub-space of the four dimensional space, we can use results from differential geometry to compute the volumes of these three dimensional spaces to compare the relative homogeneity of the <b>risk</b> <b>difference,</b> risk ratio, and odds ratio.

MethodsAmong 570, 777 men (67. 5 %) and women (32. 5 %) who underwent PCI in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's CathPCI Registry between July 1, 2009 and March 31, 2011, in-hospital bleeding rates {{and the use of}} BAS (vascular closure devices, bivalirudin, radial approach, and their combinations) were assessed. The relative risk of bleeding for each BAS compared with no BAS was determined in women and men using multivariable logistic regressions adjusted for clinical characteristics and the propensity for receiving BAS. Finally, the absolute <b>risk</b> <b>differences</b> in bleeding associated with BAS were compared. ResultsOverall, the use of any BAS differed slightly between women and men (75. 4 % vs. 75. 7 %, p = 0. 01). When BAS was not used, women had significantly higher rates of bleeding than men (12. 5 % vs. 6. 2 %, p < 0. 01). Both sexes had similar adjusted risk reductions of bleeding when any BAS was used (women, odds ratio: 0. 60, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 57 to 0. 63; men, odds ratio: 0. 62, 95 % CI: 0. 59 to 0. 65).

40|$|Objective: The {{status of}} oximes in human {{organophosphate}} poisoning is controversial. This analysis compares {{the outcomes of}} therapy with or without oximes. Design: Quantitative analysis using meta-analytic techniques. Methods: Controlled trials of oximes in human organophosphate poisoning were identified by search of MEDLINE and TOXLINE (1966 to May 2005) and review of published articles. Measurements and Main Results: Of the 3, 122 articles on organophosphate poisoning identified by electronic search, 116 related to oxime use in human organophosphate poisoning. Seven trials, including two randomized controlled trials, compared oximes with standard medical care. Varying dosage schedules of pralidoxime or obidoxime were used. The effects of oxime therapy on mortality rate, mechanical ventilation, incidence of intermediate syndrome, and need for intensive care therapy were analyzed and expressed as <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> (positive values indicating oxime harm). The random effects estimator was reported because of underlying heterogeneity of treatment effects between study types. No statistically significant association of oxime therapy was demonstrated for either mortality (<b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 09, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 08 to 0. 27), ventilatory requirements (<b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 16, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 07 to 0. 38), or the incidence of intermediate syndrome (<b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 16, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 12 to 0. 45), although point estimates of effect suggested harm. An increased need for intensive care therapy (<b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> 0. 19, 95 % confidence interval 0. 01 to 0. 36) was apparent with oxime therapy. Conclusions: Based on the current available data on human organophosphate poisoning, oxime was associated with either a null effect or possible harm. The lack of current prospective randomized controlled trials, with appropriate patient stratification, mandates ongoing assessment {{of the role of}} oximes in organophosphate poisoning. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The common frequentist {{approach}} {{is limited in}} providing investigators with appropriate measures for conducting a new trial. To answer such important questions and one {{has to look at}} Bayesian statistics. Methods As a worked example, we conducted a Bayesian cumulative meta-analysis to summarize the benefit of patient-specific instrumentation on the alignment of total knee replacement from previously published evidence. Data were sourced from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. All randomised controlled comparisons of the effect of patient-specific instrumentation on the coronal alignment of total knee replacement were included. The main outcome was the <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> measured by the proportion of failures in the control group minus the proportion of failures in the experimental group. Through Bayesian statistics, we estimated cumulatively over publication time of the trial results: the posterior probabilities that the <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> was more than 5 and 10 %; the posterior probabilities that given the results of all previous published trials an additional fictive trial would achieve a <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> of at least 5 %; and the predictive probabilities that observed failure rate differ from 5 % across arms. Results Thirteen trials were identified including 1092 patients, 554 in the experimental group and 538 in the control group. The cumulative mean <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> was 0. 5 % (95 % CrI: − 5. 7 %; + 4. 5 %). The posterior probabilities that the <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> be superior to 5 and 10 % was less than 5 % after trial # 4 and trial # 2 respectively. The predictive probability that the difference in failure rates was at least 5 % dropped from 45 % after the first trial down to 11 % after the 13 th. Last, only unrealistic trial design parameters could change the overall evidence accumulated to date. Conclusions Bayesian probabilities are readily understandable when discussing the relevance of performing a new trial. It provides investigators the current probability that an experimental treatment be superior to a reference treatment. In case a trial is designed, it also provides the predictive probability that this new trial will reach the targeted <b>risk</b> <b>difference</b> in failure rates.
