25|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{considered}} by the IMF {{to be a model}} country in its compliance to policy proposals by the Bretton Woods institutions, experienced a catastrophic economic crisis in 2001, which some believe to have been caused by IMF-induced budget restrictions—which undercut the government's ability to sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health, education, and security—and privatisation of strategically vital national resources. Others attribute the crisis to Argentina's misdesigned fiscal federalism, which caused subnational spending to increase rapidly. The crisis added to widespread hatred of this institution in Argentina and other South American countries, with many blaming the IMF for the region's economic problems. The current—as of early 2006—trend toward moderate left-wing governments in the region and a growing concern with the development of a <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> largely independent of big business pressures has been ascribed to this crisis.|$|E

It concentrates on Dutch and German <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> development <b>policies,</b> to illustrate the similarities and differences in the policymaking process. <b>Regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> flourished in the 1950 s and 1960 s, when most developed countries were implementing them. Industrial subsidies and infrastructure investments were intended to strengthen the economic structure of those regions lagging behind the standards of national growth. This post-war history of regional policy will be investigated, using the Northern Netherlands and North West Germany as examples. Parallels and divergences between concepts, instruments and administration will be scruti-nised from a comparative perspective. Similar patterns in Dutch and German regions point to a European consensus on how to develop ‘backward’ re-gions. Differences in and between the regions will be explained on the basis of variations in planning traditions on a national and even regional scale...|$|R

Unlike previous works, the present paper {{takes into account the}} economic geography by examining the regional clusters and the significant transformation of the Chinese economy through the introduction of structural breaks and nonlinearities in the model. Results indicate that the regional clusters are relevant to the convergence behaviour across China, when both the administrative division and the regional clusters are considered. However, the number of provinces that are converging is higher in the latter case. When nonlinearities were considered across the regional clusters, we found that 18 provinces have already converged with their cluster, 3 provinces are catching up and 10 regions show divergence. These findings are useful for the design and development of national and <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> in the Chinese economy...|$|R

However, integrating environmental and economic aims has proved difficult, despite arguments that sustainability enables ‘win‐win‐win’ solutions. Eco‐industrial development is a recent policy initiative that attempts to integrate economic, social and environmental aims in a concrete form.

40|$|In {{the brief}} history of West German {{federalism}} the field of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> underwent an important change.

30|$|Ecosystems in Northern Eurasia are {{subjected}} to the impacts of climate change and human activities over the entire sub-continent. In the northern part on sites with permafrost, anthropogenic changes are primarily due to {{oil and gas exploration}} and extraction, mining, and infrastructure development. Further south, timber harvest (along with oil/gas) is predominant in the boreal and temperate forest zones, as are agricultural and pastoral activities in the forest-steppe and steppe zones. Industrial development often leads to the physical destruction of landscapes, changes of the hydrological regime, and widespread contamination of air, soil, and water (Derome and Lukina 2011; Baklanov et al. 2013). Climate-induced changes in terrestrial ecosystems transform important ecosystems and their services, which in turn, require an adjustment in business planning, nature conservation, forest management, agricultural practices, and <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> to mitigate or adapt to these changes. The Siberian Taiga and Far East zones together comprise the largest part of the world’s most intact remaining boreal forests (Potapov et al. 2008).

The empirical work suggests that the preferred tools of local economic development and their locally perceived effectiveness vary but that careful interpretation is necessary to understand why this is the case.
