40|$|ABSTRACT – During {{fabrication}} of welded components residual stresses are generated {{as a result}} of non-uniform temperature distribution during the welding and particularly the cooling process. Such residual stresses have a major effect on the overall performance of a component in service, especially when hydrogen is involved and the component might become prone to Hydrogen Assisted Cold Cracking (HACC). Up to the present, most of the welding standard and specification to test the resistance of <b>welds</b> against HACC <b>test</b> are without consideration of the restraint intensity provided by the surrounding structure. This may lead to a misunderstanding of the welding heat treatment procedures, i. e. preheating and interpass temperature, for multi-pass welding of extra high strength steels. Such <b>restrained</b> <b>welds</b> might also interact at real components with respect to the stresses and strains produced in the transverse direction. This point has not been addressed within the recent years and in order to elucidate such effects, two competing single v-butt joints in high strength steel with a yield strength level of 1100 MPa are investigated in the present contribution by Finite Element Analyses (FEA). As a specific result, {{it turned out that the}} transverse residual stresses increase with the restraint intensity of the surrounding structure. As a consequence of the different restraint intensity during completion o...|$|R
40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis I elaborated {{an overview}} of suitable materials for the manufacturing of bicycle frames. Most preferred materials for mass production of bicycle frames are cured aluminum alloys. The best method for joining aluminum tubular frame construction is fusion welding at robot lines in a protective atmosphere of inert gas. We measured the hardness of the welded metal, heat affected zone and base material at the weld of the bicycle frame. Values are very similar in all areas, so the whole frame structure was cured. We <b>welded</b> a <b>test</b> <b>weld,</b> using TIG method. Hardness of the <b>test</b> <b>weld</b> is about 24. 5 % lower, than hardness of the weld from manufacturer. Hardness of the heat affected zone is even lower. The curing of the whole frame construction is therefore very important. There is a concentration cavity in the cut of the weld from manufacturer and {{the root of the}} weld is not welded all over. The same defects are in the cuts of our <b>test</b> <b>welds,</b> there is also porosity in one of the <b>test</b> <b>welds.</b> But the <b>test</b> <b>weld</b> is satisfying, despite the defects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of externally applied magnetic fields on the weld quality in laser beam welding.

In this study, stress changes of constant stress beam in loading process were tested using strain gauge (SG), strain rosette (SR) and XRSA, and their test results were compared to analyze measurement errors of XRSA. It was found that the property of XRSA meets the experimental requirement. The machining stress in surface of <b>welding</b> <b>test</b> plate could be completely removed after 4 min electrolytic polishing under 1 A current and 100 % NaCl electrolyte.

40|$|Extensive {{damage to}} steel moment {{connections}} {{has been reported}} since the 1994 Northridge earthquake. While low-toughness welds and notch-like discontinuities created by the bottom flange backing bars {{have been identified as}} primary causes of the fractures that occurred, other factors have also been linked to the failures. Column stiffening design practices, resulting in the design of weak panel zones and a lack of or insufficient use of continuity plates, have been speculated as potential contributors to the fractures. The concern associated with the role of column stiffener detailing in the Northridge damage has subsequently led to a tendency towards over-conservatism in stiffener design. However, the additional expense of larger stiffeners coupled with the potential for fabrication cracking due to larger, highly <b>restrained</b> <b>welds</b> required to attach such stiffeners is an undesirable consequence of this increased conservatism. To study these column stiffener design issues, a research project was launched to reassess the AISC design criteria related to the limit states of Local Flange Bending (LFB), Local Web Yielding (LWY), and Panel Zone (PZ) strength, and to develop new...|$|R
