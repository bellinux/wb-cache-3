50|$|The gold <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace</b> site {{consists}} of four parallel 22 metres by 2.75 metres brick plinths with collapsed brick arched roofs, interpreted as being <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace</b> bases. The plinths are separated by approximately 5.25 metres spaces between them, one of which at least is paved (the others are largely covered with soils and rubble). The furnaces fed in pairs into two chimneys via brick and stone flues, interconnected with a cross flue between each pair. The furnace bases have flat floors that {{appear to have been}} 2 metres wide internally, with arched roofs about 1.5 metres high, and the floors step up towards the flue-end by one course of brick every 3 metres. There are vaulted tunnels/boxes under two of the furnaces about 2 metres from the end opposite the flues, but there are no apparent fireboxes. The furnace bricks are not firebricks, and there is no vitrification or slag deposit in them, suggesting they were used for roasting rather than smelting.|$|E

5000|$|In 1868 {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in Deloro, meaning [...] "Valley of Gold". The Canadian Consolidated Gold Mining Company (a British company) began mining in 1873. This eventually failed since the recover of the gold was so poor. In 1896 Canadian Gold Fields Company bought Deloro and built the first mill where they used a new cyanide process to extract the gold. <b>Roasting</b> <b>furnaces</b> were used to remove the arsenic from the gold, but {{the quality of the}} gold was poor, forcing the closure of the mill in 1903. After the completion of the railroad in 1904 it opened up the possibility to ship silver to the Deloro mine for treatment. In 1906 the Deloro Mining and Reduction Company was formed. In 1915 the company changed its name to Deloro Smelting and Refining Company Limited after Dr. Haynes developed the first commercially produced stellite in the world, which was manufactured at the Deloro plant.|$|R

In 1916 the Irvinebank Mining Company replaced the ball mill with stamps and installed a dynamo for lighting and a magnetic machine to separate wolfram from bismuth and the impurities from the concentrates. A 66 hp suction gas engine and belt-driven air compressor were erected at Leisner's Wolfram Block mine.|$|E
50|$|He {{was educated}} at University of Berlin and the mining school in Clausthal. After {{coming to the}} United States in 1865 {{to work in a}} small lead mine in Hampden County, Massachusetts, he headed for the western U.S. in 1866, where he was {{variously}} occupied as superintendent of mining, metallurgical mills, and smelters in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, and Utah. He contributed technical papers to the Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, having been elected a member of that society in 1882. Among his inventions are the siphon tap, used on lead furnaces; the Eureka lead furnace, extensively employed throughout Colorado and Utah; and a <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace</b> that bears his name. At his death, he resided in Alameda, California, where he had moved around 1880.|$|E
50|$|The {{recovered}} ore {{also has}} drawbacks. The carbonate ore {{is more difficult}} to smelt than a haematite or other oxide ore. Driving off the carbonate as carbon dioxide requires more energy and so the ore 'kills' the blast furnace if added directly. Instead the ore must be given a preliminary roasting step. Developments of specific techniques to deal with these ores began in the early 19th century, largely with the work of Sir Thomas Lethbridge in Somerset. His 'Iron Mill' of 1838 used a three-chambered concentric <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace,</b> before passing the ore to a separate reducing furnace for smelting. Details of this Mill were the invention of Charles Sanderson, a steel maker of Sheffield, who held the patent for it.|$|E
50|$|A fourth {{blast furnace}} was {{installed}} in 1909 to treat the copper ore. A larger air-blowing machine also improved the copper smelting. A heavy duty horizontal compound condensing steam engine with duplex air cylinders could blow two converter stands at once. A new high pressure motor-driven air compressor supplied air to the pneumatic ram used for relining converter vessels. A DC generator was ordered for the motors and lighting. The ore sampling floor was doubled in capacity. A high-lift motor-driven centrifugal pump for pumping furnace jacket water was added. A new sample crushing office was attached with electric motors driving the pulverizers.Ore supplies locally were poor in 1910 and ore was scavenged across the Etheridge Goldfield to supply Chillagoe smelters. The <b>roasting</b> <b>furnaces</b> were supplied with all the Etheridge gold mine dumps, the copper smelters worked on sintered Havelock residues, along with Mungana copper-lead oxides and clean lead ores from the Lady Jane, Girofla and Etheridge mines. Overhead central flues were fitted over the copper and lead furnaces.|$|R
40|$|The mobility, {{bioavailability}} and {{toxicity of}} mercury {{in the environment}} strongly depend on the chemical species {{in which it is}} present in soil, sediments, water or air. In mining districts, differences in mobility and bioavailability of mercury mainly arise from the different type of mineralization and ore processing. In this work, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) has been taken advantage of to study the speciation of mercury in geological samples from three of the largest European mercury mining districts: Almadén (Spain), Idria (Slovenia) and Asturias (Spain). XANES has been complemented with a single extraction protocol for the determination of Hg mobility. Ore, calcines, dump material, soil, sediment and suspended particles from the three sites have been considered in the study. In the three sites, rather insoluble sulfide compounds (cinnabar and metacinnabar) were found to predominate. Minor amounts of more soluble mercury compounds (chlorides and sulfates) were also identified in some samples. Single extraction procedures have put forward a strong dependence of the mobility with the concentration of chlorides and sulfates. Differences in efficiency of <b>roasting</b> <b>furnaces</b> from the three sites have been found...|$|R
50|$|To produce liquid mercury (quicksilver), crushed {{cinnabar}} ore is <b>roasted</b> in rotary <b>furnaces.</b> Pure mercury separates from sulfur in {{this process}} and easily evaporates. A condensing column is used to collect the liquid metal, which is most often shipped in iron flasks.|$|R
50|$|The 6m {{diameter}} Mackay modified wedge furnace {{had seven}} roasting and one drying hearths. The furnace {{was connected to}} a Wilson pressure-type gas producer, which delivered gas to the <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace</b> as fuel to roast the ore. The furnace plant was enclosed in a steel building 11m by 11m and 12m high. In the leaching plant there were two reinforced concrete tanks 9m by 18m by 3m deep and four reinforced concrete solution storage tanks 9m in diameter and 3m deep. The plant for the electrolytic deposition of copper from the leaching solutions was in a two-storey steel building, 15m by 18m and 13m high. On the second level there were 24 wooded tanks 3.7m long, lined with lead, and containing electrolytic cells, cathodes, and anode bars. On the ground level were three wooden solution circulating tanks.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the great}} {{advantages}} common to all systems of chlorination is that ores may be crushed dry and treated, so that the loss from float gold may be avoided. Of this loss, which is most serious, we shall {{have something to say}} on another occasion. An advantage in amalgamation with chlorine gas instead of amalgamation with quicksilver in the wet way, is that the ore need not be crushed so finely. Roasting takes the place of fine crushing, as the ore from the <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace</b> is either found somewhat spongy in texture or the grains of silica in which fine gold may be incased are split or flawed by the fire. For quicksilver amalgamation very fine crushing is necessary to bring all gold particles in contact with it. Quicksilver being so thick in substance, it will not find its way readily {{in and out of a}} microscopically fine spongy body or through very fine flaws in grains of silica, whereas chlorine gas or a solution of liquefied chlorine does this, and absorbs the gold far more readily.|$|E
50|$|The gold-bearing ore became scarcer {{the deeper}} the miners went and work {{underground}} diminished while the tailings were reprocessed. The {{owners of the}} mine then decided to prospect within the existing shafts for new veins of gold-bearing rocks.

By this time the Congress Shaft had reached a depth of 4,000 feet with a few of the other shafts passing the 3,000 foot level.By 1906, with the discovery of new veins, the Congress Mine was again in full production. The ore near the 4,000 foot depth was reported to be richer than the veins at the lesser depths. At this time equipment included 12 hoists with steam engines ranging from 20 to 200 horsepower, a reduction plant with an 80 stamp mill, a new concentrating plant, a cyanide plant consisting of a <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace</b> and seven 90-ton leaching tanks and three 200-ton leaching tanks for non roasted ore.|$|E

40|$|The {{smelting}} {{industry is}} one of the most important sources of anthropogenic contamination of the environment today. In the vicinity of nonferrous metal smelters, high concen-trations of toxic compounds (especially metals and metal-loids) have been detected in soils and vegetation (e. g., Ettler et al., 2005 a; Suchara and Sucharová, 2002; Svoboda et al., 2000). In these instances, smelter emissions are as-sumed to be the dominant source of soil contamination (Ettler et al., 2005 a,b). In the vicinity of a Pb smelter, Ettler et al. (2004) found that metals such as Pb strongly migrate downwards in soils and accumulate in mineral soil hori-zons. The form of metal in smelter emissions varies signifi-cantly. The smelter emissions in traditional Hg-mining areas are mainly composed of elemental Hg 0, coming from the vapor produced and emitted by <b>roasting</b> <b>furnaces</b> (Fernández-Martı́nez et al., 2006). In contrast, the emis-sions from Pb smelters are mainly composed of Pb-sulfates and Pb-chlorides, and no specific Hg-bearing phases were detected in fly ash by the mineralogical methods (Ettler et al., 2005 b). Nevertheless, soil Hg concentrations can be high enough to be considered a severe contaminant even in areas polluted by Pb smelting (Rieuwerts and Farago, 1996). Interestingly, little attention has been given to Hg concentrations in soils and vegetation in the vicinity of primary and secondary Pb smelters. This article describes the differences in total Hg concentrations between undis-turbed forest and tilled soil profiles affected by a Pb smelter at Přı́bram, Czech Republic. Mercury sources and the vertical migration of mercury through soils are discussed. Materials and Methods The mining and smelting district of Přı́bram, Czech Republic, is known for its Pb-Ag-Zn polymetallic mineral deposits, which were mined and processed from the Middle Ages until the 1970 s. Since 1974, the Pb smelter in the district operates as a secondary smelter that processes Pb scrap, mainly car batteries (more information on smelter operations is recorded in Ettler et al., 2001, 2005 b).

40|$|In the {{fluidized}} bed furnace at Rönnskärsverken, Skelleftehamn, sulphur-containing ore concentrates are roasted {{in order to}} remove about 50 % of the sulphur in the incoming ore concentrate. This occurs {{in order to reach}} the goal of a matte containing 55 % of copper in the following smelting process. At {{the same time as the}} ore concentrate is partially roasted pollutions as arsenic, antimony and bismuth are expelled. Earlier made thermodynamic calculations of equilibrium suggested that calcium and magnesium form stable compounds with arsenic and thereby inhibit expellation of arsenic in the {{fluidized bed}} furnace, an element that is undesired. The purpose of this thesis work was to gain knowledge of the mechanisms behind the formation of these stable arsenic compounds. In order to yield an increased expellation of arsenic in the fluidized bed furnace.   Thermodynamic calculations were made by the computer programme FactSage and roasting experiments with ore concentrates were performed on a laboratory scale. Simple particle size measurements were performed as well.   It could be ascertained that raising the temperature increased the cupellation of arsenic and that magnesium carriers bind less arsenic than calcium carriers. The expellation of arsenic was also affected by the form of calcium carriers as well as their particle size. Calcium oxide binds the most arsenic while limestone and calcium silicate bind it the least. Smaller particles reacted in a larger extent with arsenic.     When roasting ore concentrates with high arsenic levels in the fluidized bed furnace, the addition of slurry from the lead kaldo furnace should be avoided. The slurry, which is normally added during roasting, contains large amounts of calcium oxide which has proven to be an inhibitor of the expellation of arsenic. Future roasting experiments focusing on the slurry’s effect on the expellation of arsenic should be made. For these experiments another <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace</b> should be used since the one used in this thesis work didn’t give conditions homogenous enough. It would also be interesting to investigate at what levels calcium in a given mineral form starts to give a substantial expellation of arsenic...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Increasing {{efficiency}} {{is a necessary}} target for an industrial roaster nowadays. This thesis presents some studies on efficiency improvement in the zinc roasting process - process characterisation, control design, implementation and testing. The thesis focuses on the roaster, i. e. on research regarding the phenomena in the roaster furnace. By {{learning more about the}} roasting mechanism, particle size growth and dynamics of the furnace, new control implementations have been developed. More measurements, analyses and calculated variables have been added to give more information {{on the state of the}} furnace. New control variables have been introduced to give the operators more opportunities to set the conditions so that they are more suitable for the actual concentrate feed mixture. Equipment modifications have also been done. In this research, both laboratory and plant experiments have been performed together with thermodynamic evaluations and calculations. It has been necessary to make plant trials in order to obtain information about the impacts of different variables on the process. Only full-scale experiments give reliable results of the behaviour of an industrial furnace. The experiments with the roaster furnace have emphasised the study of both the metallurgy and the dynamics of the roasting process. The on-line calculated oxygen coefficient and its active control have proved important. The particle size distribution analysis of the furnace calcine has been shown to be a significant source of information for evaluating the state of the <b>roasting</b> <b>furnace.</b> The main target is to improve the economic performance. The key is to be able to be flexible in using different kinds of raw materials, because the main income is the treatment charge. The trend is that concentrates are becoming finer, which increases the challenges for roaster furnace control. The capability to use low-grade concentrates is also a major challenge and improves the economic result. Research and development on the boiler and mercury removal has also been part of this work for many reasons. Improved boiler performance and mercury removal gives more freedom in choosing concentrates and operating the roaster furnace. The approach has been the same as in the roaster furnace research and development work. Control improvements based on existing knowledge, such as fuzzy control systems for controlling the furnace temperature and mercury removal, did stabilize the process, but they did not solve all the problems regarding process stability. The research and development concept of this thesis has provided the extra knowledge needed for further improvement of process control. The results of the process characterisation have led to the implementation of a new and effective control strategy. The research and development carried out has improved performance in a number of ways: increased running time of the furnace and boiler, in-depth knowledge of roasting phenomena which led to new control methods and instructions for the operators, improved quality of sulphuric acid and a method to control its quality, measurements and analyses that give valuable information of the state of the process – all of which are now in use. In the future, the emphasis will be placed on the research and development of roaster furnace performance, which will be a great challenge. Control of the roaster furnace is the key to the economic success of the roasting process and more information about these phenomena is needed for improving and optimising control...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, an attempt {{has been done}} to study the {{simultaneous}} effects of the major processing variables on the extent of oxidation of commercially pure sphalerite ore pellets. These process variables taken into consideration were time and temperature. The oxidation was carried inside a muffle furnace where there was mild oxidation in the presence of atmospheric air. The pellets were charged for <b>roasting</b> inside the <b>furnace</b> in a graphite crucible. This process of roasting was carried out at four temperatures 7500 C, 8000 C, 8500 C and 9000 C. The project goal is to compare the oxidation or roasting at different temperature and time. At all instance of comparison one of the parameter was kept constant. The percentage (degree) of oxidation of sphalerite pellets was calculated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes, after the furnace reached the predetermined oxidation temperature. The experiments were statistically designed such that the effect of each variable can be quantitatively assessed and compared. The results showed that, temperatures above 8500 C, time remaining constant, with the increase in temperature there is increase in the rate of oxidation (roasting) of sphalerite ore pellets. Further more for a constant temperature with the increase in time of exposure, rate of oxidation of Sphalerite (ZnS) pellets increases. This is valid for temperature range above 8500 C. Another observation was made that temperature remaining constant, the rate of oxidation of Sphalerite (ZnS) ore pellets increases with time of exposure to attain a maximum limit than suddenly decreases followed by increment in the rate again.
