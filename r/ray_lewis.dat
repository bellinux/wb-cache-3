5|$|Though the Giants {{kept the}} game {{close in the}} first half, and went into halftime down 10–0, the Ravens {{dominated}} the second half. Their defense (led by game MVP <b>Ray</b> <b>Lewis)</b> frustrated Kerry Collins all game long, resulting in Collins turning {{in one of the}} worst playoff performances in Super Bowl history. Collins completed 15 of 39 passes for 112yards and 4 interceptions. The Ravens won the game 34–7 {{in one of the most}} lopsided Super Bowls ever. The lone Giants score came on a Ron Dixon kickoff return for a touchdown. On the very next kickoff, the Ravens countered as Jermaine Lewis also returned a kickoff for a touchdown.|$|E

25|$|South Yorkshire Police Superintendent Greenwood (the ground commander) {{realised}} the situation, and ran on {{the field}} to gain referee <b>Ray</b> <b>Lewis's</b> attention. Lewis stopped the match at 3:05:30 as fans climbed the fence {{in an effort to}} escape the crush and went onto the track. By this time, a small gate in the fence had been forced open and some fans escaped via this route, as others continued to climb over the fencing. Other fans were pulled to safety by fans in the West Stand above the Leppings Lane terrace. The intensity of the crush broke more crush barriers on the terraces. Holes in the perimeter fencing were made by fans desperately attempting to rescue others.|$|R

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Oakland {{defensive}} back Johnnie Harris intercepted a pass from Trent Dilfer {{and returned it}} to the Ravens 39-yard line. The Raiders then drove to a first down on the Ravens 2-yard line, aided by two penalties against Baltimore for 27 yards. But they could not penetrate the end zone. First Tyrone Wheatley was dropped for a 1-yard loss. Then Gannon was sacked on second down by Jamie Sharper. On third down, Gannon's pass was incomplete and the Raiders {{had to settle for}} Sebastian Janikowski's field goal to cut the score to 10–3; those were the only Raiders points of the game. Ravens receiver Jermaine Lewis returned the ensuing kickoff 29 yards to the 38-yard line. Then Dilfer completed a 13-yard pass to Brandon Stokley and a 24-yard pass to tight end Ben Coates on a 51-yard drive that ended with another field goal by Stover. In the fourth quarter, <b>Ray</b> <b>Lewis</b> recovered a fumble from Gannon on the Raiders 6-yard line, setting up Stover's third field goal to close out the scoring. With 4:30 left in the game, Raiders receiver Andre Rison caught a 5-yard touchdown pass, but was penalized for pass interference before making the catch and the score was called back. One play later, faced with third and goal from the 12-yard line, Hoying threw a pass that was intercepted by Sharper.|$|E
