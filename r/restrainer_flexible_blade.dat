The study mainly {{focuses on the}} analysis of blade structure characteristics associated with the bending and twist deflection. Two types of <b>flexible</b> <b>blade</b> material and two strut locations supporting H-type blades are being investigated.

The simulation {{results show that the}} bending and twist deflection peak is positively correlated with the turbine tip speed ratio Î». For a <b>flexible</b> <b>blade,</b> an unevenly distributed structural stress along the blade with a high stress regime in the vicinity of strut location has also been observed. Due to the rotational motion of a VAWT, the centrifugal force acting on VAWT blade plays an important role on the blade structure characteristics. Reduction of the blade stiffness results in an increase of the blade stress. Changing the strut location from middle to tip will cause a large area under high stress. The results also indicate that the VAWT with a highly <b>flexible</b> <b>blade</b> is not an efficient energy extraction device when it is compared to a less flexible or a rigid blade...|$|R

An unsteady aerodynamic model {{is included in the}} analysis with two different inflow models: single streamtube and double-multiple streamtube inflow models.

The analysis clearly showed that the reason for the reduction in the thrust-producing capability of the cycloidal rotor with blade flexibility may be attributed to the large nosedown elastic twisting of the blades in the upper half cylindrical section, which is not compensated by a noseup pitching in the lower half-section.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} and numerical study {{that describes the}} motion of <b>flexible</b> <b>blades,</b> scaled to be dynamically similar to natural aquatic vegetation, forced by wave-induced oscillatory flows. For the conditions tested, blade motion is governed primarily by two dimensionless variables: (i) the Cauchy number, Ca, which represents {{the ratio of the}} hydrodynamic forcing to the restoring force due to blade stiffness, and (ii) the ratio of the blade length to the wave orbital excursion, L. For <b>flexible</b> <b>blades</b> with Ca â« 1, the relationship between drag and velocity can be described by two different scaling laws at the large- and small-excursion limits. For large excursions (L âª 1), the flow resembles a unidirectional current and the scaling laws developed for steady-flow reconfiguration studies hold. For small excursions (L â« 1), the beam equations may be linearized and a different scaling law for drag applies. The experimental force measurements suggest that the small-excursion scaling applies even for intermediate cases with L â¼ O(1). The numerical model employs the well-known Morison force formulation, and adequately reproduces the observed blade dynamics and measured hydrodynamic forces without the use of any fitted parameters. For Ca â« 1, the movement of the <b>flexible</b> <b>blades</b> reduces the measured and modeled hydrodynamic drag relative to a rigid blade of the same morphology. However, in some cases with Ca â¼ O(1), the measured hydrodynamic forces generated by the <b>flexible</b> <b>blades</b> exceed those generated by rigid blades, but this is not reproduced in the model. Observations of blade motion suggest that this unusual behavior is related to an unsteady vortex shedding event, which the simple numerical model cannot reproduce. Finally, we also discuss implications for the modeling of wave energy dissipation over canopies of natural aquatic vegetation...|$|R

40|$|Small-scale model {{tests in}} wave basins are {{important}} tools for validating numerical tools, evaluating system performance, and studying physical phenomena related to floating wind turbines. Hydrodynamic tests generally follow Froude scaling, but a consistent scaling {{of the wind}} turbine {{will result in a}} reduced Reynolds number compared to the prototype, which leads to generally poor aerodynamic performance. In order to solve such a Froude-Reynolds scaling conflict, a real-time hybrid model(ReaTHM) test was designed and carried out in SINTEF Ocean, illustrated in Figure(1). The aerodynamic loads were calculated numerically in real time based on the measured platform position. Then, the aerodynamic loads were applied to the physical model in the ocean basin through actuators. One disadvantage of the NOWITECH experiments in 2015 is that it used a rigid rotor model for the aerodynamic loads in order to minimize the calculation time. The purpose of this master s thesis project is to develop an efficient flexible structural model of the rotor, including the blade bending and torsion deflections, which is coupled to an aerodynamic code such as AeroDyn. First, a <b>flexible</b> <b>blade</b> model is developed. The blade is assumed to be an Euler-Bernoulli cantilever beam. The stretch, flapwise bending, edgewise bending and torsion deflections are considered. The blade kinetic energy and potential energy are established using a set of hybrid coordinates. The equations of motion are obtained by Hamilton s principle. Finite element analysis is applied to calculate the blade natural frequencies and eigenmodes. Modal analysis is carried out in the time domain, coupled with AeroDyn to simulate the aerodynamic loads. In the thesis, emulated ReaTHM testing is carried out, as shown in Figure(2). The tower, floater and mooring lines are modeled in SIMO-RIFLEX which can interact with the <b>flexible</b> <b>blade</b> model and the AeroDyn code through a dynamic link library(DLL). The computational efficiency of the presented <b>flexible</b> <b>blade</b> model is discussed. The set up of the emulated ReaTHM test is verified by decay tests and tests in irregular wind and wave. hen, the effects of blade flexibility in the ReaTHM test are investigated. ReaTHM testing with rigid blades is more conservative for the considered semi-submersible concept. The effects of blade flexibility on the mean values is limited(1 %). But the effects on the standard deviation(3 - 8 %), especially the standard deviation of tower fore-aft bending moment are large, leading to large fatigue damage. Since 2015 NOWITECH ReaTHM test used a rigid tower model, using <b>flexible</b> <b>blades</b> model will not lead to a significant difference. However, if SINTEF Ocean plans to do the ReaTHM test with tension leg platform(TLP), it is recommended to use the developed methodology to see if <b>flexible</b> <b>blades</b> should be used.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 91 - 95). There is {{a growing}} global demand for "clean" energy due to an increased mandate to reduce greenhouse gases. Wind energy has established itself as an economically competitive source due to major developments made in the efficiency and reliability of conversion systems. Currently, horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) dominate the wind energy conversion market because of their high efficiency. However, recent advances in vertical axis conversion systems are closing the gap in efficiency. A novel <b>flexible</b> <b>blade</b> concept {{with the ability to}} morph and adapt to changing flow conditions was proposed by A. Beyene and T. Ireland, to address part load and performance issues encountered in wind energy conversion systems. The extension of these benefits to a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) would make wind technology a more competitive player in the energy market. A straight bladed vertical axis wind turbine (SB-VAWT) rotor was manufactured, to accommodate <b>flexible</b> and rigid <b>blades.</b> The performance and flexible behavior was studied in the department of mechanical engineering's low speed wind tunnel using a test rig that was built for this study. A mathematical model, validated using a high speed camera and finite element analysis, was developed to predict the magnitude and direction of blade morph. The results show that the coefficient of performance (CP) greatly depends on the tip speed ratio (TSR), i. e., the rigid blade has CP of 0. 11 for a TSR of 1. 6, whereas the morphing blade achieved a CP of 0. 06 at a TSR of 1. 13. Overall, the modified morphing blade has better performance at low RPMs, but the rigid blade performed better at high RPMs. It was observed that the VAWT equipped with <b>flexible</b> <b>blades</b> self-started in the majority of the experiments. The <b>flexible</b> <b>blade's</b> production of power at relatively low TSRs is a rare occurrence in the field. At high RPM, the centrifugal force overwhelmed the lift force, bending the blade out of phase in an undesired direction increasing drag and therefore reducing the CP. These results suggest that alterations to the current design must be made in order to account for the inertial forces experienced by blades in a vertical axis configuration...|$|R
