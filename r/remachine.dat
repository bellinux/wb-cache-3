40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This particular test required {{the application of a}} variety of loads including axial tension and compression, internal pressure (gas), external pressure (water), bending and both low and elevated temperature. These loads were used to determine the sealing and structural limits of the connection. The connection design tested had tapered threads with 10 threads per inch. A square thread form and a round thread form were tested. The square thread form had a 2 {sup o} load flank and 15 {sup o} stab flank. The round thread had a 0 {sup o} load flank and 20 {sup o} stab flank. Most of the testing was performed on the round thread form. Both a coupled connection design and an integral connection design were tested. The coupling was a pin by pin (male) thread, with the pipe having a box (female) thread. Both designs have outside and inside diameters that are flush with the pipe body. Both designs also contain a small external shoulder. The test procedure selected for this evaluation was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test was performed with four coupled samples and included most of these loads. Two integral samples were also included for limit load testing ISO makeup/breakout tests are divided into three types [...] initial makeup, IML 1, repeated makeup within the same sample, MBL, and repeated makeup using several samples called round robin, RR. IMU and MBL were performed in this project. The ISO sealing and structural procedure is divided into four primary tests and identified as Series A, B, C and Limit Load (failure). Series A and B test to 95 % actual yield of the pipe and Series C uses 90 % of actual yield. Samples 1 and 3 were tested to Series A and the loads are shown in Figure 1. For these samples, the axial compression was limited to 75 % pipe body yield, which was set by Mr. Watts {{at the beginning of the}} test. Samples 2 and 4 were tested to Series B with loads shown in Figure 2. This series included 20 degrees per 100 feet bending but no external pressure. Due to premature leaks, no samples were subjected to Series C which included mechanical and thermal cycles. Samples 5 and 6 were tested to failure. The project started with the selection and purchase of a popular size of oilfield pipe, which was 7 -inch OD, 32 pound per foot, P- 110 casing. While the connections were being threaded, material tensile tests were performed to get the actual strength of the 7 -inch pipe. The first samples contained a square thread form. Excessive galling was experienced during the first series of makeup/breakout tests and Mr. Watts decided to change the thread form and <b>remachine</b> the samples. The second samples had a round thread form and performed very well in the makeup/breakout tests. Basically no galling occurred of any consequence. Samples 1 and 3 were to be tested with external water (ISO Series A) while samples 2 and 4 were to be tested with bending (ISO Series B, no external pressure). Testing of all four samples started with tension and internal gas pressure. During this initial pressure testing, samples 1, 3 and 4 developed leaks and the test was stopped before any external pressure or bending was applied. Sample 2 successfully tested to ISO Load Point 5 which included bending before developing a leak. Figure 3 shows the loads at which the samples leaked and the relative pipe body performance capability. Sample 1 and end A of sample 2 held a high pressure while samples 3, 4 and end B of sample 2 leaked at relatively low pressures. All of these leaks were with nitrogen gas pressure. After reviewing the results, it was believed that several conditions may have contributed to the premature leaks: The BOL 2000 thread lubricant contains solid particles that are larger than the solid particles in API 5 A 2 compound. Possibly the large particles prevented tight thread contact necessary for gas leak tightness. The BOL 2000 lubricant may have caused or at least contributed to the yielding of the pin end during makeup. Pin inward deformation was found in some pins subsequent to testing and breakout. Excessive yielding of the pin or box will contribute to poor thread contact and leakage. The connections were made up to full or near full shoulder contact. This causes the end of the pin to be stressed near the yield strength. This along with the interference caused by the thread compound may cause excessive pin hoop stresses and yielding which in turn gives relatively loose thread contact. This behavior is present when repeated makeup and breakout occurs...|$|E

50|$|Bed {{of nails}} {{fixtures}} require a mechanical assembly {{to hold the}} PCB in place. Fixtures can hold the PCB with either a vacuum or pressing {{down from the top}} of the PCB. Vacuum fixtures give better signal reading versus the press-down type. On the other hand, vacuum fixtures are expensive because of their high manufacturing complexity. Moreover, vacuum fixtures cannot be used on bed-of-nails systems that are used in automated production lines, where the board is automatically loaded to the tester by a handling mechanism.The bed of nails or fixture, as generally termed, is used together with an in-circuit tester. Fixtures with a grid of 0.8 mm for small nails and test point diameter 0.6 mm are theoretically possible without using special constructions. But in mass production, test point diameters of 1.0 mm or higher are normally used to minimise contact failures leading to lower <b>remachining</b> costs.|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{depositing}} metal coatings such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, {{and copper}} in traditional electroplating processes have inherent pollution problems. Several alternative technologies exist to coat a substrate with metal without using electrolytic solutions or plating baths. These technologies do not eliminate {{the use of}} metal coatings, but they do eliminate the use of non-metal toxic components such as cyanide from the plating process. They also can {{reduce the amount of}} metal-contaminated wastewater and sludge that is generated from plating. These alternative technologies include thermal spray coating, vapor deposition, and chemical vapor deposition (EPA 1995). In the future, these technologies might play a greater role in metal finishing operations. However, many of these alternative processes have high unit-plating costs and, therefore, are used only for special applications where the cost of coating is not a major consideration. Another drawback to alternative metal deposition methods is that metal overspray or tailings from <b>remachining</b> thick coatings from the alternative processes can actually increase waste generation (Davis 1994). Alternative technologies for metal finishing have several features in common that distinguis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I {{concentrate}} on a substantial <b>remachining</b> of Bataille’s {{notion of a}} sovereign ‘accursed share’ of general economy by adding a theoretical dimension that I propose to term ‘Ecanomie’ which, I will argue, suspends the traditional moral-numerical restrictions of a hitherto dominant economic housing. The lodging here of this portmanteau is coined to uncannily combine the previously separate concepts of ‘economy’ and ‘anomie’ into something that suspends the classical modeling of each. As well as converting these discursive positions of Bataille’s {{to the benefit of}} outlining this recent historical turn I will also be utilising Heidegger’s quasi-corporeal take on ‘Signification’ to uncover the concrete reconfigurations of embodied worldview that such ecanomic acts formally indicate or entail. Signification, it is argued, is not some abstract upper layer or mere outer ontic shell of representation, but a materially networked substance that works-over all individual comportments. I will finally explore this substantively through the optic of Derrida’s deployment of biopolitical ‘Autoimmunity’, here in the concrete re-signification of ‘the suicidal’ within social networking ecanomic technologies of the self...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 95 - 110 A {{case study}} of a remanufacture of a steam turbine is presented. The turbine has been in service for 20 years. Thermal and {{physical}} stresses have taken their toll on the turbine casing and supporting hardware. Remanufacture was planned with innovative processes and state-of-the-art component upgrades. A unique heat treatment process was designed to reshape the casing and relieve residual stresses thermally induced into the casing over its operating life. Using heat to reshape the case minimized the amount of <b>remachining</b> time required. A team of three vendors was combined to maximize technical and physical resources and accomplish this task in 24 days. The goals of the remanufacture included: ? Recovery of lost horsepower and efficiency due to steam path deterioration ? Increase efficiency {{through the application of}} packing, tip, and nozzle seal upgrades ? Elimination of chronic maintenance problems. Major topics include: ? Casing disassembly and damage assessment ? Weld restoration of erosion damage and steam path blading ?

40|$|Three-dimensional finite-element thermal-stress {{models are}} applied to predict temperature, {{distortion}} and residual stress in a continuous casting mold for steel slabs. The model predictions of temperature, distortion during operation, and residual distorted mold shape match plant observations. During operation, the copper faces bend towards the steel, with a maximum outward distortion {{on the order of}} 1 mm, found just above the center of the wide faces. Distortion during operation increases with increasing mold temperature, increasing strand width, and decreasing water jacket rigidity. Mold clamping forces, bolt prestress, friction, and ferrostatic pressure have little effect on this behavior. Constraint generated by the temperature gradients and the sides of the bolt holes in the steel water jackets generate stresses and creep in the copper hot face during operation. This leads to permanent distortion and residual stress after cooling to ambient. Residual stress and distortion increase with repeated thermal cycling over a campaign, higher temperatures, smaller water-jacket bolt holes, non-uniform water slot depth, and higher clamping forces. Increased residual distortion requires increased <b>remachining,</b> which reduces mold life. Increased residual stress increases the probability of a catastrophic crack failure. 1...|$|R
40|$|Today many {{industries}} use CNC {{machines for}} production of turbo machinery components like turbine blades, impellers, rotors, propellers etc. Turbine blades are complex shapes {{and difficult to}} machine on CNC. Contouring operations are generally used for this purpose. This paper presents optimization of toolpath for turbine blades in vertical machining centre (VMC). Toolpath optimization of turbine blade usingMasterCAM® software results in reduction of machining time. Different contouring toolpaths are simulated in MasterCAM® prior to machining of turbine blades. Cutting Parameters used for machining are spindle speed, feed, tool diameter, plunge-rate, and depth of cut. Most of the research work is focused on cutter path generation with the main aim on reducing total cycle time. Both productive time and non-productive times (airtime, tool change time) areconsidered for optimization. Different toolpath generation methods are studied to select the best one to find out optimized cycle time. Different contour toolpaths being simulated are 2 D, chamfer 2 D, Ramp, <b>Remachining</b> and Oscillating. The objective of simulation is to generate the shortest tool-path for contouring operation. Actual machining is done to validate the software simulation time. Experimentation reveals that zigzag toolpath is more favorable than any other strategies for the machining of turbine blade for minimum cycle time. Ramp contour toolpath ismore favorable than any other toolpaths...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program {{is to develop a}} system to both monitor the vibration of a bottomhole assembly, and to adjust the properties of an active damper in response to these measured vibrations. Phase I of this program entails modeling and design of the necessary subsystems and design, manufacture and test of a full laboratory prototype. The project continues to advance, but is behind the revised (14 -month) schedule. Tasks 1 - 3 (Modeling, Specification and Design) are all essentially complete.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} one finishing electrode to finish multiple dies without <b>remachining</b> the electrode. The multiple-use electrode finishing experiment in this study addresses technology in the die-forging industry. Methods of manufacturing spherical straight bevel forge gear dies have relied on die-sinking Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) practices that showed great potential for advancement. The focus {{of this study is}} solely on the improvements of electrode use in EDM finishing-processes. The surface finish quality itself is not an area of concern other than maintaining that it does not diminish. The focused concern is maximizing the process by using one electrode unmodified for multiple-finishing operations. The objective for improvement is utilization of one finishing electrode used multiple times rather than only one finishing electrode per die. Utilizing a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), the inspection of specific locations on the finishing electrode reveals the repeatability and accuracy of use for one finishing electrode for six gear forging-dies. Initial experimentation validates the capabilities to finish four dies accurately in two separate die configurations with one electrode. To accomplish finishing the four initial dies, a die-sinking EDM machine that possesses a large enough working envelope was included in the process. The transition of using graphite electrode materials in place of brass for finishing multiple dies aids in reducing what was a total eight-hour process time into a four-hour process time. A machine with a working envelope large enough for only setting up one die to be EDM machined generated the eight-hour process time. The researcher achieved the eight-hour process time by replacing brass electrodes in the roughing stages with graphite electrodes. The extent to which one finish electrode can finish a sample set of six complete dies with one electrode is studied. Data is extrapolated from the deviation of absolute locations on a three-dimensional solid model compared to the multiple-use finishing electrode. Specific locations inspected on the electrode conclude the study efforts with results revealing that the maximum repeated use of an electrode is seven uses...|$|R
