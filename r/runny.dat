5|$|Strep throat is {{unlikely}} when {{any of the}} symptoms of red eyes, hoarseness, <b>runny</b> nose, or mouth ulcers are present. It is also unlikely {{when there is no}} fever.|$|E
5|$|Some advise {{to avoid}} {{physical}} exercise {{if there are}} symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including <b>runny</b> nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat.|$|E
5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a <b>runny</b> nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
5000|$|Monja-yaki - a savoury pancake {{similar to}} okonomiyaki but much <b>runnier</b> and eaten {{directly}} off the grill using a metal spatula, from working-class districts of Tokyo. A nostalgic food item making a recent comeback.|$|R
50|$|In Thailand, {{the sauce}} {{is most often}} called sot Siracha (ซอสศรีราชา) and only {{sometimes}} nam phrik Siracha (น้ำพริกศรีราชา). Traditional Thai sriracha sauce tends to be tangier in taste, and <b>runnier</b> in texture than non-Thai versions.|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} in monjayaki are finely chopped and mixed into the batter before frying. Monjayaki batter has ingredients similar to okonomiyaki. However, additional dashi or water {{is added to}} the monjayaki batter mixture, making it <b>runnier</b> than okonomiyaki. The consistency of cooked Monjayaki is comparable to melted cheese.|$|R
5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, <b>runny</b> nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a <b>runny</b> nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a <b>runny</b> nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E
50|$|About 3 kg (6.5 lb) of metspar grade fluorite, added {{directly}} to the batch, are used for every metric ton of steel made. The fluoride ions from CaF2 lower the melt's temperature and viscosity (make the liquid <b>runnier).</b> The calcium content has a tangential benefit in removing sulfur and phosphorus, but other additives such as lime are still needed. Metspar is similarly used in cast iron production and for other iron-containing alloys.|$|R
500|$|Most often, borscht {{is served}} with sour cream, the East European version of which, known as , is <b>runnier</b> than its American counterpart. The sour cream may be {{served in a}} {{separate}} pitcher for the diners to add the desired amount themselves or the borscht may come already [...] "whitened", that is, blended with sour cream. Sometimes the cream is thickened with flour before being added to the soup. Yogurt and a mixture of milk and yolks are possible substitutes.|$|R
50|$|In Southeast Asia, {{especially}} {{countries like}} Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, {{a variation of}} soft-boiled eggs known as half-boiled eggs are commonly eaten at breakfast. The major difference is that, instead of the egg being served in an egg cup, it is cracked into a bowl to which dark or light soy sauce or pepper are added. The egg is also cooked for a shorter period of time resulting in a <b>runnier</b> egg {{instead of the usual}} gelatin state and is commonly eaten with Kaya toast.|$|R
5|$|The volcano {{enters the}} subaerial subphase {{once it is}} tall enough to escape the water. Now the volcano puts on 95% of its above-water height over roughly 500,000 years. Thereafter eruptions become much less explosive. The lava {{released}} in this stage often includes both pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, and the currently active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea, are in this phase. Hawaiian lava is often <b>runny,</b> blocky, slow, and relatively easy to predict; the USGS tracks where it {{is most likely to}} run, and maintains a tourist site for viewing the lava.|$|E
5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are {{implicated in}} the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former. Influenza is less likely to result in a <b>runny</b> nose.|$|E

50|$|Later it {{was found}} that this {{original}} formulation expanded too much and in some instances floors cracked. US patent 4,159,912 describes changes made so that the expansion was greatly reduced. In that formulation, 5-8% of Portland cement was added to reduce the expansion. The latex emulsion and antifoaming agent were no longer necessary as the concrete was strengthened by the Portland cement. It was found that atmospheric calcined gypsum could be used {{for the majority of the}} calcined gypsum if it was ball milled to change the texture. The proportion of sand was also changed, so that it was in a 1:1.3 to 1:3 ratio with the calcined gypsum. This resulted in a <b>runnier</b> mix, but the set up time was not changed.|$|R
5000|$|The starch mogul {{system is}} a method of molding candy that allows <b>runnier</b> {{materials}} to be used than normal processes. It {{is used in the}} manufacture of jelly beans [...] and gummy bears, [...] and was formerly used in the manufacture of marshmallows before the advent of the extrusion process. The starch mogul system uses a machine with trays of starch. Each tray has a mold firmly pushed down in it to create cavities in the starch. The cavities are then filled with the candy material, and allowed to cool or harden as necessary. During this time, the starch helps absorb excess water, making the candy moldings handleable. Finally, the trays are dumped and the candy is separated from the starch, which is then reused by the machine.|$|R
5000|$|Non-Newtonian fluids {{change their}} {{viscosity}} or flow behaviour under stress. If you apply {{a force to}} such fluids, the sudden application of stress can cause them to get thicker and act like a solid, {{or in some cases}} it results in the opposite behaviour and they may get <b>runnier</b> than they were before. Removal of the stress cause them to return to their earlier state.Not all non-Newtonian Fluids behave in the same way when stress is applied - some become more solid, others more fluid. Some non-Newtonian fluids react {{as a result of the}} amount of stress applied, while others react as a result of the length of time that stress is applied.The generalized power law for all fluids can be written as: τ=-K(dy/dx)^n Where K = flow consistency index n = Fluid behavior index, n=1 for Newtonian fluids ...|$|R
25|$|Kennel cough is a {{respiratory}} infection {{that can be}} easily transmitted from one dog to another. Symptoms include <b>runny</b> nose and loss of appetite. This disease can be prevented by vaccination.|$|E
25|$|Cluster {{headaches}} {{are relatively}} rare (1–3 in 10,000 people) {{and are more}} common in men than women. They present with sudden onset explosive pain around one eye and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms (tearing, <b>runny</b> nose and red eye).|$|E
25|$|People with {{pertussis}} are infectious {{from the}} beginning of the catarrhal stage (a <b>runny</b> nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, symptoms of the common cold) through the third week after the onset of paroxysms (multiple, rapid coughs) or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Shatter {{is a type}} of {{cannabis}} concentrate, shatter specifically {{refers to}} a texture of concentrate that breaks and shatters like glass, rather than pulling like taffy. It is created by extracting the cannabinoids, terpenes, and other chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant usually from dried cannabis. Shatter is similar to Live resin, but instead Live resin uses fresh cannabis and is extracted differently than Shatter. A wide variety of solvents can be used for extraction, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, petroleum ether, naphtha, benzene, butane, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and olive oil. Shatter is usually transparent and has an amber glass color. The reason shatter is clear {{has to do with the}} molecules in the cannabis. If this molecules are left undisturbed, they form the glass-like appearance. Heat, moisture, and high terpene content can also affect the texture of the outcome of the extraction, which may turn oils into a <b>runnier</b> substance that resembles sap. Oils with a consistency that falls somewhere between clear shatter and viscous sap is often referred to as [...] "pull-and-snap".|$|R
25|$|Pharyngitis is {{inflammation}} {{of the back of}} the throat, known as the pharynx. It typically results in a sore throat and fever. Other symptoms may include a <b>runny</b> nose, cough, headache, a hoarse voice. Symptoms usually last three to five days. Complications can include sinusitis and acute otitis media. Pharyngitis is typically a type of respiratory tract infection.|$|E
25|$|Thermosets, or {{thermosetting}} polymers, can melt {{and take}} shape only once: {{after they have}} solidified, they stay solid. In the thermosetting process, a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber {{is an example of}} a thermosetting process: before heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a tacky, slightly <b>runny</b> material; after vulcanization, the product is rigid and non-tacky.|$|E
25|$|Vongerichten {{claims to}} have invented molten {{chocolate}} cake in New York City in 1987, but the French chef and chocolatier Jacques Torres has disputed that, arguing that such a dish already existed in France. According to Vongerichten, he pulled a chocolate sponge cake from the oven before it was done {{and found that the}} center was still <b>runny,</b> but was warm and had both a good taste and a good texture.|$|E
25|$|Allergies, {{also known}} as {{allergic}} diseases, {{are a number of}} conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to something in the environment that usually causes little or no problem in most people. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a <b>runny</b> nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} opiate-based pain killers, chronic use of codeine can cause {{physical}} dependence. When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur {{if a person}} suddenly stops the medication. Withdrawal symptoms include: drug craving, <b>runny</b> nose, yawning, sweating, insomnia, weakness, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle spasms, chills, irritability, and pain. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, long-term users should gradually reduce their codeine medication {{under the supervision of}} a healthcare professional.|$|E
25|$|Many {{kinds of}} leprosy are known, but some {{symptoms}} {{are common to}} them, including <b>runny</b> nose, dry scalp, eye problems, skin lesions, muscle weakness, reddish skin, smooth, shiny, diffuse thickening of facial skin, ear, and hand, loss of sensation in fingers and toes, thickening of peripheral nerves, and flat nose due to destruction of nasal cartilage. Also, phonation and resonation of sound occur during speech. Often, atrophy of the testes with resulting impotence occurs.|$|E
25|$|Originally a Paramount Classics film titled Pootie Tang in Sine Your Pitty on the <b>Runny</b> Kine, {{the budget}} was {{increased}} {{and transferred to}} the main Paramount Pictures division. C.K. has stated that he was all but fired from the film during the editing phase. According to him, Ali LeRoi was hired to extensively re-edit the film. Openly agreeing with Roger Ebert's dismissive criticism that the movie should not have even been released, C.K. {{has said that the}} finished product, though containing parts he enjoyed, was far from his own vision.|$|E
25|$|Measles is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} infection caused by the measles virus. Initial signs and symptoms typically include fever, often greater than , cough, <b>runny</b> nose, and inflamed eyes. Two or {{three days after the}} start of symptoms, small white spots may form inside the mouth, known as Koplik's spots. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads {{to the rest of the}} body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. Complications occur in about 30% and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia among others. Rubella (German measles) and roseola are different diseases.|$|E
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} symptoms associated with morphine addiction are usually experienced {{shortly before the}} time of the next scheduled dose, sometimes within as early as a few hours (usually 6h to 12h) after the last administration. Early symptoms include watery eyes, insomnia, diarrhea, <b>runny</b> nose, yawning, dysphoria, sweating, and in some cases a strong drug craving. Severe headache, restlessness, irritability, loss of appetite, body aches, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tremors, and even stronger and more intense drug craving appear as the syndrome progresses. Severe depression and vomiting are very common. During the acute withdrawal period, systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase, usually beyond premorphine levels, and heart rate increases, which have potential to cause a heart attack, blood clot, or stroke.|$|E
25|$|Creme Eggs were {{manufactured}} in New Zealand at the Cadbury factory in Dunedin from 1983 to 2009. Cadbury in New Zealand and Australia {{went through a}} restructuring process which most Cadbury products previously produced in New Zealand being {{manufactured in}}stead at Cadbury factories in Australia. The Dunedin plant later received a $69 million upgrade to specialise in boxed products such as Cadbury Roses, and Creme Eggs were no longer produced there. The result of the changes meant that Creme Eggs were instead imported from the United Kingdom. The change has also seen the range of Creme Eggs available for sale decreased. The size also dropped from 40g to 39g in this time. The response from New Zealanders has not been positive. Complaints have included the filling not being as <b>runny</b> as the New Zealand version.|$|E
25|$|The final {{decades of}} Attic red—figure vase {{painting}} {{are dominated by}} the Kerch Style. This style, current between 370 and 330 BC, combined the preceding Rich and Modest Styles, with a preponderance of the Rich. Crowded compositions with large statuesque figures are typical. The added colours now include blue, green and others. Volume and shading are indicated {{by the use of}} diluted <b>runny</b> glossy clay. Occasionally, whole figures are added as appliques, i.e. as thin figural reliefs attached to the body of the vase. The variety of vessel shapes in use was reduced sharply. Common painted shapes include pelike, chalice krater, belly lekythos, skyphos, hydria and oinochoe. Scenes from female life are very common. Mythological themes are still dominated by Dionysos; Ariadne and Heracles are the most commonly depicted heroes. The best-known painter of this style is the Marsyas Painter.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (<b>runny</b> nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E
500|$|Croup, {{also known}} as laryngotracheobronchitis, {{is a type of}} {{respiratory}} infection that is usually caused by a virus. The infection leads to swelling inside the trachea, which interferes with normal breathing and produces the classic symptoms of [...] "barking" [...] cough, stridor, and a hoarse voice. Fever and <b>runny</b> nose may also be present. These symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe. Often it starts or is worse at night. It normally lasts one to two days.|$|E
500|$|Lanolin, a {{hydrophobic}} grease from wool-bearing {{animals such as}} sheep or goats, acts as both a waterproofing wax and a bonding agent, {{giving the}} shoe polish its greasy feel and texture. It prevents the naphtha from evaporating until the polish has been spread and buffed into a thin film on the leather surface. [...] An essential ingredient in shoe polish is a thickener; without this, the polish would be too <b>runny,</b> {{making it difficult to}} use. Gum arabic, a substance from two sub-Saharan species of the acacia tree, is commonly used to increase the viscosity of the product.|$|E
