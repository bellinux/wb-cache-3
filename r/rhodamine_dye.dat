40|$|Polymer films {{developed}} for distance detection, containing dye-coated silver particles for ultra-sensitive analysis using surf ace-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS), identified {{the need for}} effective SERRS labels that interact strongly with the metal surfaces. Many dyes that are currently used for SERRS can be displaced from the surface owing to the relatively weak surface attachment, and therefore they do not adhere strongly enough to the surface for many practical applications, i. e. to withstand incorporation into environments such as paints, resins and polymers. <b>Rhodamine</b> <b>dyes</b> are very effective in SERRS under ideal laboratory conditions, {{as shown by the}} detection of single molecules. The synthesis of 19 -[4 -(benzotriazole- 5 -ylsulfamoyl) - 2 -methylphenyl]- 6 -diethylaminoxanthen- 3 -ylidene]diethylammonium (benzotriazole rhodamine B, BTRB), which was designed to give much stronger surface adhesion, was evaluated using SERRS in comparison with two commercially available <b>rhodamine</b> <b>dyes,</b> <b>rhodamine</b> 6 G and rhodamine B. The increased strength of interaction with the roughened metal surface was shown to increase the versatility of BTRB in terms of the choice of aggregating agent and also the type of sample prepared.

40|$|The DynaSand ® is a {{proprietary}} continuously backwashed up-flow filter (CoUF) {{used in the}} tertiary treatment stage of wastewater treatment. The technology was initially designed as a suspended solid removal filter.

30|$|In {{the first}} step, the <b>Rhodamine</b> B <b>dye</b> can absorb photons from light source {{and may be}} excited to singlet state.
