40|$|Abstract. Although reverse {{logistics}} has been disregarded for many years, pressures from both environmental awareness and business sustainability have risen. Reverse logistical activities include return, repair and recycle products. Traditionally, since the information transparency {{of the entire}} supply chain is restricted, business is difficult to predict, and prepare for these reverse activities. This study presents an agent-based framework to increase the degree of information transparency. The cooperation between sensor and disposal agents helps predict reverse activities, avoid <b>return,</b> <b>speed</b> up repair and prepare for recycling behaviors...|$|E

40|$|To date, no {{study has}} {{investigated}} how landscape structural (visual) alterations affect navigation and thus homing success in stingless bees. We addressed {{this question in}} the Australian stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria by performing marking, release and re-capture experiments in landscapes differing in habitat homogeneity (i. e., the proportion of elongated ground features typically considered prominent visual landmarks). We investigated how landscape affected the proportion of bees and nectar foragers returning to their hives {{as well as the}} earliest time bees and foragers returned. Undisturbed landscapes with few landmarks (that are conspicuous to the human eye) and large proportions of vegetation cover (natural forests) were classified visually/structurally homogeneous, and disturbed landscapes with many landmarks and fragmented or no extensive vegetation cover (gardens and plantations) visually/structurally heterogeneous. We found that proportions of successfully returning nectar foragers and earliest times first bees and foragers returned did not differ between landscapes. However, most bees returned in the visually/structurally most (forest) and least (garden) homogeneous landscape, suggesting that they use other than elongated ground features for navigation and that <b>return</b> <b>speed</b> is primarily driven by resource availability in a landscape...|$|E

This comparison study presents the different methods of propulsion that can be employed to return 5, 000 tonnes of asteroid regolith into a cycling orbit between Earth and Mars. While the returned regolith mass can be arbitrary, calculations are performed for the minimum requirement to provide a Mars-Earth Cycler (M-EC) habitat for a crew of ten, support various research activities, and/or produce materials for living needs during journeys to and from Mars. The return of mined materials to the cycler orbit from Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) is relatively easy when compared to doing it from other planets or moons (including Phobos and Deimos) as sources, especially with respect to energy requirements. Currently, there are an estimated one thousand NEAs in orbit around the Sun and many have values of <b>return</b> <b>speed</b> increments (delta-v) lower than 100 m/s. Numerous propulsion schemes have been put forward to accomplish this task however the direct use of asteroid regolith as a fuel shows orders of magnitude improvements in energy, power consumption, spacecraft weight at launch from Earth, and ultimately mission cost...|$|E
40|$|In {{electromagnetic}} models, the return-stroke {{channel is}} represented as an antenna excited {{at its base}} by either a voltage or a current source. To adjust {{the speed of the}} current pulse propagating in the channel to available optical observations, different representations for the return-stroke channel have been proposed in the literature using different techniques to artificially reduce the propagation speed of the current pulse to values consistent with observations. In this paper, we present an analysis of the available electromagnetic models in terms of their practical implementation. Criteria used for the analysis are the ease of implementation of the models, the numerical accuracy and the needed computer resources, as well as their ability to reproduce a desired value for the speed of the return stroke current pulse. Using the CST-MWS software, which is based on the time-domain finite-integration technique, different electromagnetic models were analyzed, namely (A) a wire embedded in a fictitious half-space dielectric medium (other than air), (B) a wire embedded in a fictitious coating with permittivity (Îµr) and permeability (Î¼r), and (C) a wire in free-space loaded by distributed series inductance and resistance. It is shown that, by adjusting the parameters of each model, it is possible to reproduce a desired value for the speed of the current pulse. For each of the considered models, we determined the values for the adjustable parameters that allow obtaining the desired value of the <b>return</b> <b>speed.</b> Model A is the least expensive in terms of computing resources. However, it requires two simulation runs to obtain the electromagnetic fields. A variant of Model B that includes a fictitious dielectric/ferromagnetic coating is found to be more efficient to control the current speed along the channel than using only a dielectric coating. On the other hand, this model requires an increased number of mesh cells, resulting in higher memory and computational time. The presence of an inhomogeneous medium generates, in addition, unphysical fluctuations on the resulting current distributions. These fluctuations, which strongly depend {{on the size of the}} coating as well as on its electric and magnetic properties, can be attenuated by considering conductive losses in the coating. Considering the efficiency in terms of the required computer resources and ease of implementation, we recommend the use of Model C (wire loaded by distributed inductance and resistance) ...|$|E

Therefore, application of triggered lightning results to natural lightning phenomena must be made with certain caveats.
