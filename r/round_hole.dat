40|$|Abstract. Patterned {{sapphire}} substrate (PSS) {{is effective}} approach to improve {{external quantum efficiency}} of light emitting diode (LED) chip. The <b>round</b> <b>holes</b> pattern was studied in this paper. Simulation was used to study how external quantum efficiency changes in different parameters of the <b>round</b> <b>holes</b> for flip GaN-based LEDs fabricated <b>round</b> <b>holes</b> PSS. Through a series of comparisons on simulation results, the maximum enhancement of LED’s external quantum efficiency is 15 % compared to the external quantum efficiency of non-patterned sapphire substrate (non-PSS) LED for a most effective pattern...|$|R

25|$|Tools, {{originally}} {{made of wood}} or bone, {{were bound}} to handles with leather straps. During the Bronze Age, {{they were made of}} bronze with wooden handles. Due to its <b>round</b> <b>hole,</b> the tool head would spin on the handle. The Minoans developed oval-shaped holes in their tools to fit oval-shaped handles, which prevented spinning. Tools included double adzes, double- and single-bladed axes, axe-adzes, sickles and chisels.|$|E
25|$|The round coin, the {{precursor}} {{of the familiar}} cash coin, circulated in both the spade and knife money areas in the Zhou period, from around 350 BC. Apart from two small and presumably late coins from the State of Qin, coins from the spade money area have a <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> and refer to the jin and liang units.

25|$|A {{somewhat}} rare congenital {{disorder of}} the sternum {{sometimes referred to}} as an anatomical variation is a sternal foramen, a single <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> in the sternum that is present from birth and usually is off-centered to the right or left, commonly forming in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th segments of the breastbone body. Congenital sternal foramens can often be mistaken for bullet holes. They are usually without symptoms but can be problematic if acupuncture in the area is intended.|$|E

The advantage of this socket style is its small, compact face. Vimar brand claims to have patented this socket first in 1975 with their Bpresa model; however soon other brands started selling similar products, mostly naming them with the generic term presa bipasso (twin-gauge socket) that is now of common use.|$|E
25|$|Some {{displays}} {{for early}} computers (those {{that needed to}} display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask (stencil), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so {{a second set of}} deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed {{toward the center of the}} screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.|$|E
25|$|Of {{this first}} edifice, the gables of the transept, a single portal, the tower {{up until the}} {{uppermost}} corbel table and some pillars are all that remain. As noted above, {{the eastern part of}} the church was rebuilt during the early 13th century. The transept was doubled in size, a new choir added to the east of it and in the angle between the choir and the transept, two towers constructed. During this construction period, a new southern portal, still Romanesque in style, was sculpted. After an interval of a few years, a new reconstruction scheme began. The nave was now enlarged to become as wide as the transept, in effect transforming the church from a basilica to a hall church. Again, the models can be traced to western Germany. The superfluous space between the ceiling and roof was turned into a very large attic. In the easternmost vault of the church, constituting the ceiling of the choir, a <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> exists. Scholars believe that this hole was used during enactments of the story of the Passion of Christ, to pull up a wooden statue of Christ in order to illustrate his very concrete ascent to heaven.|$|E

25|$|It must be observed, however, that {{in order}} to find the real {{intensity}} ratio, the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted between the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. Make a small <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer, and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.|$|E

500|$|Halfway {{through the}} trial, Whiting made {{allegations}} that Adams {{had been murdered}} with a Colt Paterson revolver rather than a hatchet. [...] Whiting came to this conclusion after Doctor Gilman, who examined the body with the coroner, testified about a <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> in Adams skull {{that could not have}} been made by the hatchet and suggested that Colt used a revolver in a premeditated act by which he lured Adams to his death. [...] Although no witnesses had reported the sounds of gunfire, Whiting's argument was that a revolver ball fired under the power of the percussion cap alone could propel the ball with [...] "enough force to kill a man", without making the noise of the exploding black powder in the cylinder. [...] Several witnesses were called in to testify against this idea including an early ballistician named Zabrisky and Samuel Colt himself, who demonstrated to the court, by shooting his revolver in the courtroom and catching the fired balls in his hand, that such a shot could not penetrate to the depth of the wound found on Adams' skull.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the N 1 value in the relationship between pressure and flow for different types of water reticulation pipes with different forms of fractures. The relationship is defined as: Once these N 1 values are established, they can be used as an indication for better pressure management in water reticulation networks. This investigation was limited to three types of pipe with diameter 110 mm and wall thickness of 4 mm: • uPVC • Cast iron • Steel And three different forms of failures: • <b>Round</b> <b>holes</b> • Longitudinal splits • Circular cracks Pressure step testing was used to obtain experimental data. During analysis of the data, Cd was calculated from the initial area of a fracture and kept constant thereafter. Conclusions could be drawn about similar type pipes with similar fractures and comparisons could be made between all the samples as well as previous studies. Generally it seems that longitudinal splits lead to the most excessive leaking, followed by <b>round</b> <b>holes</b> and then the circular cracks. A summary of typical N 1 exponents found is shown below: • uPVC pipes with <b>round</b> <b>holes</b> 0. 48 - 0. 49 • uPVC pipes with longitudinal splits 0. 89 - 1. 26 • uPVC pipes with circular cracks 0. 31 – 0. 48 • Cast Iron pipes with <b>round</b> <b>holes</b> 0. 43 – 0. 44 • Cast Iron pipes with longitudinal splits 0. 42 – 0. 46 • Cast Iron pipes with circular cracks 0. 41 – 0. 43 • Steel pipes with <b>round</b> <b>holes</b> 0. 42 – 0. 44 • Steel pipes with longitudinal splits 0. 39 – 0. 45 • Steel pipes with circular cracks 0. 38 – 0. 4...|$|R
