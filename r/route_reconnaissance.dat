25|$|The Iraqi {{port city}} of Umm Qasr was the first British obstacle. A joint Polish-British-American force ran into {{unexpectedly}} stiff resistance, and it took several days to clear the Iraqi forces out. Farther north, the British 7 Armoured Brigade ("The Desert Rats"), fought their way into Iraq's second-largest city, Basra, on 6 April, coming under constant attack by regulars and Fedayeen, while 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment cleared the 'old quarter' {{of the city that}} was inaccessible to vehicles. Entering Basra was achieved after two weeks of fierce fighting, which included the biggest tank battle by British forces since World War II when the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks on 27 March. A few members of D Squadron, British SAS, were deployed to southern Iraq to support the coalition advance on Basra, the team conducted forward <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> and infiltrated the city and brought in strikes on the Ba'athist loyalist leadership.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 1951, {{the unit}} was re-designated the 12th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Night Photo. On 25 February, {{eight months after}} the Korean War started, it was {{activated}} at Komaki Air Base, Japan, and assigned to the 67th TRG once more. The 67th TRG was part of the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, which had been formed in a reorganization of reconnaissance assets in Fifth Air Force. Personnel and equipment (RB-26s) came from the inactivated Ohio Air National Guard 162d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron which returned to the United States. On 15 March 1951, the unit moved to Taegu Air Base (K-2), South Korea, where the operations section had been located since {{the first part of the}} month. The primary mission of the squadron during the Korean War was to provide the night reconnaissance capability for the wing, both photographic and visual. During hours of darkness, the 12th Squadron was tasked to collect information on enemy activities, to make visual searches and perform <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> to perform targeting, and bomb damage assessments, to determine the accuracy of SHORAN coordinates. In emergencies, the 12th was expected to assist the two-day visual and photo recon squadrons.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 June 1944, D-Day, and {{for days}} afterwards, the 12th TRS {{performed}} area and <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> missions {{as well as}} artillery adjustment missions over and immediately behind the front lines. The squadron flew 250 missions during the month and operated around the clock. Reconnaissance was {{a major factor in}} allied strategy, and the 12th TRS kept higher echelons informed of enemy convoy and troop movements, and the location of troop concentrations. Effective 13 June, the 12th was officially transferred to the 10th Photo Reconnaissance Group. However, about 5 July 1944, the squadron moved with the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group to ALG A-9 Le Molay-Littry – the first of five airfields from which it would operate in France – and began supporting the United States First Army, which was massing for a breakthrough near Saint-Lô. After the breakthrough, the 12th followed General George S. Patton’s Third Army in its drive across France and supported him {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, the {{original}} battle plan was abandoned and the tank brigades advanced into new sectors without <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> or infantry support. This caused the tanks {{to get stuck}} in minefields and swampy forested terrain.

The corps' 105th Heavy Tank Brigade and 17th Motor Rifle Brigade launched an attack on the village, taking it at 17:00 and dislodging the 56th Division's 192nd Infantry Regiment after losing seven tanks, but were unable to continue the advance. Meanwhile, the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions, supported by the 12th Tank Corps, captured the villages of Ozernenskoye, Ozerno and Goskovo, but the southern group of the 61st Army made no progress.

50|$|<b>Route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> is the {{intelligence}} {{assessment of the}} operational environment in reconnaissance operations of routes for military use, including methods of reconnoitering and classifying them for other troops. In a tactical area of responsibility during combat operations {{the primary purpose of}} conducting <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> is to find and report all enemy forces that can interfere with movement along a route, and to identify the limit of direct-fire range and terrain that dominates the route. <b>Route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> includes creation of reconnaissance overlays to identify land and water features, bridge reconnaissance and classification, road reconnaissance and classification, special terrain reconnaissance such as that used during cross-country movement, at the landing areas, on the inland waterways, or when using footpaths and trails, engineer reconnaissance, and use of military route signs (standard signs, sign lighting, bridge signs). A significant part of <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> is the ability to identify choke points that prohibit military traffic by using conversion factors and tables to identify non-standard surfaces or inadequate load bearing in structure. To do so, Military Load Classifications are used for standard vehicles of a given armed force. <b>Route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> is typically conducted by a foot, horse or vehicle-mounted <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> patrol, sometimes with aid of aerial reconnaissance aircraft. The patrol would include regular reconnaissance elements and a combat engineering team.|$|E
50|$|The Pakistani {{plan was}} to reach Longewala, Ramgarh and Jaisalmer. The plan was far-fetched from the start, if only because it called for a night attack to be {{conducted}} over terrain that was not preceded by <b>route</b> or engineer <b>reconnaissance,</b> and the armoured troops were therefore unaware of the ground surface that could not support rapid movement towards the objective. As the day unfolded, Longewala would stand out {{as one of the}} biggest losses in a battle for Pakistan despite overwhelming superiority before commencement of the battle, largely due to the vehicles becoming bogged down in soft sand.|$|R
50|$|The 2d Squadron,9th Cavalry, {{assigned}} to the 7th Infantry (Light), deployed to Panama in order to conduct combat operations during Operation Just Cause and the ensuing humanitarian and nation building mission Operation Promote Liberty.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we examine}} three {{important}} routing problems. In the second chapter we investigate the Close-Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP) {{in which a}} salesman must get within a specified radius of each node to visit it. The third chapter studies the multi-vehicle extension of the CETSP, the Close-Enough Vehicle Routing Problem (CEVRP). In the fourth chapter, we develop a post-processor to improve the accuracy of our heuristics for solving the CETSP and CEVRP. In the fifth chapter, we solve the Sequence-Dependent Team Orienteering Problem (SDTOP) in which the profit received for each node visited {{is dependent on the}} sequence in which all the nodes are visited. We summarize the dissertation in the final chapter. The CETSP, CEVRP, and SDTOP have application in aerial <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>route</b> planning. We formulate each problem as a mathematical program and apply heuristic and combinatorial optimization techniques to solve them. We present the results of extensive computational experiments that show that our methods produce high-quality solutions quickly...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1958 Graduation date: 1958 The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to outline the {{principles}} involved in the reconnaissance, survey, and design of forest roads in the Douglas-fir Region. The reconnaissance survey {{is the most important}} element in road location. Poor reconnaissance often results in abandonment of the route at considerable expense. The ground slope affects the type of reconnaissance employed. In level country alignment controls the location of the road and grade is adapted to the topography to balance excavation and embankment quantities. In sidehill country grade controls the location of the road and alignment is adapted to the topography to balance excavation and embankment quantities. The reconnaissance survey may be separated into extensive and intensive reconnaissance. The extensive survey is the study of an area or drainage to determine the general location of the <b>route.</b> The intensive <b>reconnaissance</b> is a study of the ground adjacent of a route often involves the comparison of one or more alternatives. A preliminary survey is conducted along the final reconnaissance line to establish horizontal and vertical control and the topography {{on either side of the}} line. The precision desired determines the method of survey employed. The staff compass-tape-abney survey is the most widely used method in the Douglas-fir Region. The road is designed from the data obtained from the reconnaissance and preliminary surveys. These data are studied graphically using the plan, profile, and cross sections of the route or any combination of these graphic aids. Center line of the road will closely follow the final reconnaissance line if the intensive reconnaissance is thorough. Regardless of the method of design used, the final center line is a compromise between optimum alignment and minimum excavation...|$|R
50|$|Even it is {{paramount}} {{to obtain information}} about the available space in which a force can maneuver without being forced to bunch up due to obstacles. Terrain-oriented <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> allows the commander to obtain information and capabilities about the adjacent terrain for maneuvering his forces, to include, any obstacles (minefields, barriers, steep ravines, marshy areas, or chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contamination) that may obstruct vehicle movement—on routes to, and in, his assigned area of operations. This requirement includes the size of trees and the density of forests due to their effects on vehicle movement. <b>Route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> also allows the observation for fields of fire along the route and adjacent terrain. This information assists planners {{as a supplement to}} map information.|$|E
50|$|<b>Route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> {{was very}} good for short term {{forecasts}} over one route, but wasn’t very efficient, so early in 1944 the squadron began emphasizing synoptic area reconnaissance.

50|$|On 6 November 2002, the 1st Infantry Division {{published}} a warning order establishing ARFOR-T (Army Forces Turkey). This mission was enormous, encompassing the subordinate units of 2 heavy mechanized divisions, 4th ID and 1st ID. Normally these missions {{are assigned to}} corps headquarters. The following months involved extensive planning, command post exercises, and a joint warfighter with 1st ID key personnel traveling to Ft. Hood, TX, to conduct planning with the 4th ID staff. During this time the 1st Squadron's commander, Lt. Col. James H. Chevallier, designated about 40 personnel to comprise an ADVON, and they deployed to Turkey in early February. Their mission was to conduct a detailed <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> from the seaport of debarkation (SPOD) at İskenderun, on the Mediterranean Sea coast, in south-central Turkey, to the border crossing near the tactical assembly areas located near the towns of Silopi, Dicle, and Cizre, near the Turkish-Iraqi border. The <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> conducted by less than 30 officers and non-commissioned officers is believed to the longest route recon conducted in modern times; the men assigned the task cataloged every bridge, route constriction and obstruction, hill grade, and curve radius for nearly 500 mi. The goal of ARFOR-T was to open a second front, to crush Iraqi armed resistance from the North. The Quarterhorse, mounted on the hastily drawn, and refurbished, HMMWVs they had prepared initially for their Kosovo rotation, would conduct a screen along one of the 4th IDs flanks as it charged south out of Turkey. While the Quarterhorse was conducting the <b>route</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> the Turkish government debated at length whether they should to allow Coalition forces to invade from their territory, finally signaling in early March 2003 that the invasion would not be permitted from their soil. By early April, all of the Quarterhorse troopers returned to Schweinfurt, unsure what the future held, as the Iraqi regime was toppled by forces assaulting north from Kuwait. The {{main body of the}} squadron never deployed out of Germany, despite being on standby and prepared to move for nearly two weeks in early March.|$|E
