50|$|In use, {{this type}} of secure fixing enables rod {{rotation}} in both directions which is often necessary to clear blockages. Tree roots in particular often need 'winding up' before extraction and disposal. In addition the drain <b>rod</b> <b>set</b> usually has one or two unblocking tools. One may be a pivoting flat metal plate of almost half the drain diameter. It is hinged across the widest point. This tool can be rotated to ride over poor mortar joints or dragged over the joint to scrape any protuberance. An auger can be screwed onto one end, {{it may be a}} single helical coarse thread or even double helix. The latter being ideal to capture thin young tree roots. Various rubber 'washers' and bristle cleaning assemblies can be purchased too.|$|E

40|$|Modeling of ion {{motion and}} {{experimental}} investigations of ion excitation in a linear quadrupole trap with a 4 % added octopole field are described. The results are {{compared with those}} obtained with a conventional round <b>rod</b> <b>set.</b> Motion in the effective potential of the <b>rod</b> <b>set</b> can explain many of the observed phenomena. The frequencies of ion oscillation in the x and y directions shift with amplitude in opposite directions as the amplitudes of oscillation increase. Excitation profiles for ion fragmentation become asymmetric {{and in some cases}} show bistable behavior where the amplitude of oscillation suddenly jumps between high and low values with very small changes in excitation frequency. Experiments show these effects. Ions are injected into a linear trap, stored, isolated, excited for MS/MS, and then mass analyzed in a time-of-flight mass analyzer. Frequency shifts between the x and y motions are observed, and in some cases asymmetric excitation profiles and bistable behavior are observed. Higher MS/MS efficiencies are expected when an octopole field is added. MS/MS efficiencies (N 2 collision gas) have been measured for a conventional quadrupole <b>rod</b> <b>set</b> and a linear ion trap with a 4 % added octopole field. Efficiencies are chemical compound dependent, but when an octopole field is added, efficiencies can be substantially higher than with a conventional <b>rod</b> <b>set,</b> particularly at pressures of 1. 4 × 10 − 4 torr or less...|$|E

40|$|Mass {{selective}} axial ejection of ions from linear quadrupoles {{with added}} octopole fields is described. Quadrupoles with 2. 0 % and 2. 6 % added octopole fields {{have been tested}} and compared with a conventional quadrupole. The effects of trapping ions at different q values, excitation voltage, scan direction, balanced and unbalanced rf voltages on the rods, and dc applied between the rods have been investigated. The highest scan speeds and best resolution are obtained with resonant excitation and ejection at high q (q = 0. 8). With axial ejection, the quadrupole with a 2. 0 % added octopole field provides mass resolution and ejection efficiencies similar to a conventional <b>rod</b> <b>set.</b> Quadrupole, dipole, and simultaneous dipole–dipole excitation between the x and y rod pairs were compared, and no advantage was found with quadrupole or dipole–dipole excitation. The effects of scan speed were investigated and a resolution at half height of about 1600 is possible at scans speed up to 5000 Th/s...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{analysis}} with linear quadrupole mass filters is possible by forming “islands” in the stability diagram with auxiliary quadrupole excitation. In this work, computer simulations {{are used to}} calculate stability boundaries, island positions, and peak shapes and ion transmission for mass {{analysis with}} linear quadrupole mass filters that have added octopole fields of about 2 to 4 %. <b>Rod</b> <b>sets</b> with exact geometries that have quadrupole and octopole fields only in the potential, and round <b>rod</b> <b>sets,</b> with multipoles up to N = 10 (the twenty pole term) included in the calculations, show the same stability boundaries, island positions, and peak shapes. With the DC voltage applied to the rods so that the Mathieu parameter a 0, the resolution and transmission are poor preventing conventional mass analysis. In principle, mass analysis in an island is possible with operation at either of two tips. Provided the correct island tip is chosen for mass analysis, peak shapes comparable to those with a > 0 and no excitation are possible, both with a > 0 and with a < 0. In the latter case, {{the use of an}} island of stability allows mass analysis when the added octopole otherwise prevents conventional mass analysis...|$|R
5000|$|The {{quadrupole}} mass analyzer (QMS) is {{one type}} of mass analyzer used in mass spectrometry. It {{is also known as}} a transmission quadrupole mass spectrometer, quadrupole mass filter, or quadrupole mass spectrometer. As the name implies, it consists of four cylindrical <b>rods,</b> <b>set</b> parallel to each other. [...] In a quadrupole mass spectrometer the quadrupole is the component of the instrument responsible for filtering sample ions, based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Ions are separated in a quadrupole based on the stability of their trajectories in the oscillating electric fields that are applied to the rods.|$|R

40|$|Linear quadrupoles {{with added}} hexapole fields are described. The shifts in ion {{oscillation}} frequency {{caused by the}} addition of a hexapole field are calculated within the effective potential model. Methods to construct linear quadrupoles with added hexapole fields with exact electrode geometries and with round rods are discussed. A quadrupole with added hexapole field can be constructed with round rods by rotating two rods (say the y rods) towards an x rod. Computer simulations are used to investigate the possibility of mass analysis with quadrupoles with added hexapole fields. We find that a quadrupole with an added hexapole field in the range 2 – 12 % can provide mass analysis provided the dc is applied with the correct polarity and value. When a <b>rod</b> <b>set</b> is constructed with round rods, other multipoles in the potential degrade the peak shape, resolution and transmission. The largest of these after the quadrupole and hexapole are a dipole and octopole term. With round rod sets, the peak shape can be improved by using different diameters for the x and y rod pairs to minimize the octopole term in the potential and by injecting ions at the field center where the dipole term is zero. Calculations of the boundaries of the stability diagram for this case show the boundaries move out, relative to those of a pure quadrupole field, but remain sharp...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a pneumatic/hydraulic operated cylinder composed of several cylinder modules arranged in succession in the axial direction, {{each of which}} guidess a piston which {{has at least one}} piston <b>rod</b> <b>set</b> {{to one side of the}} piston, whereby the front cylinder module has an opening at its front end face permitting the piston rod to pass through, and in said opening the piston rod extendable out of the cylinder at said face side and connected to the piston of the front cylinder module is guided, each cylinder module, with the exception of the rear, end-side closed cylinder module, having a piston rod passage opening for the piston rod and its rear end face, said piston rod being connected to the piston guided in the next cylinder module, and whereby each cylinder module is provided with an inlet and outlet for the hydraulic/pneumatic medium at least in the area of its rear end face and in the area of the front end face. The task of specifying a cylinder which permits more tha n two defined positions of the piston rod such as the known multiposition cylinder, but in comparison having a simple and compact design, is characterized by the fact that, according to the solution provided by the invention, the cylinder modules (1, 2, 3, 4) in the cylinders of the type described above are designed so that the maximum possible piston stroke length in the rearmost [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{wave energy}} convertors are {{designed}} to use either vertical (heave) or horizontal (surge) movements of waves. But the frequency response of small heaving buoys and oscillating water column devices shows that they are too stiff and so their resonance is at too short a period. A device moving in the horizontal (surge) direction has less restoring spring and so its resonance is at too long a period. It follows that a device that moved at some intermediate slope angle could have an intermediate value of hydrodynamic stiffness and so be resonant at a variable and desirable part of the wave spectrum. There have been two series of model tests in this work. The first used a simple free-floating model with no power take-off apparatus and with constraint achieved {{by means of a}} large inertia plate lying in the slope plane. The second used a rig that constrained the slope movement of the buoy head by means of hydrostatic bearings running on a guide <b>rod</b> <b>set</b> to the chosen slope angle. An external power take-off system was used to simulate a linear damper for absorbing the incident wave energy and control the motion of the model. This thesis firstly studies the potential of varying the slope angle as a way of tuning the natural period of the device to suit useful wave periods. Secondly, it studies the experimental and theoretical power capture ability of models with different slope angles in regular waves in the frequency domain. The hydrodynamic coefficients of the model were determined both experimentally and numerically based on linear hydrodynamic concepts. The power absorption of the models was calculated using the experimental data of the hydrodynamic coefficients and also measured directly. Some control of power take-off was also investigated. Some irregular wave tests were carried out for the 45 degrees slope angle case. The results show that it is feasible to alter the slope angle of the device as a way of tuning its natural period. However, in further studies of the power capture ability for different slope angles, the device shows a very wide bandwidth and high efficiency performance when it is set to 45 degrees slope angle. This suggests that to constrain the device to a 45 degrees slope angle is suitable for most of the sea states...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{are carried}} out to {{investigate}} the cavitation process induced by the spill-off from material from a surface in a liquid environment. Therefore, a simplified physical model was designed which allows the optical observation of the process next to a transparent glass rod submerged in a liquid where the rod is forced to fracture at a pre-defined groove. High-speed shadow-imaging and refractive index matching allow observation {{of the dynamics of}} the cavitation generation and cavitation bubble breakdown together with the flow. The results show that the initial phase of spill-off is a vertical lift-off of the rod from the surface that is normal to the direction of pendulum impact. A cavitation bubble is immediately formed during spill-off process and grows in size until lateral motion of the <b>rod</b> <b>sets</b> in. While the rod is transported away, the bubble shrinks into hyperbolic shape and finally collapses.
