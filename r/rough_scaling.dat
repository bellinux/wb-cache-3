This {{seemingly}} obscure {{but really}} beautiful little insect (the {{smallest of the}} 154 New Zealand Oecophoridae) is probably adapted by its complex marking and <b>rough</b> <b>scaling</b> for concealment on tree-trunks, and by its bright metallic and coppery ornamentation for flying in sunshine, both these habits being characteristic of the species of Petalanthes also.|$|E

Acreage requirements for drilling and powerplants are estimated, as are the costs for wells, fluid transmission pipes, and generating stations. <b>Rough</b> <b>scaling</b> relationships are developed for cost factors as a function of reservoir temperature. Estimates are made for cooling water requirements, and possible sources of cooling water are discussed. Availability and suitability of agricultural wastewater for cooling are emphasized.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find out what abiotic {{environmental}} variables are related to the occurrence of benthic water bug Aphelocheirus aestivalis. Samples and abiotic environmental data sets obtained by extensive monitoring of Labe, Vltava and Danube river basin in the Czech Republic were sorted and analysed by Redundancy analysis (RDA). Results of RDA did not offer transparent response on our question. The reason is probably too <b>rough</b> <b>scaling</b> of environmental variables used commonly by hydrobiologist for monitoring of benthos in running waters. More detailed design of fieldwork is probably necessary for a better solution of question mentioned above...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMirror dark matter, {{and other}} similar {{dissipative}} dark matter candidates, need an energy source to stabilize dark matter halos around spiral galaxies. It has been suggested previously that ordinary supernovae can potentially supply the required energy. By matching the energy supplied to the halo from supernovae to that lost due to radiative cooling, we here derive a <b>rough</b> <b>scaling</b> relation, RSN∝ρ 0 r 02 (RSN is the supernova rate and ρ 0,r 0 the dark matter central density and core radius). Such a relation is consistent with dark matter properties inferred from studies of spiral galaxies with halo masses larger than 3 × 1011 M⊙. We speculate that other observed galaxy regularities might be explained {{within the framework of}} such dissipative dark matter...|$|E

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that tunneling spectra in various high Tc cuprates display generic features. The principal conductance peaks in superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) junctions indicate the superconducting {{gap in the}} density of states (DOS), Higher energy features include a dip and hump structure with a strength that is asymmetric in bias voltage. The dip and hump features follow the doping trends of the superconducting gap, Δ, with a <b>rough</b> <b>scaling</b> as ∼ 2 Δ and ∼ 3 Δ respectively. Tunneling spectra in underdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +δ display a more pronounced hump feature suggestive of a second gap in the DOS. It is observed that the hump feature in the tunneling density of states is consistent with other experimental observations of the so-called high energy pseudogap which may have magnetic origin...|$|E
40|$|Columnar {{jointing}} is {{a fracture}} pattern common in igneous rocks in which cracks self-organize into a roughly hexagonal arrangement, leaving behind an ordered colonnade. We report observations of columnar jointing {{in a laboratory}} analog system, desiccated corn starch slurries. Using measurements of moisture density, evaporation rates, and fracture advance rates as evidence, we suggest an advective-diffusive system {{is responsible for the}} <b>rough</b> <b>scaling</b> behavior of columnar joints. This theory explains the order of magnitude difference in scales between jointing in lavas and in starches. We investigated the scaling of average columnar cross-sectional areas due to the evaporation rate, the analog of the cooling rate of igneous columnar joints. We measured column areas in experiments where the evaporation rate depended on lamp height and time, in experiments where the evaporation rate was fixed using feedback methods, and in experiments where gelatin was added to vary the rheology of the starch. Our results suggest that the column area at a particular depth is related to both the current conditions, and hysteretically to the geometry of the pattern at previous depths. We argue that there exists a range of stable column scales allowed for any particular evaporation rate. Comment: 12 pages, 11 figures, for supporting online movies, go to [URL]...|$|E

40|$|We perform Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) {{modeling}} {{to interpret}} small-scale and intermediate-scale clustering of 35, 000 luminous early-type galaxies and their cross-correlation with a reference imaging sample of normal L ∗ {{galaxies in the}} Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The modeling results show {{that most of these}} luminous red galaxies (LRGs) are central galaxies residing in massive halos of typical mass M ∼ a few times 10 13 to 10 14 h − 1 M⊙, while a few percent of them have to be satellites within halos in order to produce the strong auto-correlations exhibited on smaller scales. The mean luminosity Lc of central LRGs increases with the host halo mass, with a <b>rough</b> <b>scaling</b> relation of Lc ∝ M 0. 5. The halo mass required to host on average one satellite LRG above a luminosity threshold is found to be about 10 times higher than that required to host a central LRG above the same threshold. We find that in massive halos the distribution of L ∗ galaxies roughly follows that of the dark matter and their mean occupation number scales with halo mass as M 1. 5. The HOD modeling results also allows for an intuitive understanding of the scale-dependent luminosity dependence of the cross-correlation between LRGs and L ∗ galaxies. Constraints on the LRG HOD provide tests to models of formation and evolution of massive galaxies, and they are also useful for cosmological paramete...|$|E
5000|$|The {{efficiency}} of conversion of ingested food to unit of body substance (ECI, also termed [...] "growth efficiency") is an index measure of food fuel efficiency in animals.
