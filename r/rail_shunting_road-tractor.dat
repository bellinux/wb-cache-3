50|$|PD Ports leases {{a number}} of former-British <b>Rail</b> Class 08 <b>shunting</b> {{locomotives}} from RMS Locotec to move rail traffic around the port, and to/from the two main associated marshalling yards. The port is directly rail connected to the East Coast Main Line and the Durham Coast Line, {{and close to the}} A66 trans-pennine route, and other major trunk roads.|$|R
50|$|The {{power station}} {{consisted}} of two 30-megawatt (MW) generation units for a peak rating of 57 MWe. It was commissioned in 1965 for the then South of Scotland Electricity Board. Built {{on the site of}} a golf course, it was designed to utilise low-grade coal slurry supplied from the washeries of the nearby Fife coalfield. This coal was delivered by road and <b>rail</b> wagons <b>shunted</b> into and out of elevated sidings. Like almost all other coal-fired power stations in Scotland, Methil did not use cooling towers, instead using sea water as coolant. An exception was Methil's sister station of Barony, situated in central Ayrshire.|$|R
50|$|In Belgium, {{the company}} UCA bvba has been {{constructing}} road-rail vehicles since 1981. UCA started with converting WF-trac and MB-trac for rail traction uses. They built <b>rail</b> car movers, <b>shunting</b> locotractors and other road-rail vehicles. Best known is the UCA-TRAC, {{based on the}} chassis of a JCB Load-All (UCA-TRAC B) and Fastrac (UCA-TRAC F). The UCA-TRAC provides traction through its rubber wheels.|$|R
25|$|The railway {{first thought}} {{of using a}} diesel {{locomotive}} in the early 1970s, when a small four-wheeled diesel-mechanical locomotive built by Ruston & Hornsby (their class 48DL) was bought second-hand from a quarry. It was intended to regauge it {{and use it as}} a yard shunter at Llanberis. It was sold to the Llanberis Lake Railway in 1978 without being regauged or used on the SMR. It would have been the railway's only locomotive without pinions, and as such would have been of limited use â€“ it is doubtful if it would have had sufficient grip on the grease covered <b>rails</b> to <b>shunt</b> a dead steam locomotive. This locomotive has since been dismantled and scrapped.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} the {{allocation}} has solely consisted of Class 43 power cars for High Speed Trains along with some British <b>Rail</b> Class 08 <b>shunting</b> locomotives. The DMUs in Devon and Cornwall were based at Cardiff Canton TMD for several years, but in December 2007 Laira had an allocation of two-car Class 150 and single-car Class 153 DMUs. After a while these were transferred to a reopened Exeter Traction Maintenance Depot.|$|R
50|$|Class T 9.1 of the Prussian state {{railways}} were {{goods train}} tank locomotives with a 0-6-2T wheel arrangement. They were intended for service on branch lines, for goods train duties on main lines and for <b>shunting</b> (<b>rail)</b> work. A total of 420 locomotives were built by various manufacturers for the Prussian state railways {{as well as}} 6 units for the Cronberg Railway, which had {{been taken over by}} the state railways in 1914.|$|R
50|$|However, in April 2008, the {{completion}} date was redefined, {{because of the}} lack of coherence between Russian Railways and municipality, and due to the inconsistency of the reconstruction works on the Ligovsky Prospect. The new dates were set as follows: in early May, static and dynamic tests were to be held on the bridge by passing locomotives. The load testing took place on 6 May 2008, whereupon the bridge was opened for <b>shunting</b> <b>rail</b> traffic.|$|R
40|$|Angle {{of attack}} is an {{important}} wheel-rail contact parameter. It serves for estimation of the rolling stock curving performance. Together with wheel-rail contact forces, angle of attack influences the wear index. This paper presents experimental on-track measurements of the angle of attack using a specially designed laser device installed on track. Experiments are performed on three types of <b>rail</b> vehicles: <b>shunting</b> locomotive series 631 - 301, motor unit 412 - 077 and trailing unit 416 - 077 of electromotor train 412 / 416. Experimental measurements are compared with multibody system (MBS) simulations using specialized computer package VAMPIRE Pro. We have found good agreement between the results obtained experimentally and by simulations. Using these data, we have also performed relative comparison of wear indices of the outer wheels of the leading wheelsets {{for each of the}} tested vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a rail-bound transport system comprising self-propelled vehicles running along a rail system, fixed rail sections and movable <b>rail</b> sections, <b>shunted</b> wagons, lifts, turntables, etc. The rail-bound transport system {{is characterized by}} the vehicles having at least one bumper to prevent them travelling over open rail ends and having at least a stopping element for the fixed and movable open rail ends, which are movable between an operating point at which they stop the vehicle on contact with the bumper, and an external operating point at which they permit the passage of the vehicle, the transition of the contact element from operating point to external operating point taking place by means of an operating equipment, when a moving rail end is positioned in relation to the open fixed rail end such that a vehicle can travel over the joint position...|$|R
30|$|In step 1, {{the total}} costs {{for a single}} {{transport}} segment (per train / per barge / per truck) were calculated. Then the segment costs for a single container were worked out by dividing the total segment cost {{by the number of}} containers. In the final step, the total trip costs for a single container were calculated by adding the costs for all transport segments. In <b>rail</b> transport, each <b>shunting</b> process was considered as a new transport segment (the shunting segments consisted of: collection: siding -> shunting yard; mainline operation: shunting yard -> shunting yard; distribution: shunting yard -> siding).|$|R
5000|$|The first wharf {{built in}} 1885-86 {{was called the}} Port Darwin Jetty or Railway Jetty and was made of timber. The railway {{connecting}} Palmerston, the previous name for Darwin, to Pine Creek ran onto the wharf. A small steam engine, known as the [...] "Sandfly", was used to <b>shunt</b> <b>rail</b> stock {{the length of the}} jetty. The jetty was closed in 1897 owing to the danger of collapse. The cyclone of 1897 and being eaten away by teredo navalis, a salt water clam also known as the naval shipworm, eventually caused the jetty to collapse that year.|$|R
40|$|The Aurizon (formerly QR National) Workshops in Rockhampton {{is a large}} rail heavy {{maintenance}} facility where the primary function is to repair and modify rollingstock. As the workshops are {{in close proximity to}} the Central Queensland coal fields most of the rollingstock presented are coal wagons and locomotives. Due to {{the fact that most of}} the rollingstock in the workshop yard is unpowered an external power source in the form of a <b>rail</b> mounted <b>shunt</b> vehicle is used to place the rollingstock in the desired location. The site has two shunt vehicles, a DN 300 and a DN 100. Both vehicles are designed for on road and on track operation. The on track operation is facilitated by the rubber road tyres contacting the track to provide traction with the on track guidance provided by hi-rail wheels front and rear. Both machines have derailed during normal operations heightening the risk of possible injury as well as causing major disruptions to production as the machine is quarantined for investigation following a derailment. Management are therefore very keen to try and establish a root cause of these derailments. The focus of this preliminary report is to provide an update on the investigations into the root causes of these derailments. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} MISTER (Metropolitan Individual System of Transportation on an Elevated Rail), {{and compares}} {{it with other}} leading personal rapid transit (PRT) designs that are currently under development. MISTER would be a high-capacity PRT, to be used initially for city transportation of passengers and goods. Like other PRT designs, it would be fully automated, driven by demand and individual travel requirements. MISTER would be more economically, energy and space efficient than private cars, buses, tramways (streetcars), metros and other rail transit systems. While most PRT concepts would feature supported vehicles, MISTERâ€™s cabins would travel suspended below an elevated guideway infrastructure. The vehicles would be propelled by electric motors powered by an external cable or rail. This configuration would enable the implementation of parallel parking bays, the negotiation of steep grades, and contactless, stationary frogs (<b>rail</b> switching or <b>shunting</b> equivalent) at intersections. In a later phase, MISTERâ€™s vehicles could be transferred from their suspended propulsion caddies, used for travel on the rail network, onto battery-driven and automated wheeled platforms, akin to golf-cart bases, for automated door-to-door delivery of MISTER cabins over city streets. A further extension would enable intercity travel (under, say 400 km) on the same elevate...|$|R
