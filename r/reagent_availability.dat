40|$|Background—Testing for canine blood types {{other than}} dog {{erythrocyte}} antigen 1. 1 (DEA 1. 1) is controversial and complicated by <b>reagent</b> <b>availability</b> and methodology. Objectives—The objectives {{of this study}} were to use available gel column technology to develop an extended blood-typing method using polyclonal reagents for DEA 1. 1, 1. 2, 3, 4, 7, and Dal and to assess the use of gel columns for cross-matching. Methods—Dogs (43 – 75) were typed for DEA 1. 1, 1. 2, 3, 4, 7, and Dal. Methods included tube agglutination (Tube) using polyclonal reagents, a commercially available DEA 1. 1 gel column test kit (Standard-Gel) using monoclonal reagent, and multiple gel columns (Extended-Gel) using polyclonal reagents. Blood from 10 recipient and 15 donor dogs was typed as described above and cross-matched using the gel column technique. Results—Of 43 dogs typed for DEA 1. 1, 23, 25, and 20 dogs were positive using Standard-Gel, Extended-Gel, and Tube, respectively. Typing for DEA 1. 2 was not achievable with Extended-Gel. For 75 dogs typed for DEA 3, 4, and 7, concordance of Extended-Gel with Tube was 94. 7 %, 100 %, and 84 %, respectively. Dal, determined only by Extended-Gel, was positive for all dogs...|$|E
40|$|Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an orthopoxvirus {{closely related}} to variola, the {{etiological}} agent of smallpox. In humans, MPXV causes a disease similar to smallpox and {{is considered to be}} an emerging infectious disease. Moreover, the use of MPXV for bioterroristic/biowarfare activities is of significant concern. Available small animal models of human monkeypox have been restricted to mammals with poorly defined biologies that also have limited <b>reagent</b> <b>availability.</b> We have established a murine MPXV model utilizing the STAT 1 -deficient C 57 BL/ 6 mouse. Here we report that a relatively low-dose intranasal (IN) infection induces 100 % mortality in the stat 1 −/− model by day 10 postinfection with high infectious titers in the livers, spleens, and lungs of moribund animals. Vaccination with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) followed by a booster vaccination is sufficient to protect against an intranasal MPXV challenge and induces an immune response more robust than that of a single vaccination. Furthermore, antiviral treatment with CMX 001 (HDP-cidofovir) and ST- 246 protects when administered as a regimen initiated on the day of infection. Thus, the stat 1 −/− model provides a lethal murine platform for evaluating therapeutics and for investigating the immunological and pathological responses to MPXV infection...|$|E
40|$|Convenient and well-performing protein {{detection}} methods {{for a wide}} range of targets are in great demand for biomedical research and future diagnostics. Assays without the need for washing steps while still unaffected when analyzing complex biological samples are difficult to develop. Herein, we report a well-characterized nucleic acid proximity-based assay using antibodies, called Proximity Extension Assay (PEA), showing good performance in plasma samples. Target-specific antibody pairs are linked to DNA strands that upon simultaneous binding to the target analyte create a real-time PCR amplicon in a proximity-dependent manner enabled by the action of a DNA polymerase. 3 ′Exonuclease-capable polymerases were found to be clearly superior in sensitivity over non- 3 ′exonuclease ones. A PEA was set up for IL- 8 and GDNF in a user-friendly, homogenous assay displaying femtomolar detection sensitivity, good recovery in human plasma, high specificity and up to 5 -log dynamic range in 1 μL samples. Furthermore, we have illustrated the use of a macro-molecular crowding matrix in combination with this homogeneous assay to drive target binding for low-affinity antibodies, thereby improving the sensitivity and increasing affinity <b>reagent</b> <b>availability</b> by lowering assay development dependency on high-affinity antibodies. Assay performance was also confirmed for a multiplex version of PEA...|$|E
40|$|In this study, Singh et al. {{aimed to}} {{identify}} alternative nonpeptidic structures {{to replace a}} known peptidic molecule antagonist that is rapidly cleared from the body. Experiments have indicated that the integrin binding motif of (Leu-Asp-Val) {{can be used as}} a starting point for the design of small molecule antagonists of α 4 β 1. However, the potent molecule of 4 -[N'-(2 -methylphenyl) ureido]phenylacetyl-Leu-Asp-Val results in rapid clearance due to its peptidic nature. Singh et al. developed a Catalyst model based on known structure activity relationship (SAR) data. A virtual compound library, which was based on commercially available reagents containing a free amine or a nitro group and a carboxyl group, was generated (~ 8500 compounds). The Catalyst pharmacophore model was then used to virtually screen the database. A total of 416 hits were retrieved, and removal of peptide-like compounds reduced this to 170 hits. Of these, 12 compounds were selected based on synthetic feasibility and <b>reagents</b> <b>availability.</b> The most potent hit yielded 1. 3 nM activity. In this project, Catalyst aided in the successful transformation of a peptide lead compound into discover y of a small molecule inhibitor.

We present a direct multivariate finite mixture modeling approach, using skew and heavy-tailed distributions, to address the complexities of flow cytometric analysis and to deal with high-dimensional cytometric data without the need for projection or transformation. We demonstrate its ability to detect rare populations, to model robustly in the presence of outliers and skew, and to perform the critical task of matching cell populations across samples that enables downstream analysis. This advance will facilitate the application of flow cytometry to new, complex biological and clinical problems...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{genotypic}} methods based {{on the study of}} bacterial DNA polymorphism have shown high discriminatory power for strain differentiation and superiority over most phenotypic methods commonly available in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Some of the methods used, however, required either a high level of technology and sophisticated equipment (e. g., pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) or species-specific <b>reagents</b> of restricted <b>availability</b> (randomly cloned DNA probes or gene-specific probes). Because ribotyping uses a universal probe (rRNA) and is a rather simple technology, particularly since the advent of nonradioactive labelling systems, it has been widely used for strain differentiation of most bacterial species involved in nosocomial outbreaks. In vitro and in vivo stability of the markers studied has been demonstrated. Although there may be limitation to this approach, ribotyping was found to be highly discriminative, particularly for typing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Xanthomonas maltophilia. In many cases, it has improved the understanding of the mechanism of nosocomial acquisition of organisms by allowing a distinction between endogenous and exogenous infections. Among exogenous infections, it has distinguished between individual and epidemic strains, thus differentiating cross-infection from independent acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Neisseria meningitidis is a {{major cause}} of both {{meningitis}} and septicemia. Typically, isolates are characterized by using a combination of immunological phenotyping, using monoclonal and polyclonal antisera, and Sanger nucleotide sequencing of epitope-encoding variable regions, although these methods can be both time-consuming and limited by <b>reagent</b> <b>availability.</b> Herein, we describe and evaluate a novel microarray to define the porB and porA serotypes of N. meningitidis by the resequencing of variable regions in a single hybridization reaction. PCR products for each gene were amplified, pooled in equimolar concentrations, hybridized to the microarray, and analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip DNA Analysis Software. Resequencing of the microarray data was then validated by comparison with sequencing data. Molecular profiles were generated for 50 isolates that were combinations of phenotypically typeable (ie, PorA and PorB) and non-typeable (PorB only) isolates. Microarray-generated profiles from isolates with a PorB phenotype were concordant with predicted profiles compared with a previously described typing scheme. In addition, 42 % (8 of 19) of previously non-typeable samples were assigned a PorB type when tested using the microarray. The remaining isolates were novel types for which no typing antisera are currently available. The porA data were 97 % concordant with Sanger nucleotide sequencing. These results suggest that that microarray resequencing may be a useful tool for the characterization of meningococci, particularly for those isolates that cannot be phenotyped, offering an alternative to conventional sequencing methods.

40|$|Kathleen Lewis, ???Solvex: A {{database}} for {{the selection and}} appraisal of solvent extraction reagents???, Minerals Engineering, Vol. 5 (3 - 5) : 513 - 520, 1992. The version of record is available online at doi: [URL] Copyright ?? 1992 Published by Elsevier Ltd. The design of a solvent extraction process can cause considerable problems regarding the choice of reagents. Reagent selection {{is based upon the}} evaluation of many criteria, for example the ability of a reagent to transfer a metal selectively across the aqueous/organic interface in both directions and the ability of the extractant/diluent mixture to perform efficiently in terms of reaction rates and stabilities. Other factors are also important such as <b>reagent</b> <b>availability,</b> cost, capacity and toxicity. Manufacturers, world wide, are continuously seeking new and improved reagents and so the already large range is steadily growing, adding to the dilemma. In response to these problems the Solvent Extraction Database, SOLVEX, was developed at Warren Spring Laboratory, in association with the Minerals Industry Research Organisation. It offers a single comprehensive source of reliable, quantitative information compiled into a single, standard format. A large part of the database consists of performance data which is essential to the process designer. The recent addition of a graphical interface has greatly enhanced the ability of the system to allow the efficiency of different systems to be compared and evaluated. SOLVEX also stores data concerned with the physical properties of the reagents and physicochemical data such as specific gravity, solubility, interfacial tension, viscosity and toxicity. There are also comprehensive sections on commercial information and references. This paper describes the database and the graphical interface and discusses the advantages it can offer process engineers and manufacturers alike...|$|E
40|$|Immunoprecipitable {{double-stranded}} (dsDNA) {{was previously}} shown {{to persist in}} the circulation of a clinically recognizable subgroup of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Plasma from 10 such patients was subjected to a DNA isolation procedure that used a combination of proteolysis, phenol extraction, and hydroxylapatite adsorption and elution {{in the presence of}} urea. The isolated dsDNA was radiolabeled by nick translation and then characterized by isopyknic ultracentrifugation in CsCl under both neutral and alkaline conditions, as well as after digestion with S 1 -endonuclease. These experiments demonstrated essential identity in nucleotide base composition between the plasma-derived DNA and human genomic DNA. The presence of specific human base sequences in the plasma DNA was demonstrated by finding that authentic human genomic DNA accelerated the renaturation of plasma DNA when compared with the effect of nonhuman, control DNA. The proportion of such sequences in plasma DNA was estimated by attempting to renature the plasma DNA in the presence of human DNA under conditions shown to result in complete renaturation of human DNA in model experiments. In this way, a minimum of 47 % of plasma DNA base sequences could be shown also to be present in human genomic DNA. However, an average of 10 - 20 % of the plasma-derived DNA failed to renature under these conditions, a result that was further confirmed by comparing the renaturation of the tritium-labeled plasma DNA specimens, in double-label experiments, with internal controls consisting of 14 C-labeled authentic human DNA. Attempts to drive the reaction to completion with human DNA led to a similar conclusion. The relative nonrenaturability of this fraction of plasma DNA {{did not appear to be}} attributable to extensive chain breakage, although adequate analysis of this DNA subfraction was limited by <b>reagent</b> <b>availability.</b> It was therefore concluded that, in this group of SLE patients, persistently circulating DNA consisted largely of base sequences also found in human genomic DNA. The additional presence in plasma of a DNA subfraction that differed in its renaturation behavior from human genomic DNA was recognized, although its significance could not be established with certainty...|$|E
40|$|Fc receptors (FcRs) play a {{key role}} in {{regulating}} and coordinating responses from both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The inhibitory Fc gamma receptor II (Fc?RIIB; CD 32) is central to this regulation with Fc?RIIB(-/-) mice demonstrating augmented responses to mAb immunotherapy, elevated incidence and severity of auto-immunity, and increased response to mAb-mediated cancer therapy. To date, these observations have remained unexploited therapeutically, partly through a lack of specific mAb reagents capable of exclusively binding mouse Fc?RIIB. Thus almost all of the Fc?RIIB-binding mAb currently available, such as 2. 4 G 2, also bind Fc?RIII (CD 16), and polyclonal <b>reagents</b> have limited <b>availability</b> and are of unproven specificity and avidity, making in vivo manipulation of Fc?RIIB impossible. Following an extensive immunisation protocol using Fc?RIIB(-/-) mice, we recently produced three unique mAb that are suitable for this purpose. Here we characterise these novel reagents and demonstrate that they fall into two distinct categories; those which cause phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Fc?RIIB (agonistic) and those that block receptor phosphorylation (antagonistic). These two types of mAb exhibit different characteristics in a range of biochemical, cellular, and functional assays relevant to Fc?RIIB activity and mAb therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{signaling}} events {{generated by}} a cold exposure are poorly known in plants. We were interested in checking the possible activation of enzymes of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway {{in response to a}} temperature drop. In Arabidopsis suspension cells labeled with 33 PO 43 −, a cold treatment induces a rapid increase of phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) content. This production was due to the simultaneous activation of phospholipase C (through diacylglycerol kinase activity) and phospholipase D, as monitored by the production of inositol triphosphate and of transphosphatidylation product, respectively. Moreover, inhibitors of the phosphoinositide pathway and of diacylglycerol kinase reduced PtdOH production. Enzyme activation occurred immediately after cells were transferred to low temperature. The respective contribution of both kind of phospholipases in cold-induced production of PtdOH could be estimated. We created conditions where phospholipids were labeled with 33 PO 43 −, but with ATP being nonradioactive. In such conditions, the apparition of radioactive PtdOH reflected PLD activity. Thus, we demonstrated that during a cold stress, phospholipase D activity accounted for 20 % of PtdOH production. The analysis of composition in fatty acids of cold-produced PtdOH compared with that of different phospholipids confirmed that cold-induced PtdOH more likely derived mainly from phosphoinositides. The addition of chemical <b>reagents</b> modifying calcium <b>availability</b> inhibited the formation of PtdOH, showing that the cold-induced activation of phospholipase pathways is dependent on a calcium entry...|$|R

40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} deposits of insoluble protein inclusions or aggregates. Evidence shows that different neurodegenerative diseases share some common underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. However, the exact pathways by which disease-associated proteins form aggregates/inclusions and the steps in this cascade that are linked to pathogenesis, are not fully understood. In the present work, we investigated two known neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins, Synphilin- 1 and huntingtin, in yeast models, to explore the aggregation management and translocation of these disease proteins. Synphilin- 1 is {{a major component of}} the Lewy body, a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Wakabayashi et al., 2000), and a Synphilin- 1 yeast model faithfully recapitulates this essential hallmark with Synphilin- 1 inclusions formation. However, biological processes and pathways that involved in the inclusion formation are still not known in detail. Given the excellent tool that the yeast model can provide, in this thesis, we use a novel image-based genome-wide high-content microscopy (HCM) screening system, which enables us to validate inclusion body (IB) formation of Synphilin- 1 in different genetic background systematically, and identify players controlling inclusion formation of Synphilin- 1. In parallel, we study the Huntington's disease (HD) protein huntingtin. PolyQ-expansion of huntingtin exon- 1 (Httex 1) is responsible for the HD pathogenesis. Although the subcellular localization of polyQ-expanded Httex 1 modulates polyQ toxicity in models of HD, the mechanisms involved in the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of polyQ-expanded Httex 1 remain to be elucidated. To investigate components and pathways involved in altering the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of polyQ-expanded Httex 1 - 103 Q, we performed a dual channel image-based genome-wide HCM screen, which allows us to analyze the subcellular localization of Httex 1 - 103 Q. In the Synphilin- 1 study we found that 133 genes are required for the IB formation of Synphilin- 1. Functional enrichment and physical interaction network analysis revealed these genes to encode for functions involved in cytoskeleton organization, histone modification, sister chromatid segregation, glycolipid biosynthetic process, DNA repair and replication. We provide evidence that lower level of Synphilin- 1 inclusion formation enhance cytotoxicity of Synphilin- 1, supporting the hypothesis that matured inclusions represent an end stage of several events to protect cells from misfolded proteins. The results of our Huntingtin study show that the ribosome quality control machinery is a key determinant for the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Httex 1 - 103 Q. Defect of the ribosome quality control components, Ltn 1 or Rqc 1, caused nuclear accumulation of Httex 1 - 103 Q through a process that requires the CAT-tail tagging activity of Rqc 2 and transport via the nuclear pore complex. We provide evidence that nuclear accumulation of Httex 1 - 103 Q enhances its cytotoxicity, suggesting that the ribosome quality control machinery {{plays an important role in}} protecting cells against the adverse effects of polyQ expansion proteins.
