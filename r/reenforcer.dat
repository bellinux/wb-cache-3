40|$|Ronald Creagh, Deference : Postmodernity and Anarchist Dissidence The anarchist {{critique}} is {{not primarily}} aimed at people or organizations, but rather {{at the social}} structure, the system and the elitist mentality and hierarchical relationships that it <b>reenforces.</b> This critique aims to, on the contrary, <b>reenforce</b> different loyalties, other life styles {{and other types of}} behavior. The anarchists are not opposed to the state because it is not perfect or because it is controlled by a particular social class, but because the structural conditions necessary for its existence are unacceptable. To accept the idea that the state is inevitable is to accept the idea that the people are to be inevitably alienated from the decision making process. This is an epistemological bias that raises ethical questions, misperceives the phenomenon of postmodernity and falsifies understanding of decision making. Creagh Ronald.

40|$|Ursula K. Le Guin’s 1969 Novel The Left Hand of Darkness and “The Outcast,” a 1992 {{episode of}} Star Trek: The Next Generation, {{have both been}} criticized for their {{representations}} of gender and sexuality essentially because they fail to remove fully the “traditional straitjackets” of the male-female binary and the heteronormativity they seek to challenge. A selection of this criticism is discussed, along with a close reading of each work. Despite different media, {{a difference in the}} degree of focus on gender, and the years separating them, the two works share striking similarities, making them worthy of comparison. This paper will reveal two shared features of The Left Hand of Darkness and “The Outcast” that undermine their stated or presumed aims: first, both works serve to <b>reenforce</b> a male-female gender binary, and second, while the use of androgynous characters has the potential to challenge heterosexual norms, both works <b>reenforce</b> such norms by gendering — specifically, feminizing — otherwise androgynous characters and conflating biological sex or gender identity with sexual orientation through romantic relationships with male protagonists...|$|R

30|$|The {{acceptance}} of misinformation or misleading information {{by the people}} depends on their prior beliefs and opinions [5]. People believe things which support their prior thoughts without questioning them. The same is also supported by research in cognitive psychology [6].

Countering such ideological and personal beliefs is indeed very difficult. Another important finding was that countering the misinformation may lead to amplifying the beliefs and <b>reenforcing</b> them.|$|R
