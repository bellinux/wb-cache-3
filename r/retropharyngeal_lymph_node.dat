40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the incidence and clinical significance of <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis in hypopharyngeal cancer. Methods: Pretreatment computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance images of 152 patients treated between 1998 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed.

Results: Twelve patients (8 %) were radiologically positive for <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis. Tumors originating from the posterior wall showed significantly higher inci-dence of <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> than those originating from other sites (23. 8 vs. 5. 3 %, P 0. 01).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The pretreatment computed tomographic scans of 208 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx were reviewed {{for the presence of}} metastatic <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> All patients were treated at the Leuven department between 1984 and 2003 : by radiotherapy alone in 84. 1 % of patients, by surgery with postoperative radiotherapy in 11. 5 %, and by concomitant chemoradiotherapy in 4. 4 %. Retropharyngeal node involvement was present in 34 (16 %) patients. The influence on recurrence (local and regional), distant metastasis, and survival was retrospectively analyzed. Median follow-up was 47 months (3. 9 years), and results were analyzed for 201 patients. RESULTS: At 5 years, patients with retropharyngeal adenopathy had significantly more regional recurrences (45 % vs. 10 %, p = 0. 004). Involvement of <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> significantly (relative risk 4. 29 [95 % confidence interval 3. 33 - 5. 25], p = 0. 01) and independently predicted regional recurrence in multivariate analysis. Disease-specific survival was significantly lower in the retropharyngeal node positive group (38 % vs. 58 %, p = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: Retropharyngeal node involvement has a negative impact on the prognosis of squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx. Patients are particularly at risk for regional recurrence, resulting in worse disease-specific survival. Retropharyngeal node involvement should be taken into account in designing the treatment plan for these patients. status: publishe...|$|R

A 4 -year-old ewe from a flock of 30 Santa Inês sheep, raised semi-extensively with access to a weir, showed cachexia, bilateral enlargement in nasal region, a serous and bloody secretion with a fetid odor from its nose and swollen submandibular and <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Blood collection was performed trough jugular vein puncture in order to make complete blood cell count (CBC) and to obtain serum for the subsequent serological examination. As the hematological counts were within the normal range for sheep, the animal was euthanized and submitted to necropsy. Indirect ELISA resulted positive for pythiosis. Necropsy revealed necrosis of the hard palate with a diameter of 3. 5 cm and extending up to the nasal cavity, forming a fistula. Submandibular and <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were enlarged and edematous on section. Microscopic findings for submandibular and <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> consisted in moderate infiltration of eosinophils mainly in the subcapsular sinus, characterizing reactive eosinophilic lymphadenitis.

40|$|Six {{goats and}} 169 sheep {{carrying}} the genotype susceptible for PrPSc from a flock naturally infected with classical scrapie were culled and investigated for scrapie using a rapid test on brainstem material (obex). Forty sheep {{turned out to}} be TSE-positive. The remaining 135 animals (with a negative test result in the obex region) were further investigated for the accumulation of PrPSc in selected lymphatic and neuronal tissue samples in order to reveal the actual prevalence in this affected flock and to assess the validity of the brain stem based rapid test result. Furthermore potential ports of entry of the agent and its spread throughout the body as well as the usefulness of certain tissues for an antemortem diagnosis were investigated. The following tissues were investigated immunohistochemically from all 135 animals: ileum, ileocolic lymph node, <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> tonsils and third eyelid. If PrPSc in one of the above mentioned tissues was detected, other tissues were checked for the presence of PrPSc (superficial cervical lymph node, spleen, rectum, solar plexus, ganglion cervicale craniale, ganglion stellatum, vagus nerve and tongue). In another 13 (10 %) out of 129 investigated sheep PrPSc was detected in peripheral tissues. In total, 53 sheep tested positive for PrPSc. That means that 24, 5 % (13 sheep) had not been detected using rapid test in the brain stem. Referring to the number of investigated sheep 7, 7 % of them were positive. The tissues producing positive results most frequently in this study were the tonsil and the <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> each with nine positive results, while ileum, superficial cervical lymph node and spleen were positive in eight sheep respectively. In the solar plexus PrPSc was detected in six sheep which also showed PrPSc in the enteric nervous system of the ileum and three of them also of the rectum. Only two sheep were positive in the third eyelid. All investigated tissues from the six goats tested negative. In conclusion, this study shows that a negative result of the rapid test for brain stem samples does not exclude the presence of PrPSc in peripheral tissues. In consequence, the actual prevalence of scrapie is significantly underestimated when it is only based on brainstem samples. Moreover this study shows that lymphatic tissues such as the <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and the tonsil are meaningful tissues for a closer investigation, if more information about the TSE-state of an animal is of any interest. In all, this study supports possible ports of entry as well as the postulates of a progress of PrPSc from the periphery to the CNS. The results from third eyelid and rectum samples do not support the usefulness of antemortem tests using these tissues. But an investigation of the tonsils provides an opportunity for early diagnosis...|$|E

Lymph node {{metastasis}} from differ-entiated thyroid carcinoma {{may occur}} {{outside of the}} basins at greatest risk of spread, such as the lateral retropharyngeal lymph nodes. The extensive surgery of traditional approaches to the retropharyngeal space are rarely justified {{in the treatment of}} metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer. Therefore, a less inva-sive surgical approach is advantageous in resection of meta-static lateral retropharyngeal nodes. Methods.

40|$|Wild deer have an {{important}} role in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). The aims of this study were (1) to compare the pattern of lesions present in wild red (Cervus elaphus) and fallow (Dama dama) deer that were naturally infected with Mycobacterium bovis, and (2) to use this information to develop a sampling strategy for the isolation of M. bovis from the lymphoid tissues of the head of these animals. Culture of head lymphoid tissues demonstrated that 28 of 95 red deer and 22 of 100 fallow deer sampled were infected with M. bovis. Approx- imately 30 % of each deer population had no gross lesions. Fallow deer were signiﬁcantly more likely to have thoracic lesions than red deer. Lesions were observed in the <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of 64 % of the culture-positive red deer and 43 % of the culture positive fallow deer. One third of the red deer, but none of the fallow deer, had well-encapsulated abscess lesions. There were no microscopical differences in the lesions in the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of the red and fallow deer. Bacteriological culture from both the tonsil and retro- pharyngeal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> increased the rate of isolation of M. bovis by 22 % over culture of the <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> alone in both species. These ﬁndings indicate that investigation of wild deer for bTB-compatible lesions should include examination of the medial retropharyngeal, left tracheobronchial, mediastinal, mesen- teric and ileocaecal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Sampling for bacteriological culture from head lymphoid tissues should be from the tonsil and the medial <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> These protocols may prove useful in bTB surveil- lance and control in regions where wild deer contribute to the circulation of M. bovis.

Results The frequency of RPLN was 20. 8 % (11 / 53). Advanced T stage cancer (OR = 5. 6250, 95 % CI: 1. 06 - 29. 80, p = 0. 0410) and advanced clinical N stage cancer (i. e. N 2 +) had higher odds (OR = 3. 9773, 95 % CI: 0. 9628 - 16. 4291) of being RPLN positive as compared to N 0 - 1 patients. Conclusions Pre-treatment PET-CT {{can be used as}} a staging tool to aid in treatment planning of OPSCC, as rates of RPLN and nodal metastasis are consistent with those reported in the literature. Advanced T and N stage are associated with a greater odds ratio of being RPLN positive by PET-CT imaging...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) from scrapie-infected sheep were {{evaluated}} {{for the presence}} of PrPSc by using dissociated <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (DRLN) cells and immunohistochemistry (IHC). PrPSc-positive cells were detected in 2. 05 % 0. 28 % of 3 106 DRLN cells, but were not detected in 3 106 PBLs from scrapie-infected sheep. Titration of DRLN cells mixed with PBLs showed that IHC detects a minimum of 0. 00205 % or 60 PrPSc-positive cells in 3 106 PBLs. Natural sheep scrapie is {{part of a group of}} fatal neurode-generative diseases called transmissible spongiform encepha-lopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, and is characterized by the accumulation of a protease-resistant protein designated PrPSc. Since PrPSc and a factor associated with infectivity copurify, the presence of PrPSc is considered a marker for TSEs (1). Immunohistochemical detection of PrPSc is a standard diag-nostic method for sheep scrapie. By immunohistochemistry (IHC), PrPSc is detected in lymphoid tissues during preclinical and clinical disease (6, 10, 11, 13, 14). Mouse bioassays corre...|$|E

40|$|Background. There is debate if the lymphatic {{drainage}} {{pattern of}} oral maxillary cancer {{is to the}} <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> or to the cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Insight in drainage patterns {{is important for the}} indication for neck treatment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the lymphatic drainage pattern of oral maxillary cancer via preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. Methods. Eleven consecutive patients with oral maxillary cancer treated in our center between December 1, 2012, and April 22, 2016 were studied. Sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> identified by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy after injection of Tc- 99 m-nanocolloid and by intraoperative detection using a gamma-probe, were surgically removed and histopathologically examined. Results. In 10 patients, sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were detected and harvested at cervical levels I, II, or III in the neck. In 2 patients, a parapharyngeal sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was detected. One of the harvested sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (1 / 19) was tumor positive. Conclusion. This study suggests the likelihood of 73 % of exclusively cervical level I to III sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in oral maxillary cancer. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background. The lymphatic {{pathways}} of {{the nasal}} cavity are of enormous clinical importance. To date {{there has been no}} accurate radiographic record of these pathways. Methods. Four halves {{of the head and neck}} from 2 fresh human cadavers were studied. Results. The capillary network arises from the mucous mem-brane of the atrium, the turbinates, the floor {{of the nasal}} cavity, and the nasopharynx. They drain into the lateral pharyngeal and <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> There is 1 lymphatic communica-tion at the junction of the lateral posterior wall of the turbinates and the nasopharynx and another communication between 2 groups of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> situated between the origin of the facial artery and the bifurcation of the carotid artery. Conclusions. A rich avalvular lymph capillary network exists in the mucous membrane and 2 major lymph collecting vessels course through the parapharyngeal space to multiple first tie...|$|R
50|$|Guttural pouch empyema is {{characterized}} by the accretion of purulent, bacteria infested exudate in the pouch. The bacteria is primarily Streptococcus equi, the infectious agent of strangles. Clinically apparent symptoms include painful swelling of the parotid area and recurrent infected nasal discharge, and in severe circumstances, difficulty breathing and abnormal head carriage may be observable. Fever, anorexia, difficulty swallowing and soft palate displacement {{may or may not be}} seen. Empyema is often secondary to guttural pouch tympany (distention of the pouches with air) in foals and weanlings. Arabians, in particular, are inclined to guttural pouch tympany, as many have a congenital defect in the pharyngeal orifices of the pouches. The infection can also be due to the rupture of the nearby <b>retropharyngeal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> usually caused by an abscess.|$|R
