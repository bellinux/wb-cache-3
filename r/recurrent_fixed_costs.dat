50|$|An {{implicit}} {{assumption of}} the above rules is that all <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> are sunk costs. When some costs are sunk and some are not sunk, total <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> (TFC) equal sunk <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> (SFC) plus non-sunk <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> (NSFC) or TFC = SFC + NSFC. When some <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> are non-sunk, the shutdown rule must be modified. As Besanko notes, to illustrate the new rule {{it is necessary to}} define a new cost curve, the average non-sunk cost curve, or ANSC. The ANSC equals the average variable costs plus the average non-sunk <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> or ANSC = AVC + ANFC. The new rule then becomes: if the price is greater than the minimum average costs, produce; if the price is between minimum average costs and minimum ANSC produce, and if the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down. If all <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> are non-sunk, then (a competitive) firm would shut down if the price were below average total costs.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: In this thesis, I {{study the}} effect of {{operating}} leverage, the proportion of <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> in a firm's cost structure, on the financial policies of European firms. Primarily I examine whether higher <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> contribute to conservative policies in terms of lower leverage ratios and higher cash holdings. I also study what contributes to the observed policies, and how the policies affect the investment spending of firms. Finally, I analyze how operating leverage affects the inclination to pay dividends and the dividend payout ratio of firms. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The sample consists of all firm-year observations from EU 15 countries in the Thomson One Worldscope database from 1990 to 2013 with the relevant data available. First, I construct a cost structure metric that estimates the sensitivity of operating costs to changes in sales after accounting for growth trends. Then, I analyze the relation between operating leverage and financial policy determinants primarily with multiple OLS regression models and tests of differences. I also utilize logit models on the estimation of zero leverage and zero dividend. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: I find that firms with high <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> have significantly lower leverage ratios than firms with low <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b> They also have considerably larger cash holdings, even among firms with zero debt. An important determinant of the lower leverage ratios of high <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> firms is that they issue more equity than low <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> firms. High <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> firms also save significantly more out of their cash flow and from both debt and equity issues, which contributes to their higher cash holdings. I also find evidence that high <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> firms have become more financially conservative over time than low <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> firms. Furthermore, I find that high <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> firms are less affected in their investment spending due to low sales growth than low <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> firms. Regarding dividend payments, high <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> firms {{are also more likely}} to not pay dividends. However, I do not find evidence that operating leverage would have a significant effect on the dividend payout ratio of firms. Overall, my findings show that operating leverage is an important determinant of financial policies and it helps explain why many firms follow a conservative financial policy...|$|R
