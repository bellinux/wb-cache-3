25|$|In {{areas where}} speeds are lower {{and there are}} a number of routes which can be taken, {{alphanumeric}} (also called theatre-style) route indicators are used to display a number or a letter (e.g. a platform number or line designation) to denote the route the train is to take. They may be located above or beside the relevant signal. When a route is set and the signal is cleared, the relevant letter or number is shown. On shunting signals, where speeds are much lower, a miniature version of the alphanumeric <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> is used.|$|E
500|$|The {{first six}} {{locomotives}} were initially fitted with plywood sheeting over the cab-side windows as a wartime material-saving measure, with No. 21C107 Wadebridge {{the first to}} receive glass windows. [...] Two of the front <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> irons (of which there are five) were originally located on the smoke deflectors, which meant that the indicator discs stood proud of the casing. This necessitated a trial relocation to the smokebox door at the three and nine o'clock positions on No. 21C109 Lyme Regis, and fitted as standard from No. 21C118 Axminster onwards. The batch constructed between June and October 1946 received a modified steam regulator [...] and LMS-style parallel buffer casings.|$|E
50|$|A track-number type {{preliminary}} <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> (進路予告機番線表示灯, shinro yokokuki bansen hyōjitō) {{advises the}} route by number. If a train is allowed on track #3, the track number display shows 3; the number's color matches the main signal {{to which the}} preliminary <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> is attached.|$|E
5000|$|Signal types: the {{signalling}} system(s) in use, {{including the}} position, sighting {{and function of}} signals and associated <b>route</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
25|$|Where {{junction}} <b>indicators</b> are unsuitable, <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> {{are also}} used in colour-light areas. They may {{take the form of}} a dot-matrix of white lamps, or, in more recent installations, fibre-optic displays driven from a single lamp to display the route code. At certain locations, no route indication is given for the highest-speed route. As with semaphore <b>route</b> <b>indicators,</b> they are usually restricted to areas where all routes are at low speed, often on the approach or departure from large stations.|$|R
5000|$|In the Adelaide station yard Theatre-style <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> {{are used}} on both running signals and shunt signals; {{platform}} numbers for 'up' trains and route through the yard for 'down' trains. The down indicators can show these indications: ...|$|R

50|$|Water taxis, {{which also}} have colored flags as <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> link Port Orleans - French Quarter/Riverside (blue), Old Key West (green), and Saratoga Springs (yellow) to Disney Springs along the Sassagoula River. A fourth route, the red-flag route, ferries {{passengers}} around Disney Springs.|$|R
50|$|In early 1996, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) {{received}} four Dennis Dragons {{for use as}} staff buses. They {{were similar}} with Citybus's 12-metre Dragon in appearance but with no <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> and narrower seats were fitted so as to increase the seating capacity.|$|R
2500|$|Where {{there is}} a large number of {{possible}} routes, splitting signals are unsuitable because they would be easily confused, and <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> are used instead. These consist of a black background, mounted under a single stop signal, on which is superimposed a white letter(s), number(s) or combination of the two, to make a code indicating the route to be taken. For example, if the possible routes were to Cambridge and to Norwich, a Norwich-bound train might be shown 'N' and a Cambridge-bound train 'C'. The route code is only shown when the signal is off. In semaphore areas, <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> may be mechanical, with boards that slide into view to display the code; or electric [...] "theatre-type", with a light projected through a suitably-printed screen.|$|R
50|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} routes ahead and corresponding home (or starting) signals have poor visibility, a preliminary <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> (進路予告機, shinro yokokuki) is installed below the signal one block before the home (or starting) signals. A preliminary <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> advises the route displayed by the relevant home (or starting) signals.|$|E

50|$|The {{town has}} trolley, tram and bus systems. These kinds of public {{transport}} {{cover the entire}} territory of the city. Each bus, tram and trolley is equipped with <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> that inform about the route through the city, designated stops. There is also a waterbus on the Oka River. In the city there are taxis and shuttles, and rental cars. Intercity transport terminals: Oryol Station, Station Luzhki-Oryol, Oryol Bus Station, as well as federal highway M2 (E 105), P92, R119, R120, A142.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} {{seventeen}} Class 142 units based at Newton Heath depot (142041-9 and 142051-8) were refurbished {{for use on}} Merseyside PTE's City Line on services around the Liverpool and Greater Manchester areas. The refurbishment included dot-matrix <b>route</b> <b>indicators,</b> a new design of individual low-backed seating and the units were repainted into Merseyrail's livery. Upon privatisation these units passed to First North Western in March 1997. All of these sets are now with Northern and however remain in the livery of previous operator Northern Rail.|$|R
50|$|In principle, an {{independent}} home or starting signal must be installed for each route. If this proves difficult, one signal {{can be used}} for multiple routes. In this case, a <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> (進路表示機, shinro hyōjiki) displays the route a train is permitted to follow.|$|E
50|$|At {{high speed}} junctions, turnout {{indications}} {{are no longer}} provided. Instead, the signal in rear of the junction signal is provided with a directional indicator. The junction signal is provided with a <b>route</b> <b>indicator,</b> and exhibits the least-restrictive straight route indication permitted by track circuit occupancy.|$|E
50|$|A position-type <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> {{displays}} the route by light position. The relative {{position of the}} lighted bulbs indicates the route (with a maximum of three); if the left light is on, the train will take the left route. Some route indicators display the track number of the route or an arrow.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} explore stable <b>route</b> safety {{evaluation}} <b>indicators,</b> this study discusses {{the relationship between}} the heart rate variability (HRV) and other factors, such as design speed, operating speed, acceleration rate, and velocity gradient through a lot of experiments. The results show that operating speed coordination and velocity gradient (Gv) outperform others as road safety indicators. Speed coordination evaluation criteria: |ΔV 85 |≤ 10 [*]km/h, good coordination; 10 [*]km/h ≤|ΔV 85 |≤[*] 20 [*]km/h, general coordination, <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> of adjacent sections should be adjusted, so that the speed difference is not more than 10 [*]km/h; |ΔV 85 |≥ 20 [*]km/h, poor speed coordination, it needs to readjust the design of the adjacent sections. Speed gradient evaluation criteria: Gv≤ 0. 10, good road safety; 0. 10 ≤Gv 0. 15, poor road safety and the adjacent sections need to readjust. The conclusions provide the theoretical reference for highway safety evaluation...|$|R
5000|$|Each gym has a [...] "designated" [...] path {{to climb}} {{known as the}} [...] "route". Each route is {{distinguished}} either by an indicated piece of tape or a monochromatic system of climbing holds. If the route is taped, each hold on the designated route {{will have the same}} color tape, indicating which holds to grab or step on. Some newer gyms have converted to the monochromatic system: instead of using colored tape as <b>route</b> <b>indicators,</b> this system uses colored climbing holds. Each monochromatic route is set using holds of a corresponding color; thus, climbers follow the holds of a single color throughout the route.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{batch of}} units was built as three-car sets in 1959, and {{numbered}} 1123-1126. These units were built {{to supplement the}} first batch on services in Hampshire. Collectively, {{the first and third}} batches are often called Hampshire sets. The final batch of units, numbered 1127-1133, was built in 1962 as three car sets. These units have some detail differences from the earlier batches, such as a different internal layout, and smaller <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> (compare the two photos). They were built for services from [...] to Salisbury, and other services in Berkshire. The final batch of units is sometimes referred to as Berkshire sets.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Preserved W55033 at the Colne Valley Railway in {{original}} green livery, with yellow [...] "speed whiskers" [...] (warning stripes) on the cab front. This unit {{differs from the}} rest of the class by the fitment of a small <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> box above the centre window, like a Class 122, rather than a large headcode box.|$|E
5000|$|A new depot {{was opened}} at Priestley's Bridge (grid {{reference}} [...] ) during 1899. On 6 March 1900 a tramway postal service was inaugurated, which continued {{until the end}} of tramway operation 40 years later. In latter days the postal car left Bedworth at 8.50pm, showing 'Postal Car' in red letters on the <b>route</b> <b>indicator.</b> The letter-box was fixed to the outside of the rear dash.|$|E

30|$|Another metric, {{called the}} <b>Route</b> Quality <b>Indicator</b> (RQI), is {{equivalent}} to MAX-LQI. The RQI of a path {{is defined as the}} minimum LQI of the links of that path. The path with the greatest RQI between the sender and receiver is selected [40].|$|R
50|$|Between 1995 and 1999, the {{remaining}} 106 Z1s and Z2s were refurbished by Goninan. The bodies were overhauled {{in an area}} of Preston Workshops allocated to Goninan while the bogies were sent to Goninan's Auburn, New South Wales facility. On all bar four, the flap type destination displays and <b>route</b> number <b>indicators</b> were replaced by dot-matrix displays.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} glow {{discharge}} for solution of certain mapping problems was described in 2002. According to a Nature news article describing the work, researchers at Imperial College London demonstrated how they built a mini-map that gives tourists luminous <b>route</b> <b>indicators.</b> To make the one-inch London chip, the team etched a plan of the city centre on a glass slide. Fitting a flat lid over the top turned the streets into hollow, connected tubes. They filled these with helium gas, and inserted electrodes at key tourist hubs. When a voltage is applied between two points, electricity naturally runs through the streets along the shortest route from A to B - and the gas glows like a tiny glowing strip light. The approach itself provides a novel visible analog computing approach for solving a wide class of maze searching problems based on the properties of lighting up of a {{glow discharge}} in a microfluidic chip.|$|R

50|$|In June 2016, cars 7501-7510 and 7928 {{had their}} route signs {{modified}} with green circle/red diamond LED signs and a LED number display, {{similar to those}} on the R62As originally used on the 7 (and currently on the 6). This modification was done presumably {{due to the fact}} that passengers on the 7 cannot visually differentiate between an express train and local train, despite the announcements and digital signage. In the following year, 7501 had the LCD destination indicator parts of its destination signs replaced with LED panels to make them aesthetically similar to the <b>route</b> <b>indicator.</b> It is currently unknown if the remainder of the R188 fleet will be retrofitted with these features.|$|E
50|$|Under route signalling, {{a driver}} is {{informed}} which route the train will take beyond each signal (unless only one route is possible). This {{is achieved by}} a <b>route</b> <b>indicator</b> attached to the signal. The driver uses his route knowledge, reinforced by speed restriction signs fixed at the lineside, to drive the train at the correct speed for the route to be taken. This method has the disadvantage that the driver may be unfamiliar with a route onto {{which he has been}} diverted due to some emergency condition. Several accidents have been caused by this alone. For this reason, in the UK drivers are only allowed to drive on routes that they have been trained on and must regularly travel over the lesser used diversionary routes to keep their route knowledge up to date.|$|E
5000|$|Like the R142s, R142As, and R143s, the R188s {{feature the}} {{electronic}} strip map with all {{stops on the}} 7 <b>route</b> with an <b>indicator</b> that can be set to either a local or express train.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of GPS data analysis and processing is contributing to new solutions in urban logistics, such as route characterization or client detection. The city of Quito, Ecuador, has problems regarding freight transportation. The reduction in magnitude of these problems, through {{the implementation of}} a responsible enterprise logistics system, can contribute to a better urban and economic {{development of}} this Latin-American capital city. This study proposes and analyses a solution in GPS data manipulation methodologies applied to urban freight distribution. The reliability of traditional routing software methods and truck drivers’ empiric knowledge are evaluated by comparing it to mathematical optimization algorithms which consider the city’s transportation network, modeled after the Asymmetric Traveling Salesperson Problem (ATSP). Tools used include Python for manipulating data and optimizing, CartoDB for Graphical Information Systems (GIS), and Compass (a logistics application developed by MIT) for generation of <b>route</b> <b>indicators.</b> The results of this study represent a better understanding of solutions to last-mile delivery operations in Quito, and suggest mathematical optimization is a reliable way to develop freight transportation routes...|$|R
5000|$|UK Signalling {{seems to}} be similar to the Ks system at first sight. The major {{difference}} is that British signals do not work on the principle of speed signalling. To prevent trains running over a switch too fast several workarounds are in use. One of them is the [...] "approach release". With this system the train approaches a junction seeing a [...] "warning" [...] aspect, the signal before the junction stays at [...] "stop". It is released to a [...] "clear" [...] aspect once the train has reduced its speed. Normally, however, only the route a train is to take is indicated; with semaphores, this is done using several arms side-by-side, each applying to a separate route; and with colour-lights, a 'feather' - a row of white lights which 'point' in the direction the train is to take. In both cases, speed adjustment depends solely on the driver's judgement and his route knowledge. In Germany <b>route</b> <b>indicators</b> are used in several cases but do not have an influence on the speed; they are used purely to prove to the driver that the route is correctly set.|$|R
