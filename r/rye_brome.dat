50|$|O. melanopus consumes {{nearly all}} cereal crops, {{but has a}} strong {{affinity}} for oats, barley, and rye, and its favorite host is wheat. Alternatives are corn, sorghum, and sudangrass for adults, and wild oats, quackgrass, timothy, canary grass, reed canary grass, annual and perennial ryegrass, foxtail, orchard grass, wild <b>rye,</b> smooth <b>brome,</b> and fescues for the whole lifespan. The physical symptoms of the plant caused by them are thin, long lines where the upper epidermis of the leaf has been eaten. Since the beetle is migratory when it eats, it is not consistent within a field. In Michigan, entire fields are rarely affected and the situation is most likely {{the same in the}} Midwest. A field of plants looks weathered and old, but is never completely destroyed. Damage is usually no more than 40% total.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Annual {{cover crops}} {{are widely used}} in the Willamette Valley of Oregon on hill land, in {{orchards}} and on overflow river bottom land. Cover crops are grown to prevent soil erosion and to increase soil organic matter. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the crops that would be most suitable as cover crops in the Willamette Valley as measured by their green and dry matter production at different times during the early spring. Twelve crop species including winter wheat, oats, barley, <b>rye,</b> annual <b>brome</b> and ryegrass, vetches, turnips, crimson and subterranean clover were seeded alone and in certain combinations on two different soil types near Corvallis, Oregon. The winter cereal grains produced the greatest amount of ground cover and green and dry matter at both locations. The cereal grain-legume mixtures were not significantly different from the pure stands of grain. During the season that this trial was conducted the Austrian winter peas were damaged by freezing, suggesting that this crop might have limited usefulness as a cover crop. Based on total production, Abruzzi rye, and the combination of Abruzzi rye and legumes were the most favorable crops to be used as cover crops at both locations. Annual ryegrass was comparable to Abruzzi rye and would certainly be useful under certain conditions...|$|R

Grazed summer forage combinations included 1) continuous brome, 2) brome and warm-season grasses, 3) brome and alfalfa or sudangrass, 4) brome and a monoculture of red clover, 5) red clover seeded in brome, 6) brome and Native Sandhills range, or 7) Sandhills range only. Grazed fall forages included 1) brome, 2) brome and turnips, 3) <b>brome</b> and <b>rye,</b> or 4) <b>brome</b> and cornstalks. Following grazing, the cattle were finished on a high-concentrate, corn-based finishing diet. The success of a grazing system was measured by slaughter breakeven cost analyses including all costs of production. The most consistent improvement in summer grazing BW gain compared with continuous brome and the most desirable slaughter breakeven costs were observed for cattle grazing brome and warm-season grasses or brome and Sandhills range. Using alfalfa or sudangrass in grazing systems improved (...|$|R
40|$|The Early Iron Age granaries of Tell Gradina upon Bosut {{exploded}} {{in a fire}} inferno in the 8 th century B. C. The result of this catastrophe is 2 - 5 cm thick layer with mixed carbonized seeds and fruits. Recently, eight samples were taken from Gradina's profile for archaeobotanical analysis. The goal was to obtain basic information on land use and on major crops and weeds of that period. The most abundant were cereals, followed by millets, pulses and oil/fibre plants. The dominant cereals were einkorn (Triticum monococcum) and hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare vulgare). Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) was also very important. Pulses were represented with six and oil/fibre plants with three species. Among weeds and ruderals, most common are <b>rye</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus secalinus), fat hen (Chenopodium album), darnel ryegrass (Lolium temulentum), hairy crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis) and corncockle (Agrostemma githago) ...|$|E
40|$|Frequent rearrangements, {{typically}} through {{homologous recombination}} in plant mitochondrial genomes often result in different {{upstream and downstream}} sequences for the same gene {{among a number of}} species. Transcription and RNA processing signals are therefore different, even among closely related plants. To evaluate the impact of DNA rearrangements on gene expression I conducted a comparative analysis of the S 7 ribosomal protein gene (rps 7) among a number of grasses: wheat, rice, maize, barley, <b>rye,</b> <b>brome,</b> Lolium and oats (grasses whose evolutionary divergence times range from about 5 to 60 Mya). Using circularized-RT-PCR to simultaneously map rps 7 transcript termini I found that 3 ’ends for various RNA species are homogeneous, mapping to conserved sequences among plants. 5 ’ termini are more complex and can be both discrete and heterogeneous for different transcripts, both within and among plants. Genome rearrangements upstream of the rps 7 start codon for some but not all species has led to plant-specific signals for both rps 7 transcription and RNA processing. Termini for rps 7 precursor species in wheat and Lolium are very discrete and likely use different upstream tRNAs as processing signals for end-cleavage. A number of potential stem-loop structures have also been identified at or near 5 ’ and 3 ’ termini which may function in maturation of transcript ends or provide transcript stability and protection from degradation by ribonucleases. C-to-U RNA editing of non-coding sequences, a rare event, was observed at multiple sites within the 5 ’ and 3 ’UTRs among plants. Some sites may even be developmentally regulated as CR-RT-PCR experiments were conducted using mitochondrial RNA isolated from seedlings and germinating embryos. Taken together, my observations demonstrate the frequency of upstream DNA rearrangements and the variety of signals used for expression of rps 7 among grasses, providing new insights into the complexities of mRNA production in plant mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{germination}} of <b>rye</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus secalinus L.) seeds and the initial growth of seedlings under simulated drought and different thermal conditions. The study included two experiments carried out under laboratory conditions in the spring of 2012. The first experiment involved an evaluation of the speed of germination as well as of the biometric characters and weight of seedlings in polyethylene glycol solutions (PEG 8000) in which the water potential was: - 0. 2; - 0. 4; - 0. 65; - 0. 9 MPa, and in distilled water as the control treatment. The experiment was conducted at the following temperatures: 25 / 22 oC and 18 / 14 oC day/night, at a relative air humidity of 90 %. The other experiment, in which lessive soil was used as a germination substrate, was carried out in a plant growth chamber at two levels of air humidity (55 – 65 % and 85 – 95 %) and temperature (22 / 10 oC and 16 / 5 oC). The soil moisture content was determined by the gravimetric method and the water potential corresponding to it was as follows: - 0. 02, - 0. 07, - 0. 16, - 0. 49, - 1. 55 MPa. The germination capacity and emergence of Bromus secalinus as well as the weight of sprouts produced were significantly dependent on the water potential of the polyethylene glycol solution and on the soil water potential. The emergence of Bromus secalinus was completely inhibited by reducing the soil water potential below - 0. 16 MPa (the point of strong growth inhibition). The emergence and biometric characters of rye bro- me seedlings were significantly dependent on temperature and air humidity...|$|E

Istaknuti su ciljevi i pojedini rezultati istraživanja te značaj i vrijednost nalazišta kao i njegov potencijal. Detaljnije se razmatraju arheološki ostaci koji su otkriveni 2008. godine, a čine ih arheološki kontekst i pokretni arheološki materijal. Radi se o ostacima objekta koji je na osnovi tipo-kronološke analize keramičkih posuda relativno kronološki datiran u Ha B stupanj, odnosno mlađu fazu kasnog brončanog doba. Apsolutno kronološki ovaj objekt i predmeti koji su u njemu pronađeni datirani su u 9 st. pr. Kr. Objekt je uništen u požaru, a svi pokretni nalazi iz objekta otkriveni su in situ. Pri tome je u vatri karboniziran i obilan arheobotanički uzorak na kojemu je napravljena detaljna analiza. Pronađene su velike količine žitarica različitih vrsta, mahunarke i nekoliko vrsta divljih biljaka. U radu su predstavljeni rezultati analize makrofosila te se razmatraju društveno-ekonomski aspekti zajednice koja je hranu proizvodila i konzumirala. The archeological site Kalnik-Igrišče has {{during the}} last two decades {{become one of the most}} {{prominent}} Bronze Age sites in Croatia primarily thanks to the results of the systematic archeological excavations which have been conducted since 1988 (Majnarić-Pandžić 1992; Vrdoljak 1992; Vrdoljak, Forenbaher 1995). The site – where the remains of settlements from the Copper, Bronze, Late Iron Age and Roman period were found during the years – is situated on the southern terraces of the Kalnik at 500 meters above sea level. Based on the settlement remains and archaeological artefacts analysis and according to the potential of the Kalnik-Igrišče site, new systematic excavations were initiated by the Institute for Archeology under the leadership of Dr. Sc. Snježana Karavanić. Research began in 2006, and the very next year it was clear that Kalnik is extremely complex multilayered site with layers from different periods of prehistory. The most abundant finds date to the Late Bronze Age. In 2008 archaeological excavations at Kalnik-Igrišče yielded the remains of a Late Bronze Age structure, dated to the 9 th century BC based on the radiocarbon measurements of charred cereal grains (Karavanić 2008, Karavanić 2009). On the house floor among broken pottery an abundant sample of carbonised grains were discovered. The collected samples were preserved in an excellent condition, carbonized by the fire that destroyed the house. A hearth was also discovered at the floor level, while the rest of the structure extends eastwards beyond the limits of the archaeological trench. A smaller section of the house was explored, measuring approximately 35 square meters. In 2012 the trench was investigated fully and it was concluded that the house rested on wooden pillars which were firmly implanted in the rocky subsoil. Non-destructive investigation methods such as field surveying and geophysical probing were conducted on the site during 2012 and 2013. The further article elucidates the context of the uncovered Bronze Age structure and contains a short overview of the pottery finds, together with a detailed analysis of the archeobotanical material. The pottery are classified into four basic functional groups: bowls (most numerous), pots used to prepare food in the fireplace, amphorae and smaller vessels of different purposes and finer texture. The analysis of the full sample of the archeobotanical finds was conducted as part of a doctoral dissertation at the Department of Biology of the Faculty of Science in Zagreb (Mareković 2013). According to the archeobotanical analysis of the macrofossils, the following plant species were found in the analyzed sample ranging from most numerous to least: millet (Panicum miliaceum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), broad bean (Vicia faba L.), common wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum), emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon), lentil (Lens culinaris), spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta), while oats (Avena), rye (Secale cereale), peas (Pisum sativum), acorn (Quercus), European wilde apple (Malus sylvestris), European cornel (Cornus mas) were not present to such an extent. The mentioned species were divided into four groups: These species were divided into 4 basic groups: 1. 	Cereals: millet (Panicum miliaceum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), common wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum), emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon), spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. Spelta), oat (Avena), rye (Secale cereale), foxtail millet (Setaria italica) 2. 	Legumes: broad bean (Vicia Faba L.), lentil (Lens culinaris), pea (Pisum sativum), 3. 	Useful wild woody plants: acorn (Quercus), wilde apple (Malus sylvestris), Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas) 4. 	Crop weeds. Field brome (Bromus arvensis), <b>rye</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus secalinus), barnyard millet (Echinochloa crus-galli), cleavers (Galium aparine), false cleavers (Galium spurium) The finds consist mostly of cereals (millet and barley). On the basis of the findings of weed (Galium aparine), which is connected with winter wheat, it can be concluded that the community gave preference to the autumn harvest by sowing winter wheat, while millet was sowed during the spring. Based on the very small proportion of weeds in the sample we assume that the community was well organized, and that it stored thoroughly cleaned cereals. The space in which the analysed samples were found might be associated with a domestic storage of food, that is, a store of a single household. The presence of isolated, but also mixed grains in the context of finds speaks of the storing of individual species on the one hand and mixed species on the other, which may point to the way food was prepared in the household...|$|E
