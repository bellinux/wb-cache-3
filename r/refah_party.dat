Consequently, this paper focuses on the available strategies for dealing with relatively moderate nationalist-religious parties like the <b>Refah</b> <b>Party</b> in Turkey and the Bharatiya Janata Party in India. In particular, it examines two opposed approaches: that which seeks to exclude and isolate such parties, {{as in the case of}} Turkey; and that which adopts a policy of engagement, as in India. The paper then assesses the relative merits of these two strategies and concludes that the latter approach provides a more effective means of dealing with nationalist-religious parties, especially in democratic countries...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} ways in which the current constitutional system in Turkey is being contested and negotiated around the constitutive norm of secularism and the place and role of Islam, as these negotiations are carried out in various sites of everyday life. Islamic identities began to emerge in the secular public sphere around mid- 1980 s and gained a more forceful presence after 1994 when the Islamist political party, Refah, came to power in Istanbul upon winning the municipal elections. Tracing Islamist interventions in public spaces, I explore the formations of political identities around the categories of gender, class, nationalism and religious orientation, and how the performance of such identities contest and call into question established norms around which the public sphere is organized. My analysis focuses on bodies (the construction of the national subject), places (the construction of social space) and time (the construction of national history) as three main sites from which interventions and contestations are carried out. I examine interventions regarding (1) the clothing of bodies through state regulations, the proliferation of women 2 ̆ 7 s images in the media and the propagation of the image of the veiled woman in various public performances; (2) the construction of social space, as illustrated in the representations of the city of Istanbul and the restructuring of various city spaces in the performance of both secular and Islamic identities; and (3) the making and contestations of national history, as illustrated in the unofficial commemoration of May 29, 1453 by Islamic circles as “the Conquest of Istanbul Day. ” I conclude that, under <b>Refah</b> <b>Party,</b> Islamic discourse turns into a nationalist political project, which contests the authority of secularism, but retains the national, homogenizing and authoritative systems of state control intact and uncontested. This is partially the reason why Islamism is perceived as a threat to the secular system, which compelled the military to intervene in 1997 and led to the eventual closure of <b>Refah</b> <b>Party.</b> This intervention allowed the military to establish itself as the ultimate overseer of the secular system, and closed all venues to the formal negotiation of the constitutional norm of secularism. ...|$|E
40|$|Turkey {{adopted from}} its very {{beginning}} an original project of modernity {{seen as an}} alternative both to Westernization and Islam. It seems that this "third way" does not help enough {{in order to achieve}} the democratic standards of a European country. This paper analyses not all Turkey modernity aspects, but only secularism, mainly because this was considered for a long time the most successful one. Turkish secularism is based not on a separation between State and Church, but on putting all religious practices and institutions {{under the control of the}} State. In order to see what the meaning of secularism in Turkey is right now, this paper addresses the historical background of political parties in Turkey, starting with <b>Refah</b> <b>Party</b> and ending with the latest developments of AK Party of the current Prime Minister Erdoğan. This party tries a unique experiment in Turkey, willing to adapt traditional Islam values to modernization and giving a new meaning to secularism. This paper discuss many issues related to the role of religion in society, either Islam ("the Muslim veil" interpreted by ECHR in Leyla Şahin v. Turkey - 2005, the Alevi community, Imam Hatip schools), or Christian (the new 2008 legal framework on associations acknowledging the right of property of the religious associations, mainly Christian, the ECHR decision on Ecumenical Patriarchate v. Turkey - 2008, the status of the Theological School of the Ecumenical Patriarchate from the island of Halki). At this moment, the question if a Muslim majority country could Member State of the European Union is not at stake, but in what extent the European Union may be involved in changing the current Turkey approach on religious freedom, taking into account that there is no European model on Church-State relations. This is the reason why, even in his last 2008 Report, European Commission relies not on the acquis communautaire, but mainly on enforcing ECHR decisions. The question of Turkey belonging to the European Union is addressed in this paper also from the perspective of different types of Europe borders - geographical, institutional, cultural and transactional (formal). No matter the type of border considered, Turkey is still a problematic case. Its European aspirations accelerated the debate on what is and what should be the European Union: a construction based on Western civilization and Christianity or a polity based on democratic values without reference to history or even geography. The paper conclusion is that it is in the very interest of the European Union to accept Turkey and it has to act in such a way that at a certain moment Turkey will transform itself into a country with a similar approach to religious freedom as all other existing Member States...|$|E

40|$|In this article, I analyze {{two cases}} where the Turkish Constitutional Court {{dissolved}} political parties during the 1990 s. Specifically, I examine the cases against the Islamist <b>Refah</b> (Welfare/Well-Being) <b>Party</b> and the pro-Kurdish Halkin Emek Partisi (People's Labor Party). While the former was charged with threatening the secular basis of the national social order, the charges against the latter were around its allegedly separatist character. I engage in an in-depth analysis of the lines of argument in the indictments, arguments of defense deployed by the parties, and their ultimate contestations as they appeared in the final decisions by the Court. I see the Court as engaging with a medley of themes and tendencies, [trying to resolve them for the case at hand]. I argue that despite {{the differences in the}} construction of the alleged threats, in both cases the Court deployed a similar image of the ways in which social, political, and judicial terrains interact. A rather arbitrary boundary between the political and cultural domains informs these decisions. The Court operates with the understanding that once this boundary is transgressed, what may be harmless when an issue is cultural—such as the use of the headscarf or of the Kurdish language—may turn into a political symbol threatening the basis of the united, democratic, and progressive nation-state. In this vision, the concepts of democracy, progress, and unity are intimately tied together such that the threat to one of these concepts almost simultaneously constitutes a threat to the other two. The Court imagines itself as protecting the boundary between the political and cultural domains in an effort to uphold the right of a democracy to protect itself. This line of thought also enables the court's rather routine involvement in the political domain—which has brought about eighteen decisions for political party dissolution since 1980...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the decision}} of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Refah Partisi v. Turkey from 2003. The <b>Refah</b> Partisi political <b>party</b> was in power in Turkey when it was dissolved in 1998 by {{the decision of}} the Constitutional Court of Turkey for its alleged involvement in activities contrary to the principles of secularism. The European Court upheld this decision and found it compatible with the freedom of association guarantees under the European Convention on Human Rights. This article argues that the Court’s judgment in the Refah case was wrong, and that it proposes an unsatisfactory model of relations between religion and state. It is further critical of the Court’s decision on account of its incidental assessment of Islam, and its inappropriate critique of this religion where it should have promoted inter-cultural understanding instead. In the light of the Refah case, this article addresses the complex relationships of secularism and democracy, religion and democracy, and asks whether rights, or democracy, should come first. The article concludes with reminding the Court of its duty {{to protect the rights of}} secularists and religious believers alike, and emphasizes the importance of the Court’s applying a cautious and sensitive approach as a stronghold for human rights in multi-ethnic and multi-religious Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to present a {{comparative}} analysis of attitudes, perceptions and expectations of “Islamist women” regarding the European Union, between the period of the Welfare <b>Party</b> (<b>Refah</b> Partisi-RP) and the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi-AKP). The study argues that Islamist women approach to the EU is subjected to a visible change as a result of secession from the “social pattern of control” of the Nationalist View Movement. The thesis applied Norwegian Anthropologist F. Barth’s theory of “social organizations” to explain this change in the perceptions of the Islamist women. In order to control this argument the thesis uses both questionnaires and interviews that are held with Islamist women party members. Findings suggest that Islamist women are experiencing a more rapid and visible social change. These changes have started to be more visible mainly after the AKP government. The women do not perceive the EU membership as a challenge to the Muslim identity of Turkey and who regarded the EU as a Christian club during the RP era, interpret the EU with its institutions, and possible democratic advantages of membership today. Moreover, findings identify the expectation about head scarf issue is one of the important determinant of Islamist women’s perceptions regarding the EU...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, two {{developments}} have challenged Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s national and cultural identity [...] a growing Islamist movement {{at home and}} the European Union 2 ̆ 7 s (EU) orientation toward Turkey. While the Turkish government and the military continue to pursue a pro-NATO foreign policy orientation, {{an increasing number of}} Turks have begun to question whether the country could not be better served by reducing their ties to the EU. The apparent dissatisfaction with the West stems, to a significant extent, from the EU 2 ̆ 7 s decision to exclude Turkey from the next wave of EU membership expansion. At the Luxembourg summit in December 1997, the European leaders added insult to injury by including Cyprus (the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government) among the first wave of the next members. Today, EU-Turkey relations stand at an all time low with little prospect for improvement. The European Parliament recently invited Turkey to enter into political dialogue with the union. However, it listed the same conditions for membership that were outlined in the EU 2 ̆ 7 s earlier rejection of Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s candidacy. The Turkish reaction has been a flat refusal of dialogue with the EU as long as the union maintains its position on Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s membership. These developments raise questions over how Turkey might revise its foreign, economic, and security policies to better position itself in the next century. During the 1990 s, Turkish leaders initiated bold economic, political, and security relations with the Turkic republics of Central Asia and Azerbaijan, brought together the Black Sea states in an economic framework known as the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone, and signed agreements with Israel. Can these efforts replace the key position the EU currently holds in Turkish external trade and security relations? To what other alternatives can the Turks look? Clearly absent from these agreements is any serious attempt to improve Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s ties to the Islamic states of the Middle East. Even the Islamist <b>Refah</b> (Welfare) <b>Party,</b> when it was the majority coalition partner in the Erbakan-Çiller coalition, failed to achieve tangible results in Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s economic relations with the Islamic world. In general, the Islamists would like to cut Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s ties to the West and improve relations with the Islamic world. This is most apparent in the position taken by the Refah and Fazilet (Virtue) Parties in recent years. Would continued problems with the EU help the Islamists in their objectives? As these questions imply, Turkish leaders face important challenges as they prepare their country for the next millennium. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the current state of EU-Turkey relations and assess the implications of the recent problems for Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s foreign and domestic policy orientation in the twenty-first century...|$|R
