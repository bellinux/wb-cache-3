One of the major undertakings of the club {{in recent years has}} been the restoration of the historic <b>racing</b> <b>craft</b> Cruiskeen, which was built in the 1840s by GAA founder member Maurice Davin. The project, outsourced to 'Conservation | Letterfrack', took several years of meticulous cleaning, treatment and repair and the 38ft./11.6m timber boat is now on permanent display in the County Museum, Clonmel.|$|E
25|$|At low to {{moderate}} speeds, a lightweight catamaran hull experiences resistance to passage through {{water that is}} approximately proportional to the square of its speed. A displacement monohull, by comparison, experiences resistance that is at least the cube of its speed. This means that a catamaran would require four times the power in order to double its speed, whereas a monohull would require eight times the power to double its speed, starting at a slow speed. For powered catamarans, this implies smaller power plants (although two are typically required). For sailing catamarans, low forward resistance allows the sails to derive power from attached flow, their most efficient mode—analogous to a wing—leading {{to the use of}} wingsails in <b>racing</b> <b>craft.</b>|$|E
25|$|Outhauls, which {{control the}} foot tension of a boom-footed sail. This {{is one of}} the main {{controls}} for sail fullness. In a racing boat the boom outhaul runs from the sail clew through a turning block along the inside of the boom and out through another turning bock at the fore end of the boom. For simplicity many small <b>racing</b> <b>craft</b> have the boom outhaul attached to a powerful hyfield lever mounted on the boom or deck. The lever is let off for down wind sailing, so the main sail becomes full. Alternatively the outhaul tail can be attached to a block and tackle system so that it can be adjusted to many positions.|$|E

They are mostly built from light {{materials}} to maximize the speed but the safety is often compromised.People who build <b>race</b> <b>craft</b> often participate in different hovercraft races.The world's first hovercraft race was held on March 14, 1964 in the Canberra, capital of Australia. There were 13 participants and around 10 000 spectators.|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to shields, each <b>racing</b> <b>craft</b> contains air brakes for navigating tight corners, {{as well as}} [...] "Hyperthrust" [...] option. Players can activate Hyperthrust to increase their speed, but Using Hyperthrust drains energy from the shields, making the craft more vulnerable.|$|E
500|$|Set in 2098, just a {{year after}} Wipeout 2097, Wipeout 64 {{introduced}} several new elements to the Wipeout series including analogue control which benefited from the Nintendo 64's controller, new weapons, teams and tracks. The game received mixed opinions from critics. Comparing the game with F-Zero X, which was released a month earlier, many critics praised the game for its individuality among the Wipeout series, offering more tracks and <b>racing</b> <b>craft,</b> unique atmosphere and [...] "superior track design". However, the game was criticised for its slow frame rate, and opinion is divided whether Wipeout 64 is a 'true sequel' to Wipeout 2097.|$|E
500|$|Each <b>racing</b> <b>craft</b> {{contains}} {{air brakes}} for navigating tight corners {{by using the}} control stick and shoulder buttons. Afterwards, the game's physics modeling give vehicles setup with high acceleration a boost of acceleration. Players can easily exploit this on a wide straight stretch of a circuit to generate serpentinous movements. This technique called [...] "snaking" [...] delivers a massive increase in speed, but it is best used on the easier tracks, when racing alone in Time Trial, and with heavy vehicles with a high grip rating and given high acceleration. According to Nintendo, the snaking technique was an intentional addition to F-Zero GXs gameplay.|$|E

50|$|The indoor circuit {{has been}} a happy hunting ground for Andrew over the years. Sitting second on the British Indoor All-Time list, he has also shown <b>race</b> <b>craft</b> when medals are up for grabs. In 2012 and 2014 he picked up World Indoor medals in Istanbul and Sopot respectively.|$|R
500|$|Most reviews {{compared}} {{the game with}} F-Zero X which was released a month earlier, with the general assumption that Nintendo's own futuristic racer offered more tracks and <b>racing</b> <b>craft,</b> but Wipeout 64 contained superior track design and atmosphere. GameSpot gave the game a lower score of 6.9 out of 10, stating that [...] "WipeOut 64 isn't horrible, it just feels like the developer's first effort for the system at times - which it is". [...] "Sayewonn" [...] of Gaming Age gave Wipeout 64 8 out of 10 stars, praising its new innovations, especially its analogue control, saying that [...] "adapting analogue controls was the biggest improvement racing games made and Wipeout 64 demonstrates that beautifully". Sayewonn {{also noted that the}} game still had a [...] "learning curve", saying that [...] "it’s not as brutal as the first game but definitely harder than the far easier XL". However, despite being complimentary of Wipeout 64, both GameSpot and Gaming Age recommended purchasing F-Zero X instead.|$|E
2500|$|F-Zero Climax is {{a racing}} game that plays {{similarly}} to its immediate predecessor (...) {{and the original}} F-Zero game. Players select their vehicles and race around fifty-three courses while avoiding obstacles such as ice and bombs. Each <b>racing</b> <b>craft</b> contains air brakes for drifting around tight corners by pressing the L and R shoulder buttons. A vehicle's health and ability to speed boost after the first lap is measured by an energy meter. Boosting in this manner briefly increases the racer's speed while draining their energy. The player is also rewarded with a stored speed boost for each lap completed. However, this may only be used {{in tandem with the}} energy-draining boost resulting in a double speed boost. Vehicles can drive over pink plates scattered throughout the track to replenish energy. Players can damage competitors with two attacks: a spin attack that quickly rotates the entire vehicle, or a side attack. The former is new to the 2D F-Zero series. Players can also spin attack during a speed boost to inflict extra damage. The game offers four control scheme presets, and personalized button configurations.|$|E

50|$|Radio control {{may be used}} in many locations. Typically two {{controls}} are provided for sailing yacht models, a general - purpose small servo for rudder control and a specialized sail winch to draw in the mainsheet and jib. Motorized craft control rudder and throttle, and perhaps other functions such as reversing, lighting, and mechanical novelties. Other radio controlled watercraft hobbies include the operation and battle engagement of scale model warships (with gas-operated guns intended to sink opponents), and various high speed <b>racing</b> <b>craft</b> driven by powerful engines.|$|E
