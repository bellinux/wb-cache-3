Giáp <b>realized</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> pressed, the French would abandon Lai Châu Province and fight a pitched battle at Điện Biên Phủ. On 24 November, Giáp ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th Division to attack Lai Chau, while the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions assault Điện Biên Phủ from Việt Bắc.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after {{studying}} experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of the Nickelodeon series Rocko's Modern Life, at an animation festival, and was offered {{a job as a}} director of the show. Martin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko's Modern Life, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he ever did, this would be the best approach. Production on Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996. Shortly afterwards, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.|$|E
5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} that the race was close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E

5|$|The {{siege of}} Krujë in 1450 {{resulted}} in heavy loss for both Murad II and the League of Lezhë. A {{large portion of}} the Albanian land was wasted from the long campaign where the Turkish forces had been stationed {{for more than half a}} year. The country was left with few resources to produce crops and a large famine was the result. In 1451, the year after Murad's forces had devastated the country, Mehmed II gained control of the Ottoman Empire after his father's death. Mehmed's great energy was already apparent during the previous years when he had accompanied his father to Albania. Skanderbeg <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Mehmed struck now, he would be in great difficulty since he lacked the resources and the support to successfully hold off a large invasion. One of Albania's most powerful princedoms, the Dukagjini, were making open negotiations with the Turks, suggesting that they would become Mehmed's vassals.|$|E
5|$|With dawn nearing, Adan <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the {{pontoon bridge}} {{could not be}} brought to the canal during the few {{remaining}} hours of dark, an entire day would pass without a bridge being laid across the canal, and in daylight, the paratroopers would sustain more casualties. He sent a half-track company to reconnoiter Akavish at 3:00. Half an hour later, the company reported it had reached the crossing site without encountering any resistance. The Egyptian battalion fighting the paratroopers had focused all their attention on the Israelis at Tirtur, ignoring activity on Akavish. Adan took a risky decision, sending the irreplaceable pontoons down Akavish to the canal. IDF bulldozers cleared the road of wreckage and debris, and the Israelis reached Fort Lakekan before turning northwards, finally reaching the crossing site. Bridge construction was started immediately by military engineers of the 143rd Division.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{chemical}} chain reactions was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist Max Bodenstein for {{a situation in}} which two molecules react to form not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist Leo Szilard on 12 September 1933. Szilard <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a nuclear reaction produced neutrons or dineutrons, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, although he did entertain the possibility of using uranium as a fuel. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year. The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, opened up the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction with uranium or indium, but initial experiments were unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|The reserve clause {{had been}} part of {{baseball}} contracts since the game's early days. The National League had begun using it in the late 19th century; the American League began using it in 1903 as part of the truce between the two that created MLB. Team owners <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> players could go from team to team seeking higher pay, salaries of all players, not just stars, would go up. They feared some teams might have to fold under such competitive pressure, and included the reserve clause, so called since a team reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, to limit free agency.|$|E

25|$|Like France, rosés {{are made}} {{throughout}} Italy with {{the style and}} grape varieties used changing depending on the region and local climate. The long history of Italian rosés, particularly in the warm {{southern part of the}} country, stem from difficulties {{in the early days of}} winemaking to make dark, fully colored dry red wines without temperature controlled fermentation vessels. As the must macerated with the skins, the intense heat of the process would often kill the yeast resulting in a stuck fermentation and residual sugar in the remaining wine. Eventually Italian winemakers <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they pressed the wines early in the process, remaining the skins, they could complete the fermentation albeit with a lightly colored wine.|$|E
25|$|PFC Carlos James Lozada was {{assigned}} to Co. A, 2nd Battalion, 503 Infantry, 173rd Airborne Brigade. On November 20, 1967, at Dak To, Lozada spotted a North Vietnamese Army company rapidly approaching his outpost. He alerted his comrades and opened fire with a machine gun, killing at least twenty enemy soldiers and disrupting their initial attack. He <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he abandoned his position {{there would be nothing}} to hold back the surging North Vietnamese soldiers and that his entire company withdrawal would be jeopardized - as a result he told his comrades to move to the back and that he would supply cover for them. He continued to deliver a heavy and accurate volume of suppressive fire against the enemy until he was mortally wounded and had to be carried during the withdrawal.|$|E

After that, Lujan went to Kirchner and told him that they had unknowingly crossed into Mexico and that they had better leave now because the villagers had sent word to the Mexican Army. Unwilling to leave his captain behind, Kirchner and his men fought it out for the next forty-five minutes before they <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Mexicans were able to flank and surround them then they would all be killed. Accordingly, the Americans fought their way back across the Rio Grande and made it to the small town of Clint, where news of the engagement was relayed to Sheriff Frank B. Simmons in El Paso.|$|E

25|$|The {{first issue}} facing Johnston in the West was {{the fate of}} Braxton Bragg. The Confederate {{government}} was displeased with Bragg's performance at the Battle of Stones River, as were many of Bragg's senior subordinates. Jefferson Davis ordered Johnston to visit Bragg and determine whether he should be replaced. Johnston <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he recommended Bragg's replacement, {{he would be the}} logical choice to succeed him, and he considered that a field army command was more desirable than his current, mostly administrative post, but his sense of honor prevented him from achieving this personal gain at Bragg's expense. After interviewing Bragg and a number of his subordinates, he produced a generally positive report and refused to relieve the army commander. Davis ordered Bragg to a meeting in Richmond and designated Johnston to take command in the field, but Bragg's wife was ill and he was unable to travel. Furthermore, in early April Johnston was forced to bed with lingering problems from his Peninsula wound, and the attention of the Confederates shifted from Tennessee to Mississippi, leaving Bragg in place.|$|E

500|$|Szilard was so {{annoyed at}} Rutherford's {{dismissal}} that he conceived {{of the idea}} of nuclear chain reaction (analogous to a chemical chain reaction), using recently discovered neutrons.

The following year he filed for a patent on the concept of the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction. [...] Richard Rhodes described Szilard's moment of inspiration: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the first conference {{prompted}} the announcement of a second ISMB conference {{at the end of}} the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in Seattle. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at Stanford University in August 1994 and was organised by Russ Altman, a research scientist at Stanford University School of Medicine. To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at Robinson College, Cambridge. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. ISCB Board member and Director of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute Alfonso Valencia has stated that, in 1995, [...] "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone <b>realized</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> you want to make progress, there has to be more focus in biology." ...|$|E
500|$|Sources {{disagree}} on whether Crassus had requested reinforcements, {{or whether the}} Senate simply took advantage of Pompey's return to Italy, but Pompey was ordered to bypass Rome and head south to aid Crassus.
