Construction then began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $5million. The park was officially opened on October 2, 1999.|$|E
5|$|Both battalions {{were still}} {{in contact with the}} Germans during the {{withdrawal}} with 10 Para to the north having the furthest to travel to reach the relative safety of the <b>rail</b> <b>crossing.</b> By 15:00 it became obvious that the Germans were already in front of the battalion. Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, they had to capture positions between themselves and the railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's rear guard.|$|E
5|$|NY410 {{begins at}} a rural {{intersection}} with NY26 {{in the town}} of Denmark. The two-lane route heads eastward from the junction, winding to the north and south across open, rolling terrain with several cultivated fields. After , the highway meets County Route19 (CR19, named East Road) and turns to the northeast toward the village of Castorland. The open fields gradually give way to homes as NY410 enters the village limits as Main Street. The route passes {{through the center of the}} village, serving four lightly developed residential blocks before crossing the Mohawk, Adirondack and Northern Railroad at the northeastern edge of the community. At the <b>rail</b> <b>crossing,</b> the highway passes south of what was once the New York Central Railroad's Castorland passenger station.|$|E

5|$|The Anderson Street Station had a wood {{siding with}} a {{shingled}} roof, two brick chimneys {{off the roof}} and two asphalt platforms in both directions. The station also had a garage door on the southern side of the building. No official style of architecture was mentioned for Anderson Street in the 1920 Final Engineering Report {{due to lack of}} design. Nearby, a wooden watchman's shanty was constructed near the team track. The station had two tracks run through it (one main track and a team track) and had a <b>rail</b> <b>crossing</b> between tracks. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but just one year later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the <b>rail,</b> <b>crossing</b> over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E

No eastern <b>rail</b> <b>crossing</b> has ever been built. Instead the Rhaetian Railway (RhB) opened the Albula line in 1903 and the Bernina Railway completed the Bernina line in 1910, providing a link to Italy. These lines were initially built for tourists, but they were later also used for freight.|$|E

50|$|Regular <b>rail</b> can <b>cross</b> its own track {{because the}} gaps in the rails for wheel flanges are narrow, {{permitting}} the bladed design.

40|$|AbstractProgress is {{not being}} made on the longstanding problem of {{collisions}} between people and trains at rail level crossings.

This paper presents a systems analysis of current <b>rail</b> level <b>crossing</b> systems in Australia that was undertaken specifically to identify safety-related issues in <b>rail</b> level <b>crossing</b> environments. Cognitive work analysis was used to analyze current <b>rail</b> level <b>crossing</b> systems based on data derived from a range of focused data collection activities. The analysis identified various issues potentially impacting behavior and safety across the different users of rail level crossings. In addition, potential areas for improvement through redesign were highlighted. An important implication of the study is that improvements in behavior and safety may be achievable through changes to the overall <b>rail</b> level <b>crossing</b> system (e. g. values, goals, norms, data systems) as opposed to changes to the physical <b>rail</b> level <b>crossing</b> infrastructure only.

25|$|The fort {{commands}} the <b>rail</b> <b>crossing</b> of the Rhine. The tracks at the Swiss {{end of the}} bridge featured a turnout that would send an enemy armored train off the tracks and down an embankment, to be fired upon by the machine gun in Block 4. On 14 May 1940 a false alarm caused the switch to be activated, nearly derailing an innocent coal train.|$|E
25|$|The fort {{was one of}} {{the first}} built {{according}} to the fortification system developed by Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières. The goal was to build a discontinuous enclosure around Metz using a series of artillery forts spaced a cannonshot apart. In the 1860s tension was rising between France and Germany, causing France to attend to the fortification of its frontiers. Metz, close to the border and a strategic road and <b>rail</b> <b>crossing,</b> was the beneficiary of one of the first programs of fortification. Before all of the forts could be completed, France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War and the area around Metz was annexed to Germany. Metz then became a crucial strongpoint on Germany's frontier, receiving sustained attention to its defenses that culminated in the Moselstellung of the early twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|Light rail is {{generally}} powered by electricity, usually {{by means of}} overhead wires, but sometimes by a live rail, also called third rail (a high voltage bar alongside the track), requiring safety measures and warnings to the public not to touch it. In some cases, particularly when initial funds are limited, diesel-powered versions have been used, {{but it is not}} a preferred option. Some systems, such as AirTrain JFK in New York City, are automatic, dispensing with the need for a driver; however, such systems are not what {{is generally}} thought of as light <b>rail,</b> <b>crossing</b> over into rapid transit. Automatic operation is more common in smaller people mover systems than in light rail systems, where the possibility of grade crossings and street running make driverless operation of the latter inappropriate.|$|E

Since the border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the Schengen Area the city is a center for trade in mainly from the east.|$|E
