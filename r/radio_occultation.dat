25|$|In May 2005, Cassini began {{a series}} of <b>radio</b> <b>occultation</b> experiments, to measure the size-distribution of {{particles}} in Saturn's rings, and measure the atmosphere of Saturn itself. For over four months, the craft completed orbits designed for this purpose. During these experiments, it flew behind the ring plane of Saturn, as seen from Earth, and transmitted radio waves through the particles. The radio signals received on Earth were analyzed, for frequency, phase, and power shift of the signal to determine the structure of the rings.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{location}} of the upper two cloud layers is somewhat controversial. Methane clouds were directly detected by Voyager 2 at 1.2–1.3bar by <b>radio</b> <b>occultation.</b> This result was later confirmed by {{an analysis of the}} Voyager 2 limb images. The top of the deeper ammonia/hydrogen sulfide clouds were determined to be at 3bar based on the spectroscopic data in the visible and near-infra spectral ranges (0.5–1μm). However a recent analysis of the spectroscopic data in the wavelength range 1–2.3μm placed the methane cloudtops at 2bar, and the top of the lower clouds at 6bar. This contradiction may be resolved when new data on methane absorption in Uranus's atmosphere are available. The optical depth of the two upper cloud layers varies with latitude: both become thinner at the poles as compared to the equator, though in 2007 the methane cloud layer's optical depth had a local maximum at 45°S, where the southern polar collar is located (see below).|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. <b>Radio</b> <b>occultations</b> by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Alice {{characterized}} the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules (airglow), and by dimming of background stars {{as they pass}} behind Pluto (occultation). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere {{and its effects on}} the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications dish on Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the <b>radio</b> <b>occultation</b> signal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth ("downlink"). Pluto's mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited a Doppler shift. The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>occultation</b> is {{a remote}} sensing {{technique}} where a GNSS signal tangentially scrapes the Earth, passing through the atmosphere, and is received by a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. As the signal passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted, curved and delayed. An LEO satellite samples the total electron content and bending angle of many such signal paths as it watches the GNSS satellite rise or set behind the Earth. Using an Inverse Abel's transform, a radial profile of refractivity at that tangent point on earth can be reconstructed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{composition}} of the Uranian atmosphere {{is different from that}} of Uranus as a whole, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.

2500|$|The {{thermosphere}} {{and upper}} part of the stratosphere contain a large concentration of ions and electrons, forming the ionosphere of Uranus. <b>Radio</b> <b>occultation</b> observations by the Voyager 2 spacecraft showed that the ionosphere lies between 1,000and 10,000km altitude and may include several narrow and dense layers between 1,000 and 3,500km. The electron density in the Uranian ionosphere is on average , reaching to as high as [...] in the narrow layers in the stratosphere. The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity. The auroral activity on Uranus is not as powerful as at Jupiter and Saturn and contributes little to the ionization. The high electron density may be in part caused by the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere.|$|E
2500|$|Pioneer10 {{became the}} first {{spacecraft}} to reach the Jupiter system on December 3, 1973. It passed within [...] of Io. During Pioneer10's fly-by of Io, the spacecraft performed a <b>radio</b> <b>occultation</b> experiment by transmitting an S-band signal as Io passed between it and Earth. A slight attenuation of the signal {{before and after the}} occultation showed that Io had an ionosphere, suggesting the presence of a thin atmosphere with a pressure of 1.0bar, though the composition was not determined. This was the second atmosphere to be discovered around a moon of an outer planet, after Saturn's moon Titan. Close-up images using Pioneers Imaging Photopolarimeter were planned as well, but were lost because of the high-radiation environment. Pioneer10 also discovered a hydrogen ion torus at the orbit of Io.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a methodology {{to extract the}} separate contributions of the ionosphere and the plasmasphere to the vertical total electron content, without relying on a fixed altitude to perform that separation. The method combines two previously developed and tested techniques, namely, the retrieval of electron density profiles from <b>radio</b> <b>occultations</b> using an improved Abel inversion technique and a two-component model for the topside ionosphere plus protonosphere. Taking measurements of the total electron content from global ionospheric maps and <b>radio</b> <b>occultations</b> from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate/FORMOSAT- 3 constellation, the ionospheric and plasmaspheric electron contents are calculated for a sample of observations covering 2007, a period of low solar and geomagnetic activity. The results obtained are shown {{to be consistent with}} previous studies for the last solar minimum period and with model calculations, confirming the reversal of the winter anomaly, the hemispheric asymmetry of the semiannual anomaly, and the existence in the plasmasphere of an annual anomaly in the South American sector of longitudes. The analysis of the respective fractional contributions from the ionosphere and the plasmasphere to the total electron content shows quantitatively that during the night the plasmasphere makes the largest contribution, peaking just before sunrise and during winter. On the other hand, the fractional contribution from the ionosphere reaches a maximum value around noon, which is nearly independent of season and geomagnetic latitude. JRC.

30|$|Vertical {{transport}} {{of air and}} momentum will occur also via small-scale turbulence. Woo et al.

They found that a turbulent layer exists around 60 km altitude, and the scintillation power is higher at higher latitudes. An eddy diffusion coefficient of 4 m 2 s− 1 was estimated for 60 km altitude from the same data set. Leroy and Ingersoll (1996), on the other hand, attributed the scintillations to vertically-propagating gravity waves created by cloud-level convection.|$|R

2500|$|Measurements of Martian {{temperature}} predate the Space Age. However, early instrumentation {{and techniques}} of radio astronomy produced crude, differing results.

The physical observables estimated with this technique permit to test theoretical {{models of the}} electron density such as, for example, the Chapman and the Vary-Chap models.

We propose to investigate the feasibility of the Vary-Chap model where the scale height varies linearly with respect to height. In order to test this hypothesis, the scale height data provided by <b>radio</b> <b>occultations</b> from a receiver on board a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite, obtained by iterating with a local Chapman model at every point of the topside F 2 layer provided by the GNSS satellite occultation, are fitted to height data by means of a linear least squares fit (LLS). Results, based on FORMOSAT- 3 /COSMIC GPS occultation data inverted by means of the Improved Abel transform inversion technique (which takes into account the horizontal electron content gradients) show that the scale height presents a more clear linear trend above the F 2 layer peak height, hm, which is in good agreement with the expected linear temperature dependence. Moreover, the parameters of the linear fit obtained during four representative days for all seasons, depend significantly on local time and latitude, strongly suggesting that this approach can significantly contribute to build realistic models of the electron density directly derived from GNSS occultation data.
