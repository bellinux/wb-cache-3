50|$|Galvanized <b>rigid</b> <b>conduit</b> (GRC) is {{galvanized}} steel tubing, with a tubing wall that is {{thick enough to}} allow it to be threaded. Its common applications are in commercial and industrial construction.|$|E
5000|$|Electrical {{metallic}} tubing (EMT), {{sometimes called}} thin-wall, {{is commonly used}} instead of galvanized <b>rigid</b> <b>conduit</b> (GRC), as it is less costly and lighter than GRC. EMT itself is not threaded, but {{can be used with}} threaded fittings that clamp to it. Lengths of conduit are connected {{to each other and to}} equipment with clamp-type fittings. Like GRC, EMT is more common in commercial and industrial buildings than in residential applications. EMT is generally made of coated steel, though it may be aluminum.https://steeltubeinstitute.org/steel-conduit/types-of-steel-conduit/electrical-metallic-tubing-emt/ ...|$|E
50|$|For some {{industrial}} uses in steel mills and similar hot environments, no organic material gives satisfactory service. Cables insulated with compressed mica flakes are sometimes used. Another form of high-temperature cable is a mineral insulated cable, with individual conductors placed within a copper tube {{and the space}} filled with magnesium oxide powder. The whole assembly is drawn down to smaller sizes, thereby compressing the powder. Such cables have a certified fire resistance rating and are more costly than non-fire rated cable. They have little flexibility and behave more like <b>rigid</b> <b>conduit</b> rather than flexible cables.|$|E

50|$|All {{equipment}} in Division 1 areas {{must have an}} approval label, but certain materials, such as <b>rigid</b> metallic <b>conduit,</b> {{does not have a}} specific label indicating the Cl./Div.1 suitability and their listing as approved method of installation in the NEC serves as the permission. Some {{equipment in}} Division 2 areas do not require a specific label, such as standard 3 phase induction motors that do not contain normally arcing components.|$|R
40|$|Regulation (NRR) {{technical}} assistance {{to determine if the}} licensee has “reasonable assurance that the 125 -volt dc circuits in the drywell would have remained operable during a high energy line break, or would the 10 -amp circuit fuses have likely opened resulting in a common cause failure of both trains " of 125 -volt circuits. Background- As a result of root cause findings relating to a reported deficiency with the environmental qualification (EQ) program at the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS), the licensee as part of its commitment to long term corrective actions, performed a review of its existing EQ program design bases against its document files supporting EQ of equipment. The licensee’s review identified, in part, a nonconforming condition in which a specific type of EQ equipment (PCI Pressure Switches) may be installed at CNS without conduit seals. The tested configuration used <b>rigid</b> <b>conduit</b> routed through the test chamber wall. This effectively sealed off the switch internals and wire leads from the loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) test environment. Therefore, the existing CNS installed configuration that utilizes <b>rigid</b> <b>conduit</b> attached to the switch and then run to an unsealed junction box within the drywell does not adequately represent the tested configuration. The installed configuration could potentially...|$|E
40|$|The {{ascent of}} magma to the Earth's surface is {{commonly}} modeled by assuming a fixed dike or flow geometry {{from a deep}} subsurface reservoir to the surface. In practice, however, this flow geometry is produced by deformation of the crust by ascending overpressured magma. Here, we explore how this elastic deformation is coupled to magma ascent using {{a model of a}} planar dike whose width is allowed to evolve with depth in the crust. The model predicts that, for points well below the surface, the dike gradually narrows with height above the source reservoir as the overpressure of the magma relative to the minimum horizontal stress in the crust decreases. For a bubbly compressible magma, the flow accelerates to the surface and reaches the speed of sound at the vent, as for <b>rigid</b> <b>conduit</b> flow. However, it is now able to decompress to atmospheric pressure at the vent by contraction of the conduit. Our calculations predict eruption rates on the order of 0. 1 – 10 $m^ 2 /s$ per unit length of a dike, for magma supplied from a reservoir with overpressure in the range − 10 MPa to + 20 MPa...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the effect of oscillating flow in a conduit in the absence of secondary flow on the rate of mass transfer to the wall, and the parameters that influence the magnitude of the change in the flux. Flow in an artery is pulsatile in nature and it will be shown in a later section that the model discussed in this paper, that of pulsating flow in a distensible tube is applicable to such flows. Nutrition of the arterial wall depends on the rate of diffusion of luminal plasma to and through the wall. This research is of importance in understanding the functioning of the cardiovascular system. It also finds application in the study of certain disorders of the artery. Another area of interest is in the study of diffusion controlled heterogeneous reactions in tubular reactors. The majority of the heterogeneous reactions and especially those of industrial importance are diffusion controlled. If pulsations bring about a change in the rate of diffusion as has been postulated, then a change in the rate of the diffusion controlled reaction will result. Two physical models are discussed in this paper. The first refers to flow in a <b>rigid</b> <b>conduit</b> with a periodic disturbance superimposed on a steady mean flow. The second case applies to flow in a distensible tube which is longitudinally constrained, and the steady flow is disturbed by a pulse wave progressing in the direction of flow...|$|E
50|$|An {{electrical}} conduit is a tube {{used to protect}} and route electrical wiring in a building or structure. Electrical conduit may be made of metal, plastic, fiber, or fired clay. Most <b>conduit</b> is <b>rigid,</b> but flexible <b>conduit</b> is used for some purposes.|$|R
40|$|Magma flow during {{explosive}} {{volcanic eruptions}} {{has been described}} assuming <b>rigid</b> <b>conduits</b> with simple cylindrical or planar geometries. Here we study the dynamics of explosive volcanic flows {{to take account of}} the role of elastic deformation of the conduit influenced by local magmatic pressure. Three cases are investigated: a dyke with elliptical cross-section, a cylindrical conduit and a deep dyke connected to a shallow cylinder. The model CPIUC (Macedonio et al., 2005) was used for simulations and generalized to account for elastic deformations of the conduit cross-section area due to magmatic overpressure. Fragmentation level is typically deeper in a dyke than in a cylinder. For flows in wide dykes pressure at the fragmentation depth can be lower than the surrounding lithostatic pressure by several tens of MPa, indicating that the wall-rocks of the dyke will be unstable, constraining the dyke width and eventually blocking the eruption. On the other hand, when the fragmentation level is shallow the corresponding lithostatic pressure is not large enough to close the dyke and eruptions from wide dykes are possible. The behaviour changes drastically when we assume the conduit is a dyke at depth that evolves to a cylinder near the surface. In this case even very wide dykes can be stable because the fragmentation level moves into the cylindrical region where deformation is negligible...|$|R
50|$|Aluminum conduit, {{similar to}} {{galvanized}} steel <b>conduit,</b> is a <b>rigid</b> tube, generally used in {{commercial and industrial}} applications where a higher resistance to corrosion is needed. Such locations would include food processing plants, where large amounts of water and cleaning chemicals would make galvanized conduit unsuitable. Aluminum cannot be directly embedded in concrete, since the metal reacts with the alkalis in cement. The conduit may be coated to prevent corrosion by incidental contact with concrete. Aluminum conduit is generally lower cost than steel {{in addition to having}} a lower labor cost to install, since a length of aluminum conduit will have about one-third the weight of an equally-sized <b>rigid</b> steel <b>conduit.</b>|$|R
40|$|The linear {{stability}} {{analysis of}} a plane Couette flow of an Oldroyd-B viscoelastic fluid past a flexible solid medium is carried out to investigate the role of polymer addition in the stability behavior. The system consists of a viscoelastic fluid layer of thickness R, density rho, viscosity eta, relaxation time lambda, and retardation time beta lambda flowing past a linear elastic solid medium of thickness HR, density rho, and shear modulus G. The {{emphasis is on the}} high-Reynolds-number wall-mode instability, which has recently been shown in experiments to destabilize the laminar flow of Newtonian fluids in soft-walled tubes and channels at a significantly lower Reynolds number than that for flows in <b>rigid</b> <b>conduits.</b> For Newtonian fluids, the linear stability {{studies have shown that the}} wall modes become unstable when flow Reynolds number exceeds a certain critical value Re c which scales as Sigma(3 / 4), where Reynolds number Re = rho VR/eta, V is the top-plate velocity, and dimensionless parameter Sigma = rho GR(2) /eta(2) characterizes the fluid-solid system. For high-Reynolds-number flow, the addition of polymer tends to decrease the critical Reynolds number in comparison to that for the Newtonian fluid, indicating a destabilizing role for fluid viscoelasticity. Numerical calculations show that the critical Reynolds number could be decreased by up to a factor of 10 by the addition of small amount of polymer. The critical Reynolds number follows the same scaling Re-c similar to Sigma(3 / 4) as the wall modes for a Newtonian fluid for very high Reynolds number. However, for moderate Reynolds number, there exists a narrow region in beta-H parametric space, corresponding to very dilute polymer solution (0. 9 less than or similar to beta < 1) and thin solids (H less than or similar to 1. 1), in which the addition of polymer tends to increase the critical Reynolds number in comparison to the Newtonian fluid. Thus, Reynolds number and polymer properties can be tailored to either increase or decrease the critical Reynolds number for unstable modes, thus providing an additional degree of control over the laminar-turbulent transition...|$|R
