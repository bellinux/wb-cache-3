50|$|The {{bridge was}} damaged in floods during 1904.

50|$|This {{self-propelled}} gun was built with <b>riveted</b> <b>steel</b> plates, which were thicker but also less sloped {{than in the}} original tank (50 mm as against 42 mm max). Frontal armour was almost vertical, but it consisted of two plates that strengthened it when compared to a simple homogeneous steel plate.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>riveted</b> <b>steel</b> ship, the strakes {{were usually}} lapped and joggled, but where a {{smoother}} finish was sought, they too might be riveted on a butt strap, {{though this was}} weaker. In modern welded construction, the plates are normally butt-welded all round to adjoining plates within the strake and to adjoining strakes.|$|R
50|$|The Ambridge-Aliquippa Bridge’s {{cantilevered}} trusses {{are made}} from <b>riveted</b> <b>steel,</b> a design favored from the 1920s through the 1970s for crossings with 600 to 1,400 foot main spans. In addition to the Ohio River and two railways, the bridge crosses two main highways making the full length 1,908 feet excluding the end spans.|$|R
50|$|At some point, the {{wrought iron}} girders were {{replaced}} with <b>riveted</b> <b>steel</b> girders. Further remedial work {{was carried out}} in 1919; by then, the weight of modern trains necessitated the strengthening of Broadbottom and Dinting viaducts. Three red brick intermediate piers, of which one is in the river, were built to better support the girders.|$|R
50|$|King's Bridge, {{which carries}} the A74 across the river, {{was built in}} 1933 and has four 21-metre spans {{containing}} a series of <b>rivetted</b> <b>steel</b> plate girders which support the reinforced concrete bridge deck. With deep foundations, the piers divide at low level to create the arches. The bridge is a low-level bridge and was designed by TPM Somers.|$|R
50|$|The Slate Creek Bridge is a <b>riveted</b> <b>steel</b> Parker pony {{truss bridge}} {{spanning}} the Blue River 9 mi north of Silverthorne, Colorado. It {{is named after}} the road it carries, Slate Creek Road. The bridge was rehabilitated in 1951. This rare example of an uncommon truss type was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Many old <b>riveted</b> <b>steel</b> bridges remain {{operational}} {{and require}} retrofit to accommodate ever increasing demands. Complicating retrofit efforts, <b>riveted</b> <b>steel</b> bridges are often considered historical structures {{and as such}} structural modifications that affect the original construction are to be avoided. The presence of rivets along with preservation requirements often prevent the use of traditional retrofit methods, such as bonding of fiber reinforced composites, or the addition of supplementary steel elements. In this paper, an un-bonded post-tensioning retrofit method is numerically investigated using an existing riveted bridge geometry from Münchenstein, Switzerland. Pre-stressed un-bonded carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates will be considered for the strengthening elements. By using prestressed CFRP plates, {{a portion of the}} permanent loads (such as the dead-weight) will be transferred to the strengthening element. Fatigue critical regions of the bridge are identified, and the effects of the un-bonded post-tensioning method on strength and fatigue susceptibility are explored...|$|R

The original span was constructed of <b>riveted</b> <b>steel</b> plates, and it has an open-grate shoulder access walk.

50|$|Broadbottom Viaduct (also {{known as}} Etherow Viaduct) is a railway viaduct that spans the River Etherow between Derbyshire and Greater Manchester in England. Originally of wooden {{construction}} supported by stone piers, the timber was replaced first with wrought iron girders, less than 20 {{years after the}} viaduct's opening, and later with <b>riveted</b> <b>steel</b> girders. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|R
50|$|The Grande Ronde River Bridge, near Asotin in Asotin County in {{southeast}} Washington, is a <b>riveted</b> <b>steel</b> girder bridge {{which was built}} in 1941. It is notable as the first, {{or one of the}} first, steel girder bridges in the Washington State highway system, and was a prototype for later ones. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.|$|R

The vessel was the first Australian tugboat to be built with an oil-fired compound steam engine.|$|R

40|$|Rivets {{were the}} primary {{fastener}} used to fabricate the connections of steel structures until the mid-twentieth century through a technique called hot riveting. Nowadays, engineers, architects and historic preservationists often lack information on the structural behaviour of <b>steel</b> <b>riveted</b> connections. Given {{the high number of}} parameters induced by hot riveting, the understanding and assessment of the behaviour of <b>steel</b> <b>riveted</b> connections is challenging. Therefore, we reviewed and compared historical test data with the results of experiments we performed. We tested in tension <b>rivets</b> machined from <b>steel</b> connections we fabricated. This paper addresses the impact of the hot-driving process on the strength and ductility of <b>steel</b> <b>rivets.</b> Experimental results corroborate historical test data. Rivet driving increases the tensile strength of <b>steel</b> <b>rivets</b> markedly. However, it reduces their ductility substantially. Consequently, the hot-driving process improves the shear strength of <b>steel</b> <b>riveted</b> connections. Present standards could be refined to account for the impact of the hot-driving process...|$|R
