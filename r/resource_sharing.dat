This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of <b>resource</b> <b>sharing</b> and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E

Similarly, based on production system, further statistical analysis portrayed a significant variation between women at (p[*]=[*] 0.028, χ 2 [*]=[*] 9.096, df[*]=[*] 3) on <b>resources</b> <b>shared</b> in their relationships. This shows that livelihood basis is a significant factor determining the variety of <b>resources</b> <b>shared</b> in the women’s relationships. As indicated in all group interviews, the more diversified the livelihood of the household, the more variety of <b>resources</b> <b>shared</b> in marro. The group interviews with agro-pastoralist women showed that their engagement in crop farming had increased the variety of <b>resources</b> <b>shared</b> in marro, {{in such a way}} that using grains from crop farming strengthens their marro with pastoral women. This shows diversification has increased the variety of <b>resources</b> women <b>share</b> in their institution.|$|R

The third question, the role of marro in ensuring household food security, was answered by allowing the women to sit down in groups and discuss the primary purpose of <b>shared</b> <b>resources,</b> and the role of these resources in improving household food security and challenges of marro. In addition, women in individual interviews were asked to choose if <b>shared</b> <b>resources</b> have no impact, positive impact and negative impact on household food security.|$|R

25|$|Poles {{settled a}} farming {{community}} in Parisville, Michigan, in 1857. Historians debate whether {{the community was}} established earlier, and claims that the community originated in 1848 still exist. The community was started by five or six Polish families who came from Poland by ship in the 1850s, and lived in Detroit, Michigan in 1855 before deciding to initiate a farming community in Parisville, where they created prosperous farms, and raised cattle and horses. The lands were originally dark black swamps, and the settlers succeeded in draining the land for use as fruit orchards. As per the Swamplands Act of 1850, the lands were legally conferred to pioneering settlers who could make use of these territories. Individual Polish farmers and their families took advantage of this new law, and other immigrants settled disparate areas in interior Michigan independently. The Parisville community was surrounded by Native American Indians who continued to live in tepees during this time. The Poles and the Indians enjoyed good relations and historical anecdotes of gift-giving and <b>resource</b> <b>sharing</b> are documented. Polish farmers were dispersed throughout Michigan, and by 1903 roughly 50,000 Poles were said to live in Detroit.|$|E

40|$|Multiple threads in SMT {{processor}} <b>share</b> <b>resources</b> {{to increase}} resource utilization and im-prove overall performance. At the same time, they compete {{against each other}} for the <b>shared</b> <b>resources,</b> causing resource monopolization or underutilization. Therefore, resource scheduling mechanism is important because it determines the throughput as well as fairness of the simulta-neously running threads in SMT processor. To achieve optimal SMT performance, all the earlier mechanisms schedule resources based on a couple of indicators, such as cache miss count, pre-decoded instruction count, or resource demand/occupancy. Those indicators trigger scheduling actions, expecting improved performance. However, since combinations of indicators can not cover all possible cases of threads behavior, earlier mechanisms may face a situation where the expected positive correlation between the indicators and the performance becomes weak, losing the chance of performance improvement. In this paper, we developed a novel methodology using hill-climbing or gradient descent algorithm to find the optimal <b>resource</b> <b>share</b> of simultaneously running threads. We carefully vary the <b>resource</b> <b>share</b> of multiple threads toward the direction which improves the SMT per-formance. Instead of monitoring the behavior of indicators, we use the past <b>resource</b> <b>share</b> and SMT performance change history to determine the <b>resource</b> <b>share</b> shift direction for the future.

40|$|There exists {{significant}} literature {{investigating the}} link between macroeconomic variables and stock market returns. Most previous studies utilise an overall stock market index to measure stock market returns, thereby aggregating {{a number of different}} industries into a single index. This research investigated {{the link between}} macroeconomic variables and a single sector’s share returns, being the Resources sector. The aim was to ascertain whether or not a correlation exists between the Resource Index of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and four macroeconomic variables, namely: GDP, Inflation, Interest rates and the Rand/US Dollar Exchange Rate. Quarterly data for all 4 macroeconomic variables and the Resource Index was collected for the period 2002 to 2011 and tests of correlation performed between each macroeconomic variable and the Resource Index. The findings reveal that there is a positive correlation between GDP and <b>resources</b> <b>share</b> returns, a negative correlation between interest rates and <b>resources</b> <b>share</b> returns and a positive relationship between the Rand/US Dollar Exchange rate and <b>resources</b> <b>share</b> returns.
