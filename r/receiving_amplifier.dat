This paper presents recent work on system specifications, front-end transceiver prototypes, passive components studies and commercial back-end transceiver evaluations. System optical power budgets are specified for single mode (1310 nm) and multi-mode (850 nm) links, with a target data rate of 4. 8 Gbps and a transmission length of 150 meters.

40|$|Ultrasound is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for industrial non-destructive testing (NDT) applications. By sending ultrasonic waves into an object and observing the amplitude and the delay of the reflected or transmitted waves, one can characterize the material, measure {{the thickness of the}} object, and detect discontinuities (flaws) as well as the size, location, and orientation of the defects in the object. Traditionally, ultrasonic transducers for NDT are made with piezoelectric crystals. Meanwhile, another class of ultrasonic transducers known as capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have become popular in medical ultrasound research because of their large bandwidths and other attributes that allow them to be integrated into the tip of a catheter. However, CMUTs have not been widely adopted in ultrasonic NDT applications. In this thesis, three important CMUTs characteristics that could potentially make them attractive for NDT applications are introduced and demonstrated. First, CMUTs can be beneficial to NDT because the fabrication techniques of CMUTs can easily be used to implement high-frequency, high-density phased arrays, which are essential for high resolution scanning. Surface scanning using a 2 -D row-column addressed CMUT array was demonstrated. Secondly, CMUTs can be integrated with supporting microelectronic circuits, thus one can implement a highly integrated transducer system, which can be useful in structural health monitoring NDT applications. Front-end microelectronic circuits that include a transmit pulser and a <b>receive</b> <b>amplifier</b> were designed, tested, and characterized. Thirdly, CMUTs are suitable for air-coupled applications because of their low acoustic impedance at resonance. Air-coupled CMUTs fabricated in a standard RF-MEMS process were characterized and tested. This thesis concludes with an analysis of the potential usefulness of CMUTs for ultrasonic NDT. While many ultrasonic NDT applications are better off being performed using conventional piezoelectric transducers, CMUTs can and should be used in certain NDT applications that {{can take advantage of the}} beneficial characteristics of this exciting transducer technology...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{inspection}} is {{the primary}} method of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) {{for the detection of}} planar flaws in engineering components. In recent years phased array technology has been adopted for use in NDE following success in related fields, such as medical and sonar applications. Phased array technology provides increased flexibility relative to single element monolithic transducers and the development of controlling hardware with large numbers of parallel channels has allowed the use of large phased arrays able to focus at long range, and offer increased performance. Full Matrix Capture (FMC) is a method of recording data using a phased array transducer that allows image reconstruction to be performed for any inspection technique than could be deployed using delay laws applied to the transmit voltage pulses applied to the array and <b>receiving</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> FMC technology provides a step change in inspection flexibility, and also provides the opportunity to take advantage of imaging techniques that are not practical to implement using phased arrays in the conventional way. However, existing inspection calibration procedures defined in standards do not allow these benefits to be fully realised. This thesis reports the development of a calibration framework designed for FMC based inspection for both rigid and conformable wedge mounted arrays. A large part of this work has been the development of acceptance limits on transducer performance variations. The developments of these limits have required a significant amount of modelling work, often using a Monte Carlo approach. To accommodate this, modelling tools have been developed to investigate the effect of array element directivity, sensitivity, and relative phase on system performance. For conformable phased arrays the effect of surface profile measurement accuracies has also been assessed. The developed calibration framework includes the tools necessary to monitor transducer performance throughout an inspection, with minimum impact on inspection duration. A means of calibrating imaging tools against known reflectors, in accordance with established industrial practice, has also been produced. Imperial Users Onl...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{analysis}} and design of ultra-low power radio transceivers operating at microwave frequencies. Hybrid prototypes and Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) which achieve power consumptions of less than 1 mW and theoretical operating ranges of over 10 m are described. The motivation behind the design of circuits exhibiting ultra low power consumption and, {{in the case of}} the MMICs, small size is the emerging technology of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). WSNs consist of spatially distributed ‘nodes’ or ‘specks’ each with their own renewable energy source, one or more sensors, limited memory, processing capability and radio or optical link. The idea is that specks within a ‘speckzone’ cooperate and share computational resources to perform complex tasks such as monitoring fire hazards, radiation levels or for motion tracking. The radio section must be ultra low power e. g. sub 1 mW in order not to drain the limited battery capacity. The radio must also be small in size e. g. less than 5 x 5 mm so that the overall speck size is small. Also, the radio must still be able to operate over a range of at least a metre so as to allow radio contact between, for example, rooms or relatively distant specks. The unsuitability of conventional homodyne topologies to WSNs is discussed and more efficient methods of modulation (On-Off Keying) and demodulation (non-coherent) are presented. Furthermore, it is shown how Super-Regenerative Receivers (SRR) can be used to achieve relatively large output voltages for small input powers. This is important because baseband Op-Amps connected at the RF receiver output generally cannot amplify small signals at the input without the output being saturated in noise (10 mV is the smallest measured input for 741 Op-Amp). Instrumentation amplifiers are used in this work as they can amplify signals below 1 mV. The thesis details {{the analysis and}} design of basic RF building blocks: amplifiers, oscillators, switches and detectors. It also details how the circuits can be put together to make transceivers as well as describing various strategies to lower power consumption. In addition, novel techniques in both circuit and system design are presented which allow the power consumption of the radio to be reduced by as much as 97 % whilst still retaining adequate performance. These techniques are based on duty cycling the transmitter and receiver and are possible because of the discontinuous nature of the On-Off Keying signal. In order to ease the sensitivity requirements of the baseband <b>receive</b> <b>amplifier</b> a design methodology for large output voltage receivers is presented. The designed receiver is measured to give a 5 mV output for an input power of - 90 dBm and yet consumes less than 0. 7 mW.

Pulsed excitation of triangle monopole antenna of 6. 5 cm height by rectangular electric pulses induced radiation of UWB signals with spectral density of power having maximum in ultra-high frequency (UHF) range. The same antenna {{was used for the}} radiated signal <b>receiving.</b> Filters and <b>amplifiers</b> of different passband were employed to divide UHF range into subranges of 0. 3 - 0. 55 GHz, 0. 55 - 1 GHz, 1 - 2 GHz and 2 - 4 GHz bands. The free space method, when conductive fabric samples of 50 x 50 cm 2 were placed between transmitting and receiving antennas, was used to imitate a practical application. Received wideband signals corresponding to the defined range were detected by unbiased detectors. The fabrics made of two types of warps, containing different threads with conductive yarns, were investigated. It was estimated attenuation and reflective properties of the fabrics when electric field is collinear or perpendicular to thread direction. In the UHF range it was revealed good reflecting properties of the fabrics containing metallic component in the threads. The system has advantages but not without a certain shortcoming. Adapting it for specific tasks should lead to more effective usage, including yet unused properties of the UWB signals. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{need of the}} {{everyday}} user to transfer large amounts of data is driving the need for larger data transfer capacity. Optical communication networks can satisfy this need. To be economically viable, optical transceivers must be integrated onto chips at low cost, using relatively cheap semiconductor processes. The optical preamplifier (transimpedance <b>amplifier)</b> <b>receives</b> optical information and converts it to a useful electrical form. It must operate at high speed, contribute little distortion to the input signal, and add little electrical noise to the incoming signal. This thesis investigates the design techniques in the literature, and proposes new architectures. Two high performance preamplifiers are designed, one using GaAs HEMTs, and the other using GaAs HBTs, each with different circuit techniques. The HEMT preamplifier has a transimpedance gain of 1. 4 k??????, {{the highest in the}} literature for 10 Gb/s operation, along with a low input referred noise current of about 15 pA/Hz 1 / 2 at a bandwidth of 6. 3 GHz. The HBT preamplifier also has a transimpedance gain of 1. 5 k??????, with a low input referred noise current of about 7 pA/Hz 1 / 2. Both have clear, open eye-diagrams with a 10 Gb/s bit stream input, and are suitable for integration on a chip. The HEMT preamplifier was implemented as a common-gate, common-source amplifier cascade with a darlington output driver for a 50 ?????? load. The HBT preamplifier was implemented as common-emitter darlington amplifier with shunt peaking, and a simple emitter degenerated output driver for a 50 ?????? load. Both implementations exceeded the bandwidth, transimpedance gain and noise performance typically expected of the transistor technologies used. It is shown that the transimpedance limit can be circumvented by the use of novel architectures and shunt peaking...|$|R
