Two {{primary calibration}} methods were used, namely the differential spectral responsivity (DSR) method at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and the direct sunlight method (DSM) at the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI). Furthermore, secondary calibrations were also made at ESTI against the World Photovoltaic Scale (WPVS). The calibration of c-Si <b>reference</b> <b>cells</b> is well established.

Furthermore, two filtered c-Si PV <b>reference</b> <b>cells</b> were calibrated using the same methods. The agreement between the methods is studied and possible sources for discrepancies are investigated. The spectral mismatch correction is identified as crucial factor.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} {{progress}} on gas sensing using real-time correlation spectroscopy, where a gas {{is used to}} "recognise" its own spectral absorption lines. Our recent results on methane detection using pressure modulation spectrometry are shown, and a new method of modulating the absorption of the gas in the <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> section of an ammonia detection system is reported for the first time. The basic concept of correlation spectrometry involves the passage of light sequentially through two gas <b>cells,</b> a <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> containing a known quantity of the gas to be detected, and a sampling cell where {{the presence of the}} gas is to be determined. An optical signal passing sequentially through the cells will suffer absorption in each of the cells. If the absorption in the <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> is periodically modulated, then the total absorption depends on whether the gas absorption lines in the sampling cell correlate with those in the <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> gas. If the absorption lines of the gases do not correlate strongly, then the modulation index of the optical signal is essentially unaffected by the presence of the different gas in the sampling cell. Therefore, the concentration of a specific gas in the sampling cell can be quantified by this means. Pressure modulation of the gas within the <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> is achieved by the use of a novel acoustic resonator. This device provides a reasonable pressure ratio whilst being compact and easily driven. Unlike previous piston-compressors, the high modulation frequency of the resonator improves the tolerance to transients in the optical signal produced by the passage of dust through the optical beam. The system can be tailored to detect a desired gas by changing the reference gas and a broadband section filter. Results for methane are presented in this paper. A novel method for detection of ammonia gas is reported for the first time. This involves Stark modulation of the gas in the <b>reference</b> <b>cell,</b> by the application of an electric field.
