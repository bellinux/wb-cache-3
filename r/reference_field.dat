25|$|Placement of {{the sample}} stage {{into one of the}} {{interferometer}}'s arms (instead of outside of the interferometer as typically implemented in conventional FTIR) is a key element of nano-FTIR. It boosts the weak near-field signal due to interference with the strong <b>reference</b> <b>field,</b> helps to eliminate completely the background caused by parasitic scattering off everything that falls into large diffraction-limited beam focus, and most importantly, allows for recording of both amplitude s and phase φ spectra of the tip-scattered radiation. With the detection of phase, nano-FTIR provides complete information about near fields, which is essential for quantitative studies and many other applications. For example, for soft matter samples (organics, polymers, biomaterials, etc.), φ directly relates to the absorption in the sample material. This permits a direct comparison of nano-FTIR spectra with conventional absorption spectra {{of the sample}} material, thus allowing for simple spectroscopic identification according to standard FTIR databases.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{radiation}} detector {{based on an}} artificial single crystal diamond was used to characterize in detail the energy distribution of neutron <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and their contamination with charged particles. The monoenergetic <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> at PTB in the neutron energy range from 1. 5 MeV up to 19 MeV are generated by proton and deuteron beams impinging on solid and gas targets of tritium and deuterium. The energy of the incoming particles and the variation of the angle under which the measurement is performed produce monoenergetic <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> with different mean energies and line shapes. In this paper we present high resolution neutron spectrometry measurements of different monoenergetic <b>reference</b> <b>fields.</b> The results are compared with calculated spectra {{taking into account the}} actual target parameters. Line structures in the order of 80 keV for a neutron energy of 9 MeV were resolved. The shift of the mean energy and the increasing of the width of the neutron peak with increasing pressure in the gas target in the order of 30 keV were measured. Another result is the determination of the contamination of the neutron field at 14 MeV with high energy charged particles (protons) from side reactions inside the T-target. The experiments have shown that this detector is an easy to operate compact neutron spectrometer with extremely good energy resolution and that detailed structures in the line shapes of monoenergetic neutron fields can be resolved without using time of flight techniques.

40|$|We {{develop the}} "simulated {{extinction}} method" to measure average foreground Galactic extinction from field galaxy number-counts and colors. The method comprises simulating extinction in suitable <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> {{by changing the}} isophotal detection limit. This procedure takes into account selection effects, in particular, the change in isophotal detection limit (and hence in isophotal magnitude completeness limit) with extinction, and the galaxy color [...] magnitude relation. We present a first application of the method to the HST WFPC 2 images of the gamma-ray burster GRB 970228. Four different WFPC 2 high-latitude fields, including the HDF, are used as reference to measure the average extinction towards the GRB in the F 606 W passband. From the counts, we derive an average extinction of A_V = 0. 5 mag, but the dispersion of 0. 4 mag between the estimates from the different <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> is significantly larger than can be accounted by Poisson plus clustering uncertainties. Although the counts differ, the average colors of the field galaxies agree well. The extinction implied by the average color difference between the GRB <b>field</b> and the <b>reference</b> galaxies is A_V = 0. 6 mag, with a dispersion in the estimated extinction from the four <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> of only 0. 1 mag. All our estimates are in good agreement with the value of 0. 81 ± 0. 27 mag obtained by Burstein & Heiles, and with the extinction of 0. 78 ± 0. 12 measured by Schlegel et al. from maps of dust IR emission. However, {{the discrepancy between the}} widely varying counts and the very stable colors in these high-latitude fields is worth investigating.

40|$|Almost {{all modern}} {{imperative}} programming languages include operations for dynamically manipu-lating the heap, for example by allocating and deallocating objects, and by updating <b>reference</b> <b>fields.</b> In {{the presence of}} recursive procedures and local variables the interactions of a program with the heap can become rather complex, as an unbounded number of objects can be allocated either on the call stack using local variables, or, anonymously, on the heap using <b>reference</b> <b>fields.</b> As such a static analysis is, in general, undecidable. In this paper we study the verification of recursive programs with unbounded allocation of ob-jects, in a simple imperative language for heap manipulation. We present an improved semantics for this language, using an abstraction that is precise. For any program with a bounded visible heap, meaning {{that the number of}} objects reachable from variables at any point of execution is bounded, this abstraction is a finitary representation of its behaviour, even though an unbounded number of objects can appear in the state. As a consequence, for such programs model checking is decidable. Finally we introduce a specification language for temporal properties of the heap, and discuss model checking these properties against heap-manipulating programs. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this work, we {{consider}} the effect of indiscriminate nudging time on an idealized high-resolution global model (GM) and limited-area model (LAM) simulations. The model used is a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model on the beta-plane. The effect of nudging is studied {{as a function of}} the predictability time, following a 'Big Brother' experimental approach: a high-resolution 'global' model is used to generate a 'reference run'. These fields are filtered afterwards to remove small scales and provide the coarse-resolution fields which are used to drive the high-resolution GM and the LAM. Comparison of the <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> and the high-resolution runs over the same region allows the estimation of the ability of the high-resolution GM and LAM to regenerate the removed small scales. This fully nonlinear set-up mimics the configuration used for regional high-resolution atmospheric modelling. For the high-resolution GM, the results show that the behaviour of the nudged model depends primarily on the ratio of the nudging time to the predictability time. When the nudging time is very small compared to the predictability time, the model reproduces the large scale used to drive the model. On the other hand, if the nudging time is close to or larger than the predictability time, the nudging effect is weak and both large and small scales are poorly reproduced compared to the <b>reference</b> <b>fields.</b> The best result is obtained with a nudging time close to half the predictability time. This technique clearly improves the model capacity to reproduce the <b>reference</b> <b>fields.</b> For the high-resolution LAM, our results show that for a sufficiently small domain the simulation is largely controlled by the lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) and is quasi-insensitive to nudging. However, if the domain size exceeds a few Rossby radii, the high-resolution LAM becomes sensitive to initial conditions and the control exerted by LBCs becomes insufficient to prevent a divergence from the driving fields. Although the reconstructed fine scales are significantly damped, they are surprisingly well correlated to their reference values in a deterministic sense, not a statistical sense. © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society...|$|R
