These figures differ slightly from those reported in most major media outlets (including some linked {{at the bottom of}} the page), where percentages have been slightly mis-stated for some candidates in some elections (either by applying inconsistent rounding or by inconsistently excluding minor candidates or candidates who had dropped out).|$|E
50|$|The {{minor change}} in total {{population}} percent from 1935 to 2015 {{is attributed to}} Han Chinese migration to urban areas in autonomous regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as one-child policy restrictions on the majority, with exceptions for largely minority groups west of the line. However, 2000-2015 period, west of the line is indeed growing faster than the east, but the growth wasn't sufficient to budge the <b>rounded</b> <b>percentages.</b> Most of this growth was contained in the cities of Ürümqi, Lanzhou, Ordos, and Yinchuan, although some tribal non-city areas also registered high growth. West of the Heihe-Tengchong Line after 80 years remains relatively rural rugged or inhospitable, underdeveloped and poor {{as compared to the}} east.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Adjusting {{a column}} of <b>rounded</b> <b>percentages</b> to sum to 100 percent is often done. Rounding of entries in {{statistical}} tables of counts has been a standard tool for preserving confidentiality of respondent data. Rounding has the disadvantage that the tables may no longer add up as expected. Controlled rounding addresses this problem but in turn introduces new problems. The rounding is no longer to the nearest value which is {{a benefit for the}} confidentiality application. However controlled rounding may not be possible for hierarchical tables or for tables with three or more dimensions. Many heuristics have addressed these problems. A careful analysis of the structure of tables shows how to identify totals for which controlled rounding is always possible. The analysis shows that some choice is possible in the identified totals. The guaranteed rounding may often be extended to other totals depending upon the data in any example...|$|E

40|$|Universities {{have entered}} {{a period of}} rapid change and {{upheaval}} due to an external environment beyond their control which includes shifting demographic patterns, accelerating technology, funding shortages, and keener competition for students. Strategic planning, a comprehensive vision which challenges universities to take bold and creative measures to meet the threats and opportunities of the future, is an institutional imperative in the 1980 's. This paper examines freshman student feedback {{in an effort to}} incorporate this important element into a strategic plan for Brock University, a small, predominantly liberal arts university in St. Catharines, Ontario. The study was designed to provide information on the characteristics of the 1985 - 86 pool of freshman registrants: their attitudes towards Brock's recruitment measures, their general university priorities, and their influences in regard to university selection (along with other demographical and attitudinal data). A survey involving fixed-alternative questions of a subjective and objective nature was administered in two large freshman classes at Brock in which a broad cross-section of academic programs was anticipated. Computer analysis of the data for the 357 respondents included total raw frequencies and <b>rounded</b> <b>percentages,</b> as well as subgroup cross-tabulation by geographic home area of respondent, academic major, and high school graduating average. The four directional hypotheses put forward were all substantiatied by the survey data, indicating that 1) the university's current recruitment program had been a positive influence during their university search 2) parents were the most influential group in the students' decisions related to university 3) respondents viewed institutional reputation as less of a priority than an enjoyable university lifestyle in a personal learning atmosphere 4) students had a decided preference for co-operative study and internship programs. Strategic planning recommendations included a reduction in the faculty/student ratio through faculty hirings to restore the close rapport between professors and students, increased recruitment presentations in Ontario high schools to enlarge the applicant pool, creation of an Office of Co-operative Study and Internship Programs, institutional emphasis on a "customer orientation", and an extension of research into student demographics and attitudinal data...|$|E

In experiment 1, the speaker used percentages, positive verbal probabilities or negative verbal probabilities in eight scenarios. Speakers were held more responsible if they used negative verbal probabilities rather than percentages or positive verbal probabilities. Speakers were also held more responsible when the outcome was negative than when it was positive. In experiment 2, speakers used <b>round</b> <b>percentages</b> (e. g., 70 %) or precise percentages (e. g., 71 %) within the same scenarios. Only speakers who used <b>round</b> <b>percentages</b> were held more responsible after a negative outcome. Across experiments 1 and 2 participants’ judgements ignored the predicted likelihood of the uncertain event. Experiment 3 replicated experiment 2 with an additional measure of the intention to recommend to another.

Intention to recommend was rated higher after positive outcomes than after negative outcomes; this difference was bigger when the event’s likelihood was high.

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} if {{election}} results are manipulated or forged, then, {{due to the}} well-known human attraction to round numbers, the frequency of reported <b>round</b> <b>percentages</b> can be increased. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed raw data from seven federal elections held in the Russian Federation {{during the period from}} 2000 to 2012 and found that in all elections since 2004 the number of polling stations reporting turnout and/or leader's result expressed by an integer percentage (as opposed to a fractional value) was much higher than expected by pure chance. Monte Carlo simulations confirmed high statistical significance of the observed phenomenon, thereby suggesting its man-made nature. Geographical analysis showed that these anomalies were concentrated in a specific subset of Russian regions which strongly suggests its orchestrated origin. Unlike previously proposed statistical indicators of alleged electoral falsifications, our observations can hardly be explained differently but by a widespread election fraud.

40|$|In four {{experiments}} {{we tested}} how speakers predicting uncertain events were held responsible {{according to the}} uncertainty format they used. In experiment 1, speakers used percentages, positive verbal probabilities or negative ones, of different magnitude. Speakers were held less responsible for predicting a positive event with a positive verbal probability or a percentage, but more for predicting it with a negative verbal probability. Speakers were also held more responsible if the outcome was negative than if it was positive. In experiment 2 a, speakers used <b>round</b> or precise <b>percentages</b> (e. g., 70 % or 71 %). Only speakers who used <b>round</b> <b>percentages</b> were held more responsible after a negative outcome. In experiments 1 and 2 a participants' judgements ignored the predicted likelihood of the uncertain event. Experiment 2 b replicated experiment 2 a with an additional measure of the intention to recommend to another. Speakers were held more responsible for positive than for negative outcomes and if the event's likelihood was high rather than low. Intention to recommend was rated higher for positive than for negative outcomes; this difference was bigger if the event's likelihood was high. Level of precision {{had no effect on}} the responsibility judgements or on the intention to recommend. Experiment 2 c replicated experiment 2 b but the responsibility judgement and the intention to recommend were measured between participants. Speakers were held more responsible and {{were more likely to be}} recommended for positive than for negative outcomes. They were held more responsible if the event's likelihood was low, but were more likely to be recommended if this likelihood was high. We discuss how these findings inform our understanding of the Preference Paradox (Erev & Cohen, 1990) ...|$|R
