AIMS: To assess {{the adoption of}} transnasal oesogastroduodenoscopy among endoscopists from various European countries and its determinants. METHODS: A survey was distributed to 624 endoscopists attending a live course on digestive endoscopy; a poll was also performed immediately before and after live <b>video</b> <b>retransmission</b> of a transnasal oesogastroduodenoscopy. RESULTS: Answer rate was 48 %; transnasal oesogastroduodenoscopy was practised by 31 % of respondents. In multivariate analysis, practice of transnasal oesogastroduodenoscopy was associated with location in France and Netherlands (P< 0. 0001), availability of many gastroscopes (P< 0. 0001) and less frequent use of sedation (P= 0. 006). Endoscopists who did not practise transnasal oesogastroduodenoscopy cited doubts about its advantages over conventional oesogastroduodenoscopy and lack of training (34 % each) as barriers to adoption. Seventy-four percent of endoscopists practicing transnasal oesogastroduodenoscopy did actually use it in < 20 % of eligible cases. Live <b>video</b> <b>retransmission</b> of a transnasal oesogastroduodenoscopy increased the proportion of endoscopists interested in this technique (P= 0. 006).

30|$|The {{usage of}} HFS from {{and up to}} the {{application}} level is justified in several cases by the interest and necessity of representing true bit reality. One of these cases corresponds to the introduction of forward error correction codes in the higher layers of the protocol stack, as for instance, with RTP-FEC or more generally IETF FecFrame approaches, which aim at overcoming remaining losses or errors at transport or application layers, without requiring a full TCP integrity mechanism. Another case corresponds to the transmission of multimedia data, whose codecs are often resilient to small errors or losses, and for which errors or losses positions are critical to evaluate their real impact on the end-user and measure the PQoS. This is the case considered by the French ANR DITEMOI project, in which error and loss resilient H. 264 /AVC decoders were introduced [31], and new strategies for limiting <b>retransmission</b> in <b>video</b> sessions in a multiple users context are being studied.|$|R

The frequent errors should cause deterioration of the quality of multimedia streams. In this paper we present a selective <b>retransmission</b> algorithm for <b>video</b> streaming over IP networks where the video is streamed using DCCP transport protocol. The goal is to minimize the number of the corrupted bits, with acceptable transmission delay. The performance of the algorithm was confirmed by analytical examinations.

40|$|Abstract—For {{streaming}} scalably {{compressed video}} streams over unreliable networks, Limited-Retransmission Priority En-coding Transmission (LR-PET) outperforms PET remarkably since {{the opportunity to}} retransmit is fully exploited by hypoth-esizing the possible future retransmission behavior before the retransmission really occurs. For the retransmission to be efficient in such a scheme, {{it is critical to}} get adequate acknowledgment from a previous transmission before deciding what data to re-transmit. However, in many scenarios, the presence of a stochastic packet delay process results in frequent late acknowledgments, while imperfect feedback channels can impare the server’s knowl-edge of what the client has received. This paper proposes an extended LR-PET scheme, which optimizes PET-protection of transmissed bitstreams, recognizing that the received feedback information is likely to be incomplete. Similar to the original LR-PET, the behavior of future retransmissions is hypothesized in the optimization objective of each transmission opportunity. As the key contribution, we develop a method to efficiently de-rive the effective recovery probability versus redundancy rate characteristic for the extended LR-PET communication process. This significantly simplifies the ultimate protection assignment procedure. This paper also demonstrates the advantage of the proposed strategy over several alternative strategies.

30|$|Video content can be {{provided}} to an end user by transmitting video data as a sequence of internet protocol (IP) packets over the network. When the network contains a wireless link, packet erasures occur because of occasional deep fades. In order to maintain a sufficient video quality at the end user, video packets must be protected against erasures {{by means of a}} suitable form of error control. In this contribution, we investigate two types of error control: (1) forward error correction (FEC), which involves the transmission of parity packets that enables recovery of a limited number of erased video packets, and (2) the use of an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol, where the receiver requests the <b>retransmission</b> of <b>video</b> packets that have been erased. We point out that FEC and ARQ considerably reduce the probability of unrecoverable packet loss, because both error control techniques provide a diversity gain, as compared to the case where no protection against erasures is applied. We derive a simple analytical expression for the diversity gain resulting from FEC or ARQ, in terms of the channel coherence time, the allowable latency, and (for FEC) the allowable overhead or (for ARQ) the time interval between (re)transmissions of copies of a same packet.

40|$|Abstract — This paper investigates {{priority}} encoding trans-mission (PET) {{protection for}} streaming scalably compressed video streams over erasure channels, for the scenarios {{where a small}} number of retransmissions are allowed. In principle, the optimal protection depends not only on the importance of each stream element, but also on the expected channel behavior. By formulating a collection of hypotheses concerning its own behavior in future transmissions, limited-retransmission PET (LR-PET) effectively constructs channel codes spanning multiple transmission slots and thus offers better protection efficiency than the original PET. As the number of transmission oppor-tunities increases, the optimization for LR-PET becomes very challenging because the number of hypothetical retransmission paths increases exponentially. As a key contribution, this paper develops a method to derive the effective recovery-probability versus redundancy-rate characteristic for the LR-PET procedure with any number of transmission opportunities. This significantly accelerates the protection assignment procedure in the original LR-PET with only two transmissions, and also makes a quick and optimal protection assignment feasible for scenarios where more transmissions are possible. This paper also gives a concrete proof to the redundancy embedding property of the channel codes formed by LR-PET, which allows for a decoupled optimization for sequentially dependent source elements with convex utility-length characteristic. This essentially justifies the source-independent construction of the protection convex hull for LR-PET.

40|$|Abstract- We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} video streaming over multihop wireless networks. Wireless channel errors, delay and delay jitter are major concerns for QoS guarantee. We propose a distributed system for layered video streaming over multi-hop wireless networks. The system is composed of two major components: distributed control (DC) system consisting of DC nodes and distributed buffer (DB) system consisting of DB nodes. The DC system performs early-drops of outdated video packets to improve the bandwidth utilization and to reduce end-to-end delay. The DB system buffers video packets at certain intermediate nodes to reduce delay jitter and buffer overflow probability. Employing FEC and ARQ scheme in the proposed DB system localizes the error correction and retransmission within two consecutive DB nodes. Therefore FEC overhead and ARQ delay are reduced. Compared to the traditional FEC and ARQ scheme, our distributed FEC and ARQ scheme consumes less bandwidth and provides less ARQ delay. Simulations show that the end-to-end delay is reduced and bandwidth utilization is saved by DC system and delay jitter is reduced by DB system. Also, at the receiver side, {{there is a significant}} reduction of average <b>retransmission</b> delay of <b>video</b> packets. I...|$|R

These networks present some unique challenges for video streaming applications due to the inherent infrastructure unreliability. In this paper, we address the problem of robust video streaming in multihop networks by relying on delay-constrained and distortion-aware scheduling, path diversity, and <b>retransmission</b> of important <b>video</b> packets over multiple links to maximize the received video quality at the destination node. To provide an analytical study of this streaming problem, we focus on an elementary multihop network topology that enables path diversity, which we term “elementary cell. ” Our analysis is considering several cross-layer parameters at the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers, as well as application-layer parameters such as the expected distortion reduction of each video packet and the packet scheduling via an overlay network infrastructure. In addition, we study the optimal deployment of path diversity in order to cope with link failures. The analysis is validated in each case by simulation results with the elementary cell topology, as well as with a larger multihop network topology. Based on the derived results, we are able to establish the benefits of using path diversity in video streaming over multihop networks, as well as to identify the cases where path diversity does not lead to performance improvements.

A simple and effective formula is proposed {{to combine the}} perceptual and temporal importance of each packet into a single priority value, which is then used to drive the packet-selection process at each retransmission opportunity. Compared to the standard 802. 11 MAC-layer ARQ scheme, the proposed technique delivers higher perceptual quality because it can retransmit only the most perceptually important packets reducing <b>retransmission</b> bandwidth waste. <b>Video</b> streaming of H. 264 test sequences has been simulated with ns in a realistic 802. 11 e home scenario, in which the various kinds of traffic flows have been assigned to different 802. 11 e access categories according to the Wi-Fi alliance WMM specification. Extensive simulations show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the standard link-layer 802. 11 retransmission scheme, delivering PSNR gains up to 12 dB while achieving low transmission delay and limited impact on concurrent traffic. Moreover, comparisons with a MAC-level ARQ scheme which adapts the retry limit {{to the type of}} frame contained in packets and with an application-level deadline-based priority retransmission scheme show that the PSNR gain offered by the proposed algorithm is significant, up to 5 dB. Additional results obtained in a scenario in which the transmission relies on an intermediate node (i. e., the access point) further confirms the consistency of the perceptual ARQ performance.

40|$|Dissertação de Mestrado em Engenharia Informática apresentada à Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de CoimbraRemote video viewing {{is largely}} growing, {{especially}} in wireless devices. Therefore, video transmission mechanisms such as retransmission and Forward Error Correction (FEC) {{are very important}} to ensure that the video arrives at its destination while retaining its quality. While some of these mechanisms can obtain good performance, this does not mean they provide an optimal situation. There are several factors that negatively impact Quality of Experience (QoE) in video transmission, such as network congestion, loss and type of video being transmitted. Adaptive Forward Error Correction schemes aim at providing protection against loss errors by analysing several relevant characteristics of the video and/or network, and using them to apply unequal error protection (UEP) to di erent parts of the video. Taking this into account, it is clear that an adaptive FEC mechanism is a viable option to achieve optimal error protection, thus increasing the video transmission's resilience against errors and losses, and therefore improving Quality of Experience for the end user. This work presents and examines the state-of-the-art mechanisms for <b>retransmission,</b> FEC, QoE, <b>video</b> classi cation and algorithm optimization. The assessment of the mechanisms presents an in-depth study of each concept and individually explores their advantages and disadvantages. Three mechanisms which provide adaptive FEC are developed in and evaluated in a simulation environment, with motion classi cation, error correction, adaptive redundancy allocation and loss feedback components. The capabilities of the adaptive FEC mechanisms are evaluated through a wireless network environment in order to assess their performance against other methods. The results obtained through the assessed mechanisms showed incremental improvements through each stage of development. They also showed {{that it is possible to}} accurately characterize the intensity of motion in video sequences according to their characteristics. Furthermore, the ndings highlight the importance of shielding sequences with higher amounts of motion intensity with greater quantities of redundancy due to david their higher degradation when subjected to error.

At the same time, the mechanisms maintained video quality which combined with the overhead reduction results in an overall improvement of QoE ultimately enhancing video transmission in wireless networks...|$|R
