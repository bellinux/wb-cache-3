5000|$|On 8 August 2012, a Bangladeshi {{worker was}} {{dismantling}} a supporting structure that formed {{part of an}} Earth Retaining Stabilizing Structure (ERSS) used at the C156 Marina Bay worksite. The worker {{had been assigned to}} <b>remove</b> <b>bolts</b> from a waler section to be dismantled. Following the removal of the bolts, the waler sections were to be hoisted by a crane out of the worksite. During the hoisting of one waler section, another waler section which the worker had been standing on became dislodged as it was still connected to the waler section being hoisted. Both the worker and this waler section plunged {{to the base of the}} ERSS, and this waler section crushed the worker, killing him.|$|E
5000|$|Scott Carpenter was {{the first}} {{astronaut}} to evaluate the contractor's operation, in a [...] "wet workshop" [...] simulation. The task was to <b>remove</b> <b>bolts</b> while in a submerged simulated airlock. The bolt removal task was designed to create access to a spent S-IVB dome. Carpenter's evaluation of the simulation was favorable and NASA quickly provided mockups of Gemini vehicles and docking components to facilitate further development of EVA capabilities via neutral buoyancy training. Astronaut Gene Cernan first visited the McDonogh School indoor pool facility for post-mission evaluation of problems that he encountered during his Gemini IX-A EVA. NASA then modified the contract to include pre-mission training of Gemini XII astronaut, Buzz Aldrin. Astronaut Cernan also participated in this pre-mission training, {{as he was in}} a backup role to Aldrin as pilot of Gemini XII.|$|E
40|$|In car {{workshops}} in cleaning the air filter, tighten or <b>remove</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{fill the air}} in the tires, and in the use of hydro pneumatic require pressurized air. To obtain the pressurized air required tool, it called compressor. To accommodate the pressurized air generated by the compressor, it require a container, it called tank. The function compressed air reservoir (receiver) to stabilize the usage of compressed air. Pressurized air reservoir that mostly used, it was tank because it have character will be delicate pressure fluctuations on network when the air used by the network. In the fabrication process very need accuracy in material choosing until the inspection so produce a standrt product and safe on operating. The design of the pressurized air reservoir tank for need car workshop then the designer going to design pressurized air reservoir tank with capacity 1400 liters and operating pressure 600 kPa that will be used for service needs, with the mechanism is air sucked into the compressor and then enter into the tank, when the pressure was in excess of the the maximum design pressure tank safety valve automatically open, after the air stored in tank, air pass the dryer, after that it used to pneumatic tools such as blow gun, the drive screw, lifting car. The result of pressurized air reservoir tank design was found design pressure 1100 kPa, design temperature 65. 560 C, corrosion allowance 3 mm, thickness of shell and head 9. 53 mm, and hydrotest pressure 1430 kP...|$|E
50|$|Stealing {{dynamite}} {{from the}} Germans eventually took preference over handcrafting explosives. The British Special Operations Executive also parachuted tons of explosives to its agents in France for essential sabotage missions. The railways were a favorite target of saboteurs, who soon understood that <b>removing</b> <b>bolts</b> from the tracks {{was far more}} efficient than planting explosives.|$|R
50|$|Failing to <b>remove</b> transit <b>bolts</b> {{before using}} the machine can also damage the machine.|$|R
50|$|An {{impact socket}} wrench is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool {{with a female}} opening to fit over a nut or bolt head, and is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an Impact wrench or hydraulic torque wrench. Sizes range from the very small, to massive sizes weighing hundreds of pounds each. Impact sockets typically connect with the driving tool {{by way of a}} male to female square drive connection (or less commonly a spline drive connection). The use of power tools and ratchet wrenches with sockets makes tightening and <b>removing</b> <b>bolts</b> incredibly easy over alternative methods like combination wrenches and other manual methods.|$|R
6000|$|Serge {{had often}} studied thus {{through the night}} and when it was morning he would say, [...] "It is morning," [...] and would go down and help Madame Vasselitch unbar the iron {{shutters}} and unchain the door, and <b>remove</b> the <b>bolts</b> from the window casement.|$|R
50|$|Bendera {{went to the}} motorpool; Piechowski, Lempart, and Jaster went to the {{warehouse}} in which the uniforms and weapons were stored. They entered via a coal bunker which Piechowski had helped fill. He had <b>removed</b> a <b>bolt</b> from the lid so it wouldn't self latch when closed.|$|R

50|$|Dextre was put {{together}} today during the second spacewalk of STS-123. Mission Specialists Richard Linnehan and Mike Foreman completed their 7-hour, 8-minute orbital stroll Sunday at 06:57 UTC. The spacewalkers encountered some difficulty <b>removing</b> two <b>bolts</b> that secured the robot arm during transport, and {{had to resort to}} using a prybar to remove them.|$|R
50|$|Legend has it {{that during}} the King's stay at a Dominican chapter house in Perth, {{a group of men}} led by Sir Robert Graham came to the door searching for the King in order to kill him. The King's Chamberlain, Robert Stewart, Master of Atholl, had <b>removed</b> the <b>bolt</b> from the door of the room in which James and his queen were staying.|$|R
50|$|The new {{operators}} {{began taking}} direct {{action against the}} Cobourg line. Some time in 1861 they moved the locomotives to their own yards in Port Hope, and then sabotaged the bridge by <b>removing</b> iron <b>bolts</b> and fittings, taking them for use on the Millbrook line. At some point between 1861 and 1863 the main center section of the bridge collapsed.|$|R
40|$|A 6 -MW ion {{cyclotron}} (IC) {{system for}} the Tokamak Physics Experiment (TPX) is in the preliminary design phase. In conjunction with the 3 -MW Lower Hybrid system and the 8 -MW neutral beam system, the IC system will provide heating and current-drive capabilities to explore advanced tokamak physics and long-pulse (1000 s) operation. The IC launcher consists of six nickel-plated current straps arranged toroidally in pairs behind three water-cooled Faraday shields. The Faraday shields can be independently mid remotely detached by cutting water lines {{at the back of}} the launcher and <b>removing</b> <b>bolts</b> at the front to free each shield. The antenna can be located at the + 2 cm flux line and retracted 10 cm. Faraday shields are usually copper- or nickel-plated stainless steel or inconel. Titanium is the preferred material to minimize activation without greatly decreasing electrical resistivity and therefore increasing disruption loads. The IC antenna research and development programs have provided data that confirm the feasibility of B{sub 4 }C-coated nickel-plated titanium alloy in the TPX environment...|$|R
5000|$|In the [...]22LR version, {{the barrel}} was switched, the {{magazine}} follower and spring was <b>removed</b> and the <b>bolt</b> {{was changed to}} be able to fire rimfire ammunition. This model had no magazine and was a single-shot rifle.|$|R
50|$|The {{rocket pack}} could be swapped in around 20 minutes by <b>removing</b> six <b>bolts.</b> Fuelling the rocket oxidiser was {{potentially}} somewhat hazardous {{and so it}} was carried out away from other aircraft, by groundcrew in protective clothing and with a fire crew standing by in order to flush away any spillage. Acid refuelling was carried out above a steel drip tray, with the acid flow and tank vent return through closed pipework with a sightglass to observe full tanks.|$|R
50|$|The M-10 is a cantilevered, high wing, {{conventional}} landing gear-equipped {{aircraft that}} seats two in tandem. The all-wood wing {{is able to}} pivot 90 degrees for trailering or storage. The pivot works by <b>removing</b> four <b>bolts,</b> using a jack to raise the wing a few inches for pivoting, then lowering the wing again, reattaching the bolts in the same pattern. The controls are mounted overhead. The front and rear occupant each have an individual door for entry on either side.|$|R

5000|$|The group's {{activities}} have included [...] "guerrilla benching" [...] — restoring benches {{that had been}} recently <b>removed</b> and <b>bolting</b> them to the ground — organising a midnight game of cricket in {{the centre of the}} City of London financial district, and satirising the glossy architects' drawings that are displayed on the perimeter of luxury apartments by depicting children’s playgrounds and other projects they believe to be actually desirable. Many of these activities aim to bring to people's attention the role which corporations play in society in a different light.|$|R
5000|$|The restyled {{front end}} was {{engineered}} {{so that by}} <b>removing</b> 8 <b>bolts</b> the whole front panel could be completely removed, providing {{easy access to the}} engine so it could be removed from the front instead of from underneath like on the CF1. (The CF1 [...] "facelift" [...] is often confused with being a CF2 because it's difficult to tell them apart from the exterior.The easiest visual check is that the CF facelift will have the same old metallic door handles and mirrors as the CF1 while on the CF2 have new plastic ones.) ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of the breakout, Ben Hardy was manning the Number 2 Vickers machine gun when he was {{overwhelmed}} by Japanese prisoners and killed. Before he was killed, Hardy disabled the gun by <b>removing</b> the firing <b>bolt</b> and throwing it away, thus rendering the gun useless to the escaping Japanese.|$|R
40|$|An active {{diagnosis}} method using support vector {{machines and}} ultrasonic waves is presented. The {{support vector machine}} is a recently developed pattern recognition method that has some similarities with neural networks and perceptrons. It has a strong pattern recognition capability with relatively easy implementation processes. By introducing the support vector machines, a flexible and accurate damage diagnosis procedure is formulated. The procedure proposed here can be extended to an automatic diagnosis with strong learning capability. The multi-dimensional feature vectors that represent the features of damages are generated by active sensing technologies based on ultrasonic wave propagation. AE sensors were used for generating ultrasonic Lamb waves in a plate and for sensing the traveling ultrasonic waves. A set of AE sensors deployed {{in the vicinity of}} a bolted joint is utilized to obtain the inputs and outputs combinations in the time domain. The recorded time histories are converted to frequency domain data for each segment to generate feature vectors for the support vector machines. Simplified bolted joints were fabricated using aluminum plates and bolts. The frequency range of the ultrasonic wave is around 100 kHz. Several normalization methods for generating feature vectors were carefully evaluated in this study. The proposed active diagnosis method could identify the location of not only <b>removed</b> <b>bolts</b> but also slightly loosened bolts with their quantitative information...|$|R
50|$|Traditional boresighting, as {{the name}} suggests, {{involves}} <b>removing</b> the <b>bolt</b> and sighting down the bore of a gun to a fixed point. While the rifle is fixed in place, the scope or irons can then be adjusted to also aim at the distant object. A more modern method of boresighting {{is to use a}} laser rather than by visual inspection to illuminate the distant point. This method is preferable because it allows more movement in the gun, as the laser dot will not move relative to the barrel, and is a method of boresighting which does not require the removal of the bolt.|$|R
50|$|On October 17, 2006, {{one week}} after announcing a {{revenue-sharing}} deal with YouTube, Universal Music filed suit against Bolt Media and another video site, Grouper. Universal contended that both sites allowed and promoted their users to swap unlicensed music videos. Several weeks later, <b>Bolt</b> <b>removed</b> the music section from their site, without any explanation.|$|R
50|$|Unlike many rifles {{designed}} later, {{the bolt}} {{head of this}} rifle is able to be <b>removed</b> from the <b>bolt</b> body. This piece could be removed during disassembly, and was frequently lost. Additionally, both the ejector and the extractor that {{are attached to the}} bolt head are prone to falling out if care is not taken during disassembly and reassembly.|$|R
2500|$|The Hurricane was {{a wooden}} framed, fabric covered {{shoulder}} wing monoplane. [...] The wing was a two spar cantilever structure, [...] {{made possible by}} the adoption of one of the novel thick Göttingen airfoil sections. [...] It was tapered, but almost entirely on the trailing edge and with clipped wingtips. [...] Seen in plan, the wing of the Hurricane looked much a late 20th-century light aircraft. The competition rules required that aircraft could access suitable fields via a farm gate, and many met this condition with folding wings. [...] The Hurricane's designer, Samuel Childs chose instead to make its wings easily detachable after <b>removing</b> eight <b>bolts</b> per side.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 April 1829, {{a triple}} {{execution}} {{was carried out}} in front of the newly opened prison when Charles Forrester (21), John Hinton (25) and William Varnam (24) were hanged for horse stealing. In reporting the incident, the Leicester Chronicle newspaper noted that after the executioner had pulled caps over the faces of the condemned men, [...] "a short but painful suspense took place, owing to some difficulty in <b>removing</b> the <b>bolt</b> which causes the platform on which they stood, to fall". It was also noted that about half of the huge crowd that had assembled to watch the event were women and children.|$|R
50|$|In {{steam power}} plants, MJTs are used on {{boiler feed pump}} head and barrel casings, boiler circ pump main flanges, stop valves, control valves, turbine couplings, stay rods, manway doors, inlet flanges, and {{feedwater}} heaters.

50|$|At the 1952 Commercial Motor show, they {{displayed}} {{a new model}} called the Endeavour, which was a general purpose vehicle designed for a payload of 30 cwt. They also showcased two Tough Ten models, one a bare chassis, and one with a milk float body. The Endeavour had a heavy duty traction motor, which was attached to a sub-frame by Metalastic flexible mountings. A Layrub shaft delivered power to the double reduction rear axle. Helecs used a controller which was built as a removable unit, so that <b>removing</b> two <b>bolts</b> and some electrical connections allowed the whole panel to be withdrawn from the vehicle. A Layrub shaft was also used on the Tough Ten vehicles.|$|R

40|$|In March 2008, {{an adult}} male (the victim) {{sustained}} fatal injuries when the crane boom he was disassembling buckled and crushed him. The truck-mounted lattice boom crane {{belonged to the}} owner of a construction company (the owner), who was a friend of the victim. The victim was not an employee of the construction company. At the time of the incident, the victim was at the owner’s yard assisting him in disassembling the boom. The boom was 55 feet long and composed of four sections: a base (15 feet), boom extension I (20 feet), boom extension II (10 feet) and a tip with the hook (10 feet). Adjacent sections were connected with eight bolts and four connecting pins. With the pendants (hoist cables) attached to the upper end or tip of the boom, the owner and the victim lowered the boom until the tip was approximately 4 feet above the ground. According to the owner, no connecting pins were to be removed until the pendants were moved from the tip to extension II and the tip section was cantilevered. The victim started <b>removing</b> the <b>bolts</b> while the owner was disassembling the hook block assembly near the tip end. In addition to <b>removing</b> the <b>bolts,</b> the victim also removed four lower connecting pins while positioning himself under the boom: two between the tip and extension II and two between extensions I and II. As the victim drove the last pin out with a 12 -pound sledgehammer, the boom buckled and fell on him. The owner called 911 to summon paramedics who arrived within minutes. The victim was transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead...|$|R
