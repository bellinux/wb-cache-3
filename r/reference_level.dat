40|$|This study {{extends the}} {{literature}} on portfolio choice under prospect theory preferences by introducing a two-period life cycle model, where the household decides on optimal consumption and investment in a portfolio with one risk-free and one risky asset. The optimal solution depends primarily on the household’s choice of {{the present value of}} the consumption <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> relative to the present value of its endowment income. If the present value of the consumption <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> is set below the present value of endowment income, then the household behaves in such a way to avoid relative losses in consumption in any present or future state of nature (good or bad). As a result the degree of loss aversion does not directly affect optimal consumption and risk taking activity. However, it must be sufficiently high in order to rule out outcomes with relative losses. On the other hand, if the present value of the consumption <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> is set exactly equal to the present value of the endowment income, i. e., the household sets its <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> such that they are in balance with its income, then the household’s optimal consumption is the reference consumption in both periods and the household will not invest in the risky asset. Finally, if the present value of the household’s consumption <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> is set above the present value of its endowment income, then the household cannot avoid experiencing a relative loss in consumption, either now or in the future. As a result, loss aversion directly affects consumption and risky investment. <b>Reference</b> <b>levels</b> {{play a significant role in}} consumption and risk taking activity. In most cases the household will “follow the Joneses” if the <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> are set equal to the consumption levels of the Joneses.

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the determination of the}} precise location of the trigonometric points the Survey established the precise altitude of a number of fundamental benchmarks by spirit levelling over the years 1839 to 1860. This height survey was completely independent of the position survey, in contrast to modern GPS fixes which give both. The report of the levelling in Ireland had been published in 1855, and it fell to Clarke to prepare the reports for England and Scotland. For England this involved a least squares analysis for the 62 lines of primary levelling with 91 fundamental benchmarks at the end points and at points of intersection. The <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> was the height of Mean Water at Liverpool. 32 end points were connected to tidal stations and therefore the variation of mean water around the country was fixed. The benchmarking proceeded along the roads, but side lines were taken to, and over, many of the mountain top trig points, from which other trig point altitudes were measured by trigonometric levelling. The reports were published in 1861. Unlike the Principal Triangulation report no theory was included in Clarke's levelling reports.|$|E

40|$|The modern {{approach}} to the radiation protection of the patients from medical exposure is mainly {{based on the principle}} of optimization using diagnostic <b>reference</b> <b>levels.</b> Implementation of diagnostic <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> and optimization in Russian radiological practice is limited due to lack of methodology of data collection and patient dose assessment, investigation and management of abnormally high and low patient doses. Current study is focused on the justification of the diagnostic <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> concept and practical aspects of establishment of diagnostic <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> for common radiographic X-ray examinations and their use in clinical practice. It is proposed to establish diagnostic <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> as the 75 %-percentiles of X-ray unit distribution by the patient standard doses for a given X-ray examination.

2500|$|A second, {{and perhaps}} more correct, {{definition}} of [...] "compatible single sideband" [...] (CSSB) refers {{to a form of}} amplitude and phase modulation in which the carrier is transmitted along with a series of sidebands that are predominantly above or below the carrier term. [...] Since phase modulation is present in the generation of the signal, energy is removed from the carrier term and redistributed into the sideband structure similar to that which occurs in analog frequency modulation. [...] The signals feeding the phase modulator and the envelope modulator are further phase-shifted by 90° with respect to each other. [...] This places the information terms in quadrature with each other; the Hilbert transform of information to be transmitted is utilized to cause constructive addition of one sideband and cancellation of the opposite primary sideband. [...] Since phase modulation is employed, higher-order terms are also generated. [...] Several methods have been employed to reduce the impact (amplitude) of most of these higher-order terms. [...] In one system, the phase-modulated term is actually the log {{of the value of the}} carrier level plus the phase-shifted audio/information term. [...] This produces an ideal CSSB signal, where at low modulation levels only a first-order term on one side of the carrier is predominant. [...] As the modulation level is increased, the carrier level is reduced while a second-order term increases substantially in amplitude. [...] At the point of 100% envelope modulation, 6dB of power is removed from the carrier term, and the second-order term is identical in amplitude to carrier term. [...] The first-order sideband has increased in level until it is now at the same level as the formerly unmodulated carrier. [...] At the point of 100% modulation, the spectrum appears identical to a normal double-sideband AM transmission, with the center term (now the primary audio term) at a 0dB <b>reference</b> <b>level,</b> and both terms on either side of the primary sideband at −6dB. [...] The difference is that what appears to be the carrier has shifted by the audio-frequency term towards the [...] "sideband in use". [...] At levels below 100% modulation, the sideband structure appears quite asymmetric. [...] When voice is conveyed by a CSSB source of this type, low-frequency components are dominant, while higher-frequency terms are lower by as much as 20dB at 3kHz. [...] The result is that the signal occupies approximately 1/2 the normal bandwidth of a full-carrier, DSB signal. [...] There is one catch: the audio term utilized to phase-modulate the carrier is generated based on a log function that is biased by the carrier level. [...] At negative 100% modulation, the term is driven to zero (0), and the modulator becomes undefined. [...] Strict modulation control must be employed to maintain stability of the system and avoid splatter. [...] This system is of Russian origin and was described in the late 1950s. [...] It is uncertain whether it was ever deployed.|$|E
