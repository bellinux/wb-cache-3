25|$|Radioiodine (radioactive iodine-131) was {{developed}} in the early 1940s at the Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center. This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for radioiodine are failed medical therapy or surgery and where medical or surgical therapy are contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. The rationale for radioactive iodine is that it accumulates in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the total radiation being emitted by the beta (electron) particles. The most common method of iodine-131 treatment is to administer a specified amount in microcuries per gram of thyroid gland based on palpation or <b>radiodiagnostic</b> imaging of the gland over 24 hours. Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid.|$|E

40|$|<b>Radiodiagnostics</b> is a {{relatively}} young field of medicine the objective of which is imaging of anatomic structures and physiological and pathological processes {{in order to determine}} diagnoses or prognoses of diseases. For this purpose <b>radiodiagnostics</b> uses ionizing radiation with both its positive and negative effects. The effects are demonstrated also in healthy cells and healthy tissues of the human organism. A radiation protection system therefore establishes, among other things, limit doses to which individuals working with ionizing radiation may be exposed while performing their jobs. The received doses are kept under control by means of a dosimetric system. Essentially, {{there are two types of}} dosimeters: passive and active, i. e. electronic. The purpose of this thesis is to compare results from personal film dosimeters with results obtained from electronic dosimeters DMC 2000 XB made by Merlin Gerin and to determine whether electronic dosimeters are suitable for <b>radiodiagnostics</b> and whether they can replace film dosimeters. I performed the measurements at the <b>radiodiagnostics</b> ward of the hospital Nemocnice Sušice, o. p. s. X-ray assistants in the ward are routinely equipped with personal film dosimeters. In addition to their film dosimeters, they were given personal electronic dosimeters for a period of seven months. They were wearing both types of the dosimeters in compliance with the Decree issued by the State Office for Nuclear Safety (SÚJB) No. 307 / 2002 Coll., as amended, at the reference place, i. e. on the left upper part of the chest on their clothing. Measurements were conducted on five X-ray assistants and one additional personal electronic dosimeter was used to measure the natural background. I have used results from electronic personal dosimeters to evaluate the collective dose of all workers in the individual months, the total collective dose and the sum of dose equivalents in all months for the individual workers. The collective dose from dose equivalents Hp(10) was stable most of the time and in November and December it was slightly higher. This was due to a higher frequency of surgeries which required presence of an assistant with an X-ray device in the operating room. The highest sum of dose equivalents Hp(10) was found for the worker No. 1 due to his more frequent presence in the operating room. Although the X-ray workers take turns at the workplace regularly they perform their tasks at random. I can definitely exclude that the worker No. 1 was in any way different from the other workers - when it comes to radiation protection all X-ray assistants observe the same principles of radiation protection. For better understanding the thesis also includes information about working activities performed by X-ray assistants. Despite the fact that the measurements using electronic dosimeters several times indicated monthly values of personal dose equivalent Hp(10) higher than 0. 1 mSv, the evaluation of the respective film dosimeters from the same period of time indicated values lower than 0. 1 mSv or lower than 0. 05 mSv. Subsequent investigations have shown that CSOD, s. r. o. is capable of measuring values = 0. 01 mSv. The discrepancy between the measured results therefore does not come from the evaluation but from a lower sensitivity of the film dosimeter. The thesis also includes evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of both the types of personal dosimeters. Based on results of the measurements, evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of the two types of personal dosimeters and based on working activities of X-ray assistants I can conclude that the personal electronic dosimeter DMC 2000 XB made by Merlin Gerin is suitable for activities at the <b>radiodiagnostics</b> ward and that it may fully replace the film dosimeter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Male gonadal {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation may disrupt spermatogenesis, but {{its influence on}} the fecundity of couples has been rarely studied. We aimed to characterize the influence of male gonadal dose of ionizing radiation delivered during <b>radiodiagnostic</b> on the monthly probability of pregnancy. Methods We recruited {{a random sample of}} women who retrospectively described 1110 periods of unprotected intercourse beginning between 1985 and 1999 and leading either to a live birth or to no pregnancy; their duration was censored after 13 months. The male partner answered a telephone questionnaire on <b>radiodiagnostic</b> examinations. We assigned a mean gonadal dose to each type of <b>radiodiagnostic</b> examination. We defined male dose for each period of unprotected intercourse as the sum of the gonadal doses of the X-ray examinations experienced between 18 years of age and the date of discontinuation of contraception. Time to pregnancy was analysed using a discrete Cox model with random effect allowing to estimate hazard ratios of pregnancy. Results After adjustment for female factors likely to influence fecundity, {{there was no evidence of}} an association between male dose and the probability of pregnancy (test of homogeneity, p = 0. 55). When compared to couples with a male gonadal dose between 0. 01 and 0. 20 milligrays (n = 321 periods of unprotected intercourse), couples with a gonadal dose above 10 milligrays had a hazard ratio of pregnancy of 1. 44 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 73 – 2. 86, n = 31). Conclusion Our study provides no evidence of a long-term detrimental effect of male gonadal dose of ionizing radiation delivered during <b>radiodiagnostic</b> on the monthly probability of pregnancy during the year following discontinuation of contraceptive use.

40|$|The use of totally implantable venous access {{devices in}} {{radiology}} {{may be associated}} with complications such as occlusion of the system (because of the high density of some contrast), infection (if the port is not handled in aseptic conditions, using proper barrier protections), and mechanical complications due to the high-pressure administration of contrast by automatic injectors (so-called power injector), including extravasation of contrast media into the soft tissues, subintimal venous or myocardial injection, or serious damage to the device itself (breakage of the external connections, dislocation of the non-coring needle, or breakage of the catheter). The last problem - i. e., the damage of the device from a power injection - is not an unjustified fear, but a reality. A warning by the US Food and Drug Administration of July 2004 reports around 250 complications of this kind, referring to both port and central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheter systems, which occurred {{over a period of several}} years; in all cases, the damage occurred during the injection of contrast material by means of power injectors for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging procedures. Though the risk associated with the use of ports in <b>radiodiagnostics</b> is thus clear, it has been suggested that administration of the contrast material via the port may have some advantage in terms of image quality, increased comfort for the patient, and maybe more accurate reproducibility of the patient's own follow-up exams.

Also, since many cancer patients who need frequent computed tomography studies already have totally implantable systems, it would seem reasonable to try to define how and when such systems may safely be used.

Methods: The 5 F 7 GGC Nanobody was radiolabeled us-ing *I-SGMIBand, for comparison,withNe-(3 -*I-iodobenzoyl) -Lys 5 -Nα-maleimido-Gly 1 -GEEEK (*I-IB-Mal-D-GEEEK), another residualizing agent, andbydirect radioiodinationusing IODO-GEN (125 I-Nanobody) ...|$|R
