40|$|A new active LO <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> was {{introduced}} and implemented in a 2 x 2 wide band MIMO receiver. The chip was designed with STMicroelectronics 90 nm technology. The main {{advantages of the}} proposed <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> over previous works included a wide band range, high resolution and small area. The <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> {{is based on the}} dependency of the inverter propagation delay on the load capacitance. Simply, by changing the load capacitance of an inverter, a different propagation delay is generated. A number of these controllable delay cells are cascaded to provide the required phase-shift. In order for the delay cells to reduce the required amount of phase-shifting the I&Q swap circuit is introduced. The I&Q swap circuitry reduces the phase-shifting by one fourth of the original range. The wide band <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is suitable for multi-standard radios, since just one <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is needed to support all standards. This capability of the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> could potentially reduce the size of the die and simplify the design. The measurement shows that the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is able to provide 360 ˚ of phase-shifting at the output base band signal when the LO is varying from 1. 5 GHz to 6 GHz. A wider range of the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is achievable by reducing the capacitance load and increasing the number of cascaded delay cells. The proposed <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is capable of achieving a very high resolution. The resolution of the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> {{is a function of the}} inverter current capability and the load capacitance. The measurements show the average resolution of the proposed <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is about 1. 32 ps. Passive components usually take up a large area on the chip. A MOS capacitor is used as the load to reduce the area of the proposed <b>phase</b> <b>shifter.</b> A method is proposed to improve the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> stability over the temperature and process variations. This method is based on the fact that the propagation delay of an inverter is inversely proportional to the power supply. Therefore, the phase shifters’ power supply must be varied to maintain a relatively constant <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> resolution over the temperature and process variations...|$|R
