40|$|Linear time {{invariant}} (LTI) {{control design}} {{is the most}} widely applied control design technique. But it has inherent limitation. In LTI feedback control systems, high-frequency loop gain is linked to both low-frequency loop gain and stability margins through Bode 2 ̆ 7 s gain-phase relationship. This linkage results in trade-offs among competing performance specifications. Reset control design is a great candidate of improving this limitation. The basic idea <b>of</b> <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> is to <b>reset</b> the state <b>of</b> a linear controller to zero whenever its input meets a threshold. Such a reset controller is introduced in feedback control systems {{with the aim of}} providing better trade-offs between competing specifications than could be achieved using linear controllers. ^ There have been some successful experimental applications <b>of</b> <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> technique which demonstrate its benefit. However, during the past three decades, {{there is a lack of}} theoretical results for reset control systems. For example, none <b>of</b> the experimental <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> applications can provide formal proof of stability and theoretic analysis of performance. Dedicated to solving this problem, this dissertation performs theoretic analysis of the stability and performance <b>of</b> <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> systems. A complete set of theoretic results on the stability and time-domain performance are developed. These results build a solid theoretic base for the further and wider application <b>of</b> <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> system. Also, reset control design is successfully applied to the speed <b>control</b> <b>of</b> a rotational flexible mechanical system with supporting theoretic analysis. This experiment demonstrates the benefit <b>of</b> <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> design over LTI control design and the effectiveness of the theoretic results. ...|$|R

40|$|It is well-appreciated that Bode 2 ̆ 7 s gain-phase {{relationship}} {{places a}} hard limitation on performance tradeoffs in linear, time-invariant feedback control systems, Specifically, {{the need to}} minimize the open-loop high-frequency gain often competes with low-frequency loop gain and phase margin constraints. Our focus on reset control systems is motivated by recent work that showed its potential to improve this situation. ^ The basic concept in reset control is to <b>reset</b> the state <b>of</b> a linear controller to zero whenever its input meets a threshold. Typical reset controllers include the so-called Clegg integrator and the first-order reset element. The Clegg integrator has a describing function similar to the frequency response of a linear integrator but with only 38. 1 ° phase lag. This was the original motivation. ^ Reset control is a hybrid control scheme. It resembles a number <b>of</b> popular non-linear <b>control</b> strategies including relay control, sliding-mode control and switching control. A common feature to these {{is the use of}} a switching surface to trigger change in control signal. Distinctively, reset control employs the same (linear) control law {{on both sides of the}} switching surface. Resetting occurs when the system trajectory impacts this surface. The reset action renders a discontinuity (a jump) in the system trajectory. This behavior is not invertible. The reset action can be alternatively viewed as the injection of judiciously-timed impulses of state-dependent magnitude into an otherwise linear, time-invariant feedback system. ^ In this dissertation we analyze stability and steady-state performance <b>of</b> <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> systems. First, we provide an example <b>of</b> <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> overcoming a limitation of linear feedback. Secondly, we present our main stability results: a necessary and sufficient condition for quadratic stability that under a certain assumption on reset controller dynamics implies uniform bounded-input bounded-state stability. We show that this condition is satisfied for a large and important class <b>of</b> <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> systems. We also introduce a passivity-based approach to stability. Next, we give our steady-state performance results. In doing this, we establish internal model and superposition principles, existence and local stability of periodic solutions due to sinusoidal sensor noise excitation. Finally, we suggest future research directions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{timing of}} {{ovulation}} {{is critically important}} {{to the success of}} reproduction. Current thinking attributes the timing of ovulation to LH secretion by the pituitary, itself timed by signals from the hypothalamus. The discovery of an internal circadian timer in the ovary raises the possibility that ovulation is in fact timed by an interaction between clocks in the hypothalamus/pituitary and those in the ovary. We asked whether ovarian clocks were influenced by signals from the brain and pituitary. Ovaries of Period 1 -luciferase transgenic rats display circadian rhythms in vitro. To determine whether the phase of these rhythms is set by neural or endocrine signals, we surgically denervated or heterotopically transplanted ovaries with or without encapsulation in dialysis membranes. Animals’ light-dark cycles were phase advanced or delayed 6 h, and the <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> the ovarian clock was tracked by culturing ovaries at intervals over the next 12 d. <b>Resetting</b> trajectories <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> surgically denervated, and encapsulated ovaries were similar, demonstrating that endocrine signals are sufficient to transmit phase information to the ovary. We next evaluated LH and FSH as potential endocrine signals. Using the phase of Per 1 -luc expression in granulosa cell cultures, we demonstrated that both of these pituitary hormones caused large phase shifts when applied to the cultured cells. We hypothesize that the ovarian circadian clock is entrained by hormonal signals from the pituitary and that ovulation depends, in part, on the phase in the ovarian circadian cycle at which these signals occur...|$|R

One cause {{of this is a}} persistent reduction in nutrient intake, suggesting an abnormality of appetite regulation. Methods We used a novel technique to describe the appetite profile in 46 haemodialysis (HD) patients and 40 healthy controls. The Electronic Appetite Rating System (EARS) employs a palmtop computer to collect hourly ratings of motivation to eat and mood. We collected data on hunger, desire to eat, fullness, and tiredness. HD subjects were monitored on the dialysis day and the interdialytic day. Controls were monitored for 1 or 2 days. Results Temporal profiles of motivation to eat for the controls were similar on both days. Temporal profiles of motivation to eat for the HD group were lower on the dialysis day. Mean HD scores were not significantly different from controls. Dietary records indicated that dialysis patients consumed less food than controls. Conclusions Our data indicate that the EARS can be used to monitor subjective appetite states continuously in a group of HD patients. A HD session reduces hunger and desire to eat. Patients feel more tired after dialysis. This does not correlate with their hunger score, but does correlate with their fullness rating. Nutrient intake is reduced, suggesting a <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> appetite <b>control</b> for the HD group. The EARS may be useful for intervention studies...|$|R

30|$|On {{antipyretic}} activity the plant extract significantly inhibited DNP induced pyrexia {{at both the}} concentrations. In generally, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exhibit their antipyretic effect through inhibiting the production of prostaglandins specifically prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in the hypothalamus [48]. Thus {{it may be assumed}} that the plant extract may have functioned as a cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) antagonist through the inhibition of PGE 2 production in the hypothalamus or by the enhancement of body’s own antipyretic substances such as vasopressin and arginine production [29, 48]. Furthermore, the extract could have also been mediated its hypothermic activity by vasodilatation of superficial blood vessels resulting in increased dissipation <b>of</b> heat following <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> hypothalamic temperature <b>control</b> center [49].

40|$|The {{relationship}} between effective blood volume and related hormones in burn patients following resuscitation {{is not well}} understood. Previous reports have suggested that hormone secretion is altered by a <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> neural <b>control</b> mechanisms. Serum and urine sodium, plasma renin activity, serum ADH, cardiac index, effective renal plasma flow, and total blood volume were measured in seven burn patients (mean age, total burn size, and postburn day: 32 years, 56 %, and 9 days, respectively). The same values (with the exception of cardiac index and blood volume) were measured in 10 control patients (mean age, 24 years). The blood volume of patients was measured by 51 chromium red blood cell (RBC) labeling and compared to normal predicted values based on body surface area and sex. Mean serum sodium and osmolality were 138 mmol/L (millimolar) and 286 mosm/kg, respectively, in both patients and control subjects. Mean +/- standard error of the mean total blood volume in the patients was low, 81 % +/- 4 % of predicted values. Cardiac index and renal plasma flow were significantly elevated. Plasma renin activity and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels were elevated and altered in the direction expected from blood volume measurements despite the findings of increased blood flow. Dissociation of organ flow and hormonal response suggests that simultaneous direct blood volume measurements are necessary to elucidate factors other than altered neural control settings to explain hormonal changes in the flow phase of injury. Depressed total blood volume appears to promote elevated ADH levels in burn patients following resuscitation. Whether there is an additional role <b>of</b> altered neural <b>control</b> settings remains to be established...|$|R
40|$|We have {{generated}} a transgenic model consisting {{of both the}} human renin and human angiotensinogen genes to study further {{the role played by}} the renin-angiotensin system in regulating arterial pressure. Transgenic mice containing either gene alone were normotensive, whereas mice containing both genes were chronically hypertensive. Plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II levels were both markedly elevated in the double transgenic mice compared with either single transgenic or nontransgenic controls. The elevation in blood pressure caused by the human transgenes was independent of the genotype at the endogenous renin locus and was equal in mice homozygous for the Ren- 1 c allele or in mice containing one copy each of Ren- 1 c, Ren- 1 d, or Ren- 2. Chronic overproduction of angiotensin II in the double transgenic mice resulted in a <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> the baroreflex <b>control</b> <b>of</b> heart rate to a higher pressure without significantly changing the gain or sensitivity of the reflex. Moreover, this change was not due to the effects of elevated pressure itself since angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition had minimal effects on the baroreflex in spontaneously hypertensive BPH- 2 control mice, which exhibit non-renin-dependent hypertension. This double transgenic model should provide an excellent tool for further studies on the mechanisms of hypertension initiated by the renin-angiotensin system...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} {{whether there was a}} <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> the baroreflex <b>control</b> <b>of</b> renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and heart rate (HR) during exercise. Wistar female rats (n = 11) were chronically implanted with catheters for the measurement of systemic arterial (Pa) and central venous pressures and with electrodes for measurement of RSNA and electrocardiogram (ECG) at least 3 days before study. The baroreflex curve for RSNA was determined by changing Pa using rapid intravenous infusions of phenylephrine and nitroprusside. The baroreflex response curves for RSNA and HR were characterized by an inverse sigmoid function curve from which the response range, gain, centring point and minimum response were estimated. Exercise shifted the Pa-RSNA baroreflex curve upward and to the right and was associated with increases in response range of 122 ± 44 % (P < 0. 05), maximum response of 173 ± 40 % (P < 0. 05), maximum gain of 149 ± 66 % (P < 0. 05) and midpoint pressure of 15 ± 5 mmHg (P < 0. 05) compared with the pre-exercise level. After cessation of exercise, the Pa-RSNA baroreflex curve was suppressed vertically with a significant decrease in maximum response of 57 ± 14 % (P < 0. 05) compared with the pre-exercise level.

40|$|Different {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward {{during the last decade}} to explain the functional meaning of sleep and dreaming in humans. In the present paper, a new theory is presented which, while taking advantage of these earlier theories, introduces the following new and original aspects: Circadian rhythms relevant to various organs of the body affect the reciprocal interactions which operate to maintain constancy of the internal milieu and thereby also affect the sleep/wakefulness cycle. Particular attention is given to the constancy of natraemia and osmolarity and to the permissive role that the evolution of renal function has had for the evolution of the central nervous system and its integrative actions. The <b>resetting</b> <b>of</b> neuro-endocrine <b>controls</b> at the onset of wakefulness leads to the acquisition of new information and its integration within previously stored memories. This point is dealt with in relation to Moore-Ede's proposal for the existence of a 'predictive homeostasis'.

Sleep and dreaming in humans are discussed as important functions for the maintenance of a newly proposed composite state: that of 'predictive psychic homeostasis'. On the basis of these assumptions, and in accordance with the available neurobiological data, the present paper puts forward the novel hypothesis that sleep and dreaming play important functions in humans by compensating for psychic allostatic overloads. Hence, both consolatory dreams and disturbing nightmares can be part of the vis medicatrix naturae, the natural healing power, in this case, the state of eudemonia...|$|R

Nine subjects performed 4 min of ischaemic isometric calf exercise at 20 % of maximum voluntary contraction. Trials were repeated with β 1 -adrenergic blockade (metoprolol, 0. 15 ± 0. 003 mg kg− 1) or parasympathetic blockade (glycopyrrolate, 13. 6 ± 1. 5 μg kg− 1). CBR function was determined using rapid pulses of neck pressure and neck suction from + 40 to − 80 mmHg, while heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and changes in stroke volume (SV, Modelflow method) were measured. Metoprolol decreased and glycopyrrolate increased HR and cardiac output both at rest and during exercise (P < 0. 05), while resting and exercising blood pressure were unchanged. Glycopyrrolate reduced the maximal gain (Gmax) of the CBR-HR function curve (− 0. 58 ± 0. 10 to − 0. 06 ± 0. 01 beats min− 1 mmHg− 1, P < 0. 05), but had no effect on the Gmax of the CBR-MAP function curve. During isometric exercise the CBR-HR curve was shifted upward and rightward in the metoprolol and no drug conditions, while the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> HR was significantly attenuated with glycopyrrolate (P < 0. 05).
