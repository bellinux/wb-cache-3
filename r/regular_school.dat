5|$|The {{school was}} still {{operating}} in 1937, though a public request {{had been made}} for regular transport to take children to the Hagley District School, in consequence of the Hadspen school's impending closure. Children from the town began attending the Hagley school in March 1938. By {{the middle of the}} same year a tender was approved by the Minister of Education for <b>regular</b> <b>school</b> transport. The transport was also for students from nearby Carrick., whose school closed in the 1930s. The school building was finally removed; a tender in 1944 called for it to be removed and re-erected at Falmouth. Schools have also been run in other town buildings, including a hall near the Anglican church, that was used for worship before the church's completion, in what is now the Uniting Church and also in another building that later became a private home. In the 21st century there are no schools remaining in Hadspen.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Monds was {{instrumental}} in formation of the first school. This private school was built in 1843, though Thomas Reibey converted it into St Andrews church in 1845, and the school moved elsewhere in the town. A Government school was built in 1873, next to the current recreation ground, and both schools were open as of 1883. The private school closed late in the 19th Century, but the Government school still had 65 students on the 1901 roll. The latter was a weatherboard building. It was extensively renovated in 1920 and was in use until the mid-1930s when the last school in Carrick closed. The building was relocated to nearby Hagley in 1938, though it was later demolished. In the same year the government began funding <b>regular</b> <b>school</b> transport from Carrick to the school at nearby Hagley, accompanying children from Hadspen whose school had also been closed. Since that time {{there has been no}} school in Carrick and a 1976 planning report stated the population was likely to remain insufficient to require one.|$|E
5|$|On the {{national}} level, sanctions and suspension of donor aid amounting to 50 percent of {{the national}} budget and 70 percent of public investments obstructed the Rajoelina administration's management of state affairs and its ability to systematically combat poverty on a wider scale. A United Nations envoy concluded in 2011 that Rajoelina's controversial accession to the presidency had reduced food security, with Madagascar ranking among the worst in the world for child nutrition. The frequent non-payment of civil servant and military salaries resulted in <b>regular</b> <b>school</b> and hospital closures, general strikes and widespread increases in corruption. Crime and insecurity grew dramatically, with a sharp upswing in violent crime and theft in Antananarivo and increasingly frequent and deadly incidences of armed cattle rustling in the central southern region of the island. Key development indicators steeply declined between 2009 and 2013, including maternal and child mortality, education enrollment and completion, per capita income and employment rates. In 2010 the United Nations ranked Madagascar among the ten poorest countries in the world, noting that economic gains made under Ravalomanana had been lost following Rajoelina's unconstitutional rise to power. In 2011, Forbes magazine ranked Madagascar as the worst economy in the world, faulting its political instability and poor governance.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} 419 Kentucky <b>regular</b> public <b>schools</b> was {{conducted}} to investigate how special education services are presently delivered to children with disabilities {{in the context of}} the statewide educational reform movement.

Results found that approximately 80 percent of the schools practice inclusion, and 20 percent apply full inclusion. The survey also found that lack of special instructional materials and supplementary aides in regular classrooms are problems in many Kentucky <b>regular,</b> <b>schools.</b> Teachers were not adequately prepared to work in inclusive settings, and special and regular education teachers do not know their roles in full inclusion. Both rural and urban <b>regular</b> <b>schools</b> faced these problems. (Contains 41 references.)
