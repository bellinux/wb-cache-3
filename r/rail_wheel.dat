60|$|Turning a corner, and not noting an {{overhead}} arrangement of greased <b>rail,</b> <b>wheel,</b> and pulley, I {{ran into the}} arms of four eviscerated carcasses, all pure white and of a human aspect, pushed by a man clad in vehement red. When I leaped aside, the floor was slippery under me. Also there was a flavor of farm-yard in my nostrils and the shouting of a multitude in my ears. But there was no joy in that shouting. Twelve men stood in two lines six a side. Between them and overhead ran the railway of death that had nearly shunted me through the window. Each man carried a knife, the sleeves of his shirt were cut off at the elbows, and from bosom to heel he was blood-red.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went off}} to see cattle killed by way of {{clearing}} my head, which, as you will perceive, was getting muddled. They say every Englishman goes to the Chicago stockyards. You shall find them about six miles from the city; and once having seen them {{will never forget the}} sight. As {{far as the eye can}} reach stretches a township of cattle-pens, cunningly divided into blocks so that the animals of any pen can be speedily driven out close to an inclined timber path which leads to an elevated covered way straddling high above the pens. These viaducts are two-storied. On the upper storey tramp the doomed cattle, stolidly for the most part. On the lower, with a scuffling of sharp hooves and multitudinous yells, run the pigs. The same end is appointed for each. Thus you will see the gangs of cattle waiting their turn--as they wait sometimes for days; and they need not be distressed by the sight of their fellows running about in the fear of death. All they know is that a man on horseback causes their next-door neighbours to move by means of a whip. Certain bars and fences are unshipped, and, behold, that crowd have gone up the mouth of a sloping tunnel and return no more. It is different with the pigs. They shriek back the news of the exodus to their friends, and a hundred pens skirl responsive. It was to the pigs I first addressed myself. Selecting a viaduct which was full of them, as I could hear though I could not see, I marked a sombre building whereto it ran, and went there, not unalarmed by stray cattle who had managed to escape from their proper quarters. A pleasant smell of brine warned me of what was coming. I entered the factory and found it full of pork in barrels, and on another storey more pork unbarrelled, and in a huge room, the halves of swine for whose use great lumps of ice were being pitched in at the window. That room was the mortuary chamber where the pigs lie for a little while in state ere they begin their progress through such passages as kings may sometimes travel. Turning a corner and not noting an overhead arrangement of greased <b>rail,</b> <b>wheel,</b> and pulley, I ran into the arms of four eviscerated carcasses, all pure white and of a human aspect, being pushed by a man clad in vehement red. When I leaped aside, the floor was slippery under me. There was a flavour of farmyard in my nostrils and the shouting of a multitude in my ears. But there was no joy in that shouting! Twelve men stood in two lines--six a-side. Between them and overhead ran the railway of death that had nearly shunted me through the window. Each man carried a knife, the sleeves of his shirt were cut off at the elbows, and from bosom to heel he was blood-red. The atmosphere was stifling as a night in the Rains, by reason of the steam and the crowd. I climbed to the beginning of things and, perched upon a narrow beam, overlooked very nearly all the pigs ever bred in Wisconsin. They had just been shot out of the mouth of the viaduct and huddled together in a large pen. Thence they were flicked persuasively, a few at a time, into a smaller chamber, and there a man fixed tackle on their hinder legs so that they rose in the air suspended from the railway of death. Oh! it was then they shrieked and called on their mothers and made promises of amendment till the tackle-man punted them in their backs, and they slid head down into a brick-floored passage, very like a big kitchen sink that was blood-red. There awaited them a red man with a knife which he passed jauntily through their throats, and the full-voiced shriek became a sputter, and then a fall as of heavy tropical rain. The red man who was backed against the passage wall stood clear of the wildly kicking hoofs and passed his hand over his eyes, not from any feeling of compassion, but because the spurted blood was in his eyes, and he had barely time to stick the next arrival. Then that first stuck swine dropped, still kicking, into a great vat of boiling water, and spoke no more words, but wallowed in obedience to some unseen machinery, and presently came forth at the lower end of the vat and was heaved on the blades of a blunt paddle-wheel-thing which said, [...] "Hough! Hough! Hough!" [...] and skelped all the hair off him except what little a couple of men with knives could remove. Then he was again hitched by the heels to that said railway and passed down the line of the twelve men--each man with a knife--leaving with each man a certain amount of his individuality which was taken away in a wheel-barrow, and when he reached the last man he was very beautiful to behold, but immensely unstuffed and limp. Preponderance of individuality was ever a bar to foreign travel. That pig could have been in no case to visit you in India had he not parted with some of his most cherished notions.|$|E

30|$|The {{interaction}} of the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel</b> and the resulting phenomena such as wear and noise are considered as very important issues in railway transportation which allocates considerable research activities in advanced railways in the world yearly since the inappropriate {{interaction of}} the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel</b> has always brought about costly items such as extreme structure of the instruments and fractures of pavement and road bed of the lines and also automotive transportation and most importantly causes irreparable accidents. By analyzing the repair and maintenance railway costs worldwide, we found that a huge expedition {{is done in the}} field of purchase, change and installation of the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel</b> in the railway industry every year [5, 6]. The wheel has a special geometric form, and the geometric incompatibility of a wheel’s profile with the geometric characteristics of the rail line could have negative circumstances such as extreme wear of the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel</b> and dynamic instability of the railway transportation appliance, since the stability of the railway appliance and the passengers comfort is dependent on the wear of the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel</b> [7]. Thus, it could be inferred that the compatibility of the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel’s</b> profile is the most vital factor in controlling the wear. The rolling contact of the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel</b> will cause wearing of the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel</b> profile and in return there will be phenomena such as negative effects in dynamic function of the train and comfort in traveling, the possibility of emersion from the line, permanent misshapes, reduction in the wheel longevity, reduction in security, reduction in the repairing period of the line and, as a result, a reduction in efficiency and an increase in costs [8]. Recognition and reduction in the mentioned phenomena require sufficient knowledge of the <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear. Due to the solidity of the contact surfaces of the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel,</b> small contact area and the heavy weight applied in railway cars, there is high stress that would lead to phenomena such as wear and fatigue of the <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
