50|$|The first XV-3 (serial number 54-147) flew on 11 August 1955 with Bell Chief Test Pilot Floyd Carlson at the controls. On 18 August 1955, the {{aircraft}} experienced a hard landing when the rotor developed dynamic instability. Bell attempted {{to remedy the}} situation, and flight testing resumed on 29 March 1956 after additional ground runs. Bell continued to expand the flight envelope of the XV-3, but on 25 July 1956, the same rotor instability occurred again. Flight testing of the XV-3 resumed in late September 1956. Then, on 25 October 1956, {{the aircraft}} crashed when the test pilot blacked out due to extremely high cockpit vibrations.

50|$|On 5 January 1956, {{the second}} YH-16 test {{aircraft}} crashed while returning to Philadelphia from a test flight over New Jersey. The {{cause of the}} crash was later determined to be the aft slip ring, which carried flight data from the instrumented rotor blades to the data recorders in the cabin. The slip ring bearings seized, and the resultant torque load severed the instrumentation standpipe inside the aft <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft.</b> A segment of this steel standpipe tilted over and {{came into contact with}} the interior of the aluminum <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft,</b> scribing a deepening groove into it.

5000|$|The Abeille had a pod and boom, {{all-metal}} fuselage. The {{nose was}} fully glazed with two {{side by side}} crew seats ahead of a cabin with a bench seat for three passengers. The engine and gearboxes were behind them. [...] Aft, a high mounted boom carried the empennage, which on the first prototype consisted of a tall T-tail with a narrow fin. On the second machine the tailplane was lowered {{to the top of}} the fuselage and had a pair of fins at its extremities, each roughly elliptical and mounted from its top. The tails was wooden, with fabric covered. The Abeille's fixed main landing gear had two wheels on a single axle positioned a little behind the <b>rotor</b> <b>shafts</b> and mounted on broad, single struts to the mid-upper fuselage, together with a smaller nose wheel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the Abeille was {{directed}} by René Dorand at the helicopter division of SNCAC. An intermeshing rotor layout was chosen instead of a tail rotor design, following the examples of the 1939 Flettner Fl 265 and the Kellet XR-8 of 1944. Its twin, two blade rotors were driven by shafts which leaned out of the fuselage side-by-side. The rotor blades, which began some way from the hub, tapered strongly. Pitch and roll were adjusted from the control column by altering cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors with the pedals. Forward tilt of the <b>rotor</b> <b>shafts</b> was automatically linked to forward speed. A single lever controlled both the collective pitch and the throttle through an electrical link. The Abeille was powered by a [...] Renault 12S, an inverted, liquid-cooled V-12 engine.|$|E

30|$|Rotating {{electrical}} machinery, such as synchronous turbogenerators, {{synchronous machine}} (SM), and induction machine (IM) loads will {{all contribute to}} system inertia.

In the IM case, the <b>rotor</b> <b>shaft</b> is coupled to the stator field asynchronously depending on the slip. Conversely, variable-speed wind turbines do not contribute toward system inertia.

50|$|Data can be {{acquired}} from the specially designed {{hardware and software}} for the simulator. The purpose of this experiment should be to examine the spectra due to misalignment between the motor and the <b>rotor</b> <b>shafts.</b> Spectral comparisons should be made across coupling measurement points on left bearing housing and the motor. The data should be compared in both vertical and axial direction. If the results at 960 and 2100 RPM do not show significant vibration, the study can be limited to a higher speeds of 2900 and 3800 RPM. A correlation between misalignment and vibration signature could not be discerned. The data for all cases contained several harmonics. Both axial and lateral vibration was present in all cases. The dominant harmonic varied from condition to condition. As a general rule, as expected, increased misalignment yielded increased vibration peaks.As another general rule, peak vibrations in the misaligned machine were in the axial direction. For predictive maintenance applications where the goal is machinery health monitoring, it is sufficient {{to realize that the}} problem is complex. One can routinely trend the vibration spectra until it becomes severe. But for root cause analysis, one must exercise caution and perform a detailed analysis. Obviously, the rules provided in training courses and wall charts are doubtful at best.The observed changes that occurred with shifts of speed and misalignment do not show a typical signature for misalignment vibration spectra. Hence, it can be concluded that misalignment vibration is a strong function of machine speed and coupling stiffness. A single point vibration spectrum does not provide good and reliable indication of machinery misalignment. Observations of spectra in axial and radial directions at various speeds and several points are needed to diagnose misalignment effects. Orbital plots of vertical and horizontal measurements in the time domain might also be needed. Non-linear dynamic modelling must be performed to gain full understanding of misalignment effects. Finally, more work in this field is simply needed in order to develop simple rules for diagnosing machinery shaft misalignment.|$|E

40|$|On {{one hand}} <b>rotor</b> <b>shafts</b> of wind {{turbines}} {{seem to be}} larger and heavier than they need to be, {{due to a lack}} of empirical data from full scale fatigue testing and a compensation through safety factors. On the other hand wear mechanisms at the contact region between the rotor shaft and the shrink fitted inner ring of the main bearing can be observed. These wear mechanisms are also known from other industries. Shear stresses in the contact region that result from the rotating bending moment at the rotor shaft eventually overcome the frictional connection and lead to a relative motion between rotor shaft and inner ring. These relative motions can cause surface deterioration and thus a degradation of the fatigue strength of the component. The components life span, estimated by common life time assessment methods, will decrease unnoticed. To investigate both the fatigue behavior of the whole component and wear mechanisms a full scale fatigue test has to be carried out.

An analysis of the influence of steady torsion loading on fatigue crack growth rates under rotating of reversed bending is presented. Tests were carried out on cylindrical specimens in DIN Ck 45 steel and results are compared for two different testing conditions: rotating bending and reversed bending, simulating the real conditions on power <b>rotor</b> <b>shafts.</b> The growth and shape evolution of semi-elliptical surface cracks were measured for several Mode III/Mode I ratios.

Stress Intensity Factors K_I were compared with available literature results in order to validate the proposed model. Experimental results have shown that the steady Mode III loading superimposed to the cyclic Model I leads to a significant reduction on the crack growth rates.
