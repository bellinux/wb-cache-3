The thermal stability of the <b>rice</b> <b>husks</b> was examined by using a thermal gravimetric analysis instrument.

The thermal stability and final degradation temperatures of the alkali-treated <b>rice</b> <b>husks</b> were also lowered by 24 - 26 °C due to degradation of hemicellulose and lignin during alkali treatment. Absence of the onset degradation zones in the alkali-treated <b>rice</b> <b>husks</b> was a further indication that hemicellulose and other volatile substances degraded during alkali treatment.
