5|$|On 13 December, the 6th Panzer Division {{made contact}} with the Soviet 5th Tank Army, which was engaged in the {{reduction}} of German defenses around the Chir River. German forces were able to engage and defeat Soviet armor, as the former forced the crossing of the Alksay River. At this point, a major armored battle began around the village of Verkhne-Kumskiy. Although they sustained heavy losses, the Soviet forces were able to push German forces back to {{the banks of the}} Alksay River {{by the end of the}} day, while failing to retake the town. However, the losses sustained by the Red Army in the vicinity of Verkhne-Kumskiy allowed the 6th Panzer Division to enjoy a brief superiority in tank numbers thereafter. Fighting for Verkhne-Kumskiy continued for three days, as the Red Army launched a series of counterattacks against the German bridgeheads across the Alksay River and German defenders in the town. German defenders were able to pin Soviet tanks in Verkhne-Kumskiy and destroy them using well emplaced anti-tank artillery guns. With heavy support from the Luftwaffe, the Germans were able to achieve a local success and began to push toward the Myshkova river. The 6th Panzer Division took heavy losses during its drive, and took a brief respite after the battle to <b>recondition.</b> Minor damage to surviving tanks was repaired and the majority of the tanks incapacitated during the fighting at Verkhne-Kumskiy were brought back to serviceable conditions.|$|E

25|$|In early 1941, at {{the height}} of the Battle of the Atlantic, the Irish {{government}} decided to establish its own neutral merchant marine. The government purchased three secondhand freighters for the purpose, Leda, a 4,100 ton vessel, and two ships owned by the U.S. Maritime Commission (the successor to the USSB), West Neris and West Gotomska. The two U.S. ships underwent a thorough <b>recondition</b> for the sale, and were slated for carrying a cargo of wheat gifted to Ireland by the U.S. government after an Irish crop failure. However, after Leda temporarily went missing on her maiden voyage under the Irish flag, the sale of West Gotomska appears to have been cancelled, as the ship remained under U.S. ownership.|$|E
25|$|Grooming {{attachments}} – Attachments {{for large}} groomers include: a front blade, a tiller, a renovator and track setter. The leading front blade repositions snow {{in front of}} the machine for trailing equipment to <b>recondition.</b> The renovator digs into the snow pack to aerate and mix the old and new snow up to 30cm deep, as needed. The tiller attached behind the machine conditions the snow into aa soft, granular consistency, ready for its comb, which packs the snow into a finished surface. For setting classic tracks, the groomer trails special pans, which mould the tracks. Attachments for snowmobiles perform the same functions at a smaller scale and include a roller to compact the snow over a wide swath and a drag to level the snow behind the roller.|$|E
25|$|In {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} his see, Ghenadie was appointed a lifetime Starets of his place of exile, with a special law passed in 1909. He took an active part in restoring and refurbishing the monastery complex, which had been heavily damaged by time, and intervened on sites outside his jurisdiction. Early on, in 1904, he intervened at Zamfira Monastery, where he demanded that the murals done by painter Nicolae Grigorescu be covered up with tempera artwork—his order was obeyed, and the result {{remains one of the most}} controversial acts. Some have described it as virtually an act of vandalism, and, 50 years later, the process was reverted on church orders. Ghenadie requested, and received, King Carol's patronage for the Căldărușani restoration works (begun in 1908), and hired artist D. Belizarie to <b>recondition</b> its archaic murals. In 1915, he personally oversaw the festive reopening of Căldărușani Church.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, a pilot bicycle share project {{known as}} the Orange Bike Project was {{organised}} in Tucson, Arizona by Bootstraps to Share, a homeless advocacy organisation inspired by the Bikes Not Bombs movement. Using funds from a taxpayer-funded government grant to obtain, <b>recondition,</b> and maintain 30 bicycles, project organisers announced plans to station the bicycles in downtown Tucson and areas adjacent to the University of Arizona. The publicly shared bicycles, painted bright orange by Earl Scheib to identify them, were primarily intended {{for use by the}} homeless or those without means of affordable transportation. The initial 30 bicycles placed into service for the Orange Bike Project were all stolen within a few weeks. A total of 80 bicycles were eventually used in the Orange Bike Project, all of which were either stolen or vandalised beyond repair. In one case, an Orange Bike Project bicycle was thrown in front of a freight train, in others, bikes were found with major frame damage consistent with deliberate vandalism.

40|$|Six (6) {{geostationary}} spacecraft, {{manufactured by}} RCA Astro, are presently operating in orbit. All of their batteries are performing well. They all contain unique battery <b>reconditioning</b> circuitry, permitting individual cell <b>reconditioning</b> to practically zero volts without {{the danger of}} cell reversal. This <b>reconditioning</b> is performed just prior to start of each eclipse season. This technique has maintained the battery's end-of-discharge voltage with mission life. The oldest operating RCA Astro geostationary spacecraft, Satcom F 1 and F 2, have now completed almost 7 and 6 - 3 / 4 years in orbit, respectively. Their battery performance, reported herein, show that a major milestone in the mission longevity of nickel-cadmium batteries has heen achieved.

40|$|Abstract: Automobile Industry is {{the largest}} {{industry}} in the world. Automotive engines need to be <b>reconditioned</b> after certain running. The frictional torque of a half engine (which consists of cylinder block, pistons with rings and gudgeon pins, connecting rods, crankshaft and bearings) is about 75 % to 80 % of the total frictional torque of that engine. The components of new engines are manufactured with high degree of automation and accuracy but the same is not available during their <b>reconditioning.</b> Obviously, due to difference in accuracy of CNC machines and GPMs, a newly manufactured half engine has comparatively less frictional torque than a <b>reconditioned</b> one.

2500|$|Before {{and during}} the early 19th century, much of {{continental}} European agriculture was underdeveloped compared to Asian Cores and England.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{reasons for}} {{and benefits of}} <b>reconditioning</b> nickel-hydrogen (NiH 2) batteries used for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) applications. NiH 2 battery cells {{do not have the}} classic discharge voltage problems more commonly associated with nickel-cadmium (NiCd) cells. This is due, in part, to use of hydrogen electrodes in place of cadmium electrodes. The nickel electrode, however, does have a similar discharge voltage signature for both cell designs. This can have an impact on LEO applications where peak loads at higher relative depths of discharge can impact operations. Periodic <b>reconditioning</b> provides information which can be used for analyzing long term performance trends to predict usable capacity to a specified voltage level. The <b>reconditioning</b> process described herein involves discharging NiH 2 batteries at C/ 20 rates or less, to an average cell voltage of 1. 0 volts or less. Recharge is performed at nominal C/ 5 rates to specified voltage/temperature (V/T) charge levels selected to restore required capacity with minimal overcharge. <b>Reconditioning</b> is a process of restoring reserve capacity lost on cycling, which is commonly called the memory effect in NiCd cells. This effect is characterized by decreases in the discharge voltage curve with operational life and cycling. The end effect of <b>reconditioning</b> NiH 2 cells may be hidden in the versatility, of that design over the NiCd cell design and its associated negative electrode fading problem. The process of deep discharge at lower rates by way of <b>reconditioning</b> tends to redistribute electrolyte and water in the NiH 2 cell electrode stack, while improving utilization and charge efficiency. NiH 2 battery <b>reconditioning</b> effects on life are considered beneficial and may, in fact. extend life based on NiCd experience. In any case, usable capacity data obtained from <b>reconditioning</b> is required for performance evaluation and trend analysis. Characterization and life tests have provided the historical data base used to determine the need for <b>reconditioning</b> in most battery applications. The following sections briefly describe the background of NiH 2 battery <b>reconditioning</b> and testing at Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space (LMMS) and other aerospace companies...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this work was to profile the storage {{behavior}} of choice potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars introduced, cultivated and processed, primarily into crisps, by the local industry in Cyprus. Their cold chipping performance with respect to storage temperature and their potential for <b>reconditioning</b> to acceptable processing quality following long-term cold storage were profiled and evaluated, as an alternative to conventional chemical sprout control. Tuber sugar accumulation patterns, chipping performance, sprouting behavior and tuber fresh weight loss (FWL) were defined and their relations examined. Hypothetical interference of potato crop nitrogen (N) fertilization on cold storage behavior and <b>reconditioning</b> potential was tested. Finally, the application of hot water treatment (HWT) was assessed as a means for improving the effectiveness of <b>reconditioning.</b> Fry color (FCL) demonstrated a highly significant correlation with RS but not with sucrose. A sharp rise in RS content ensued within the first 30 days of storage irrespective of cultivar and temperature. Sprout growth (SG) and FWL did not correlate significantly with FCL. Accumulation patterns throughout cold storage suggest sucrose may function mainly as a transient balance in the starch breakdown process but not as a main repository commanding RS formation. FCL was commercially substandard at 4. 5 °C, acceptable at 8. 5 °C and improved further at 11 °C. Cultivar Hermes demonstrated the most prolonged dormancy and lowest SG and FWL under all storage temperatures. Throughout storage, RS were lowest and FCL superior in cultivars Hermes and Lady Rosetta. <b>Reconditioning</b> improved FCL and reduced RS and sucrose levels in all cultivars but it also induced rapid sprouting and pronounced FWL. The first 15 days of <b>reconditioning</b> were most effective in depleting RS and sucrose and improving FCL. Both FCL and RS following <b>reconditioning</b> were significantly affected by year but cultivar ranking remained unaltered. The levels of RS and FCL but not sucrose during the first 30 days of cold storage might constitute a reliable comparative index of cultivars' <b>reconditioning</b> potential as high RS-accumulating and poor chipping cultivars exhibit inadequate response to <b>reconditioning.</b> Acceptable FCL was attained after 15 days of <b>reconditioning</b> Hermes and 30 days for Lady Rosetta, which incurred excessive FWL, while Diamant and Spunta remained substandard. At harvest, FCL, sucrose and RS content where unaffected by N rate. FCL remained unaffected by N rate during cold storage and <b>reconditioning.</b> N rate did not affect RS during storage and while its effect on sucrose appeared significant, differentiation between N rates was very limited and of no practical importance. During <b>reconditioning</b> both RS and sucrose incurred a marginal and practically insignificant N rate effect. N rate did not affect FWL and SG either during cold storage or <b>reconditioning.</b> Mediterranean climatic conditions which allow for physiological senescence of spring potato crop seem to mitigate the potential interference of preplanting N fertilization with tuber maturation, sugar content and processing quality. When HWT were applied to tubers following cold storage and prior to <b>reconditioning</b> it was demonstrated that for achieving complete inhibition of sprouting the thermal tolerance threshold of the tubers need be exceeded. However, brief HWT were effective in retarding SG and lowering FWL without inflicting thermal damage, or affecting tuber sugar content and processing quality. Prolonged HWT caused extensive thermal damage, loss of membrane integrity and induced an increase in tuber sucrose and RS content resulting in deterioration of FCL in proportion to treatment duration. Although HWT did not improve FCL after <b>reconditioning,</b> future work is needed to evaluate the effect of short-duration treatments on the permissible extend of <b>reconditioning</b> and subsequent processing quality. ...|$|R
