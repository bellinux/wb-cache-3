50|$|The eight (8) named {{backflow}} assemblies ALL {{have two}} <b>resilient</b> <b>seated</b> isolation/shut off valves with properly located test ports. These assemblies have the distinct {{advantage of being}} in-line serviceable and can be tested & repaired without having to remove an installed assembly. Special accredited courses are given to test & repair backflow assemblies and only certified testers may test backflow assemblies.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, {{the battery}} and starter were improved. The bike {{received}} more <b>resilient</b> <b>seat</b> foam, a new front fender, an altered bottom triple-clamp, a better headlight (using a common H4 bulb) and new handguards. The bike retains the older spring-type clutch providing a lighter lever action than other KTMs. The 2014 {{is provided with}} a new master cylinder/reservoir with a smaller diameter piston and new lever for a lighter pull.|$|R

Polyimide-based foams {{are being developed}} as <b>resilient</b> fillers for <b>seat</b> cushions, as rigid, low-density wall panels, as high-strength sheets for floors, and as thermal and acoustical insulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} linear mathematical {{models for}} elastic plates and beams. To be specific, {{we consider the}} Euler-Bernoulli, Rayleigh and Timoshenko theories for beams and the Kirchhoff and Reissner-Mindlin theories for plates. The theories mentioned above refer to the partial differential equations that model a beam or plate. The contact with other objects {{also need to be}} modelled. The equations that result are referred to as â€œinterface conditions". We consider three problems concerning interface conditions for plates and beams: A vertical slender structure on a <b>resilient</b> <b>seating,</b> the built in end of a beam and a plate-beam system. The vertical structure may be modelled as a vertically mounted beam. How- ever, the dynamics of the seating must be included in the model and this increases the complexity of a finite element analysis considerably. We show that the interface conditions and additional equations can be accommodated in the variational form and that the finite element method yields excellent results. Although the Timoshenko model is considered to be better than the Euler- Bernoulli model, some authors do not agree that it is an improvement for the case of a cantilever beam. In a modal analysis of a two-dimensional beam model, we show that the Timoshenko model is not only better, but it provides good results when the beam is so short that one is reluctant to use beam theory at all. In applications, structures consisting of linked systems of beams and plates are encountered. We consider a rectangular plate connected to two beams. Combining the Reissner-Mindlin plate model and the Timoshenko beam model {{can be seen as a}} first step towards a better model while still avoiding the complexity of a fully three-dimensional model. However, the modelling of the plate-beam system is more complex than in the case of the classical theory and the mathematical analysis and numerical analysis present additional difficulties. A weak variational form is derived for all the model problems. This is necessary to apply general existence and uniqueness results. It is also necessary to apply general convergence results and derive error bounds. The setting for the weak variational forms are product spaces. This is due to the complex nature of the model problems. Thesis (PhD (Mathematics and Applied Mathematics)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006. Mathematics and Applied Mathematicsunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|In {{ballasted}} railway track, {{the deterioration}} of a sleeper and ballast support usually occurs due to both regular and irregular wheel/rail interactions. The repeated impact of train wheels over sleepers can reduce the lifetime of a sleeper and degrade ballast. To attenuate {{the effect of the}} impact loads on concrete sleepers, the <b>resilient</b> rail <b>seat</b> pads are used. After a certain time in service conditions, the worn rail pads have to be replaced. Assessment of the condition of rail pads is of great importance to track engineers and {{plays an important role in}} the overall track maintenance cost. A non-destructive methodology for evaluating and monitoring the dynamic properties of the rail pads has been developed based on an instrumented hammer impact technique and an equivalent single degree-of-freedom system approximation. In this study, the sample rail pads were collected during track maintenance work on a rail network in New South Wales, Australia. The measurements were performed using an instrumented hammer in a frequency range between 0 and 1, 000 Hz. The effective mass, dynamic stiffness, and dynamic damping ratio were extracted in order to assess the current condition of the worn rail pads, thus assisting track engineers to optimise track maintenance operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{repeated}} {{impact of}} train wheels over sleepers {{can reduce the}} lifetime of a sleeper and degrade ballast. In more extreme cases {{it can lead to}} the breakdown of the concrete sleeper. Concrete sleepers are rigid compared to steel and wooden sleepers and therefore it is necessary to provide impact attenuation to prevent premature breakdown of the concrete. One of the measures employed to attenuate the effect of the impact loads on concrete sleepers has been the use of the <b>resilient</b> rail <b>seat</b> pads. Numerous analytical and numerical models have been formulated to investigate the dynamic behaviour of railway track substructures. All models require careful selection of the track component properties to satisfactorily represent track vibration response. However, there is currently no standard method available {{that can be used to}} evaluate the dynamic properties of the rail pads. At the University of Wollongong, an instrumented hammer was used to excite an equivalent single degree-of-freedom system (SDOF), incorporating a rail pad as a resilient element, to determine the dynamic properties using methods of modal analysis. The analytical SDOF dynamic model was applied to best fit the experimental modal measurements that were performed in a frequency range of 0 - 500 Hz. The curve fitting gives such dynamic parameters as the effective mass, dynamic stiffness, and dynamic damping constant, all of which are required for numerical modelling of a railway track...|$|R
