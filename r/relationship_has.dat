5|$|Andy's and Red's <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> been {{described}} as a non-sexual love story between two men, that few other films offer, where the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy's and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.|$|E

5|$|Water quality: It may be fair {{to presume}} that clean water is {{necessary}} to maintain essential habitat and a healthy population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, {{just as it is}} to the survival of many other invertebrates; however, since Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a terrestrial snail, the effects of water quality are expected to be somewhat indirect. While water quality may play a potential role in the success or decline of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, this <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> not been clearly defined to date.|$|E
5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature of this <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> been widely discussed by historians; some have argued that the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E

5|$|Julius Caesar {{mentions}} {{small black}} horses that resemble the Mérens in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War), when discussing {{the defeat of}} Crassus by the Sotiates and their cavalry. Historian Paul Prunet {{was the first to}} link the animals discussed by Caesar to the Mérens, although the <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> not been definitely established. The location of the Sotiates is the subject of controversy, with some authors placing them in the district of Nerac and others near Foix. The Mérens may have been used as a pack animal by the Romans, who may have taken some of the animals with them when they left. The small black horse from the Pyrenees is described throughout antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> been on the rise.|$|E
5|$|Michel Roux is {{the brother}} of Albert Roux. Michel has a son named Alain Roux, while Albert's son is Michel Roux, Jr.. When Alain was ten years old, Michel and his wife divorced, with his wife taking British born Alain and his two sisters to France. Alain would visit during the school {{holidays}} and work with Michel in the kitchens and decided {{at the age of}} fourteen that he wanted to become a chef like his father. Michel met his second wife, Robyn Joyce, after being set up on a blind date with her by former apprentice Leigh Stone-Herbert in Sydney, Australia. The <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> been credited with opening the door to Australian chefs being trained by the Roux brothers.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Louise Bradley is {{a fictional}} {{character}} portrayed by Helen Baxendale in the British comedy-drama television series Cold Feet. Rachel is {{introduced in the}} pilot episode (1997), where she begins a relationship with Adam Williams (James Nesbitt). Their <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> highs and lows throughout the series; Rachel reveals a secret husband in the first series (1998) and has an abortion in the second (1999), which supposedly prevents her from conceiving {{a child in the}} future. She and Adam marry in the third series (2000) and are surprised to discover that she is pregnant in the fourth (2001). They both begin raising their child in the fifth series (2003), but Rachel's life is cut short when she is killed in a car crash.|$|E
5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} {{is one of}} 19 species in the genus Panulirus, {{which is one of}} several genera of spiny {{lobsters}} whose names are anagrams of the original spiny lobster genus, Palinurus. Its closest relatives are not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather Panulirus argus from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus marginatus, Panulirus pascuensis, Panulirus cygnus and Panulirus longipes; this <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> been recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S ribosomal RNA genes.|$|E

5|$|The Joker is {{alternatively}} {{depicted as}} sexual and asexual. In The Dark Knight Returns and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker is seductive toward Batman; {{it is uncertain}} if their <b>relationship</b> <b>has</b> homoerotic undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believes that the Joker is capable of a romantic relationship. His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.|$|E
