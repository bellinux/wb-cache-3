Based on Panebianco’s (1988) organizational theory and Hirschman’s (1970) work on “exit, voice and loyalty”, this paper views a political party as an organization and posits that to survive, a party must institutionalize a system of incentive and sanction and a mix of “voice ” and “exit ” options.

It seems, however, that some of his results are either wrong or derived in a wrong way for the following reason. In his argument the author used the well-known constitutive equation for a linear isotropic medium at rest, D = ε 0 εrE, as if it were valid for the medium in motion too. That, of course, is not so; in the first-order theory for a moving non-magnetic medium discussed by Lorrain, the correct constitutive equation is D = ε 0 E+ε 0 (εr − 1) (E+v×B) (see, for example, Rosser (1964)).

40|$|Colorectal cancer arises as {{a result}} of the {{accumulation}} of genetic errors many of which affect the control of apoptosis. Effective chemoprevention strategies for colorectal cancer <b>must</b> <b>rectify</b> these genetic defects. Mutation of apc is often the initiating genetic lesion in colorectal cancers that develop along the chromosomal instability pathway. Depending on the cellular context, loss of apc activates the Wnt signalling pathway causing immediate widespread apoptosis of colorectal epithelial cells and defects in differentiation and cell migration. Only cells that are inherently resistant to apoptosis survive this initial wave of apoptosis. These surviving cells constitute the epithelial population that develop into adenomas. Two gene targets of the Wnt signalling pathway are of particular relevance to apoptosis. Although controversial, survivin may function to inhibit apoptosis. MYC has two outputs in normal cells, the induction of apoptosis and proliferation. These opposing functions work so that MYC can only induce cell proliferation in cells if apoptosis is disabled. p 53 couples apoptosis to mitogenic signals and survival pathways. Under some circumstances, NF-kappaB can act as an inhibitor of apoptosis possibly through increased expression of bcl-x(L). Tumours that evolve by the microsatellite instability pathway often have mutations in the proapoptotic gene bax. Colonic adenomas express cyclo-oxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and may be targets of chemoprevention before the development of malignancy. However, the recent discovery that coxibs increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events limits their use as chemopreventive agents. Nevertheless, aspirin remains a drug of great interest as it is already known to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by up to 50 %.

40|$|The Second Circuit, in ATSI, disregarded the {{pleading}} {{and review}} instructions the Supreme Court established in Tellabs {{by stating that}} plaintiffs may plead a strong inference of scienter using only allegations of motive and opportunity or conscious misbehavior or recklessness. This decision has allowed plaintiffs to plead scienter using only such individual allegations; encouraged courts within the Second Circuit to conduct abbreviated reviews of complaints at the dismissal stage; undermined the Court’s intent for a heightened, uniform scienter pleading standard capable of reducing frivolous litigation and allowing the advancement of meritorious claims; {{and contributed to the}} renewal of a wide circuit split over whether motive and opportunity allegations are sufficient to plead scienter. In sharp contrast to the divergent policies and practices of the Second Circuit, the Third Circuit adopted the full Tellabs provisions. It therefore utilizes the scienter pleading standard that the Supreme Court intended. Given the serious consequences of this split, the Second Circuit standard merits further discussion. This Note begins by discussing the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), which established the pleading requirements for private securities fraud claims. Part II details the post-PSLRA circuit split over motive and opportunity allegations, and the pleading provisions the Supreme Court established in Tellabs. Part III describes the pleading prescriptions created by the Second Circuit in ATSI. Part IV discusses how the ATSI standard diverges from Tellabs by allowing plaintiffs to plead scienter through individual allegations, which has led to only partial application of the Tellabs dismissal review process in the Second Circuit and has undermined the Supreme Court’s intent for a heightened, uniform scienter pleading standard capable of reducing frivolous claims. This Part also details how ATSI contributed to the post-Tellabs circuit split over motive and opportunity allegations, and argues that the Supreme Court <b>must</b> <b>rectify</b> this untenable situation by fortifying the Tellabs review test.

40|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} regarding {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) in the environment, extensive studies and monitoring programs {{have been carried out}} {{in the last two decades}} to determine their concentrations in water, sediment, and more recently, in biota. An extensive review and analysis of the existing literature shows that whilst the vast majority of these efforts either attempt to compare (a) spatial changes (to identify "hot spots"), or (b) temporal changes to detect deterioration/improvement occurring in the environment, most studies could not provide sufficient statistical power to estimate concentrations of POPs in the environment and detect spatial and temporal changes. Despite various national POPs standards having been established, there has been a surprising paucity of emphasis in establishing accurate threshold concentrations that indicate potential significant threats to ecosystems and public health. Although most monitoring programs attempt to check compliance through reference to certain "environmental quality objectives", it should be pointed out that many of these established standards are typically associated with a large degree of uncertainty and rely on a large number of assumptions, some of which may be arbitrary. Non-compliance should trigger concern, so that the problem can be tracked down and <b>rectified,</b> but non-compliance <b>must</b> not be interpreted in a simplistic and mechanical way. Contaminants occurring in the physical environment may not necessarily be biologically available, and even when they are bioavailable, they may not necessarily elicit adverse biological effects at the individual or population levels. As such, we here argue that routine monitoring and reporting of abiotic and biotic POPs concentrations could be of limited use, unless such data can be related directly to the assessment of public health and ecological risks. Risk can be inferred from the ratio of predicted environmental concentration (PEC) and the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). Currently, the paucity of data does not allow accurate estimation of PNEC, and future endeavors should therefore, be devoted to determine the threshold concentrations of POPs that can cause undesirable biological effects on sensitive receivers and important biological components in the receiving environment (e. g. keystone species, populations with high energy flow values, etc.), to enable derivation of PNECs based on solid scientific evidence and reduce uncertainty. Using the threshold body burden of POPs required to elicit damages of lysosomal integrity in the green mussel (Perna virvidis) as an example, we illustrate how measurement of POPs in body tissue could be used in predicting environmental risk in a meaningful way. © 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Anthony Forsyth {{proposes a}} social {{partnership}} agenda for Australia WHAT kind of labour law or industrial relations system should replace Work Choices? This might seem an odd question - after all, {{the new legislation}} has only been in operation for a little over six months. But the Work Choices Act is widely {{considered to be a}} partisan piece of legislation - one that provides too much scope for the untrammeled exercise of managerial power. It is also heavily oriented towards conflict - especially in the bargaining sphere, where the statute sets up a complex, legalistic process for parties to engage in “industrial warfare,” without any effective mechanism for dispute resolution. In his recent Julian Small Lecture (PDF), Professor Ron McCallum speculated that Work Choices will not stand the test of time. In his view, it will be substantially revised within six to eight years, for several reasons, including the failure of many employers to engage with the new laws - for example, because they want to treat their employees fairly (rather than engaging in the labour cost-cutting that is now open to them) or they want to avoid its complexity. Clearly, the outcome of the next federal election will be critical in determining the longevity of the reforms. If the Coalition is re-elected, then Work Choices will probably have a minimum “life” of five years or so. On the other hand, if Labor wins the election, that will {{be the end of the}} Work Choices experiment. But apart from the ALP’s commitment to “rip up these unfair laws,” scrap AWAs, and introduce a firmer basis for collective bargaining, we do not really know what they will put in the place of Work Choices. So with the federal election only twelve months away (maybe less), it is not at all premature to be considering “what next, after Work Choices?” I want to suggest that the central concept underpinning any new industrial relations system should be that of “social partnership. ” I also want to briefly outline a couple of key elements of a system based on that concept. Social partnership is a continental European notion. It essentially denotes the idea of cooperation between government, unions and employers, rather than adversarialism, as the basis for ordering labour relations. In its purest form, for example in Germany, these cooperative arrangements operate at three mutually reinforcing levels: 1. At the national, policy formulation level - through tripartite mechanisms for determining the framework of labour regulation and economic policy (Australia had some experience of this in the Accord years) 2. At the industry or sectoral level - through collective bargaining between unions and employer associations, which sets the parameters for workplace-level outcomes regarding wages, working hours, and other core employment conditions 3. At the firm level - the legal rights of workers to participate in workplace decision-making through works councils, and employee representation on the boards of larger companies. Obviously, Australia cannot simply replicate the German (or any other European) industrial relations system. We have to bear in mind that their systems operate within specific institutional and economic contexts that support the social partnership approach - such as the European “social market economy,” and “stakeholder” rather than shareholder-centred corporate governance systems. However, we can borrow the underlying concept - that of partnership, or cooperation in industrial relations - and, by giving it a modern Australian flavour, use it as a basis for developing an alternative workplace relations framework. In this respect, recent experience in New Zealand points the way. New Zealand has a remarkably similar industrial relations heritage to Australia: a long-standing conciliation and arbitration system that provided strong support to trade unions, but which gave way to a deregulated model centred on individualised bargaining. When Labour was re-elected to government in NZ in 1999 it was faced with similar questions to those confronting the ALP now; with a return to conciliation and arbitration no longer viable, how could the new government legislate for a fair and balanced employment relations system to protect workers’ interests and meet the needs of a modern economy? The settlement arrived at in New Zealand’s Employment Relations Act 2000 is founded on the concept of “good faith,” which permeates all aspects of individual employment relationships, and collective labour relations, which are regulated by the legislation. For example, the 2000 legislation provides a framework of “good faith bargaining” rights and duties, applicable to employers, employees and unions, as well as consultation rights for workers over company restructuring at the firm level. The strong statutory support for “good faith” employment relations is intended to facilitate a broader cultural shift in NZ towards “workplace partnership,” which is defined as “an active relationship between unions & employers to deliver outcomes that benefit the mutual trust of both parties. ” The core ideas behind partnership include: a collaborative, “mutual gains” approach to bargaining; wide union and employee consultation practices; consensus over conflict; and restraint and protection of relationships in the management of conflict. This approach is supported by various government organisations and processes operating at the national level, including the Growth and Innovation Framework, the tripartite Workplace Productivity Project, and the Partnership Resource Centre. Overall, through these inter-linked layers of innovative regulation, the Labour government has really engineered a NZ version of the European social partnership model. I think we need a public policy conversation in Australia about establishing an IR system based on cooperation, not conflict. That debate should involve all of the “social partners” in the Australian context - for example, federal and state governments, employer bodies, unions, and welfare, church and community groups. And, in my view, there are two key elements that need to form part of an Australian social partnership agenda: 1. “Good faith bargaining”: We <b>must</b> <b>rectify</b> the current legislative anomaly, where we have around 100 pages of rules regarding protected industrial action, secret ballots, etc - but nothing preserving the right of a group of workers to obtain a collective agreement if they want one; nothing about the bargaining process; and little opportunity for resolving bargaining impasses (except in the most extreme cases). The ACTU is leading the way here. Its recent collective bargaining proposals seek to bring Australia into line with other major industrialised economies, such as the UK, US, Canada - all of which provide in some way for a right to collective bargaining, where this is supported by a majority of the workforce. The ACTU has sensibly steered clear of mandatory employee ballots and other complex legal procedures that are features of some overseas IR systems, drawing in part on NZ’s good faith bargaining model. It also seeks to restore a prominent role for the AIRC, as the body for determining whether a union has met the “majority support” requirement for triggering the bargaining process, overseeing that process and resolving deadlocks. 2. Participation in workplace decision-making: Employees in the modern workforce should be involved in strategic business decisions, and provided with the information they need to do so, including information about firm performance, future investment plans, and restructuring proposals. Much international evidence shows that this kind of “high consultation/high performance” approach leads to productive outcomes for firms, as well as providing workers with a “voice” over important issues of job security. In Australia, these objectives could be achieved through a combination of statutory mandate - for example, information & consultation rights for employees in larger businesses - supplemented by a range of regulatory supports (provided by federal and state governments) to enable firms to pursue the cooperative path to workplace innovation and business competitiveness - for example, information, training, funding trials, tax breaks and other incentives. These ideas might seem a world away from the current reality of Work Choices. But they are being successfully implemented, in various forms, in several countries that share Australia’s tradition of adversarial IR, including (as well as New Zealand) the United Kingdom and Ireland. As in those countries, any move to embrace workplace partnership will require a major cultural shift in Australia - greater levels of trust by managers in their workers, and a degree of compromise on the part of employees and their representatives. The idea of social partnership warrants serious consideration in any process of formulating alternative proposals for labour regulation in Australia. • Anthony Forsyth is senior lecturer and director of the Corporate Law and Accountability Research Group, Department of Business Law & Taxation, Monash University, and an associate of the Australian Institute of Employment Rights.
