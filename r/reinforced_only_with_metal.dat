40|$|The use of low-ductility {{welded wire}} fabric (WWF) {{as a main}} tensile {{reinforcement}} in concrete slabs compromises the ductility of concrete structures.

This paper presents the experimental {{study carried out on}} eight simply supported one-way slabs to study the structural behavior of concrete slabs reinforced with low-ductility WWF and steel fibers. The different types of steel fibers used were crimped fiber, hooked-end fiber and twincone fiber. The experimental results show that the ductility behavior of the slab specimens with low-ductility reinforcement was significantly improved with the inclusion of 40 kg/m 3 of twincone fiber. Distribution of cracks was prominent in the slabs with twincone fiber, which also indicates the better distribution of internal forces in these slabs.

40|$|Despite the {{remarkable}} {{advances in the}} field of macro-synthetic fibre reinforced concrete, the successful use of plastic macro-fibres as the sole reinforcement in structural elements still requires thorough research. Several questions hindering its wide-spread use have yet to be addressed. Do plastic fibres guarantee a clearly defined structural reliability? Is there any influence of the formwork and casting method on the orientation of this fibres? Does this orientation affects the structural behavior of the slabs?

This study assessed the longevity of composite-bonded resin/natural teeth (<b>reinforced</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> a stainless steel mesh) as replacements for periodontally lost lower incisors. METHODS: Besides the longevity of the restoration, the periodontal condition of the abutment teeth, and the general satisfaction of the patient were evaluated retrospectively via a phone interview, in combination with {{an analysis of the}} patient's clinical dental file. RESULTS: The cumulative proportion of survival rate of these composite restorations was 80 % after 5 years of function. No statistically significant difference was found between the survival distribution of one- and two-pontic bridges (P = 0. 66). The abutment teeth demonstrated stable probing depths and a negligible loss in attachment (0. 1 mm/year). The satisfaction ratings were also favorable.

This paper investigates the efficiency of NSM technique using CFRP laminates in restoring the capacity of hollowcore slabs with openings. Ten full scale hollow core slabs were tested at two shear span to depth (aid) ratios and with two different locations of opening. Presence of opening reduced the ultimate capacity of slab by 44 % and NSM CFRP strengthening fully restored the lost capacity based on aid ratio. The adopted strengthening was more effective in shear dominated than in flexure dominated specimens. However, in both aid ratios, good improvement- in initial stiffness was observed due to NSM CFRP strengthening...|$|R

40|$|Fibre {{reinforcement}} {{has been}} used to reinforce concrete members for decades. It has combined well with concrete to help control cracking and increase toughness and other properties such as corrosion resistance. The use of traditional fibre reinforcement has {{led to the development of}} a new material called textile reinforcement (multifilament continuous fibre) which can also be used as the main reinforcement instead of steel reinforcement. This study experimentally investigates concrete beams <b>reinforced</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> carbon textile material (TRC beams). The tensile strength of textile reinforcement and pull out strength of TRC were measured. Four-point bending tests were performed on 76 beams (small and large scale beams). Several parameters such as volume fraction and reinforcement layout were studied in order to investigate their effect on TRC beam behaviour. The results showed that with the correct layout and geometry of textile reinforcement, these reinforced concrete beams, providing they had sufficient cover thickness, would perform well. Also, the results confirmed that the bond between the concrete and textile reinforcement plays a vital role in TRC beam performance. The behaviour of the TRC beams was compared with that of the steel reinforced concrete (SRC) beams; a major advantage of the TRC beam was the reduced crack widths. This study finishes by proposing a design methodology for TRC beams. Guidance covers flexural design, predictions for moment-curvature, and predictions for crack width of TRC beams. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Determination of fibre {{reinforcement}} {{influence on}} wear rate and wear mechanisms were examined. Moreover, effect of fibre orientation and specimen {{pressure on the}} counterpart were analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Composite materials based on 2024 and 7075 aluminium alloys were reinforced with 10 - 20 vol. % of alumina Saffil fibres and additionally choosen specimens with graphite fibres. Wear tests were carried out on pin-on-disc device where the specimens were pressed to the cast iron counterpart with forces corresponding to pressures of 0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 5 MPa. Findings: Wear mass loss for composite materials <b>reinforced</b> <b>only</b> <b>with</b> Saffil Al 2 O 3 fibres decreased with increase of fibre content in the matrix. The largest wear rate {{in relation to the}} unreinforced alloy exhibited composites containing 20 vol. % of Saffil Al 2 O 3 fibres, tested under the largest applied pressure of 1. 5 MPa. The graphite fibres enhance the wear resistance of composite materials under all applied pressures.

Research limitations/implications: Fragmented alumina fibres acting as loose debris can enhance the wear rate both composite and iron counterpart. At high volume of graphite fibres produced preform possess low strength caused by weak joints between fibres.

40|$|Abstract. The use of glucose, {{which is}} {{produced}} from the acid hydrolysis of starch and cellulose, is studied as a fuel in a low-temperature direct-mode fuel cell (LTDMFC) with an alkaline electrolyte. Glucose {{is regarded as}} being as good a fuel as bioethanol, because both the fuels give 2 electrons per molecule in the fuel cell without carbonisation problems. However, glucose can be produced with fewer processing stages from starch and cellulose than can bioethanol. In the LTDMFC the fuel and the electrolyte are mixed {{with each other and}} the fuel cell is equipped <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> catalysts. Cellulose as a fuel is of great importance because the fuel for the energy production is not taken from food production. A description of an acid hydrolysis method for starch and cellulose is presented. Values for glucose concentrations in each hydrolysate are analysed by means of a chromatographic method. Each glucose hydrolysate was made alkaline by adding of potassium hydroxide before feed in the fuel cell. Polarisation curves were measured, and they were found to produce lower current density values when compared to earlier tests with pure glucose. The Coulombic efficiency of pure glucose electrochemical oxidation in LTDMFC, which was calculated from a ratio of detected current capacity (As) to the maximum current capacity with the release of two electrons per molecule, was also found to be very low.

40|$|I {{present a}} {{comparison}} between published dynamical (ATLAS 3 D) and spectroscopic (Conroy & van Dokkum) constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies, using the 34 galaxies in common between the two works. Both studies infer an average IMF mass factor α (the stellar mass relative to a Kroupa-IMF population of similar age and metallicity) greater than unity, i. e. both methods favour an IMF which is heavier {{than that of the}} Milky Way, on average over the sample. However, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, there is no correlation between α inferred from the two approaches. I investigate how the two estimates of α are correlated systematically with the galaxy velocity dispersion, σ, and with the Mg/Fe abundance ratio. The spectroscopic method, based on the strengths of metal absorption lines, yields a correlation <b>only</b> <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> abundance ratios: at fixed Mg/Fe, there is no residual correlation with σ. The dynamical method, applied to exactly the same galaxy sample, yields the opposite result: the IMF variation correlates <b>only</b> <b>with</b> dynamics, with no residual correlation with Mg/Fe after controlling for σ. Hence although both methods indicate a heavy IMF on average in ellipticals, they lead to incompatible results for the systematic trends, when applied to the same set of galaxies. The sense of the disagreement could suggest that one (or both) of the methods has not accounted fully for the main confounding factors, i. e. element abundance ratios or dark matter contributions. Alternatively, the poor agreement might indicate additional variation in the detailed shape of the IMF, beyond what can currently be inferred from the spectroscopic features.
