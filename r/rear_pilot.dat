500|$|Unlike the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, which {{flew the}} Phantom with a Naval Aviator (pilot) {{in the front}} seat and a Naval Flight Officer as a radar {{intercept}} officer (RIO) in the back seat, the USAF initially flew its Phantoms with a rated Air Force Pilot in front and back seats. While the <b>rear</b> <b>pilot</b> (GIB, or [...] "guy in back") could fly and ostensibly land the aircraft, he had fewer flight instruments and a very restricted forward view. The Air Force later assigned a rated Air Force Navigator qualified as a weapon/targeting systems officer (later designated as weapon systems officer or WSO) in the rear seat instead of another pilot. However, all USAF Phantoms retained dual flight controls throughout their service life.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the Lead Pilot Car Operator {{functions}} {{to maintain an}} assured clear distance - 1/2 to 1 mi - ahead of the Load. The Lead Pilot Car Operator frequently transmits his lane position, road name, lack of overhead obstruction {{up to and including}} a landmark or building and direction of travel. The Lead Pilot Car Operator is expected to observe any obstruction or complication that may require the Load to alter its path and transmit clear instructions to the Load and other necessary vehicles. Hearing the transmission from the Lead Pilot car, the <b>Rear</b> <b>Pilot</b> Car Operator ensures that the desired lane is clear and moves the <b>Rear</b> <b>Pilot</b> Car to operate in the now-clear lane. The <b>Rear</b> <b>Pilot</b> Car Operator transmit the clear lane availability to the Load. After passing the obstruction, the Lead Pilot car Operator informs the Load that the Lead Pilot car is now operating in a specific lane as it passes a specific landmark or building. The <b>Rear</b> <b>Pilot</b> Car Operator ensures and transmits that the desired lane is currently clear and moves the <b>Rear</b> <b>Pilot</b> Car to operate in the now-clear lane.|$|E

50|$|The Nimbus was a wooden, two-seater, gull-wing, low-wing glider trainer. The two {{pilots were}} {{housed in a}} tandem cockpit with a perspex hood. The {{tailplane}} {{was attached to the}} fuselage immediately forward of the single tail fin. The landing gear comprised a single, central, partly recessed landing-wheel below the <b>rear</b> <b>pilot</b> and a tail-skid below the fin.|$|E
50|$|The 6 degree forward {{sweep of}} the wing allows the <b>rear</b> <b>pilot</b> to be seated near the centres of gravity and lift. The glider {{therefore}} maintains the same trim whether flown single seated or dual seated. The D-type leading edge torsion box is of plywood and the whole wing is fabric-covered. There are metal Schempp-Hirth air brakes {{above and below the}} wing, and the wooden ailerons are fabric-covered. The fuselage is a welded steel tube structure with spruce stringers and fabric-covered overall, except for the nose, which is glassfibre. The tail unit is plywood-covered, except for the rear part of the rudder and elevators, which are fabric-covered, and there is a Flettner trim tab in the starboard elevator.|$|E

50|$|The He 162 was {{originally}} built {{with the intention}} of being flown by the Hitler Youth, as the Luftwaffe was fast running out of pilots. However, the aircraft's complexity required more experienced pilots. Both a standard-fuselage length, unarmed BMW 003E-powered two-seat version (with the <b>rear</b> <b>pilot's</b> seat planned to have a ventral access hatch to access the cockpit) and an unpowered two-seat glider version, designated the He 162S (Schulen), were developed for training purposes. Only a small number were built, and even fewer delivered to the sole He 162 Hitler Youth training unit to be activated (in March 1945) at an airbase at Sagan. The unit {{was in the process of}} formation when the war ended, and did not begin any training; it is doubtful that more than one or two He 162S gliders ever took to the air.|$|R

50|$|The Duo Discus {{replaced}} the Janus as Schempp Hirth's high-performance two-seater trainer. Although it shares its name with the highly successful Standard Class Discus, any resemblance is only superficial. It first flew in 1993 {{and is still}} in production at the factory in Orlican in the Czech Republic. It has a 20-metre four-piece wing that is slightly swept forward so that the <b>rear</b> <b>pilot</b> {{is close to the}} centre of gravity. Its best glide ratio was measured as 44:1. An optional 'turbo' retractable two-stroke engine can be specified for extended gliding sessions. Over 500 Duo Discuses had been built by August 2007. Its chief rival is now the DG Flugzeugbau DG-1001. In U.S. Air Force service it is known as the TG-15A.|$|E

5000|$|The Z.1007 had a {{standard}} monoplane configuration, with a mid-set wing, single tail, retractable undercarriage and {{a crew of}} five or six. It had a wooden structure and a clean shape that was much more aerodynamic than the competing SM.79. The Z.1007 had three engines, with one engine in the nose and two in the wings. The trimotor design was a common feature of Italian aircraft of World War II. The aircraft had a slim fuselage as the two pilots sat in tandem rather than side-by-side as in most bombers of the period. Visibility was good and the aircraft was almost a three-engine fighter. This slimness reduced drag but also somewhat worsened {{the task of the}} two pilots. Both pilots' seats were offset to port to allow a passageway for the bombardier to enter his compartment below the pilot's feet (directly behind the central engine), by ducking through an opening under the starboard instrument panel. Both front and rear instrument panels contained flight and navigation instruments, while the engine monitoring gauges were located to starboard where the <b>rear</b> <b>pilot</b> could see them past the front pilot's shoulder (cockpit picture showing instruments and bombardier's access way). Although the rear pilot's view was limited, he was capable of landing or taking off if needed; however his primary purpose was to allow the pilot to rest, and to add some [...] "muscle" [...] to the controls when needed, as well as acting as an extra set of eyes to notice problems and to monitor gauges while the other is occupied. There were five crewmembers; the pilot, the copilot, a bombardier/navigator/ventral gunner, a dorsal gunner/radio operator, and waist gunner/flight engineer. The radio equipment was located in the center section between the dorsal turret and the waist position. Like most trimotor Italian aircraft of the period the Z.1007 suffered from poor defensive armament, although it was no worse than many other contemporary designs, many of which had no rotating dorsal turret, no waist guns, or no ventral gun, or various combinations of such. Other issues were poor engine reliability and a weak power-to-weight ratio due to low powered engines (the three 1,000 hp engines of the Z.1007bis were equivalent to twin engines of 1,500 hp each, but this was slightly offset by the added weight of the third engine). The Z.1007 also suffered longitudinal stability problems that were partly rectified later by the adoption of a twin tail arrangement. The Z.1007's wooden structure suffered cracks, separations and surface delamination due to the difficult climatic conditions in North Africa and Russia, but on the contrary allowed the plane to float in case of ditching. The surface delamination and deformation greatly added to the aircraft drag. A total of 660 Alciones were built.|$|E

Refreshed FWD models feature Honda's Variable Cylinder Management system, which can deactivate up to three cylinders under light load to increase fuel economy. All Pilots from this generation feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Pilot has front struts with a coil-spring, multilink rear suspension for a flat rear load floor. Front track is 66.3 in and 66.5 in at the <b>rear.</b> The <b>Pilot</b> has a 4500 lb boat/3500 lb trailer towing capability with the optional dealer installed towing package.|$|R
2500|$|The last combat {{use of the}} DH.9 by the RAF was {{in support}} of the final {{campaign}} against Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (known by the British as the [...] "Mad Mullah") in Somalia during January–February 1920.

2500|$|Both F-4 crewmen {{had landed}} in trees. Their wingmen had {{remained}} in the area, making repeated low level passes without a gun or ordnance to try {{to slow down the}} hostile forces trying to kill or capture the airmen. Jolly Green 02 lowered its hoist to the Phantom's <b>rear</b> seat <b>pilot,</b> 1st Lt. Joseph C. Merrick, who was suspended 150 feet in the air and had lashed himself to a tree. During the eight minutes of hover needed for Merrick to transfer from his parachute harness to the jungle penetrator and be brought up, Jolly Green 02 was hit numerous times from directly ahead and Merrick was twice wounded. Youngblood rotated its tail towards the gunfire to keep the pilots from being hit. As soon as Youngblood applied power to climb, the helicopter's transmission oil pressure failed, warning of imminent seizure of both engines. Youngblood broadcast a [...] "Mayday" [...] and searched for a field to make an emergency landing, flying six miles before spotting one.|$|R
50|$|The final variant was {{the solitary}} C.19 Mk V, G-ABXP. The aircraft-style {{controls}} of earlier autogyros depended on airflow past ailerons, rudders and elevators; during the slow forward speed phases of takeoff and landing, these were ineffective, and accidents resulted. The C.19 Mk V lacked the small wing and all-moving control surfaces, relying instead on a tilting rotor head. Using a long control arm that reached to the <b>rear</b> cockpit, the <b>pilot</b> could direct the aircraft by tilting {{the plane of}} rotation of the rotor. After a period of experimentation, the C.19 Mk V flew with a small fixed tailplane and a two-bladed rotor. This control system was adopted for the Cierva C.30.|$|R
5000|$|When the Fokker Universal {{was first}} {{developed}} in 1925, {{it had a}} 149 kW (200 hp) Wright J-4 or a 164 kW (220 hp) J-5 engine. Later models of the aircraft were powered by 246 kW (330 hp) J-6 engines. Two gasoline tanks were mounted in the wings near the forward edge. As typical of the era, the pilot sat in an open cockpit forward of the wing’s leading edge. The enclosed cabin below and to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>pilot</b> held four to six passengers or could be fitted for cargo hauling. Cargo capacity {{was estimated to be}} approximately 427 kg (940 lb); fuel capacity was 280 l (78 US gal) or 213 kg (468 lb) ...|$|R
2500|$|The hull was flat-sided and deep. Its {{underside}} had two steps; {{in front}} of the first the hull bottom was a hollow V in section and behind it a flat V. There was a little water rudder behind the <b>rear</b> step. <b>Pilot</b> and mechanic sat side-by-side in an open cockpit, with gunner's positions ahead of them and at the trailing edge. [...] Alternatively, the Robbe could be configured to carry four passengers, one in a forward cabin, two in a central one and one more im a rear cabin, or to carry goods or post. The hull was divided into seven watertight compartments to preserve buoyancy. An unusual feature of each gunner's cockpit was a duralumin, telescopic mast. If, in an emergency the Robbe alighted without power, these could each be extended and a simple, triangular sail raised to reach safety. [...] At the rear the tail was conventional, with a blunted rectangular fin and small unbalanced rudder. The high aspect ratio horizontal tail, again rectangular apart from blunted tips, was mounted well up the fin and strut-braced to the upper fuselage. Like the rudder, the elevators were unbalanced.|$|R
25|$|The Whitley had {{a crew of}} five: a pilot, co-pilot/navigator, a bomb aimer, a {{wireless}} operator, and a <b>rear</b> gunner. The <b>pilot</b> and second pilot/navigator {{sat side by side}} in the cockpit, with the wireless operator further back. The navigator rotated to use the chart table behind him. The bomb aimer position was in the nose with a gun turret located directly above. The fuselage aft of the wireless operator was divided horizontally by the bomb bay; behind the bomb bay was the main entrance and aft of that the rear turret. The offensive armaments were stowed in two separate bomb bays housed within the fuselage, along with a further 14 smaller cells contained within the wing area. Bomb racks capable of holding larger bombs were installed on the Whitley Mk III variant.|$|R
