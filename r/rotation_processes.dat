40|$|A {{magneto-optical}} setup {{based on}} the transverse Kerr effect {{has been designed to}} study the magnetization reversal processes by vector magnetometry in arrays of magnetic nanostructures with a reduced total volume. This system allows the measurement of both the parallel and perpendicular to the field components of the magnetization. It has been used to analyze the behavior of amorphous Co x Si 1 -x lines fabricated by electron beam lithography that present a very well defined shape induced uniaxial anisotropy. When the field is applied near to the hard direction, coherent <b>rotation</b> <b>processes</b> are found to occur with a collapse of this reversal mode at fields very close to the hard axis that allows to estimate the very low anisotropy dispersion of these samples. The analysis of the vector hysteresis loops reveals that the magnetization switches via an incoherent process that starts prior to the Stoner-Wohlfarth instability and that can be described in terms of a localized curling-like reversal mode.

40|$|International audienceEthenylphosphine and prop- 1 -en- 2 -ylphosphine, {{obtained}} by flash-vacuum thermolysis of the corresponding Diels-Alder adducts, have {{been characterized by}} their photoelectron spectra. In both cases, the broad shape {{of the first two}} bands respectively at 9. 65 and 10. 85 eV for ethenylphosphine and at 9. 50 and 10. 3 eV for prop- 1 -en- 2 -ylphosphine can only be accounted for if we assume a free-rotating P-C bond. This conclusion was inferred from a complete theoretical study of the <b>rotation</b> <b>process</b> of the PH 2 group around the P-C bond. Two privileged forms were found: a syn form (φ = 0, the lone pair of the phosphorus eclipsing the P-C bond) and a gauche form 3. 5 kJ·mol- 1 less stable (φ = 127 °), separated by low rotation barriers (8. 19 and 10. 74 kJ·mol- 1).

40|$|In mental {{rotation}} tasks, reaction time increases linearly with increasing angular disparity (Shepard & Metzler, 1971). Extensive repetition of {{mental rotation}} {{has been shown}} to reduce reaction times (e. g., Tarr & Pinker, 1989). This training effect, however, seems {{to be based on the}} retrieval of memory representations rather than on a faster execution of the <b>rotation</b> <b>process</b> itself (e. g., Heil, Roesler, Link, & Bajric, 1998). The main purpose of the present experiments was to investigate whether mental rotation can be trained by a manual rotation task in a virtual environment. Since manual rotation does visualise the <b>process</b> of mental <b>rotation</b> and as mental rotation is assumed to be a covert motor rotation (Wexler, Kosslyn, & Berthoz, 1998), it should train the <b>rotation</b> <b>process</b> itself and thus should not be memory based.

40|$|Quantitative texture {{data have}} been {{measured}} by X-ray diffraction on Bi 2223 powders, cold-pressed to different pellet strains. Comparisons of Bi 2223 aggregates and geological phyllosilicate fabrics show that both materials, {{characterized by a}} platy grain morphology, exhibit a similar texture development. This texture development is best explained by grain-shape-induced <b>rotation</b> <b>processes,</b> which are eventually limited by grain-on-grain impingements of the relatively rigid particles. With increasing compaction, the degree of preferred orientation of platelets levels off at (001) pole densities of five to six multiples of a random distribution (m. r. d.). By contrast, intracrystalline slip mechanisms would produce much stronger textures at equivalent strains. From analogy with phyllosilicate fabrics {{it is suggested that}} textures in Bi 2223 compacts could be improved by hot-pressing rather than cold-pressing to alleviate incompatibilities at grain boundaries. Pole densities of 20 m. r. d. have been produced in experiments and observed in naturally deformed argillaceous rocks. Such processing would also improve grain contacts. Of secondary importance is the size of the rigid, equiaxed, second-phase particles, which needs to be reduced to obtain stronger crystallite alignment. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{coalescence}} of nano-crystals during sintering {{is often}} found {{to result in}} interesting crystalline structures such as multi-fold twins, and yet the plasticity mechanism accompanying their formation is unclear. In this work, the sintering behavior of two unsupported copper nanoparticles initially at room temperature is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations under the constant-energy ensemble. The results reveal that once the two nanoparticles are brought into contact, they often go through drastic structural changes with the inter-particle grain boundary quickly eliminated, and single- and multi-fold twinning occurs frequently in the coalesced product. Whereas the formation of single twins {{is found to be}} via the more usual mechanism of emission of Shockley partials on { 1 1 1 } planes, the formation of fivefold twins, however, takes place via a novel dislocation-free mechanism involving a series of shear and rigid-body <b>rotation</b> <b>processes</b> caused by elastic waves with amplitudes not corresponding to any allowable Burgers vector in the fcc lattice.

40|$|The {{study of}} surface {{adsorption}} and reaction {{is not only}} interesting from a scientific point of view, but also important in many application fields such as energy, environment, catalysis, corrosion, electronic device, and sensor. Theoretical calculations are essential in these studies. In this thesis, first principles studies for the structure and reaction of some important single molecules on the surface are presented. Dehydrogenation of single trans- 2 -butene molecule on a Pd(110) surface is the first example. The adsorption configurations of both reactant and produce are assigned and the whole dehydrogenation pathway is revealed. Our calculations show that the reactant, i. e. trans- 2 -butene molecule, undergoes a rotation before dehydrogenation occurs, which is an important detail that cannot be observed directly in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments. The dissociation and <b>rotation</b> <b>processes</b> of single oxygen molecule on a Pt(111) surface have been a subject of extensive studies in the past. A new intermediate state with a peculiar configuration is identified. The puzzled adsorption site is well explained. The calculated energy barriers agree well with experimental results for both dissociation and <b>rotation</b> <b>processes.</b> Another aspect addressed in this thesis is the mechanism of molecular electronic switches induced by molecular structural changes. By carefully examining the tautomerization process of a naphthalocyanine molecule, an intermediate state {{is located on the}} potential surface of the tautomerization. Our calculations indicate that the experimentally observed switching involves four-states, rather than the two-state as proposed by the experimentalists. In a joint experimental and theoretical study the dehydrogenation, tautomerization, and mechanical switching processes of a single melamine molecule on a Cu(100) surface have been comprehensively examined. A new dual-functional molecular device with integrated rectifying and switching functions is made for the first time. In collaborating with another experimental group, we have simulated the switching process of a single 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -hexaphenylsilole molecule on a Cu(111) surface. The role of the orientation of the molecule is carefully examined and a new switching mechanism is proposed. Switching processes are strongly associated with the inelastic electron tunneling. We have proposed a statistical model that allows explaining the non-integer exponent in the power-law relationship between the switching rate and tunneling current. In this model, the importance of the randomness in inelastic electron excitations and the lifetime of the immediate state are emphasized. It has shown that the inelastic electron tunneling is a collection of various n-electron processes with different statistical weight. QC 2011052...|$|E

Based on previous findings we tested the following hypotheses. (i) Is the hand motor cortex activated more strongly during mental rotation than during reading aloud or reading silently? The latter tasks {{have been shown to}} increase motor cortex excitability substantially in recent studies. (ii) Is the recruitment of the motor cortex for mental rotation specific for the judgement of rotated but not for nonrotated Shepard & Metzler figures? Surprisingly, motor cortex activation was higher during mental rotation than during verbal tasks. Moreover, we found strong motor cortex excitability during the mental rotation task but significantly weaker excitability during judgements of nonrotated figures. Hence, this study shows that the primary hand motor area is generally involved in mental <b>rotation</b> <b>processes.</b> These findings are discussed in the context of current theories of mental rotation, and a likely mechanism for the global excitability increase in the primary motor cortex during mental rotation is proposed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the d-distance between two ergodic processes based on observation of finite sample paths drawn from each was first discussed by D. Ornstein and B. Weiss (1990, Ann. Prob. 18, 905 - 930.) A good scheme should recognize when the sample paths {{are drawn from}} the same process. General properties of such self-recognition schemes are discussed in this paper. In particular the class of processes recognizable by a universal standard scheme is shown to be closed under stationary coding, and includes the class of almost block-independent processes, <b>rotation</b> <b>processes,</b> direct products of such processes, and some non-Bernoulli K-proceses. In addition, results about nonrecognizable processes are sharpened. A simple process that is not recognizable by the universal standard scheme is constructed, and it is shown that given any standard scheme there is a process for which the scheme eventually almost surely gives consistently wrong answers. Also, a universal counterexample is constructed for which any "reasonable" recognition scheme must give consistently wrong answers, at least in probability. In particular, this universal counterexample is an ergodic process that acts like a non-ergodic process when observed only for a finite amount of time...|$|E
40|$|Because motor imagery (MI) {{and visual}} imagery (VI) are {{influenced}} differently by {{factors such as}} biomechanical constraints or stimulus size, {{it is conceivable that}} they rely on separate processes, possibly involving distinct cortical networks, a view corroborated by neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies. In the posterior parietal cortex, {{it has been suggested that}} the superior parietal lobule (SPL) underlies VI, whereas MI relies on the supramarginalis gyrus (SMG). However, because several brain imaging studies have also shown an overlap of activations in SPL and SMG during VI or MI, the question arises as to which extent these 2 subregions really contribute to distinct imagery processes. To address this issue, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce virtual lesions of either SMG or SPL in subjects performing a MI (hand drawing rotation) or a VI (letter rotation) task. Whatever hemisphere was stimulated, SMG lesions selectively altered MI, whereas SPL lesions only affected VI, demonstrating a double dissociation between MI and VI. Because these deficits were not influenced by the angular distance of the stimuli, we suggest that SMG and SPL are involved in the reenactment of the motor and visual representations, respectively, and not in mental <b>rotation</b> <b>processes</b> per se...|$|E
