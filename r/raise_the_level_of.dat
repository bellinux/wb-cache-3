25|$|Before the {{inception}} of the J.League, the highest level of club football was the Japan Soccer League (JSL), which consisted of amateur clubs. Despite being well-attended during the boom of the late 1960s and early 1970s (when Japan's national team won the bronze Olympic medal at the 1968 games in Mexico), the JSL went into decline in the 1980s, in general line with the deteriorating situation worldwide. Fans were few, the grounds were not of the highest quality, and the Japanese national team was not {{on a par with the}} Asian powerhouses. To <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> play domestically, to attempt to garner more fans, and to strengthen the national team, the Japan Football Association (JFA) decided to form a professional league.|$|E

25|$|After the league's first decade, the TT Pro League {{has taken}} steps to internationalise the league {{in an effort to}} <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> its competition. One of the first moves in this regard was to align its {{calendar}} with those of major football leagues around the world. Prior to 2011, the Pro League operated on a spring-to-fall format which caused several conflicts with the FIFA calendar. Consequently, many of the league's top players abandoned their Pro League clubs during June and July to compete in international competitions, which made it difficult for the league to attract supporters for its matches. The schedule change has provided several players greater transfer opportunities to more prominent leagues. The second move was to expand club rosters from 25 to 35 players to provide clubs flexibility during the prolonged calendar featuring three rounds of league competition, five domestic cup competitions, CFU Club Championship, and the CONCACAF Champions League.|$|E
25|$|American {{jazz musicians}} were heard at the Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts, and at {{events in the}} major concert halls in western Germany. Primarily, local musicians played in the clubs. In order to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> {{cultural}} recognition, concert tours by the German Jazz Federation (a merger of the clubs) were increasingly organised. Until {{the end of the}} 1950s, the German jazz scene was strongly fixated on imitating American jazz, and on regaining the period of development it had previously missed. However, from 1954 on, West German jazz slowly departed from the pattern established by this musical role model. The quintet of pianist and composer Jutta Hipp {{played a central role in}} doing so; this group included the saxophonist Emil Mangelsdorff and Joki Freund, who also wrote instrumental compositions. Although Hipp's music was heavily influenced by American role models, she impressed the American jazz critics with her distinctive and independent performances. The peculiarity of her music was an asymmetrical melody in the improvisations, the beginning and end located in unusual places.|$|E
