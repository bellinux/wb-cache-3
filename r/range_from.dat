5|$|Density {{criteria}} <b>range</b> <b>from</b> above 3.5g/cm3 {{to above}} 7g/cm3. Atomic weight definitions can <b>range</b> <b>from</b> greater than sodium (atomic weight 22.98); greater than 40 (excluding s- and f-block metals, hence starting with scandium); {{or more than}} 200, i.e. from mercury onwards. Atomic numbers of heavy metals are generally given as greater than 20 (calcium); sometimes this is capped at 92 (uranium). Definitions based on atomic number have been criticised for including metals with low densities. For example, rubidium in group (column) 1 of the periodic table has an atomic number of 37 but a density of only 1.532g/cm3, which is below the threshold figure used by other authors. The same problem may occur with atomic weight based definitions.|$|E
