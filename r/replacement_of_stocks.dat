50|$|CI&T was {{initially}} founded in 1995 as an IT group working with {{research and development}} (R&D) companies for software development before expanding to provide technical services to nearshore customers. Among the company’s first clients were IBM and Hewlett-Packard (HP), Vale, Natura, and Globo. Later, in 2002, CI&T had a large scale project with HP developing a “electronic order fulfillment” system for the automatic <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> with large distribution companies. CI&T continued to work with Fortune 500 companies and expanded its business to include development centers located in Brazil and China, with clients mainly from in the United States, Brazil, Canada, and Japan to accommodate its business around the world. In 2004, CI&T began working with Drupal in a partnership on application management projects that later expanded to application development and content management {{in one of the}} largest Drupal implementation engagements in the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the {{suburban}} lines tempted KES to extend their streetcar service west from Skøyen as a suburban line; the Lilleaker Line opened to Lilleaker in 1919, to Avløs in 1924 and to Kolsås in 1930. A new section from Jar to Sørbyhaugen opened in 1942, connecting the line from Jar to Kolsås to Nationaltheatret, and making it a rapid transit and the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> with wide suburban standard. This service remained part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier, that had bought all the streetcar companies in 1924.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, the RATP {{possessed a}} large number of {{outdated}} Sprague-Thomson trains, many of which were rapidly approaching 60 and 70 years old. With the MF 77 trains in place along Lines 8, 9, and 13, most of the Sprague were replaced. However, there were still some trains in service along Line 9, which were approaching 80 years old. Those trains were finally retired in 1983, reducing the average age <b>of</b> rolling <b>stock</b> to 14 years. Anticipating further aging in its rolling stock, the RATP changed its policy regarding <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> rolling <b>stock</b> to avoid a massive, simultaneous <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> all rolling <b>stock.</b>|$|R
50|$|Though {{the units}} still remain in service, they are heavily used and {{show signs of}} wear. It is not {{uncommon}} for doors not to shut, and TCDD is planning a major <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> with the Marmaray upgrade that is in progress.|$|R
50|$|The London Transport Executive (LTE) was the {{transport}} authority from 1 January 1948 to 31 December 1962. London Transport {{was taken into}} public ownership and {{became part of the}} British Transport Commission, which brought London Transport and British Railways under the same control for the first and last time. The period saw the start of direct recruitment from the Caribbean and the repair and <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and stations damaged during the war as well as completion of delayed projects such as the Central line eastern extension. The AEC Routemaster bus was introduced in 1956. Trams were withdrawn in 1952 and trolleybuses in 1962.|$|R

Prototype trains were built with two double and two single doors hung on the outside of each carriage of the train, and with electronic traction equipment that gave regenerative and rheostatic braking.|$|R
50|$|RATB is a {{reasonably}} efficient {{and a very}} frequently-used way of getting around Bucharest. As with the Metro, the system is going under a period of renewal.

5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are usually {{based on a}} dump truck chassis, which are then converted into winter {{service vehicles}} either by the manufacturer or an aftermarket third-party. A typical modification involves the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or fibreglass, waterproofing any exposed electronic components, <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> hopper with a specially designed gritting body, {{the addition of a}} plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, bumpers to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra headlamps, a light bar, and retroreflectors for visibility.|$|R

50|$|The railway {{operating}} environment in Armenia sharply deteriorated following {{the collapse of}} the Soviet Union. According to the World Bank, Armenian Railways was in dramatic need of major investment, including the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> rolling <b>stock,</b> rehabilitation <b>of</b> the main line between Yerevan and the Georgian border, renewal of electrification, and bridge reconstruction. Rail transport was slow and unreliable, and traffic remained low compared to European countries with similar sized networks, amounting to only 2.6 million tons of freight and 0.85 million passengers in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Since mid-1990 the State Rail Authority and V/Line {{had been}} {{discussing}} the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> with an XPT from 1993. However, with {{deregulation of the}} Australian airline industry, patronage dropped to around 30%. A {{decision was made to}} cancel the service with the last service operating on 31 August 1991. Appropriately the last services were hauled in New South Wales by 44 class 4458/27 on the Melbourne bound service and 4465/69 on the Sydney bound service, while X class X37 handled the Victorian duties.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the Irish Government {{announced}} the €34 billion Transport 21 proposal for significant improvements to transport infrastructure, with major {{emphasis on the}} railway network. As part <b>of</b> this, large-scale <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> rolling <b>stock</b> was planned, then made up entirely <b>of</b> locomotive-hauled coaching <b>stock,</b> the most based on the British Rail Mark 2 and British Rail Mark 3. IÉ ordered 120 replacement vehicles: in a major departure, the new trains would be 3 and 6 car DMUs rather than locomotive-hauled carriages. This order was extended to 150 vehicles in 2005, to 183 vehicles in 2007 and to 234 vehicles in December 2008.|$|R
2500|$|The {{line was}} built by the Waterloo & City Railway Company and was opened in 1898 (at the time, Bank station was named [...] "City"). When it opened {{it was the second}} {{electric}} underground railway in London, following the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line). For much of its existence, it was owned and operated by two main line rail companies, before it was nationalised into British Rail. Operations were transferred to London Underground in 1994 following a major refurbishment and <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> rolling <b>stock.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{the line}} lost its terminus, its {{passenger}} flow dropped substantially, {{making it more}} local. Presently work is planned to upgrade the surface stations, and to finish <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the rolling <b>stock.</b> The branch service originally having 15 minute intervals now has 7.5 min which makes 1:2 ratio (sometimes 1:1) of trains traveling from Aleksandrovsky Sad.|$|R

5000|$|In 1924 the Middy {{lost its}} {{independence}} and was grouped {{together with the}} London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), but apart from the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> second-hand rolling <b>stock,</b> the railway continued as it always had done. The railway's original LNER Class J64 locomotives were replaced by LNER Class J65 or [...] "Blackwall Tanks" [...] which were eventually replaced by the older but stronger LNER Class J15.|$|R
50|$|The {{first line}} {{underwent}} a thorough refurbishment between 1970 and 1973, which included <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> its rolling <b>stock</b> and a switch from left-hand drive to right-hand drive {{for the sake}} of consistency. In 1973, both lines were extended—the first with one station and the second with four. The lines reached their current lengths of 4.4 km and 10.3 km, respectively. The Budapest Transport Company (BKV) took over operation of the metro that same year.|$|R
5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the factory <b>stock</b> tires with rain tires or {{mud and snow}} tires and the {{shortening}} of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability.

Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|R
25|$|Part of the {{franchise}} agreement required <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> older rolling <b>stock</b> with newer models, and refurbishment of the existing rolling stock. Siemens Combino trams were purchased as the D1 and D2 class, the first of 38 D1 three-car class trams entering service on 19 December 2002 and the first of 21 five-car D2 class trams on 3 March 2004. Z3 and B2 class trams were also internally refurbished by M>Tram, receiving green seat pads, and yellow stanchions and grab rails.|$|R
50|$|A special {{muzzle brake}} was added that could absorb up to 40% of the recoil energy and an elastic butt stock with {{lamellar}} spring was non-rigidly {{attached to the}} receiver. The acoustics of the rifle were also improved by adding a sound suppressor.

50|$|The {{modernisation}} of the Metropolitan line, {{the final}} {{part of the}} New Works programme which had not been completed or scrapped, was finally given the go-ahead by the BTC in 1956. This consisted of electrification between Rickmansworth and Amersham and Chesham, some station reconstruction and the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the rolling <b>stock.</b> Steam locomotives were fully withdrawn from the Underground network on 9 September 1961. By the end of 1962, new A stock trains had replaced all the pre-war stock on the Metropolitan line.|$|R
5000|$|A Winchester Model 70 Classic (claw extractor) {{can also}} easily be {{converted}} to [...]470 Capstick. In addition to the steps above, the magazine box spring must also be replaced with one that has a traditional Z-shape instead of the curly-Q style that the factory provides. The Winchester conversion may only hold 2 cartridges in the magazine box, unless you purchase an extra deep magazine box and bottom metal from Sunny Hill, Williams Firearms, Jim Wisner or Ted Blackburn. Use of an extra deep magazine box necessitates <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> with another stock having greater depth of wood. Alternatively, {{it may be possible}} to fit 3 rounds in a model 70 conversion with the factory magazine box if the follower is replaced with one having a lower profile, or if the follower is milled to shorten it.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades new {{lifestyle}} trends led to a high proliferation rate of domestic appliances that raises overall standby energy consumption. This study investigates the energy savings and CO 2 reduction potential and the economic benefits in a Dutch household in two situations: (1) {{the use of the}} best available technology (BAT) that already exists in the market and (2) the willingness of consumers to use switch off devices in their households and (3) the Effectiveness of the Ecodesign Directive in relevance with standby consumption. With the use of energy loggers, data collected from 44 Dutch households, and a database of 418 electrical appliances was created. Measurements showed a significant energy savings potential in Dutch households with the use of standby reduction devices in the existing stock. Savings can be further increased by enhancing consumer awareness especially by providing information on individual level. The Ecodesign Directive and BAT case resulted lower in energy savings potential as they largely depend on the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> appliances in households...|$|R

40|$|The IEA Reference Scenario {{assumes that}} the {{efficiency}} of energy use - {{the amount of energy}} needed to provide a given amount of energy service - will continue to improve at a pace {{similar to that of the}} past three decades. Because most of the energy-using capital stock has a long life, technological advances can affect the average efficiency of equipment and appliances in use only very gradually. In stationary energy uses in the industrial, commercial and residential sectors, progressive improvements in energy efficiency are assumed to occur as a result of ongoing technological advances. For example, the growing deployment of integrated building designs, which incorporate efficient lighting, heating and cooling systems, will reduce energy consumption per square metre of office space in new office buildings. Energy efficiency standards and labelling programs already in place will continue to encourage more efficient equipment and appliances in these sectors. However, these efficiency improvements will be very gradual, because of the slow rate <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> energy-capital <b>stock,</b> especially buildings...|$|R

5000|$|Head unit: Car stereos {{generally}} {{lag behind}} audio technology. Cassette decks {{have been found}} in cars as late as the 2008 Acura TL, and even in the 2010s the CD player is still a standard part of most car stereos, although their non-car counterparts (i.e. Walkmans) have long disappeared from consumer shelves. For decades most vehicle dashboards had a rectangular [...] "cutout" [...] where the head unit was installed (which went above another rectangular cutout for the HVAC controls), and this allowed for straightforward <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> system with an aftermarket stereo, since audio technology improves faster than model updates from car companies. These cutouts, however, also allowed for easy theft of the car radio. Due to auto manufacturing differences over the years, aftermarket headunit products are manufactured in multiple form factors. The primarily used size is mostly referred to by its legacy name of DIN, which refers to ISO 7736. DIN headunits come as single DIN or double DIN. The trend away from dashboards with cutouts, along with improving car audio technology, has eroded sales from the aftermarket stereo industry.|$|R
