But how? A deceptively simple idea is to distinguish cooperators from defectors by tagging them. It clearly {{is in the interest}} of cooperators to use some distinctive cue to assort with their like. Such an assortment, however, conflicts with the interests of the cheaters, who have every incentive to also acquire that tag. This makes for an inherently unstable situation.

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} {{experimental}} {{play of the}} repeated prisoner’s dilemma when intended actions are implemented with noise. In treatments where cooperation is an equilibrium, subjects cooperate substantially more than in treatments without cooperative equilibria. Furthermore, cooperative strategies yielded higher payoffs than uncooperative strategies in the treatments with cooperative equilibria, and successful strategies were “lenient ” in not retaliating for the first defection and/or “forgiving ” in trying to <b>return</b> to <b>cooperation</b> after inflicting a punishment. In all settings there was considerable strategic diversity, indicating that subjects had not fully learned the distribution of play. There was no difference across treatments in giving in a post-experiment dictator game, and dictator giving was not correlated with cooperation in the treatments with high <b>returns</b> on <b>cooperation.</b> We conclude that cooperation in settings with cooperative equilibria is primarily driven by strategic considerations. † Lead author...|$|R

40|$|Various {{theories}} have arisen {{to explain why}} joint liability, group-based lending can be an improvement over traditional individual-based lending. But these theories are rarely tested. Here we exploit {{the idea that if}} a model were true, observed repayment rates would vary systematically. We sign the derivative of repayment rates with respect to (exogenous) change in covariates. The basic models are four representative and often cited models of joint liability lending, featuring moral hazard in project choice, monitoring by non-borrowing members, strategic default, and adverse selection. The paper places all these models on a common empirical footing, deriving and highlighting the key project selection, monitoring equation, default region, and risk selection equation, respectively. The paper also features some new implications, signing the derivative of repayment rates with respect to co-variation of <b>returns,</b> <b>cooperation</b> among borrowers, selection criteria, and loan size, for example. The models agree on some dimensions and conflict on others. For example, we find that several (but not all...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{explaining}} how proximity between firms affects cooperation in R&D. For that purpose, it is proposed a three-stage game amongst three firms where each firm decides about location, R&D and output. Firms 2 ̆ 019 decision about location determines a R&D spillover, which is {{inversely related to}} the distance between firms. R&D output {{is assumed to be}} cost reducing and exhibit diminishing <b>returns.</b> <b>Cooperation</b> is only allowed in the R&D stage. Our results allow us to conclude that there is a positive relationship between R&D output equilibrium and the distance between firms when firms act independently. When firms cooperate in R&D, R&D output for a cooperating firm increases with the degree of information sharing between them, as well as with a reduction of the distance between cooperating firms. Firms 2 ̆ 019 decision about location is also affected by R&D activities: if R&D activities run independently, the clustering of firms only occurs for a convex spillover function; if R&D activities run cooperatively, clustering is always observed if there is an increased information sharing between firms.

Research and development (R&D) partnerships also generate higher abnormal returns (relative to production or marketing agreements). On average, smaller firms in the partnership seem to appropriate a very significant share of the cooperative surplus, especially when they receive large technology payments or when the partnership is concluded in the R&D stage.
