40|$|The {{determination}} of mechanical property {{data in the}} semi-solid region is vital for developing hot tearing numerical models. The mechanical properties are measured either during cooling from the fully liquid state or during reheating from the fully solid state. An experimental program was conducted comparing the two techniques on AA 196, Al - 0. 5 wt% Cu and Al - 2 wt% Cu alloys. Hot tear experiments were conducted using the CAST Hot Tear rig which measures load development during solidification. The same alloys were tested in an apparatus developed to <b>test</b> <b>reheated</b> alloys at temperatures above the solidus. A model was used to estimate the effect of solid state diffusion during the <b>reheating</b> <b>test.</b> Load development from the hot tear test and maximum stress from hot tensile tests were compared {{as a function of}} fraction solid. The results of this comparison and challenges faced in conducting these types of tests are discussed in this paper...|$|R
25|$|Based upon designs {{produced}} by Power Jets, Rolls-Royce produced more advanced and powerful turbojet engines. Beyond numerous improvements {{made to the}} Welland engine that powered the early Meteors, Rolls-Royce and Power Jets collaborated to develop the more capable Derwent engine, which as the Rover B.26 had undergone a radical re-design from the W.2B/500 while at Rover. The Derwent engine, and the re-designed Derwent V based on the Nene, was installed {{on many of the}} later production Meteors, the adoption of this new powerplant led to considerable performance increases. The Meteor often served {{as the basis for the}} development of other early turbojet designs; a pair of Meteor F.4s were sent to Rolls-Royce to aid in their experimental engine trials, RA435 being used for <b>reheat</b> <b>testing,</b> and RA491 being fitted with the Rolls-Royce Avon, an axial-flow engine. From their involvement in the development of the Meteor's engines, Armstrong-Siddeley, Bristol Aircraft, Metropolitan-Vickers, and de Havilland would also independently develop their own gas turbine engines.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study {{the effect of the}} Si content on the morphology, amount, and {{distribution}} of fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4), three low-carbon steels with different Si contents were selected, and <b>reheating</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted in an industrial furnace in a hot strip plant. The results show that Si distributes in two forms—first, Fe 2 SiO 4, in the innermost layer of the oxide scale, and, second, granular SiO 2, dispersively distributed in the matrix near the scale. In addition, Fe 2 SiO 4 appears in a net-like form in the innermost layer of the oxide scale close to the iron matrix when the Si content is 1. 21 wt. %. However, no obvious net-like Fe 2 SiO 4 is observed when the Si content is less than 0. 25 wt. %. Moreover, the inhibition effect of the solid Fe 2 SiO 4 on the oxidation reaction plays a more important role than the promotion effect of the liquid Fe 2 SiO 4 during the entire oxidation reaction. Therefore, the total thickness of the scale decreases with the increase in Si content...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program was to establish feasibility of a process to produce low cost aluminum oxide fibers having sufficient strength, flexibility, and thermal stability for multiple re-use at temperatures to 1480 C in advanced RSI type heat shields for reentry vehicles. Using bench-scale processing apparatus, the Alcoa 'Saphiber' process was successfully modified to produce nominally 8 microns diameter polycrystalline alpha-alumina fiber. Thermal stability was demonstrated in vacuum <b>reheating</b> <b>tests</b> to 1371 C and in atmospheric reheating to 1483 C. Individual fiber properties of strength, modulus, and flexibility were not determined because of friability and short length of the fiber. Rigidized tile produced from fiber of nominally 8, 20 and 40 micron diameter had thermal conductivities significantly {{higher than those of}} RSI SiO 2 or mullite at relatively low temperature but became comparable above about 1000 C. Tile densities were high due to short fiber length, especially in the coarser diameter fiber. No significant effect of fiber diameter on thermal properties could be determined form the data. Mechanical properties of tiles deteriorated as fiber diameter increased...|$|R

Furthermore, whilst reheating the meals would have afforded some protection, many members ate the meals cold and the <b>reheating</b> procedures <b>tested</b> at the club did not heat the food to sufficient temperatures to render it safe [18].|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} needs of forward {{deployed}} soldiers and disaster relief personnel, a mobile water distillation system was designed and tested. This system uses waste engine heat from the exhaust flow of an internal combustion engine to vaporize water for the purpose of removing impurities. The vapor is condensed back down to water in a finned condenser that experiences forced convection. The system pumps heat transfer oil through a 0. 61 meter long, cross flow, annulus-type heat exchanger installed over a section of exhaust pipe where the oil experiences a AT of 7 °C. The hot heat transfer oil is then piped to a boiler where it releases its heat to the water and returns to the exhaust heat exchanger to be <b>reheated.</b> <b>Testing</b> demonstrated that the system has a heat up time of 30 minutes, and a steady state distillation rate of 2 gallons per hour. In steady state, the system removes and transfers heat from the exhaust at a rate of 4600 Watts. by Kevin S. Mears. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|In this study, two silicon-containing steels with {{different}} P contents were used, and <b>reheating</b> <b>tests</b> {{were conducted in}} an industrial furnace in a hot strip plant. The effect of P on the microstructure and melting temperature of Fe 2 SiO 4 in silicon-containing steels was investigated using a backscattered electron (BSE) detector and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The melting process of Fe 2 SiO 4 was also observed in situ for the two steels {{with different}} P contents. The {{results show that the}} addition of P could lower the melting point of the eutectic compound Fe 2 SiO 4 /FeO, which is helpful for descaling the oxide scale. The melting point decreases with the increasing P content, and the melting point of Fe 2 SiO 4 /FeO can reduce up to 954. 2 °C when the content of P reaches 0. 115 wt %. Furthermore, P-compounds form in the dispersive particles located in the iron matrix near the interface between the matrix and inner oxide scale when the P content is relatively high. In addition, a method of in situ observation was proposed to study the effect of P on the melting point of Fe 2 SiO 4 /FeO in silicon-containing steel. The results are of more practical significance for the descaling of oxide scale in silicon-containing steel...|$|R

40|$|Reheat {{cracking}} is used {{to occur}} in HAZs of Cr-Mo steels during reheating {{at the time the}} grain boundary is weekend by the phosphorus segregation. In this research, the effects of applied stress, and reheating time and temperature on the grain boundary weakening were clarified on HAZ of 1 Cr- 1 / 2 Mo steel. A <b>reheat</b> cracking <b>test</b> and, metallurgical examination including grain boundary etching were carried out. Much attention was paid on the relation between the angle of each grain boundary line to the stress, and its phosphorus concentration. The following results were ontained. (1) In the temperature-raising process with a heating rate of 200 K/hr, phosphorus concentration of grain boundary becomes maximum at 823 K. (2) In the temperature-holding process in the range of 773 to 873 K, the maximum value of phosphorus concentration is observed at 823 K for 5 hours. (3) The phosphorus concentration is decreased by continuous heating up to 873 K or by holding at 823 K for a prolonged time. At this time period, the HAZ recovers from the weakened state. (4) The stress will intensity the phosphorus segregation in grain boundary by its direct action or by its indirect action of producing sliding at grain boundary.

40|$|Two main {{topics are}} {{dealt with in}} this thesis. Firstly, the {{performance}} of condensing boilers with finned tube heat exchangers and premix burners is evaluated. Secondly, ways of avoiding condensate formation in the flue system are evaluated. In the first investigation, a transient heat transfer approach is used to predict performance of different boiler configurations connected to different heating systems. The smallest efficiency difference between heat loads and heating systems is obtained when the heat exchanger gives a small temperature difference between flue gases and return water, the heat transfer coefficient is low and the thermostat hysteresis is large. Taking into account heat exchanger size, the best boiler is one with higher heat transfer per unit area which only causes a small efficiency loss. The total heating cost at part load, including gas and electricity, has a maximum at the lowest simulated heat load. The heat supplied by the circulation heat pump is responsible for this. The second investigation evaluates methods of drying the flue gases. Reheating the flue gases in different ways and water removal in an adsorbent bed are evaluated. <b>Reheating</b> is <b>tested</b> in two specially designed boilers. The necessary reheating is calculated to approximately 100 - 150 C if an uninsulated masonry chimney is used. The tested boilers show {{that it is possible}} to design a proper boiler. The losses, stand-by and convective/radiative, must be kept at a minimum in order to obtain a high efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{short-term}} {{performance of}} the stone matrix asphalt (SMA) prepared with various warm-mix techniques (Evotherm TM 3 G, Sasobit®, and foamed asphalt) was conducted using extensive laboratory tests and on-site stiffness measurement. The laboratory tests included the complex modulus, flow number, loaded wheel track, indirect tension (IDT) creep and strength, and semi-circular beam (SCB) fracture. In the laboratory tests, plant-produced mixes were compacted in the laboratory with and without <b>reheating,</b> and performance <b>tests</b> were conducted at various curing time periods after compaction. In addition, light weight deflectometer (LWD) tests were conducted to monitor the in-situ pavement stiffness development of the warm SMA field sections. This study concludes that SMA containing different warm mix asphalt (WMA) additives show comparable performance with the control SMA. Both laboratory and field test results do not indicate any evidence that a longer curing time is needed before allowing traffic on warm SMA pavements. The mixtures containing WMA additives show similar variations in mixture properties due to curing tim...|$|R
40|$|Some defects on {{the surface}} of carbon steel {{do not need to be}} removed before hot rolling because the surface will be vigorously {{oxidised}} in a reheating environment. Thus the defects can be minimised by oxidising and then removed by the de-scaling process. The defects {{on the surface}} of ferritic stainless steels, however, are not easily removed by oxidation when a high chromium concentration is used. In this paper, a ferritic stainless steel grade 445 was selected as a research material. The effects of different surface features on oxidation and tribological behaviour in the hot rolling process were investigated. Three surface states were prepared, namely, smooth surface, surface with 45 ° grinding marks and surface with oscillation marks. The samples were put into an electric furnace at 1100 °C for <b>reheating.</b> Hot rolling <b>tests</b> were carried out on a 2 -high Hille 100 experimental rolling mill. Rolling forces were measured, and the coefficient of friction was calculated and compared under various rolling parameters. It was found that the original surface profiles with grinding marks were still maintained during oxidation. The original oxide scale on the surface with oscillation marks caused the formation of irregular oxide nodules and the spallation of the oxide scale. Surface morphology and the reduction in thickness had a significant impact on the oxide scale integrity and coefficient of friction in the hot rolling process...|$|R
