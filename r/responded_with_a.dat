5|$|Both teams traded {{touchdowns in}} the third. The Tigers scored first on a 75-yard Rueben Randle {{reception}} from Jordan Jefferson, and the Crimson Tide <b>responded</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> five-yard Mark Ingram touchdown run.

Turnovers proved costly for Alabama with LSU scoring field goals on drives after a McElroy interception in the first and fumble in the fourth. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–24–5.|$|E

If the target port is open, it will <b>respond</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> SYN-ACK packet. The scanner host <b>responds</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> RST packet, closing the connection before the handshake is completed.
