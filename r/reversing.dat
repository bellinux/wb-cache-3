30|$|Proof. The way {{of proving}} of Theorem 4 {{is similar to}} Theorem 3. By the <b>reverse</b> Hö lder's {{inequality}} [9], we have the <b>reverse</b> of (10) and (14). It is easy to obtain the <b>reverse</b> of (13). In view of the <b>reverses</b> of (13) and (14), we obtain the <b>reverse</b> of (12). On the other hand, suppose that the <b>reverse</b> of (12) is valid. Setting the same g(y) as theorem 3, by the <b>reverse</b> of (10), we have J > 0. If J = ∞, then the <b>reverse</b> of (13) is obvious value; if J < ∞, then by the <b>reverse</b> of (12), we obtain the <b>reverses</b> of (15) and (16). Hence, we have the <b>reverse</b> of (13), which {{is equivalent to the}} <b>reverse</b> of (12).|$|R

5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar solutions that shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by <b>reversing</b> the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E

50|$|Reverse:A similar trick play is a <b>reverse,</b> {{which often}} begins as an end-around.

This abruptly <b>reverses</b> the lateral flow of the play; if the defense is slow to react, the second ball-carrier might make it around {{the end of the line}} to a near-open field. Variations of the basic <b>reverse</b> include the double <b>reverse</b> (which involves a second flow-reversing handoff), exceedingly rare triple <b>reverses</b> involving even more handoffs, the fake <b>reverse</b> described below, and the <b>reverse</b> flea flicker.|$|R

5|$|Rather than {{resubmit}} its 1901 bill, the CLR {{presented a}} much more ambitious alternative for the 1902 parliamentary session. The <b>reversing</b> loops were dropped, and the CLR instead proposed to turn the whole railway into a single large loop by constructing a new southern route between the two existing end points, adopting the committee's recommendation for a Hammersmith to City route. At the western end, new tunnels were to be extended from the dead-end <b>reversing</b> siding west of Shepherd's Bush station and from the depot access tunnel. The route was to pass under Shepherd's Bush Green and run under Goldhawk Road as far as Hammersmith Grove where it was to turn south.

50|$|Attempting {{to select}} <b>reverse</b> while {{the vehicle is}} moving forward causes severe gear wear (except in {{transmissions}} with synchromesh on the <b>reverse</b> gear). However, most manual transmissions have a gate that locks out <b>reverse</b> directly from 5th gear to help prevent this. In order to engage <b>reverse</b> from 5th, the shift lever has to be moved to the center position between 3rd and 4th, then back over and into <b>reverse.</b> Another widespread solution places <b>reverse</b> {{to the left of}} 1st gear, instead of behind the 5th (where one might expect to find a 6th gear). Many newer six-speed manual transmissions have a collar under the shift knob which must be lifted to engage <b>reverse.</b> Other <b>reverse</b> lockout designs include having to push the shift lever inward, toward the floor, to allow engagement of <b>reverse,</b> or requiring the driver to exert additional force to move the shift lever into <b>reverse.</b>|$|R
