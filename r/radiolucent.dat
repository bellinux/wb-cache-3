5|$|X-rays show lucency of the {{ossification}} {{front in}} juveniles. In older people, the lesion typically appears {{as an area}} of osteosclerotic bone with a <b>radiolucent</b> line between the osteochondral defect and the epiphysis. The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and {{on the amount of}} knee flexion used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a <b>radiolucent</b> area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E
25|$|Mammographic density {{refers to}} the {{relative}} proportions of radiodense area compared to the <b>radiolucent</b> area on a mammogram, which is basically an x-ray of the breast. The radiodense area on a mammogram is white and is associated with ductal and lobular epithelium, connective tissue and fluid in the breast. The <b>radiolucent</b> area is dark gray or black and is associated with fat in the breast. High mammographic density {{is associated with a}} higher risk of developing breast cancer, but the reasons for this link are not certain and are being studied. Conversely, patients with very low mammographic breast density were found to hold a poorer prognosis irrespective of age, BMI and menopausal status.|$|E
25|$|On radiography, it {{is normal}} to see thin <b>radiolucent</b> areas {{of less than}} 2mm around hip {{prosthesis}} components, or between a cement mantle and bone. However, these may still indicate loosening of the prosthesis if they are new or changing, and areas greater than 2mm may be harmless if they are stable. In {{the first year after}} insertion of uncemented femoral stems, it is normal to have mild subsidence (less than 10mm).|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect {{a table with a}} segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a <b>radiolucent</b> tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{the focus}} of the test, {{calcification}} within the artery walls, located in the outer edges of atheroma within the artery walls, is sometimes recognizable on fluoroscopy (without contrast injection) as radiodense halo rings partially encircling, and separated from the blood filled lumen by the interceding <b>radiolucent</b> atheroma tissue and endothelial lining. Calcification, even though usually present, is usually only visible when quite advanced and calcified sections of the artery wall happen to be viewed on end tangentially through multiple rings of calcification, so as to create enough radiodensity to be visible on fluoroscopy.|$|E
25|$|Coronary {{catheterization}} {{is performed}} in a catheterization lab, usually located within a hospital. With current designs, the patient must lie relatively flat on a narrow, minimally padded, <b>radiolucent</b> (transparent to X-ray) table. The X-ray source and imaging camera equipment are {{on opposite sides of}} the patient's chest and freely move, under motorized control, around the patient's chest so images can be taken quickly from multiple angles. More advanced equipment, termed a bi-plane cath lab, uses two sets of X-ray source and imaging cameras, each free to move independently, which allows two sets of images to be taken with each injection of radiocontrast agent. The equipment and installation setup to perform such testing typically represents a capital expenditure of US$2â€“5 million (2004), sometimes more, partially repeated every few years.|$|E
500|$|Significant {{cases of}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{are easy to}} diagnose because of the characteristic signs of the condition. In some cases, the signs are subtle, making diagnosis more difficult. Medical imaging is used to diagnose the condition or confirm a diagnosis made using clinical signs. On a chest radiograph, subcutaneous emphysema {{may be seen as}} <b>radiolucent</b> striations in the pattern expected from the pectoralis major muscle group. Air in the subcutaneous tissues may interfere with radiography of the chest, potentially obscuring serious conditions such as pneumothorax. It can also reduce the effectiveness of chest ultrasound. [...] On the other hand, since subcutaneous emphysema may become apparent in chest X-rays before a pneumothorax does, its presence may be used to infer that of the latter injury. Subcutaneous emphysema can also be seen in CT scans, with the air pockets appearing as dark areas. CT scanning is so sensitive that it commonly makes it possible to find the exact spot from which air is entering the soft tissues. [...] In 1994, M.T. Macklin and C.C. Macklin published further insights into the pathophysiology of [...] spontaneous Macklin's Syndrome occurring from a severe asthmatic attack.|$|E

This {{is seen in}} Respiratory distress syndrome ...|$|E
2500|$|Intra-articular {{bodies in}} SOC {{typically}} have popcorn calcification, with a dense sclerotic border with <b>radiolucent</b> central region. [...] This distinct radiographic appearance sets it {{apart from other}} cause of intra-articular bodies. [...] Number and size of intra-articular bodies can prove helpful as well. [...] SOC typically presents as multiple intra-articular bodies. [...] Few or isolated intra-articular bodies are more consistent with trauma or osteoarthritis.|$|E
2500|$|As the X-rays {{pass through}} the patient, they are {{attenuated}} by varying amounts as they pass through or reflect off the different tissues of the body, casting an X-ray shadow of the radiopaque tissues (such as bone tissue) on the fluorescent screen. Images on the screen are produced as the unattenuated or mildly attenuated X-rays from <b>radiolucent</b> tissues interact with atoms in the screen through the photoelectric effect, giving their energy to the electrons. [...] While much of the energy given to the electrons is dissipated as heat, a fraction of it is given off as visible light.|$|E

50|$|Rarefying osteitis is {{a general}} term for a <b>radiolucent</b> lesion on a {{radiograph}} usually diagnosed as a periapical abscess or a periapical cyst.|$|E
50|$|The grid is {{constructed}} {{of a series}} of alternating parallel strips of lead and a <b>radiolucent</b> substance such as a plastic, carbon fibre, aluminium, even paper. The grid is placed between the patient and the detector during the exposure. Primary beam radiation passes through the <b>radiolucent</b> strips as it travels roughly parallel to them, but scattered radiation which has, almost by definition, deviated from the parallel beam, cannot easily pass through the grid as it encounters the lead strips at an angle, and is attenuated, or lost, from the beam.|$|E
5000|$|Diagnosis {{relies on}} {{clinical}} signs and characteristic changes in radiographic {{images of the}} metaphyses. Bone changes can be observed on radiograph, and the disorder may progress to actual angular limb deformity. In the early stage of the illness, the metaphyseal area on X-ray may be observed to have an uneven <b>radiolucent</b> zone parallel to the physis with a thin band of increased radiodensity directly bordering the physis. Early stage radiographic changes have sometimes been described as having a [...] "moth-eaten" [...] appearance (see Figure 3). As the disease progresses, the <b>radiolucent</b> line may disappear and radiodensity may increase in the affected area as the body attempts to repair damage. Relapses can cause new <b>radiolucent</b> lines. This area is often followed by a dark line at the metaphysis, which may progress to new bone growth {{on the outside of}} that area. This area represents microfractures in the metaphysis and bone proliferation to bridge the defect in the periosteum.|$|E

50|$|Pneumomediastinum is {{uncommon}} and {{occurs when}} air leaks into the mediastinum. The diagnosis {{can be confirmed}} via chest X-ray showing a <b>radiolucent</b> outline around the heart and mediastinum or via CT scanning of the thorax.|$|E
5000|$|The {{epithelial}} rests of Malassez {{can become}} cystic, usually forming nondiagnostic, <b>radiolucent</b> apical lesions {{that can be}} seen on radiographs. This occurs as a result of chronic periapical inflammation after pulpitis occurs and must be surgically removed.|$|E
50|$|Most human enteroliths are <b>radiolucent</b> on plain X-rays. They {{sometimes}} can be visualized on CT scans without contrast; presence of contrast in the lumen may reveal the enterolith as a void. Most often, they are visualized using ultrasound.|$|E

50|$|Radiographically it is {{virtually}} impossible to differentiate granuloma from a cyst. If the lesion is large it is more likely to be a cyst. Radiographically both granuloma and cyst appear <b>radiolucent,</b> associated with the apex of non vital tooth.|$|E
50|$|A Gas pyelogram is a pyelogram {{in which}} the kidneys, renal pelvis and ureters are filled with gas, and have a <b>radiolucent</b> appearance. This gas is {{produced}} by some gas producing micro organisms which infect most upper parts of urinary system.|$|E

5000|$|The aortic {{window is}} a {{normally}} <b>radiolucent</b> region below the aortic arch. It is {{formed by the}} [...] of the trachea and traversed by the left pulmonary artery. It is visible in the left anterior oblique radiograph {{of the heart and}} great vessels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{brown tumor}} is a bone lesion that arises in {{settings}} of excess osteoclast activity, such as hyperparathyroidism. It {{is not a}} true neoplasm, as the term [...] "tumor" [...] suggests; however, it may mimic a true neoplasm. Brown tumours are <b>radiolucent</b> on x-ray.|$|E
5000|$|The {{radiographic}} {{features of}} periapical inflammatory lesions {{vary depending on}} the time course of the lesion. Because very early lesionsmay not show any radiographic changes, diagnosis of these lesions relies solely on the clinical symptoms [...] More chronic lesions may show lytic (<b>radiolucent)</b> or sclerotic (radiopaque) changes, or both.|$|E
5000|$|Saturation {{levels of}} uric acid in blood {{may result in}} one form of kidney stones when the urate {{crystallizes}} in the kidney. These uric acid stones are <b>radiolucent</b> and so do not appear on an abdominal plain X-ray.
