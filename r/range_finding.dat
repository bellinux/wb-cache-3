5|$|In the 1960s, Ehlers {{collaborated with}} Felix Pirani and Alfred Schild on a constructive-axiomatic {{approach}} to general relativity: {{a way of}} deriving the theory from a minimal set of elementary objects {{and a set of}} axioms specifying these objects' properties. The basic ingredients of their approach are primitive concepts such as event, light ray, particle and freely falling particle. At the outset, spacetime is a mere set of events, without any further structure. They postulated the basic properties of light and freely falling particles as axioms, and with their help constructed the differential topology, conformal structure and, finally, the metric structure of spacetime, that is: the notion of when two events are close to each other, the role of light rays in linking up events, and a notion of distance between events. Key steps of the construction correspond to idealized measurements, such the standard <b>range</b> <b>finding</b> used in radar. The final step derived Einstein's equations from the weakest possible set of additional axioms. The result is a formulation that clearly identifies the assumptions underlying general relativity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{battlefield}} {{use of the}} mitrailleuse as artillery was a fatally flawed concept. To {{avoid being}} hit by Dreyse rifle fire, the mitrailleuse batteries were systematically deployed beyond about 1,400m (1,500 yards) from the Prussian lines. [...] Although the maximum range of the mitrailleuses was 3,400m (3,700 yards), the distances at which they were typically engaged rarely exceeded 2,000m (2100 yards) which was less than the reach of French field artillery. However accurate fire at 1500 yards was always extremely difficult to achieve with the typical open sights present on the mitrailleuse. For instance, mitrailleuse bullet impacts on the ground could not be observed {{in the far distance}} unless enemy ranks had been disrupted by hits from them. It may be noted that modern machine guns are typically used at ranges far shorter than their maximum range—the M60 machine gun, for instance, is normally used at an effective range of 1,100m (1,200 yards), compared to its maximum range of 3,725m (4,074 yards). The mitrailleuse, by contrast, was often used at the outer edges of its range and without the benefit of optical <b>range</b> <b>finding</b> equipment.

Traditional motion planners for mobile ground robots with a laser range sensor mostly depend on the obstacle map of the navigation environment where both the highly precise laser sensor and the obstacle map building work of the environment are indispensable. We show that, through an asynchronous deep reinforcement learning method, a mapless motion planner can be trained end-to-end without any manually designed features and prior demonstrations. The trained planner can be directly applied in unseen virtual and real environments. The experiments show that the proposed mapless motion planner can navigate the nonholonomic mobile robot to the desired targets without colliding with any obstacles.

40|$|Phosphatidylserine {{exposure}} {{occurs in}} {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) from sickle cell disease (SCD) patients and is increased by deoxygenation. The mechanisms responsible remain unclear. RBCs from SCD patients also have elevated cation permeability, and, in particular, a deoxygenation-induced cation conductance which mediates Ca 2 + entry, providing an obvious link with phosphatidylserine exposure. The role of Ca 2 + was investigated using FITC-labelled annexin. Results confirmed high phosphatidylserine exposure in RBCs from SCD patients increasing upon deoxygenation. When deoxygenated, phosphatidylserine exposure was further elevated as extracellular [Ca 2 +] was increased. This effect was inhibited by dipyridamole, intracellular Ca 2 + chelation, and Gardos channel inhibition. Phosphatidylserine exposure was reduced in high K+ saline.

We demonstrate that the learned navigation model is directly transferable to previously unseen virtual and, more interestingly, real-world environments.
