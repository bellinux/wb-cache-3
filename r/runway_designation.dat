25|$|The <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> {{was changed}} from 15/33 to 14/32 during the 2010s.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport is}} located at an {{altitude}} of 86 meters (282 ft) above sea level, has a paved surface of the <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> numbers 15/33 measuring 2,067 x 45 meters so that a 13/31 measuring 2,750 x 45 meters, capable of handling Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.|$|E
50|$|New {{terminal}} {{buildings and}} tarmac ramp areas were also constructed. <b>Runway</b> <b>designation</b> 09/27 {{which was the}} primary runway for commercial air service in the 1950s and early 1960s was deactivated after the newer, longer runway 05/23 was open for aircraft flights. Pago Pago International Airport was opened to jet service in 1964 to stimulate tourism and a new local economy.|$|E
50|$|On December 17, 2009 the <b>runway</b> <b>designations</b> were changed, {{the former}} <b>runway</b> <b>designations</b> were: 9L-27R, 9R-27L and 13-31.|$|R
5000|$|Peter O. Knight Airport covers {{an area of}} 110 acre at an {{elevation}} of 8 ft above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 4/22 measuring 3580 by 100 ft and 18/36 measuring 2688 by 75 ft. On January 13, 2011, the <b>runway</b> <b>designations</b> have been change due to {{a shift in the}} Earth's magnetic headings. Runway 3/21 has become 4/22 and runway 17/35 has become 18/36. As of mid 2009 UNICOM Frequency is 122.725 ...|$|R
50|$|Tampa International Airport covers {{an area of}} 3300 acre at an {{elevation}} of 26 feet (8 m) above mean sea level. It has three runways: 10/28 is 6,999 by 150 feet (2,133 x 46 m) with an asphalt/concrete surface; 19L/1R is 8,300 by 150 feet (2,530 x 46 m) with an asphalt/concrete surface; 19R/1L is 11,002 by 150 feet (3,353 x 46 m) with a concrete surface. On January 13, 2011 the <b>runway</b> <b>designations</b> changed due to {{a shift in the}} magnetic headings. 9/27 became 10/28, 18R/36L became 1L/19R, 18L/36R became 1R/19L.|$|R
50|$|McAllen Miller International Airport covers {{an area of}} 370 acres (150 ha) at an {{elevation}} of 107 feet (33 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 14/32 is 7,120 by 150 feet (2,170 x 46 m) and 18/36 is 2,638 by 60 feet (804 x 18 m). In November 2015 the <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> of 13/31 was changed to 14/32 and an EMAS, engineered materials arrestor system, was installed at the runway 14 approach end.|$|E
50|$|The airport resides at an {{elevation}} of 8976 ft above mean sea level. It has one asphalt paved runway designated 06/24 which measures 2424 x 66 ft. There is a down slope of 1.75% up to about 418 ft from the threshold of runway 06. The airport provides Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS) on VHF Frequency. <b>Runway</b> <b>Designation,</b> threshold (THR), touch down zone (TDZ) and Centre Line are marked. No re-fuelling facilities are available. There is a terminal building for passengers.|$|E
50|$|Runway designations {{change over}} time because the {{magnetic}} poles slowly drift on the Earth's surface and the magnetic bearing will change. Depending on the airport location and how much drift takes place, {{it may be necessary}} over time to change the <b>runway</b> <b>designation.</b> As runways are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10 degrees, this will affect some runways more than others. For example, if the magnetic heading of a runway is 233 degrees, it would be designated Runway 23. If the magnetic heading changed downwards by 5 degrees to 228, the Runway would still be Runway 23. If on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226 (Runway 23), and the heading decreased by only 2 degrees to 224, the runway should become Runway 22. Because the drift itself is quite slow, <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require an accompanying change in aeronautical charts and descriptive documents. When runway designations do change, especially at major airports, it is often changed at night as taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers {{at each end of the}} runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators. In July 2009 for example, London Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom changed its runway designations from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night.|$|E
5000|$|On April 10, 1941, {{construction}} {{began on}} a project funded by the Works Progress Administration and the Civil Aeronautics Administration to bring the airport to a standard for national defense purposes. The airport now had two 4000’ x 150’ paved <b>runways,</b> with the <b>designations</b> 17/35 and 5/23. The {{total cost of the}} improvements was over $550,000. In a separate project in 1941, runway lights were added, as well as obstruction lights in the nearby fields. [...] In 1956, Runway 17/35 was lengthened by 500’ at the southern end.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport is}} {{equipped}} with a 3000 meter long precision runway with two instrumental landing systems, as well as a helicopter landing pad. For medium-haul aircraft 16 parking positions are available. Linz Airport is actually a military airport but with a civil right of use. The civil part is located north of the landing strip. To the south lie the second largest barracks of Austria as well as a military airfield named “Fliegerhorst Vogler”. On 1 November 2010, both runway 09/27 and helicopter landing pad 07/25 were renamed to runway 08/26 and helicopter landing pad 07/25 due to permanent changes in the magnetic declination. Since the submitted variation of the compass rose results in such a magnetic value which lies closer to 08/26 than the existing identification code 09/27, the Austrian flight control Austro Control initiated the tracking of the new <b>runway</b> <b>designation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{rotating}} beacon {{is at the}} north end of the airport. The Runway and Taxiways have medium intensity lighting systems (MILS). Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) are at each end of the runway, as well as lights showing the end of the threshold. A Precision Approach Path Indicator system is at each end. “Lighted airfield signs at IFP are at aircraft hold positions, taxiway intersections, and at the intersection of the connecting taxiways and runways”. [...] There are also mandatory hold signs. The medium intensity runway lighting can be turned on by a pilot clicking the radio transmission button in the cockpit. Airfield markings control the traffic efficiently on the ground. Runway 16/34 has centerline, threshold markings, aiming points, and <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> markings. Taxiways have hold short markings before runway intersections and centerlines. The Airport’s aprons have centerlines to control traffic and designated tie down areas. A segmented circle is located close to the airport for visual reference on how a pilot should perform the traffic pattern for the Runway.|$|E
50|$|The aerodrome {{is owned}} by the local {{government}} and used for pioneer flight operations. The coordinates are 00 47 North, 114 34 East. The elevation is not officially published, only measured from the aircraft altimeter, which is about 650 ft above sea level. The <b>runway</b> <b>designation</b> is 02 and 20. The length of the runway is 750 meter with width of 23 meter. A stopway of 30 meter is provided for runway 02. The runway surface is asphalt and its strength can accommodate up to CASA 212 aircraft. It has an apron, taxiway, but a tower building is not available since the aerodrome is a non controlled aerodrome. The runway is not equipped with landing direction indicators and, due to local prevailing surface winds at most of the time, the preferred takeoff and landing direction is runway 02. A significant obstacle is the hilly forest in the northerly direction of the extension of runway 02. The first obstacle is about 200 feet high above runway elevation located about 533.3 meters from the end of runway 02, and the second obstacle is about 500 feet above runway elevation 1.262,9 meters from the end of runway 02. Runway slope inclination is 3% from direction of runway 02.|$|E
