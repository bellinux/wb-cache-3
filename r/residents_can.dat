5|$|Many {{of the new}} routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} continue into downtown Washington, as they once had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents {{would be forced to}} pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District <b>residents</b> <b>can</b> readily access.

5|$|After taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, {{reducing}} {{his salary}} by 8% {{early in his}} first year as mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city <b>residents</b> <b>can</b> meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.|$|E
5|$|Walter and Astrid {{find the}} source of the {{electromagnetic}} pulse, and begin investigating the house the pulse was built on. At the same time, Peter and Olivia go to a rural meeting place where the sheriff said they would find the truck's owner, only to be shot at by the sheriff and his deputy, who are hell bent on keeping the town's secret. Walter manages to turn off the pulse, and all of the townsfolk revert to their deformed appearance. The daughter of one of the army scientists saves Olivia and Peter from getting shot, and explains that her father stayed in Edina to perfect the pulse. After Walter pleads to Broyles to let the townspeople keep their secret, the Fringe team decides to not report the case so that the remaining <b>residents</b> <b>can</b> live a normal life.|$|E
5|$|The A9, {{the great}} road {{connecting}} Edinburgh with Inverness {{and the far}} north, once ran through Evanton, {{on the path of}} Balconie Street. However, a bypass was created as part of a general scheme to shorten the journey between Inverness to Invergordon. This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village, but decreased the revenue available to local businesses. The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone, distorting the shape of the fields. This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village. For those who do not have cars, the only means of transport is either by foot or by the #25 bus service operated by Stagecoach. Recently, the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began to stop in Evanton. Now <b>residents</b> <b>can</b> travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall, making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport.|$|E
50|$|The {{applicability}} of jurisdiction {{in cases involving}} activities over the Internet is interesting because an out-of-state <b>resident</b> <b>can</b> very easily cause an impact {{in the state in}} question, leading to questions of how large the impact need be before exercising jurisdiction is constitutional.|$|R
50|$|The newly {{refurbished}} {{ground floor}} {{is home to}} the coffeehouse, a quiet study lounge, and scattered chairs, tables, and sofas for residents' use. At the Lynton Towers Coffeehouse, any <b>resident</b> <b>can</b> obtain free coffee, tea, snacks, and games for consumption and use.|$|R

50|$|Since {{there was}} no room for 351 mailboxes, a kind of {{paternoster}} system was designed for mail in consultation with the nation postal service TNT Post; in the lobby of the building, a <b>resident</b> <b>can</b> have his or her box appear by keying in a code. Residents also receive a keycard which gives them access to their apartment and storage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beginning}} of modern education in Travancore {{can be traced}} to the issue of the Royal Rescript by Rani Gouri Parvati Bai in 1817.

The same applies for residents not living on a direct connection to the schools, churches {{and most of the}} clubs. Yet, <b>residents</b> <b>can</b> use the hire car service which is operates as a point-to-point minibus shuttle service (e.g. operating on a basis similar to SuperShuttle airport services in the States). <b>Residents</b> <b>can</b> also drive their own golf carts or bicycles to travel around DB as an alternative. The internal buses charge $4.4.|$|E
