6000|$|... {Red Cloud} [...] Well spoken, O War Chief. By {{voices in}} [...] council we learn our minds, and that, too, is [...] strength. Also, is it {{kindness}}. For kindness [...] and strength and beauty are one. The eagle in [...] the high {{blue of the}} sky is beautiful. The salmon [...] leaping the white water in the sunlight is beautiful. [...] The young man fastest of foot in the race [...] is beautiful. And because they fly well, and leap [...] well, and run well, are they beautiful. Beauty [...] must beget beauty. The <b>ring-tail</b> <b>cat</b> begets [...] the <b>ring-tail</b> <b>cat,</b> the dove the dove. Never [...] does the dove beget the <b>ring-tail</b> <b>cat.</b> Hearts [...] must be kind. The little turtle is not kind. [...] That {{is why it is}} the little turtle. It lays its [...] eggs in the sun-warm sand and forgets its young [...] forever. And the little turtle is forever the [...] Kttle turtle. But we are not little turtles, [...] because we are kind. We do not leave our young [...] to the sun in the sand. Our women keep our [...] young warm under their hearts, and, after, they [...] keep them warm with deer-skin and campfire. [...] Because we are kind we are men and not little [...] turtles, and that is why we eat the little turtle [...] that is not strong because it is not kind.|$|E
5000|$|NVC {{adopted the}} wildcat mascot after then President Jacqueline Claunch {{came up with}} the idea in the {{academic}} year 2000-2001. During that time, a mountain lion had been roaming the woods behind the campus to give birth to her young. The graduation that year in May was remarkable because of posted signs that stated [...] "Beware of the wildcat!" [...] Also while crossing a bridge, Claunch encountered a <b>ring-tail</b> <b>cat.</b> A bobcat was later sighted in that same area. Thus after several viewings of undomesticated felines, the wildcat became the NVC mascot.|$|E
50|$|The Central American cacomistle's body is 38-47 cm in length, {{which is}} {{attached}} to a tail of approximately the same length, if not longer (typically 39-53 cm long). The male cacomistle is often slightly longer than its female counterpart, however both male and female have approximately the same weight, usually between 1 and 1.5 kg. Their body consists of dark brown and grey fur, which stands as a stark contrast to the black and white striped tail. The tail stripes are the most defined near the animal's posterior end and gradually fade to a solid black {{at the end of the}} tail. The cacomistle is often confused with its close relative the Ring-tailed cat (Scientific name: Bassariscus astutus) because of the similarity of their appearance, but unlike the <b>ring-tail</b> <b>cat</b> the cacomistle does not have retractable claws. The cacomistle can also be identified by its faded tail and the observation of ears that come to a point.|$|E
500|$|Common daytime animals include mule deer, rock squirrels, pinyon jays, and whiptail and {{collared}} lizards (...) [...] Desert cottontails, jackrabbits, and Merriam's kangaroo rats {{come out}} at night. Cougars, bobcats, coyotes, badgers, gray foxes, and <b>ring-tail</b> <b>cats</b> are the top predators.|$|R
50|$|The Wilderness {{is home to}} a {{wide variety}} of animals. Black-tailed deer are common, while black bear, coyotes, bobcats, <b>ring-tail</b> <b>cats,</b> and {{mountain}} lions are less common but still may be seen. A number of small mammals, particularly members of the rodent and weasel families, inhabit the area. Many species of birds can be seen in the Wilderness, including eagles, hawks, falcons, goshawks, owls, Steller's jays, and ravens.|$|R
60|$|And in the meantime, running {{endlessly}} with Jerry {{over the}} ranch, he learned {{all the ways}} of it and all the life {{of it from the}} chickenyards and the duck-ponds to the highest pitch of Sonoma Mountain. He learned where the wild deer, in their season, were to be found; when they raided the prune-orchard, the vineyards, and the apple-trees; when they sought the deepest canyons and most secret coverts; and when they stamped out in open glades and on bare hillsides and crashed and clattered their antlers together in combat. Under Jerry's leadership, always running second and after on the narrow trails as a subdued dog should, he learned the ways and habits of the foxes, the coons, the weasels, and the <b>ring-tail</b> <b>cats</b> that seemed compounded of cat and coon and weasel. He came to know the ground-nesting birds and the difference between the customs of the valley quail, the mountain quail, and the pheasants. The traits and lairs of the domestic cats gone wild he also learned, as did he learn the wild loves of mountain farm-dogs with the free-roving coyotes.|$|R
