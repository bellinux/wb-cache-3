25|$|By far, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used commercial process for treating acid mine drainage is lime precipitation in a high-density sludge (HDS) process. In this application, a slurry of lime is dispersed into a tank containing acid mine drainage and <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> to increase water pH to about 9. At this pH, most toxic metals become insoluble and precipitate, aided by the presence of <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge.</b> Optionally, air may be introduced in this tank to oxidize iron and manganese and assist in their precipitation. The resulting slurry is directed to a sludge-settling vessel, such as a clarifier. In that vessel, clean water will overflow for release, whereas settled metal precipitates (sludge) will be recycled to the acid mine drainage treatment tank, with a sludge-wasting side stream. A number of variations of this process exist, as dictated by the chemistry of ARD, its volume, and other factors. Generally, the products of the HDS process also contain gypsum and unreacted lime, which enhance both its settleability and resistance to re-acidification and metal mobilization.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{potential}} benefits of optimal control applied to the activated sludge wastewater treatment process. The optimal control approach is motivated by the need to compromise between treatment efficiency and operational costs. In this sense this approach differs from a previous activated-sludge control scheme, in which only control effectiveness was taken into account. Two separate control problems are addressed, with differing scope and methodologies, but still in the optimality context. Dis-solved oxygen control is considered first, and a discrete-time optimal output regulator is designed. Then the atten-tion is focused on <b>recycle</b> <b>sludge</b> manipulation for which two different feedback schemes are evaluted. From the simulations it appears how the effectiveness of a control scheme depends almost entirely on a proper choice of the cost functional. ...|$|R

A pilot experiment was conducted to investigate the appropriate ratio of <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge,</b> the appropriate operating conditions, and the mechanism involved in the enhancement of phosphate removal by return chemical sludge. The results showed that, with sludge recirculation, the process of coagulation for phosphate removal was enhanced by up to 12 % compared with no sludge recirculation. Those effects were primarily attributed to the removal of relatively fine particles with a size of 100 - 310 mu m. The sludge settleability was also improved {{by the addition of}} chemical sludge, which was mainly attributed to the increase in floc size. The appropriate ratio of <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> was determined to be around 15 - 20 %. Mixing and the aging time of <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> had a significant effect on phosphate removal.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was devoted to}} studying the improvement of removal efficiency of pollutants in terms of COD and SS from municipal wastewater by using a modified primary treatment system. The modified system involved recycling {{a portion of the}} settled primary sludge and mixing it with the incoming raw sewage in a flocculation tank to induce bioflocculation, biosorption and particle adsorption/enmeshment. In order to maximize biosorption, the <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> was pre-aerated for a controlled period from 15 to 60 minutes to induce microbial growth. The flocculation time was 30 minutes at a mixing speed of 60 rpm, equivalent to a tip velocity of 0. 126 m/s. The MLSS concentration was maintained at 6000 mg/L in the flocculator. It was found that both COD and SS removal efficiencies in the modified system were consistently higher than those without sludge recycling. In this particular study, the best performance was obtained with 60 -min sludge aeration. Under such a condition, the <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> had developed sufficient microbial growth to achieve an SOUR (specific oxygen uptake rate) of 72 mg O 2 /g-MLSS-hr. The average removal efficiencies for COD and SS were 48. 1 % and 61. 6 % respectively, while the corresponding efficiencies for the control unit (no sludge recycling) were only 35 % and 52. 0 %. These values represented an improvement of 37. 4 % [i. e., (48. 1 %- 35 %) / 35 % = 37. 4 %] for COD and 18. 5 % for SS. When the sludge aeration was reduced to 30 minutes, its SOUR value was also decreased to 60 mg O 2 /g-MLSS-hr. The treatment improvement were 34. 8 % for COD and 10. 8 % for SS. When the aeration was further reduced to 15 minutes, the corresponding improvement were 26. 8 % for COD and 17. 7 % for SS. Thus, appropriate aeration of the <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> could provide proper bacterial growth to enhance the sorption capacity as well as to achieve partial oxidation of the biosorbed pollutants. The experimental data also showed that without sludge aeration, some particulate pollutants could be hydrolyzed and released back to solution, thereby causing increases of both COD and SS in the treated effluent...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to show wether the sewer system in front of a wastewater treatment plant might be used as an additional pretreatment process stage. The investigations were carried out on a pilot plant consisting of 450 m of sewer (DN 100) with a subsequent grit chamber and a primary clarifier. To enhance the biomass concentration within the investigated sewer system <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> from the primary clarifier was added at different points and in different concentrations. The results show that for an efficient removal of wastewater constituents within the sewer system the oxygen concentration in the wastewater is the critical parameter. At low oxygen concentrations up to 0. 1 mg/l a considerable amount of substances from the <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> dissolve into the wastewater, thereby almost completely covering the scarce aerobic biodegradation. Intensive aeration of the atmosphere of the sewer didn't improve the situation. The addition of chemically bound oxygen in form of nitrate (recycled from the aerobic reactor of the respective wastewater treatment plant) is biochemically appropriate, as denitrification experiments show, but its application is hindered by the hydraulic limits of the sewer system. Intensive aeration by adding aeration devices to the sewer system at an equal distance of 50 meters showed only little improvement of removal rates. The use of the sewer system as a preceding process stage basically is possible, but several aspects considerably hinder its technical application: the aeration of a reactor which has a hight of only few decimeters; the need of expensive and difficult open and closed loop control technique; the necessity of putting out of operation during storm water discharge; a very low reactor volume and a very low retention time.

Riddell et al. (1983) combined the functions of the reactor and the settling tank in order to choose permissible flow rate of an activated sludge plant.

For describing the continuous sedimentation in the secondary clarifier, a one-dimensional model based on non-linear partial differential equation was proposed. The analysis of the settling process lied on vigorous mathematical treatment of the equation.

40|$|Abstract—Ferron reagent and FTIR {{spectroscopy}} {{were used}} for the identification and characterization of the aluminum species formed during dephosphorization of simulated wastewater with and without organic matter. Evidence from FTIR spectroscopy showed the formation of aluminum hydroxyphosphate, hydroxy-Al–tannate and aluminum complexes containing both phosphorus and tannic acid. The surface reactivity of the solid products is proportional to the rate of reaction with ferron. The measured reactivities indicate that aluminum solid species with dierent surface properties were formed depending on solution components and method of precipitation. Tannic acid was found to inhibit phosphorus removal and the extent of inhibition increased with increasing concentration. When prehydrolyzed aluminum is exposed to tannic acid, the organic matter forms a coating {{on the surface of the}} inorganic solid during the aging process. Coprecipitation of aluminum, phosphate and tannic acid, which is synonymous with the addition of alum before or in the aerator, produces some soluble complex and some hydroxy-Al–phosphate–tannate complex, in the form of solid with very small particle size. This system gives high residual aluminum. The results suggest that it is advantageous to add at least a portion of the alum at the exit of the aerator. This enhances phosphorus removal by coprecipitation under conditions where the concentration of organic matter is relatively low and enhances removal of organic matter by postprecipitation onto the <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> in the aerator...|$|E

Partial purification of this polymer {{was performed by}} precipitation with 95 % ethanol, dialysis and freeze-drying. It was characterized as an acidic heteropolysaccharide, composed of neutral sugars (29. 4 %), uronic acids (14. 2 %) and amino sugars (0. 93 %).

40|$|For {{enhancing}} anaerobic {{sludge digestion}} and biogas recovery, {{an increase in}} organic load rate (OLR) from 1. 0 to 3. 0 kgVS/(m 3 ·day) was imposed upon a new anaerobic digestion process combined with a sludge recirculation. The new setup requires a traditional mesophilic anaerobic digester coupled with a centrifuge for maintaining relatively high solid content within the digester. The hypothesis {{of this study was}} that increasing continuously OLR from 1. 0 to 3. 0 kgVS/(m 3 ·day) in a pilot-scale anaerobic digester with <b>recycled</b> <b>sludge</b> would not badly influence the digester stability, based on which biogas production would be enhanced. To test this hypothesis, a continuous 73 -day study with laboratory experiment was conducted. Due to scarcity of original feeding sludge and its deteriorating quality, OLR had to be increased relied on introduction of extra sludge followed by measurement of total solid (TS) and volatile solid (VS) contents in both feeding sludge and digester sludge, for calculating OLR and examining its variations. To assess the relationship between biogas production and OLR, a measurement of gas yield and methane content was a necessity, performed by applying a biogas flow meter and MSA AUER EX-METER II (P). Moreover, temperature, pH value, volatile fatty acid (VFA) and alkalinity must be tested frequently, for the purpose of preventing system failure. The results demonstrate that the digester succeeded in withstanding an OLR up to 3. 15 kgVS/(m 3 ·day). Furthermore, an enhancement in biogas yield and methane content were observed after increasing the OLR by introducing extra sludge. Biogas production measurement performed during this study indicated that biogas yield was enhanced by 73 %, with a maximum production of 14. 5 m 3 /day, when OLR was increased from 2. 05 to 3. 15 kgVS/(m 3 ·day). However, methane content was merely promoted by 10. 5 %, to the highest value of 63 %, with the same increase in OLR. Specific gas production (SGP), as another means of evaluating the relationship between biogas production and OLR, was observed to be 0. 65 Nm 3 /kg VSin averagely...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainable}} society {{requires the}} recycling of rare metals. Rare earth Nd {{is one of}} rare metals, accompanying huge consumption especially in Nd-Fe-B magnets. Although the wet process using acid is in practical use in the in-plant <b>recycle</b> of <b>sludge,</b> higher selectivity between Nd and Fe at room temperature is desired. We have proposed a pretreatment of corrosion before the dissolution into HCl and the oxalic acid precipitation. The corrosion produces γ-FeOOH and a Nd hydroxide, which have high selectivity for HCl solution at room temperature. Nd can be recovered as Mn 2 O 3 -type Nd 2 O 3. The estimated recovery-ratio of Nd reaches to 97 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{possible}} use of stone cutting sludge waste in concrete production, which would reduce both the environmental impact and the production cost. Slurry sludge was used a source of water in concrete production, which was obtained from Samara factory/Jordan, The physico-chemical and mineralogical characterization of the sludge was carried out to identify the major components and to compare it with the typical sand used to produce concrete. Samples analysis showed that 96 % of slurry sludge volume is water, so it {{should be considered as}} an important source of water. Results indicated that the use of slurry sludge as water source in concrete production has insignificant effect on compression strength, while it has a sharp effect on the slump values. Using slurry sludge with a percentage of 25 % of the total water content obtained successful concrete samples regarding slump and compression tests. To clarify slurry sludge, settling process can be used to remove the suspended solid. A settling period of 30 min. obtained 99 % removal efficiency. The clarified water is suitable for using in concrete mixes, which reduce water consumption, conserve water recourses, increase the profit, reduce operation cost and save the environment. Additionally, the dry sludge could be used in the mix design instead of the fine materials with sizes < 160 �m. This application could conserve the natural materials and solve the environmental and economical problem caused by <b>sludge</b> accumulation.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of cellulase recycling in {{the scope of}} bioethanol production from <b>recycled</b> paper <b>sludge</b> (RPS), an inexpensive byproduct with around 39 % of carbohydrates, is analyzed. RPS was easily converted and fermented by enzymes and cells, respectively. Final enzyme partition between solid and liquid phases was investigated, the solid-bound enzymes being efficiently recovered by alkaline washing. RPS hydrolysis and fermentation was conducted over four rounds, recycling the cellulases present in both fractions. A great overall enzyme stability was observed: 71, 64 and 100 % of the initial Cel 7 A, Cel 7 B and -glucosidase activities, respectively, were recovered. Even with only 30 % of fresh enzymes added on the subsequent rounds, solid conversions of 92, 83 and 71 % were achieved for the round 2, 3 and 4, respectively. This strategy enabled an enzyme saving around 53 - 60 %, while can equally contribute to a 40 % reduction in RPS disposal costs.
