5|$|Arrington and {{his assistants}} were {{supported}} {{by a team of}} editors, administrative assistants, research historians, oral history experts, and student interns. It was common for many individuals to work on a project; generally the principle author was listed in the article's byline, but sometimes Arrington's name was used to lend a publication authority. As a supervisor, Arrington was not a skillful bureaucrat, and junior staffers complained about their exclusion from decision-making and a lack of communication, which Arrington tried to ameliorate. Richard Bushman, a prominent Mormon historian, suggested that Arrington commission a multivolume history of the church, written mostly by scholars outside the history division staff. William Hartley, Gordon Irving, and Gary Shumway began an oral history program, funded {{by a grant from the}} descendants of James Moyle, a Utah politician. A summer <b>research</b> <b>fellowship</b> offered $1000 for outside scholars to use the LDS Church Archives for projects on Mormon history. Eugene England Sr. also donated money to support projects that Arrington deemed especially important. Additionally, a special Mormon History Trust Fund was formed from individual donations, including royalties donated by staff members.|$|E
