5|$|European {{dominance}} was at {{the forefront}} of United's agenda during the 1997–98 season. Having failed to take their chances in a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was <b>resolute</b> to go one step further and emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing any talk that his team was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2015, the Associated Press {{reported}} that officials at Fort Drum {{said that about}} 1,660 members of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team will deploy {{in the spring and}} summer to southern Afghanistan as part of the <b>Resolute</b> Support Mission. It will be the brigade's fourth deployment to Afghanistan. Its last deployment ended in October 2013.|$|E
5|$|After {{a one-year}} rest, the {{headquarters}} of the 10th Mountain Division was deployed to Iraq {{for the first time in}} April 2008, along with the 4th Brigade Combat Team. The division headquarters served as the command element for southern Baghdad, while the 4th BCT operated in North Baghdad. The 10th Mountain participated in larger scale operations such as Operation Phantom Phoenix. The headquarters of the 10th Mountain Division is currently deployed to Afghanistan in support of OEF XV and transitioning to the <b>Resolute</b> Support Mission in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Apple CEO John Sculley {{demands to}} know why the world {{believes}} he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were <b>resolute</b> on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.|$|E
5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, {{free trade and}} welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War he argued that Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was <b>resolute</b> in the opinion {{that it should be}} fought and won. In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division were {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of}} the <b>Resolute</b> Support Mission in the Post ISAF phase of the War in Afghanistan between late summer and early fall 2015, 300 troops from 10th Mountain's headquarters at deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel, along with about 1,000 troops from the 3rd Brigade Combat Team.|$|E
5|$|The ADF makes a {{significant}} contribution to Australia's domestic maritime security. ADF ships, aircraft and Regional Force Surveillance Units conduct patrols of northern Australia in conjunction with the Australian Border Force (ABF). This operation, which is code-named Operation <b>Resolute,</b> is commanded by the Maritime Border Command which is jointly manned by members of the ADF and ABF. This operation involves a considerable proportion of the ADF's assets, with the forces assigned typically including two major naval vessels, multiple patrol boats, Regional Force Surveillance Unit patrols and AP-3 Orion aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish People's Party of Finland (SPP) is the {{dominant}} party amongst Swedish-speaking voters; a poll has indicated that 75% of them support the party. Led by Stefan Wallin, the party is <b>resolute</b> on preserving the mandatory teaching of Swedish in schools. The SPP also wants to preserve the current immigration laws, which were passed on the initiative of incumbent Minister of Migration Astrid Thors, {{a member of the}} SPP.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Ramsey led {{his side}} to become champions of England in their debut {{season at the}} top level. The side had been tipped by many contemporary football pundits and journalists for relegation {{at the start of}} the season, making the achievement all the more remarkable. Ramsey created a strong side based on a <b>resolute</b> defence and two strikers, Ray Crawford and Ted Phillips who between them scored over sixty goals. The key to the side was considered to be left-winger, Jimmy Leadbetter whom Ramsey moved into a deep-lying, left of centre midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully <b>resolute</b> on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines {{the areas in which}} severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his early}} {{resolution}} {{not to allow}} politics to impede upon his legal career, Maxwell's <b>resolute</b> support of the Union during the American Civil War, and of the statehood movement for West Virginia, refocused his priorities. Maxwell's political affiliation had been Republican, and he became {{actively involved in the}} formation of the state of West Virginia in 1863. Just weeks prior to the state's creation on June 20 of that year, he began his political career when he was elected to represent the Third Senatorial District in the inaugural session of the West Virginia Senate in June 1863. During his tenure in the senate, which lasted until 1866, Maxwell served as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In his position as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he played a prominent role in the passage of the state's earliest legislation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the <b>resolute</b> and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E
5|$|Imamura was {{up against}} a resourceful, <b>resolute</b> and {{aggressive}} opponent, who also had access to good intelligence. Allied Ultra codebreakers were reading the Japanese shipping codes, and, by 3 January 1943, Allied commanders knew in advance about the force that Adachi was planning to send from Rabaul to Lae, although {{they did not know}} the force's ultimate destination. Blamey chose not to wait for this to become clear, but immediately ordered the 17th Infantry Brigade to move from Milne Bay to Wau on 4 January 1943. Its commander—Brigadier Murray Moten—was ordered to assume command of Kanga Force and defend Wau.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Brigade {{performed}} {{a wide variety}} of missions including evacuation of prisoners of war, security of vessels and ports, convoy escort, security of vital installations and VIPs, maintenance of discipline, law and order, and direct support to combat operations. During the Tet Offensive, the 716th MP Battalion fought off a <b>resolute</b> Viet Cong unit determined to take over the US Embassy, while other 18th Brigade units performed similar duties in the Mekong Delta, Bien Hoa, the Central Highlands, and throughout the RVN. The Brigade completed its service in Vietnam and was deactivated on 20 March 1973 in Oakland, California.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 2001, the War in Afghanistan {{began when}} U.S. and British forces {{initiated}} aerial bombing campaigns targeting Taliban and al-Qaeda camps, then later invaded Afghanistan with ground {{troops of the}} Special Forces. This {{eventually led to the}} overthrow of the Taliban rule of Afghanistan with the Fall of Kandahar on December 7, 2001, by U.S. led coalition forces. Conflict in Afghanistan between the Taliban insurgency and the Afghan forces backed by NATO <b>Resolute</b> Support Mission is ongoing. The Philippines and Indonesia, among other nations with their own internal conflicts with Islamic terrorism, also increased their military readiness.|$|E
5|$|Above all, {{he possessed}} a <b>resolute</b> {{decision}} of character, which, however unfortunately {{it may have}} operated under different conditions, appeared to extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. Bewildered by the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind, and was prepared to abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to bespeak {{for it in the}} scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.|$|E
5|$|Bergkamp {{made his}} debut against Reggiana on 29 August 1993 at the San Siro in a 2–1 victory. He scored his first {{goal for the}} club against Cremonese in September 1993 but had a {{difficult}} time against the highly organised and <b>resolute</b> Italian defences, scoring a further seven goals in the league. This was partly due to manager Osvaldo Bagnoli's inability to find a stable forward partnership, preferring Bergkamp in a three with Rubén Sosa and Salvatore Schillaci. Inter's poor league form culminated in the sacking of Bagnoli in February 1994 and his replacement by Gianpiero Marini, a member of Italy's 1982 FIFA World Cup-winning squad. The club finished 13th in Serie A, one point away from relegation, but enjoyed success in the UEFA Cup, beating Austria Salzburg in the final over two legs. Bergkamp was the competition's joint top goalscorer with eight goals and scored a hat-trick against Rapid București in the first round.|$|E
5|$|In 444 BC, the {{conservative}} {{and the democratic}} factions confronted {{each other in a}} fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of {{the conservative}}s, Thucydides (not {{to be confused with the}} historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite the passions of the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his <b>resolute</b> arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.|$|E
5|$|Thus Mu'tazilism became closely {{identified}} with the new regime of al-Mu'tasim, and adherence to Mu'tazilism was transformed into an intensely political issue, since to question it was to oppose {{the authority of the}} Caliph as the God-sanctioned imām. While Mu'tazilism found broad support, it was also passionately opposed by traditionalists, who held that the Quran's authority was absolute and unalterable as the literal word of God, as well as providing a vehicle for criticism by those who disliked the new regime and its elites. In the event, the active repression of the traditionalists was without success, and even proved counterproductive: the beating and imprisonment {{of one of the most}} <b>resolute</b> opponents of Mu'tazilism, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, in 834, only helped to spread his fame. By the time al-Mutawakkil abandoned Mu'tazilism and returned to traditional orthodoxy in 848, the strict and conservative Hanbali school had emerged as the leading school of jurisprudence (fiqh) in Sunni Islam.|$|E
5|$|In , Boruto joins an {{examination}} {{to improve his}} ninja rank from low status Genin to middle status Chunin with his teammates. Before the exams happened, he was training to surpass his father. For it, he becomes a student of Naruto's best friend and rival Sasuke Uchiha who first challenges him to perform the Rasengan; not knowing how, he received help from his teacher Konohamaru {{to know how to}} perform it. Upon learning and mastering a small Rasengan, Boruto starts training with Sasuke after his acceptance to it. Later in the film, Boruto is told by Sasuke that he has potential of surpassing his father. In the exams, he cheats by using a device that uses ninjutsu due to his lack of training in traditional abilities. After being caught and disqualified, Naruto gets captured by Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki from protecting the leaf village. Upon being scolded by Sasuke, Boruto realizes his underhandedness and joins the rescue team to save the abducted Naruto, while finally gaining his father's compliance. With the help of Naruto and Sasuke, Boruto defeats the enemy Momoshiki with his Rasengan. Although he resented the Hokage position, Boruto becomes <b>resolute</b> to become strong to protect his village's leader and entrust Sarada to be a future Hokage instead of himself. Boruto also reprises his role in the novel adaptation of the movie, as well as part of an omake from the manga Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend where he trains with the title character.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, even as {{the battle}} had {{continued}} the evacuation of the Australian casualties had begun, {{with a number of}} Iroquois helicopters from No. 9 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) under Squadron Leader Jim Cox, flying through heavy ground fire to complete the dust-off. Hindered by artillery fire and the dense foliage the operation proved difficult and Cox's aircraft was hit by heavy machine-gun fire, wounding him and an orderly on board. Safely landing the damaged aircraft he then directed the operation by radio from the ground. Among the worst of the casualties was Sergeant Alexander Sutherland, from 2 Platoon. Losing an eye and suffering heavy blood loss from multiple shrapnel wounds after a Viet Cong rocket exploded within a metre of him, he was evacuated to 8 Field Ambulance in Vung Tau with no pulse. His left leg later amputated, his wounds were so bad he had to be given a general anaesthetic each time his bandages were changed. Making a miraculous recovery however, he was personally recommended for the US Medal of Honor by Westmoreland for his <b>resolute</b> spirit, although this was later reduced to a lesser Australian award. Many casualties were beyond help however, and the battalion chaplain was inserted by winch from a helicopter to administer last rites.|$|E
5|$|The quarter-final draw also {{determined}} the teams' routes to the final, with Barcelona facing {{the prospect of}} meeting either Chelsea or Liverpool in the semi-finals. After a 3–1 win at Anfield, Chelsea qualified for the semi-finals with a 4–4 draw at Stamford Bridge. The semi-final first leg was played at the Camp Nou; although Barcelona enjoyed {{the majority of the}} possession, Chelsea's defence was <b>resolute</b> and they became the first side to keep a clean sheet in Barcelona in this season's competition, coming away with a goalless draw. Barcelona needed to avoid defeat to reach the final, but they found themselves a goal down within 10 minutes; after they failed to clear Frank Lampard's pass into the penalty area, Michael Essien fired a left-footed volley past Víctor Valdés into the roof of the net. The rest of the match continued much the same as the first leg, with Barcelona retaining most of the possession. Despite this, they found themselves guilty of several fouls, while Chelsea made four unsuccessful penalty appeals during the match. Meanwhile, Dani Alves received his third yellow card of the knockout phase, ruling him out of Barcelona's next match, and Éric Abidal was given a straight red card for a foul on Nicolas Anelka as the French forward was through on goal. However, television replays after the incident showed that there was little contact between Abidal and Anelka. Norwegian referee Tom Henning Øvrebø allowed a minimum of fourminutes of injury time {{at the end of the}} second half; in the third of those fourminutes – just when it looked like Chelsea were about to secure a repeat of the 2008 final – Messi played the ball across the edge of the penalty area to Andrés Iniesta, who shot just past Petr Čech's outstretched hand for the away goal that would send Barcelona to the final.|$|E
5|$|Various Hindu scriptures narrate {{the story}} of the union of Shiva and Parvati, with some variation. After the death of his first wife Sati, Shiva withdrew from society and engrossed himself in deep mediation. Taking {{advantage}} of the situation, the asura (demon) king Tarakasura secured from the god Brahma the boon that he could be killed only by the son of Shiva. Believing himself effectively immortal, Tarakasura terrorized the beings of the universe and defeated the gods. Meanwhile, Parvati, the reincarnation of Sati, was born to Himavan, the god of the Himalayas and his wife the apsara Mena. She underwent severe austerities to compel Shiva to marry her. The gods, desperate to hasten the birth of Shiva's son, sent Kamadeva, the god of love, to disturb Shiva's meditation. Though Shiva was awakened, Kamadeva was burnt up by Shiva's fury. Implored by the other gods to marry, Shiva agreed, but decided to test Parvati's devotion first. The Saptarishi (the seven sages) approached Parvati and mocked Shiva to dissuade her; however Parvati remained <b>resolute.</b> Then Shiva himself, disguised as an old ascetic, visited Parvati and vilified himself in her presence. As an angry Parvati was about to leave, Shiva revealed his true form to her and promised to marry her, pleased with her love and devotion. The couple married and produced a son, Kartikeya, who subsequently slew Tarakasura.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited President Barack Obama {{and gave}} him the {{original}} framed commissioning papers for <b>Resolute</b> and an ornamental pen holder made from the timbers of HMS Gannet. HMS Gannet was not a sister ship to the <b>Resolute,</b> as has been widely reported. Her only connection with <b>Resolute</b> was that the Gannet was launched from the Chatham Dockyard, which was the same dockyard where <b>Resolute</b> was decommissioned. Gannet was launched in 1878 long after the cross Atlantic slave trade was made illegal, and also many years after the American Civil War. Therefore, she was not used in anti-slavery work in connection to these markets. She did, however, patrol the Mediterranean Sea and prevented slave trade there.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Britain and America {{was at a}} breaking point when Buddington salvaged <b>Resolute.</b> They were {{on the brink of}} their third war. President Franklin Pierce addressed Congress to say he had ceased to have diplomatic relations with Britain. He closed the British embassies and sent the ambassadors home. Tensions continued to mount. Suddenly one of the most vocal hawks, Senator James Murray Mason, from Virginia, proposed a bill in Congress for the government to buy <b>Resolute,</b> refurbish her, and sail her back to Britain as a present. The bill passed, authorizing more than $40,000 for the work, and President Pierce signed it into law. <b>Resolute</b> was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she underwent a complete refit, and Commander Henry Hartstene USN, sailed her back to Britain, arriving at Spithead on December 12, 1856. After <b>Resolute</b> was towed to Cowes so that the Queen and Prince Albert could tour her, Captain Harstene presented the ship to Queen Victoria as a gesture of peace and good-will on December 17, 1856. Soon the talk of war ceased, and the gift of <b>Resolute</b> was seen as instrumental in the easing of these tensions. Henry Grinnell, a New York merchant and ship owner who had grown up in New Bedford, had supported the purchase of <b>Resolute</b> to be used as the gift, and both he and Lady Franklin had hoped the Navy would use the ship for a new search for Sir John Franklin's expedition. However, by 1856 the Royal Navy was no longer willing to spend money on what they now believed would be a fruitless search. It was impossible to believe that any of the Franklin men could still be alive eleven years after they entered the Arctic. Belcher's abandonment of four seaworthy ships was the last straw. Nor was the Navy willing to let Lady Franklin use <b>Resolute</b> for a privately funded search. Britain could not risk losing <b>Resolute</b> after the important role the ship had played in smoothing the turbulent waters between her and America. <b>Resolute</b> stayed in home waters until she was taken to the breaker's dock at Chatham Dockyard in 1879.|$|E
25|$|Replicas of the <b>Resolute</b> desk have {{appeared}} in many movies.
