40|$|The plant {{quarantine}} measures for tulip and lily bulbs were abolished in 1988. A {{removal of the}} quarantine made Japanese bulb growers face international competition in the markets. Since then the imports <b>of</b> <b>bulbs,</b> mainly from Holland, increased rapidly and bulb prices tended to decline gradually, while the Japanese production <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> did not decrease. The imports also introduced new varieties <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> to Japan. The demand for tulip bulbs increased greatly until the late 1990 s, but in the 2000 s the Japanese bulb markets stagnated. Bulb prices decreased, and the domestic production <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> decreased sharply, which caused a great {{reduction in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>bulb</b> farmers. Consequently, the rate of self-sufficiency for producing tulip bulbs in Japan decreased from 80 % in 1988 to 20 % in 2006, even though the volume <b>of</b> imported <b>bulbs</b> decreased in the 2000 s.

The {{olfactory bulb}} ends with the olfactory tract and {{is closely related to}} the olfactory sulcus of the frontal lobe. Many studies demonstrated that olfactory bulb volume assessed with magnetic resonance imaging is related to the olfactory function both in normal and pathological conditions. It has been shown that olfactory bulb volume changes with the degree of olfactory dysfunction, that it decreases with the duration of the olfactory loss and that patients with qualitative disorder such as parosmia have smaller olfactory bulbs than patients without parosmia. In this review, we will discuss the actual knowledge regarding olfactory bulb function, practical ways to measure olfactory bulb volume and olfactory sulcus depth, and report systematic observations regarding these measurements related to various causes of olfactory dysfunction, e. g. infection of the upper respiratory tract, head trauma, or neurodegenerative <b>disease.</b> Measurement <b>of</b> olfactory <b>bulb</b> volume may provide valuable information for patients with olfactory dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Although its {{importance}} as vegetable, {{a considerable amount}} <b>of</b> onion <b>bulbs</b> is lost in storage. That's why storage condition {{is one of the}} most important issues to maintain post-harvest quality. For this purpose, a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with two factors and three replicates was carried out. The factors were storage conditions <b>of</b> onion <b>bulbs</b> with five levels (4 oC in the seed storage apparatus, 25 and 30 oC without using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator, and 25 and 30 oC using rosemary leaves and branches in the incubator) and storage times with ten levels (10 consecutive weeks). The storage feedbacks <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> in terms <b>of</b> the weight loss (WL) and the average bud length (ABL) <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> were analyzed. The storage <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> at 25 oC using rosemary fresh leaves and branches inside each bag <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> after 10 weeks resulted in the lowest weight loss and average bud length, and significantly controlled the post-harvest fungal rotting and improved the shelf life <b>of</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The findings <b>of</b> this study indicated the high potential of rosemary fresh leaves and branches, which can be considered as an alternative strategy to control post-harvest fungal rotting and to improve the storage life <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> considering its simplicity and efficacy in decreasing the storage cost, the weight loss and sprouting without causing any environmental toxicity...|$|R

Symptomatic leaves from a 10 stalks sample of the sugarcane cultivar C 89 - 147 were separated and cut in three same parts and identified as third 1, 2 and 3, starting from the insert of the leaf with the sheath until the apex. The long, wide and area occupied by L. sacchari in a sample of 1000 lesions was measured. The foliage area and the area affected with lesions of each third of leaf, in 55 leaves, subsequently the percentage of Affected Foliate Area and the biometrics parameters of the evaluated variables were calculated. The most frequent values of long, wide and area of the lesions, were 10 mm, 2. 78 mm, and 10. 71 mm 2, respectively. The dimensions of the lesions and the Affected Foliate Area were significantly increased starting from leaf + 5.

40|$|The aim of my diploma thesis was to {{evaluate}} four densities of growth by chosen varieties of potatoes. The thesis {{deals with the}} experiment on 4 different varieties of potatoes. I have chosen the standard technology of growing ware potatoes. The selected densities of growth were 35 000, 40 000, 45 000 and 50 000 young plants ha- 1. Each variant was repeated four times. I have evaluated the yield <b>of</b> <b>bulbs,</b> the share and yield <b>of</b> ware <b>bulbs,</b> the average number <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> for one plant, the weight <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> for one plant, the average weight <b>of</b> a <b>bulb</b> and the average weight <b>of</b> ware <b>bulbs.</b> The research was done on a private farm like the field experiment. The farm is located in potato-growing area in Vysočina Region, 490 metres above the sea level. Potatoes are grown approximately over 7 hectares on the farm. The experiment started in 2010. The potato planter MARS 42 {{was used for the}} planting. The distance between drills was 0, 75 metre. Parcels consisted of 4 drills, each drill equals one repetition, each parcel equals one density of growth. On purchase of samples was realized the kickoff of 10 plants from each repetition. What followed was division <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> according to their size in each sample. They were divided into bulbs smaller than 40 millimetres and bigger. After that the samples were weighed and bulbs were counted. The number <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> and the weight <b>of</b> <b>bulbs</b> are very important for subtotal. It was established the variety Mirage made the best results when the density was 45 000 plants ha- 1. The variety Agria had two suitable densities of growth, namely 40 000 and 45 000 plants ha- 1. There was no considerable difference between them. In contrast with previous, the varieties Victoria and Marabel made the best result when the density was 35 000 plants ha- 1. I have realized the density 50 000 plants ha- 1 is explicitly unsuitable for all varieties. This density of growth is loss-making especially because of lowering of all assessed indexes. Another disadvantage is higher costs (more bulbs are required) and then there is also bigger risk <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> and pests...|$|R
