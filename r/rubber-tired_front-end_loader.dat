40|$|Several {{federal and}} state {{agencies}} have promulgated regulations that require the installation of operator protective structures on mobile equipment used in mining, construction, agriculture and logging industries. These regulations cover {{many different types of}} vehicles, from small farm tractors to large <b>rubber-tired</b> <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders,</b> and require structures that help protect the operator from death or injury from vehicle overturns, from falling tree tops and logs, from falling rocks, and from tree limbs in clearing operations. Two general types of vehicle operator protective structures have evolved over the past twenty years. The first of these is the "Roll-Over Protective Structure'' or "ROPS" that is essentially a "roll bar" or "roll cage" that provides a relatively safe area for the vehicle operator if the vehicle should tip over and roll. The second protective structure is the "Falling Object Protective Structure" or "FOPS" that provides overhead protection against falling material. The terms "ROPS" and "FOPS" are often used interchangeably (sometimes inaccurately) with "cabs", canopies, "roll bars", protective structures" and other such descriptive names. In this report, "ROPS" describes the function of the structure; "FOPS" also describes a particular function. Thus a ROPS/FOPS could describe a cab or a canopy that provides both roll-over protection and falling object protection. MESA is used as an abbreviation for the Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration; "USBM" is used to abbreviate the U, S. Bureau of Mines...|$|R

50|$|The first three-wheeled, <b>front-end</b> <b>loader</b> {{was invented}} by {{brothers}} Cyril and Louis Keller in Rothsay, Minnesota, in 1957. The Kellers built the loader to help a farmer, Eddie Velo, mechanize the process of cleaning turkey manure from his barn. The light and compact machine, with its rear caster wheel, was able to turn around within its own length, while performing the same tasks as a conventional <b>front-end</b> <b>loader.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tunnel {{conveyors}} can be fed by {{a continuous}} slot hopper or bunker beneath the stockpile to reclaim material. <b>Front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> and bulldozers {{can be used}} to push the coal into feeders. Sometimes <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> are the only means of reclaiming coal from the stockpile. This has a low up-front capital cost, but much higher operating costs, measured in dollars per tonne handled. High-capacity stockpiles are commonly reclaimed using bucket-wheel reclaimers. These can achieve very high rates ...|$|R

A significant 10 : 1 respirable dust protection factor (ratio of outside to inside cab dust levels) was measured for the <b>front-end</b> <b>loader</b> cab with positive pressurization of the cab interior. Whereas an insignificant 3 : 1 respirable dust protection factor was measured for the drill cab without positive pressurization of the cab interior. These results indicate that achieving positive interior cab pressurization with retrofitted cab filtration systems {{is a key element}} to their dust control effectiveness...|$|R
50|$|New Hope is an independent, {{energy company}} which has open cut mines at Acland on the Darling Downs and at Rosewood near Ipswich. The New Acland open cut mine is located {{approximately}} 150 kilometres west of Brisbane in the Darling Downs region of Queensland. The mining method used at New Acland {{is an open}} cut multi-thin-seam operation which utilises trucks, excavators and <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders.</b> Overburden is blasted or ripped by bulldozers prior to extraction. New Oakleigh operates an open cut coal mine {{near the town of}} Rosewood, 23 kilometres west of Ipswich and 92 kilometres from the Port of Brisbane.

50|$|Historically, basements {{have become}} {{much easier to}} build (in {{developed}} countries) since the industrialization of home building.

2500|$|The {{high winds}} of the {{blizzard}} packed the snow so tightly and high, drifts reached [...] in places; normal snow removal equipment was ineffective, and earth-moving equipment, such as <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders,</b> {{had to be}} used. Colonel Daniel Ludwig of the USACE stated the [...] "snow was very densely packed and that snow plows would be virtually useless {{on most of the}} roads". NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker noted on one of the roads near the NWS forecast office, high lifts were used [...] "to dig away at it and break it up like big hunks of rock". In Depew, a suburb of Buffalo, volunteer firemen used a trenching machine to get people out of a house that had been drifted shut. The long cleanup period included the railroads, who used <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> to clear snow from the rail yard into open-bodied rail cars and shipped it east by Conrail.|$|R

40|$|Landings are an {{integral}} part of harvesting operations in New Zealand. A representative sample of 142 landings were measured using GPS; twelve recently constructed and unused, 38 live and the remaining 92 were older and closed out. The average landing size was 3900 m 2, with a range from 1370 to 12540 m 2. On average 11 log sorts were cut, the landings in use for 4 weeks, and estimated daily production was 287 m 3 /day. Log processing was mechanised on 53 % of the landings and 47 % was manual processing, and most (79 %) of the operations used tracked grapple loaders (21 % used <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders).</b> A regression equation to model landing size indicated that number of log sorts and production levels are the two main factors that determine landing size. Landing size tended to increase over time, with used landings on average being 900 m 2 larger than newly constructed (unused) landings. Most recently constructed landings were much larger than the company design specifications; whereby either 40 x 60 m or 40 x 80 m were common specifications. A comparable study in 1987 showed the average landing to be just over 1900 m 2, indicating landing size has nearly doubled in the last 20 years. Landings serviced by <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> were on average 1100 m 2 larger than those serviced by tracked grapple loader, but this result is partially explained by the fact that <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> were more commonly used in high production systems...|$|R
40|$|Landings are an {{integral}} part of modern whole-tree harvesting operations in New Zealand. A representative sample of 142 landings was measured using GPS, whereby nine were recently constructed and unused, 34 were live and the remaining 99 were older and closed out. The average landing size was 3900 m², with a range from 1370 to 12540 m². On average, the number of log-sorts cut was 11, the landings were in use for 4 weeks, estimated daily production was 287 m³/day, 37 % were manual processing (63 % mechanised), 81 % were grapple <b>loader</b> (19 % <b>front-end</b> <b>loader).</b> A regression equation to model landing size indicates that number of log sorts and production levels are the two main driving factors. Landings do tend to ‘grow’ over time, with used landings on average being 560 m² larger than live ones, which in turn were 280 m² larger than recently constructed (unused) landings. Most recently constructed landings were larger than the company design; whereby either 40 mx 60 m or 40 mx 80 m were common specifications. A comparable study in 1987 showed the average landing to be just over 1900 m², indicating landing size has nearly doubled in the last 20 years. Landings serviced by <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> were slightly larger than those serviced by grapple, but this is compounded by <b>front-end</b> <b>loaders</b> being more commonly used in high production systems. Analyses of the schematic drawings for the live landings indicate that as landing size grows, there is a preference for using multiple rows to manage log inventory on the landing. Smaller landings typically prefer to stack around the edge of the landings...|$|R
