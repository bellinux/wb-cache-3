An experiment has been conducted at Kumbazha, in Pathanamthitta district, Kerala, India to evaluate {{the different types of}} coir geotextiles and polythene as soil mulch. The treatments include different mulching materials like natural needled felt, black needled felt, <b>rubberized</b> <b>coir,</b> black polythene and transparent polythene along with a control plot (no mulch). The experiment was laid out in Completely Randomized Design with six replications. The test crops used were bhindi (var. Salkeerthi) and pineapple (var. Mauritius). The study reveals that with bhindi crop growth parameters like plant height, leaf number and lateral spread were increased by mulching with <b>rubberized</b> <b>coir</b> and transparent polythene. These two mulches caused early flowering and increased fruit yield. Coir materials as mulch recorded a yield increase ranging from 67 to 196 %. Observations also reveal that weeds were not grown in plots mulched with black polythene, transparent polythene and <b>rubberized</b> <b>coir.</b> <b>Rubberized</b> <b>coir</b> as mulch enhanced the fruit yield in the case of pineapple, which is followed by natural needled felt and transparent polythene. Black polythene resisted weed growth up to 7 MAP, whereas <b>rubberized</b> <b>coir</b> and transparent polythene suppressed weeds up to 8 MAP. Though the weeds were grown in other treatments the weeds count was significantly lower than that of control plot. Mulching with transparent polythene enhanced the soil temperature whereas <b>rubberized</b> <b>coir</b> lowered soil temperature. More over all mulched treatments had a favourable influence in increasing soil moisture. Observing the biodegradability and eco-friendly nature of coir it could be inferred that <b>rubberized</b> <b>coir</b> can serve as good mulch for bhindi and pineapple with minimum weed problem...|$|E

These results are compared with those reported for neoprene, paraffin wax, rubber car mat and plastic door mat 1. The <b>rubberized</b> <b>coir</b> pads were found to possess wideband absorption characteristics. It has been experimentally found that 0. 05 m thick coir pads have almost 100 % absorption in the frequency range 800 kHz- 3 MHz with a maximum at 2. 35 MHz. We have used this material for lining the water tank for underwater acoustic studies...|$|E
