50|$|Following {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall, ICN {{acquired}} multiple pharmaceutical firms in Eastern Europe. In May 1991, ICN bought 75% of Galenika, Yugoslavia’s largest drug maker at the time. After eight months, the new subsidiary ICN-Galenika was producing revenues of $364 million. In April 1992, ICN Pharmaceuticals and ICN-Galenika partially financed a $100,000 initiative to vaccinate children in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. In 1995, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated ICN over shareholder concerns related to Mr. Panić’s sale of company stock before a key <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> by the FDA. After a three-year investigation, the SEC dropped its inquiry in 1998 with no charges filed.|$|E

However, they do encourage the voluntary submission of well-documented, quality genomics data. Both agencies are considering the use of submitted data {{on a case-by-case basis}} for assessment purposes (e.g., to help elucidate mechanism of action or contribute to a weight-of-evidence approach) or for populating relevant comparative databases by encouraging parallel submissions of genomics data and traditional toxicologic test results.|$|E
5000|$|This {{particular}} {{device was}} involved in a landmark United States <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> related to telecommunications. Previously in 1956, the FCC ruled in the Hush-A-Phone case that devices could mechanically connect to the telephone system without the permission of AT&T. In 1968, the Federal Communications Commission allowed the Carterfone and other devices to be connected directly to the AT&T network, as long as they did not cause harm to the system. This ruling, commonly called [...] "the Carterfone decision" [...] (13 F.C.C.2d 420), created the possibility of selling devices that could connect to the phone system using a protective coupler and opened the market to customer-premises equipment. The decision {{is often referred to as}} [...] "any lawful device", allowing later innovations like answering machines, fax machines, and modems (which initially used the same type of manual acoustic coupler as the Carterfone) to proliferate.|$|E
50|$|The {{challenges}} {{associated with}} studying potential {{long-term effects of}} pesticides on honey bee colonies are well documented and include the inability to adequately monitor individual bee health or extrapolate effects on individuals to whole hives. Behavior changes between bees and/or colonies in laboratory or field test conditions versus natural environments also add to the challenges. Studies submitted by Bayer AG to USEPA have provided some useful information about clothianidin's potential long-term effects on honey bees but outstanding questions remain. USEPA's analysis of nine pollinator field studies submitted concluded that three were invalid, so EPA {{did not use the}} data they provided in making its <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> for clothianidin. EPA classified the remainder as supplemental, generally because Bayer AG conducted the studies without EPA first approving the protocols. Supplemental studies are ones that don't definitively answer uncertainties but still provide some data that might be useful in characterizing risk. Indicative of the rapid advance of regulators' understanding of pollinator science, USEPA first accepted one of the studies as sound science in 2007, then reclassified it as invalid in November 2010 only to reclassify it as supplemental one month later. The changes in EPA's classification of this study have no effect on the regulatory status for clothianidin in the U.S. because the study does not provide data with which EPA can legally justify altering its 2003 registration decision. An international group of pesticide regulators, researchers, industry representatives, and beekeepers is working to develop a study protocol that will definitively answer remaining questions about the potential long-term effects on bee colonies and other pollinators.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the increasing impact of laws and regulations, several governments have introduced economic analysis {{as a way of}} improving <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> making. This paper provides the first comprehensive assessment of governmentsupported economic analysis of laws and regulations. It also reviews the changing role of economic analysis in <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> making. I find that there is growing interest in the use of economic tools, such as benefit–cost analysis; however, the quality of analysis in the U. S. A. and European Union frequently fails to meet widely accepted guidelines. Furthermore, the relationship between analysis and policy decisions is tenuous. To address this situation, I recommend alternative legal and institutional frameworks that could allow economics to play a more central role in <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> making. In addition, I suggest that prediction markets could help improve regulatory policy.

40|$|Recently, Congress {{has shown}} a greater {{interest}} in assessing {{the economic impact of}} regulation. The interest is driven in part by estimates that federal regulation cost several hundred billion dollars annually. In 1996, Congress required the director of the Office of Management and Budget to provide estimates of the total annual benefits and costs of all federal regulatory programs and estimates of the benefits and costs of individual regulations. This essay reviews the increasing use of economic analysis in <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> making, critically assesses the first OMB report, and considers how the use of economic analysis can help inform <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> making.

40|$|Techno-optimists {{advocate}} {{the application of}} information technology to the rulemaking process {{as a means of}} advancing strong democracy [...] that is, direct, broad-based citizen involvement in regulatory policy making. In this paper, I show that such optimism is unfounded given the obstacles to meaningful citizen deliberation posed by the impenetrability of current e-rulemaking developments, the prevailing level of citizen disengagement from politics and policy making more generally, and most citizens’ lack of the requisite technical information about and understanding of the issues at stake in <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> making. As such, a more realistic goal for the application of new technology to the regulatory process is to expand the information base available to <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> makers through increased interest group pluralism. Instead of creating conditions of strong democracy, information technology can expand the involvement and access of informed, knowledgeable, and affected parties to the rulemaking process, a weaker form of democracy that nevertheless can provide better information for government officials...|$|E
40|$|In practice, {{risk and}} {{uncertainty}} are essentially unavoidable in many regulation processes. Regulators frequently face a risk-benefit trade-off since zero risk is neither practicable nor affordable. Although it is accepted that cost-benefit analysis is important in many scenarios of risk management, what role it should play in a decision process is still controversial. One criticism of cost-benefit analysis is that decision makers should consider marginal benefits and costs, not present ones, in their decision making. In this paper, we investigate the problem of <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> making under risk by applying expected utility theory and present a new approach of cost-benefit analysis. Directly taking into consideration {{the reduction of the}} risks, this approach achieves marginal cost- benefit analysis. By applying this approach, the optimal <b>regulatory</b> <b>decision</b> that maximizes the marginal benefit of risk reduction can be considered. This provides a transparent and reasonable criterion for stakeholders involved in the regulatory activity. An example of evaluating seismic retrofitting alternatives is provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Branding is a {{necessary}} and important business tool. This study, however, examines whether branding can constitute an anticompetitive act. While most markets and firms do not undertake anticompetitive actions, being identified as such {{can result in a}} wide range of negative outcomes. To explore this low-frequency yet high-risk outcome, this study assesses how branding has been perceived to be anticompetitive by the UK competition authorities. This assessment is undertaken by examination of all UK competition law <b>regulatory</b> <b>decisions</b> undertaken over the period 1950 – 2007 by the UK competition authorities. From this assessment, it is observed that branding can facilitate excessive pricing, requires vertical restraints, and can lead to consumer confusion; all potentially anticompetitive acts. The competition <b>regulatory</b> <b>decisions</b> focused on branding issues are demonstrably different from <b>regulatory</b> <b>decisions</b> without branding concerns and involve larger, often manufacturing, firms, which operate in more concentrated markets. It is concluded that comprehension of competition law needs to be disseminated more widely amongst marketing communities and greater reference to business and marketing theory should be made by competition law agencies to assist the comprehension of marketing techniques such as branding...|$|R
