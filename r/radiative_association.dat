40|$|The present {{investigation}} relates the orbital radii of regular satellites of Uranus, Jupiter, Neptune, and Saturn to photon energies in the spectra of atomic and molecular hydrogen. To explain these observations a model is developed involving stimulated <b>radiative</b> molecular <b>association</b> (SRMA) reactions among the photons and {{atoms in the}} protosatellite disks of the planets. In this model thermal energy is extracted from each disk due to a resonance at radii {{where there is a}} match between the temperature in the disk and a photon energy. Matter accumulates at these radii, and satellites and rings are ultimately formed. Orbital radii of satellites of Uranus, Jupiter, and Neptune are related to photon energies ($E_{PM}$ values) in the spectrum of molecular hydrogen. Orbital radii of satellites of Saturn are related to photon energies ($E_{PA}$ values) in the spectrum of atomic hydrogen. The first hint that such relationships exist is found in the linearity of the graphs of orbital radii of uranian satellites vs. orbital radii of jovian satellites, {{as well as in the}} graphs of orbital radii of uranian satellites vs. orbital radii of neptunian satellites. An expression is determined which gives the temperature in protosatellite disks where the evolution of each satellite begins.

40|$|In a {{previous}} investigation, the orbital radii of regular satellites of Uranus, Jupiter, Neptune, and Saturn are {{shown to be}} directly related to photon energies in the spectra of atomic and molecular hydrogen. To explain these observations a model was developed involving stimulated <b>radiative</b> molecular <b>association</b> (SRMA) reactions among photons and atoms in the protosatellite disks of the planets. In the present investigation, the previously developed model {{is applied to the}} planets and important satellites of the Sun. A key component of the model involves resonance associated with SRMA. Through this resonance, thermal energy is extracted from the protosun's protoplanetary disk at specific distances from the protosun wherever there is a match between the local thermal energy of the disk and the energy of photons impinging on the disk. Orbital radii of the planets and satellites are related to photon energies ($E_P$ values) in the spectrum of atomic hydrogen. An expression determined previously is used to relate $E_P$ values to temperatures in the disk. Results indicate the surface temperature of the protosun at the time when the evolution of the planets begins is higher than the surface temperature of a typical T Tauri star. The present investigation offers an explanation for the existence of the asteroid and classical Kuiper belts and predicts that a primordial belt once existed in the vicinity of Neptune. It also indicates that Uranus is formed from two protoplanets and is thus consistent with the theory that the large tilt of Uranus's axis of rotation was created by the collision of two bodies.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{theoretical}} investigation of <b>radiative</b> <b>association,</b> {{which is one of the}} processes contributing to formation of molecules in the interstellar medium. The formation of the CN, SiN, SiP and CO molecules through <b>radiative</b> <b>association</b> of the corresponding atoms in their ground electronic states is studied by the means of classical and quantum dynamical calculations. In all cases the Born–Oppenheimer approximation is employed. The corresponding rate coefficients are calculated and the Breit–Wigner theory is used to properly account for the resonance contributions. Some common features of the <b>radiative</b> <b>association</b> process for the considered systems are discovered. For example, a drop in magnitude of the cross sections at high energy and, consequently, the high-temperature rate coefficients is observed. Also, is is shown that in the absence of a potential barrier the semi-classical formalism provides a good estimate for the rate coefficients. A pronounced isotope effect is discovered for the formation of CO by <b>radiative</b> <b>association</b> of C(3 P) and O(3 P) atoms. It is shown that the presence of a potential barrier on the A 1 Π electronic state of carbon monoxide leads to different formation channels for the 12 CO and 13 CO isotopologues at low temperatures.

In a recently proposed gas-phase formation mechanism, interstellar propene is produced from its protonated precursor C 3 H+ 7 (CH 3 CHCH+ 3) via a dissociative recombination process. The precursor ion C 3 H+ 7 is itself produced via two consecutive <b>radiative</b> <b>association</b> reactions involving H 2 starting from the isomer of C 3 H+ 3 with a linear carbon backbone (CH 2 CCH+). Initial calculations showed that the <b>radiative</b> <b>association</b> reactions are efficient enough to allow the production of an abundance of propene equal to that observed. However, a combination of experiments and more refined quantum chemical ab initio calculations reported here does not corroborate the initial result.
