40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{pancreatitis}} (CP) {{is defined}} as a continuing inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterised by irreversible morphological changes, often associated with pain and with the loss of exocrine and/or endocrine function that may be clinically relevant. Alcohol is the predominant cause of CP in the western world and is particularly prevalent in South Africa, especially in the indigent patient. CP ranks high among intractable diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The tendency for substance abuse in the alcohol-induced group poses major psychological and socioeconomic problems. OBJECTIVE: CP is a disease with significant clinical and pathological heterogeneity. Level 1 evidence to support definitive guidelines for diagnosis, medical management and interventional therapy is lacking. Despite this paucity of robust scientific evidence, it is important to provide some assistance based on the best available evidence as to the current standard of care for CP in the South African context; this will aid all involved in the management of the disease, and includes clinicians, health care managers and funders. Scope. The guidelines were developed as recommendations addressing the diagnosis, medical management and interventions, both endoscopic and surgical, for the management of a very complex and heterogeneous disease of the pancreas. The recommendations are particularly relevant in the South African context where the predominant patho-aetiological agents are alcohol-associated with smoking. RECOMMENDATIONS: The guidelines provide clear recommendations regarding the diagnostic modalities available, both imaging (which includes MRI and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)) and pancreatic function tests. The section on medical management makes recommendations on the use of analgesics, enzyme replacement and other therapeutic options in the non-interventional management of the majority of patients with CP. The section on interventional procedures identifies the indications and options available for the interventional management of both uncomplicated and complicated CP. The role of endoscopic and surgical modalities is defined, but it is in this context especially that the best available evidence, combined with the experience of the group, influenced the recommendations put forward. Owing to the lack of evidence and the complexity of the disease, it is recommended that, where possible, CP is managed {{in the context of a}} multidisciplinary team. Validation. The guidelines are based on best practice principles determined by the available evidence and the opinions of the group, which comprised 7 medical and surgical gastroenterologists with significant experience in dealing with patients with chronic pancreatitis in the South African context. The group convened between May 2009 and August 2010 under the auspices of the Hepato-Pancreatico-Biliary Association of South Africa (HPBASA) and the South African Gastroenterology Society (SAGES), and the guidelines are the result of broad consensus within this group. The draft was presented to other experts in this field of endeavour to ensure broader participation and consensus. Plans for guideline revision.

During the last decade, several new radiopharmaceuticals have been introduced for brain imaging.

Without the effectivity hypothesis, we show that the two elliptic surfaces are isomorphic. We also determine the group of universal automorphisms of a semistable elliptic surface. In particular, this includes showing that the Picard-Lefschetz transformations corresponding to an irreducible component of a singular fibre, can be extended as universal isometries. In the process, we get a family of homomorphisms of the affine Weyl group associated to Ã_n- 1 to that of Ã_dn- 1, indexed by natural numbers d, which are closed under composition.

We have addressed the full diurnal cycle of stratocumulus {{off the coast of}} California based on observations of the First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Regional Experiment (FIRE). The results of the LES model demonstrate that the model is capable of reproducing the observed diurnal cycle of the boundary-layer structure reasonably well. In particular, the LES model reproduces the distinct diurnal variation in liquid-water path and of turbulence profiles due to the forcing imposed by the short-wave heating of the cloud layer. In addition, we have examined the sensitivity of our LES results with respect to the assumed values of various external environmental conditions. We found that the largest contribution to the variance of the LES-derived data products is due to the uncertainties in the cloud-top jumps of liquid-water potential temperature and total-water mixing ratio and to the net radiative forcing. To evaluate the quality of the representation of stratocumulus in a general circulation model, results from the standard ECHAM-SCM are contrasted with diagnostics from LES simulations. Results of the standard ECHAM-SCM reveal the following deficiencies: values of the liquid-water path are too low, and unrealistically large levels of turbulent kinetic energy within the cloud layer are due to a numerical instability arising from a decoupling of radiative and diffusive processes. Based on these findings, the SCM has been <b>revised.</b> The <b>modifications</b> include the vertical advection scheme, the numerical treatment of diffusion and radiation, and the combination of the 1. 5 -order turbulent closure model with an explicit entrainment closure at the boundary-layer top in combination with a front tracking/capturing method.

We propose a new mean field model relevant for this compound. The ground state of this mean field model is unconventional because antiferromagnetism coexists with random dimers. We present new susceptibility experiments at very low temperature. We obtain a Curie-Weiss susceptibility χ(T) ∼ C / (Θ+T) as expected for antiferromagnetic correlations {{but we do not}} obtain a direct signature of antiferromagnetic long range order. We explain how to obtain the "impurity" susceptibility χ_imp(T) by subtracting the Haldane gap contribution to the total susceptibility. In the temperature range [1 K, 300 K] the experimental data are well fitted by T χ_imp(T) = C_imp (1 + T_imp/T) ^-γ. In the temperature range [100 mK, 1 K] the experimental data are well fitted by T χ_imp(T) = A (T/T_c), where T_c increases with x. This fit suggests the existence of a finite Néel temperature which is however too small to be probed directly in our experiments.

The goal {{of this study was to}} develop and implement testing protocols to determine the performance and safety capabilities of the device and use the results to redesign the walker to make it more reliable and effective. Engineering tests were performed to determine factors such as stability, range, speed, and fatigue strength. Additional tests to characterize the reliability and accuracy of the sensors and avoidance/navigation algorithms were also conducted. The walker traveled 10. 9 kilometers on a full charge, and was able to avoid obstacles while traveling at a speed of up to 1. 2 m/s. There were no failures during static stability, climatic, or static, impact, and fatigue testing. Some problems were encountered during obstacle climbing and sensor and control testing. Several significant differences were found with respect to the detection distance of the device when varying the obstacle height, material, approach angle, and lighting source. The walker also failed to detect 40 - 50 % of the doorways during the hallway test. Clinical trials were conducted to compare the VA-PAMAID to a low-tech mobility aid (AMD). Subjects were recruited and trained to use both devices efficiently. Each participant was then asked to traverse an obstacle course several times. The time to complete the course, number of wall and obstacle collisions, and number of reorientations were all recorded and averaged. There were no significant differences between the VA-PAMAID and the AMD with respect to collisions or reorientations. The AMD had a significantly lower completion time (p= 0. 017) than the VA-PAMAID on the obstacle course.

For modeling the hydrate phase, the van der Waals-Platteeuw (vdW-P) solid solution theory is used, <b>revised</b> with two <b>modifications</b> for evaluations of Langmuir constants and vapor pressure {{of water in the}} empty hydrate lattice, in which these values are supposed to be a function of TBAB concentration in aqueous solution. The Peng-Robinson (PR-EoS) equation of state along with re-tuned parameters of Mathias-Copeman alpha function is applied for calculation of the fugacity of gaseous hydrate former. For determination of the activity coefficient of the non-electrolyte species in the aqueous phase, the Non-Random Two-Liquid (NRTL) activity model is used. To calculate the mean activity coefficients of the electrolyte portion, a correlation on the basis of existing osmotic coefficient and activity coefficient values is employed. It is shown that the presented model results are in acceptable agreement with the experimental semi-clathrate hydrate dissociation data investigated in this work...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{redshift}} {{distribution of the}} SHADES galaxy population based on the rest-frame radio-mm-FIR colours of 120 robustly detected 850 um sources in the Lockman Hole East (LH) and Subaru XMM-Newton Deep Field (SXDF). The redshift distribution derived from the full SED information is shown to be narrower than that determined from the radio-submm spectral index, as more photometric bands contribute to a higher redshift accuracy. The redshift distribution of sources derived from at least two photometric bands peaks at z ~ 2. 4 and has a near-Gaussian distribution, with 50 per cent (interquartile range) of sources at z= 1. 8 - 3. 1. We find a statistically-significant difference between the measured redshift distributions in the two fields; the SXDF peaking at a slightly lower redshift (median z ~ 2. 2) than the LH (median z ~ 2. 7), which we attribute to the noise-properties of the radio observations. We demonstrate however that there could also be field-to-field variations {{that are consistent with}} the measured differences in the redshift distributions, and hence, that the incomplete area observed by SHADES with SCUBA, despite being the largest sub-mm survey to date, may still be too small to fully characterize the bright sub-mm galaxy population. Finally we present a brief comparison with the predicted, or assumed, redshift distributions of sub-mm galaxy formation and evolution models, and we derive the contribution of these SHADES sources and the general sub-mm galaxy population to the star formation-rate density at different epochs.

40|$|If n is a Z^d_+-graded {{nilpotent}} finite dimensional Lie algebra over a {{field of}} characteristic zero, {{it is well known}} that H^∗(n) ≥ L(p) where p is the polynomial associated to the grading and L(p) is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of p. From this result Deninger and Singhof derived the Toral Rank Conjecture (TRC) for 2 -step nilpotent Lie algebras. An algebraic version of the TRC states that H^∗(n) ≥ 2 ^ (z) for any finite dimensional Lie algebra n with center z. The TRC is more that 25 years old and remains open even for Z^d_+-graded 3 -step nilpotent Lie algebras. Investigating to what extent the above bound for H^∗(n) could help to prove the TRC in this case, we considered the following two questions regarding a nilpotent Lie algebra n with center z: (A) If n admits a Z_+^d-grading n=⊕_α∈Z_+^dn_α, such that its associated polynomial p satisfies L(p) > 2 ^z, does it admit a grading n=n'_ 1 ⊕n'_ 2 ⊕ [...] . ⊕n'_k such that its associated polynomial p' satisfies L(p') > 2 ^z? (B) If n is r-step nilpotent admitting a grading n=n_ 1 ⊕n_ 2 ⊕ [...] . ⊕n_k such that its associated polynomial p satisfies L(p) > 2 ^z, does it admit a grading n=n'_ 1 ⊕n'_ 2 ⊕ [...] . ⊕n'_r such that its associated polynomial p' satisfies L(p') > 2 ^z? In this paper we show that the answer to (A) is yes, but the answer to (B) is no. Comment: <b>Revised</b> version, major <b>modification...</b>|$|R
