50|$|Ongoing {{research}} on finishing techniques and materials led {{to yet another}} clothing line in 1982: Stone Island. The first collection was made entirely from a revolutionary new fabric that inspired from the tarps used by truck drivers. The 'used' look of this highly resistant, two-tone, <b>reversible</b> <b>fabric</b> was obtained through stone washing. This new collection was so successful that it sold out at every location within 10 days.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, various {{styles of}} {{camouflage}} cover were used at different times. In the 1960s through 1970s, the type commonly {{seen in the}} United States Army and Marine Corps was a <b>reversible</b> <b>fabric</b> cover called the Mitchell Pattern, with a leafy green pattern {{on one side and}} orange cloud pattern on the other. This type was nearly omnipresent in Vietnam, and where, for the first time, the army wore the cloth camouflage as general issue; whereas in World War II and the Korean War, the army traditionally wore their helmets only with nets, plain without anything on it, or with field-made, non-issue covers without camouflage. By contrast, United States Marines have consistently worn a cloth camouflage cover over their M-1 helmets in all three major wars—World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The Korean War (1950-1953) was largely fought using World War II weapons and equipment, and the Marine Corps helmets and camouflage covers were basically the same as those used during World War II. In Vietnam, the green portion of the <b>reversible</b> <b>fabric</b> camouflage was normally worn outermost. Helmet covers in the (European) woodland camouflage, were designed for fighting in the European Theater of Operations (NATO), and became the post-Vietnam (jungle pattern) camouflage cover used by the U.S. military from the late 1970s onward. The (European) Woodland pattern was not reversible; they were only printed on one side, though some rare desert camouflage examples do exist. These covers were all constructed from two semi-circular pieces of cloth stitched together to form a dome-like shape conforming to the helmet's shape. They were secured to the helmet by folding their open ends into the steel pot, and then placing the liner inside, trapping the cloth between the pot and the liner. An olive green elastic band, intended to hold additional camouflage materials, was often worn around the helmet to further hold the cover in place.|$|E

5000|$|Damask ( [...] ; دمشق) is a <b>reversible</b> figured <b>fabric</b> of silk, wool, linen, cotton, or {{synthetic}} fibres, with {{a pattern}} formed by weaving. Damasks are woven with one warp yarn and one weft yarn, usually with the pattern in warp-faced satin weave {{and the ground}} in weft-faced or sateen weave. Twill damasks include a twill-woven ground or pattern.|$|R
40|$|Severe tensile {{strength}} loss {{has been the}} major disadvantage for durable press finished 100 % cotton fabrics. The loss of fabric mechanical strength {{has been attributed to}} two main factors: acid-catalyzed depolymerization and crosslinking of the cellulose molecules. The objective of this project is to evaluate the contributions to the overall strength loss by acid degradation and by crosslinking of cellulose, and to investigate the relationship between the strength loss due to crosslinking and the molecular structure of the crosslinking agent in order to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of {{tensile strength}} loss in crosslinked cotton fabrics. Based on the understanding of the mechanism, {{we will be able to}} reach the final objective of optimizing the strength retention and improving the performance of durable press finished cotton fabrics and garments. The tensile strength of durable press finished cotton fabrics is significantly reduced as a result of the crosslinking process. In this research, we investigated the effects of acid degradation and crosslinking of cellulose on the mechanical strength of the cotton fabric crosslinked with polycarboxylic acids, and evaluated various factors influencing the mechanical strength of durable press finished cotton fabrics. The strength loss caused by acid degradation is irreversible. The magnitude of fabric strength loss is affected by the temperature and time of the exposure, the concentration of the acid applied to the fabric, the dissociation constant of the acid, and the pH of the acid solution applied to the fabric. Crosslinking of cellulose with a polycarboxylic acid causes a <b>reversible</b> loss in <b>fabric</b> strength. The magnitude of the fabric strength loss increases as the degree of crosslinking increases. In order to optimize the mechanical strength of crosslinked cotton fabrics, it is necessary to minimize the acid-catalyzed depolymerization by controlling the finish bath pH and the curing conditions.
