For example, siderocalin cannot recognize the siderophores of the C-glucosylated analog of enterobactin, as the donor groups are glycosylated, introducing steric interactions at the position 5-carbons of the catechol groups.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Subitizing {{involves}} <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{that allow}} effortless enumeration {{of up to}} four visual objects, however despite ample resolution experimental data suggest that only one pitch can be reliably enumerated. This {{may be due to}} the grouping of tones according to harmonic relationships by <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms</b> prior to fine pitch processing. Poorer frequency resolution of auditory information available to <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may lead to unrelated tones being grouped, resulting in underestimation of pitch number. METHODS, RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We tested whether pitch enumeration is better for chords of full harmonic complex tones, where grouping errors are less likely, than for complexes with fewer and less accurately tuned harmonics. Chords of low familiarity were used to mitigate the possibility that participants would recognize the chord itself and simply recall the number of pitches. We found that accuracy of pitch enumeration was less than the visual system overall, and underestimation of pitch number increased for stimuli containing fewer harmonics. We conclude that harmonically related tones are first grouped at the poorer frequency resolution of the auditory nerve, leading to poor enumeration of more than one pitch. Open Acces...|$|R

5000|$|Siderophores are {{typically}} bound to siderocalin with subnanomolar affinities, {{and interact with}} siderocalin specifically. The Kd value of the siderocalin/siderophore interaction, measured by fluorescence quenching (Kd= 0.4 nM), indicates that siderocalin can capture siderophores with high affinity. This Kd value {{is similar to that}} of the FepA bacterial receptor (Kd= 0.3 nM). Siderophore/siderocalin binding is directed by electrostatic interactions. Specifically, the mechanism involves hybrid electrostatic and cation-pi interactions in the positively charged protein calyx. The siderophore is positioned in the centre of the siderocalin calyx, and is associated with multiple direct polar interactions. Structural analysis of the siderocalin/siderophore interaction has shown that the siderophore is accompanied by a poor and diffuse quality of electron density, with the majority of the ligand exposed to the solvent when the siderophore is fit in the calyx. Siderocalin typically does not bind hydroxamate-based siderophores because these substrates do not have the necessary aromatic electronic structure for cation-pi interactions. In order to acquire iron in the presence of siderocalin, pathogenic bacteria utilize several siderophores that do not bind to siderocalin, or structurally modify siderophores to inhibit siderocalin binding. Siderocalin can bind soluble siderophores of mycobacteria, including carboxymycobactins. In vivo studies have shown that the binding interactions between carboxymycobactin and siderocalin serve to protect the host organism from mycobacterial infections, with siderocalin inhibiting mycobacterial iron acquisition.Siderocalin can sequester ferric carboxymycobactins by employing a polyspecific <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The siderophore/siderocalin <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism</b> primarily involves hybrid electrostatic/cation-pi interactions. [...] The fatty acid tails of carboxymycobactin reside in a ‘tail-in’ or ‘tail-out’ conformation within pocket 2. [...] The ‘tail-in’ conformation of the fatty acid chain lengths introduces a significant interaction between the calyx and the ligand, increasing the affinity of the siderocalin calyx and carboxymycobactin. [...] The fatty acid tails of short lengths have a correspondingly less favorable binding to siderocalin, and cannot maintain the necessary interaction with the binding pocket.Since lipocalin-2 cannot bind the long fatty acid chain carboxymycobactins of mycobacteria, it is apparent that a number of pathogens have evolved to avoid the activity of lipocalin-2.|$|E
50|$|In pinnipeds, {{mothers and}} pups are {{frequently}} separated throughout nursing {{and are thus}} expected to have evolved an efficient individual recognition system. Consequentially, in Australian sea lions, as in many social mammals, mothers and their offspring can identify each other. Individual recognition produces mutual benefits by avoiding misdirected maternal care and therefore energy expenditure for mothers, {{and the risk of}} injury for young approaching unrelated, potentially dangerous, adult females. Individual recognition can be accomplished with a combination of several sensory modalities, including olfaction, vision, and audition. The use of olfactory cues as a close range <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism</b> allows mothers to further confirm their pup’s identity. In contrast to recent olfactory studies in pinnipeds which showed the presence but not a natural function of olfaction in pinnipeds, the present study shows that wild Australian sea lions use their olfactory abilities in a functional manner, by discrimination between the scents of their own offspring and a non-filial pup. However, in a dynamic, crowded colony, the acoustic channel seems to be the most reliable modality. For pinnipeds, neither visual nor olfactory cues are likely to be the primary modality for mother-pup recognition.|$|E
50|$|Sic1 {{needs to}} be {{phosphorylated}} at multiple sites for ubiquitination-driven degradation (Fig. 2). The multiple phosphorylations are required for Sic1 to be recruited by Cdc4 to the SCF complex. The Cdc4 substrate <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism</b> includes the interaction with consensus binding motifs {{on the surface of}} the folded and phosphorylated Sic1, the so-called Cdc4 phospho-degrons (CPD). It has been shown that the optimal consensus sequence for Cdc4 is a phosphorylated serine or threonine followed by a proline and a basic amino acid. However, none of the CPDs {{on the surface of the}} Sic1 show such a composition. Therefore, multiple phosphorylation of Sic1 is necessary to get high-affinity binding to Cdc4. Although this mechanism looks inefficient, it provides advantages for a cell because it is possible to measure the environmental Cln/cdc28 concentration. The number of phosphorylated sites corresponds to the concentration of Cln/cdc28 and Sic1 could be considered as a sensor for this protein. In contrast to the many sharp transitions of ultrasensitive kinase cascade feedback loops, this mechanism allows fine tuned regulation. Moreover, because multiple phosphorylations are required, the probability that Sic1 is degraded by random is small. Using multiple phosphorylation of Sic1, the cell evolved a strategy to highly regulate the onset of DNA replication that is absolutely vital to provide genetic stability.|$|E

Object recognition was tested directly {{by looking at the}} preferential exploration of novel objects over simultaneously presented familiar objects. Object recognition was also tested indirectly by presenting just novel objects or just familiar objects, and recording exploration levels. Rats with perirhinal cortex lesions were severely impaired at discriminating a novel object from a simultaneously presented familiar object (direct test), yet displayed normal levels of exploration to novel objects presented on their own and showed normal declines in exploration times for familiar objects that were repeatedly presented (indirect tests). This effective reduction in the exploration of familiar objects after perirhinal cortex lesions points to the sparing of some <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This possibility led us to determine whether rats with perirhinal cortex lesions can overcome their preferential exploration deficits when given multiple object familiarisation trials prior to that same (familiar) object being paired with a novel object. It was found that after multiple familiarisation trials, objects could now successfully be recognised as familiar by rats with perirhinal cortex lesions, both following a 90 -min delay (the longest delay tested) and when object recognition was tested in the dark after familiarisation trials in the light. These latter findings reveal: (i) the presumed recruitment of other regions to solve recognition memory problems in the absence of perirhinal cortex tissue; and (ii) that these additional <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms</b> require more familiarisation trials than perirhinal-based <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R

It has been demonstrated that Formica polyctena uses genetically-based cues as a nestmate <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Since F. polyctena, like all ant species, lives in colonies with high genetic relatedness, this type of mechanism would be successful in distinguishing between colonies. Beye, Neumann and Moritz conducted a study where pairs of ants from different nest were introduced to each other {{to see if they}} fought, tolerated or avoided one another. Pairs of ants from the same nests were introduced as well to act as a control. Genetic similarity between these ants was measured as well. A strong positive correlation existed between antagonistic behavior and genetic dissimilarity. Thus, F. polyctena ants mostly likely recognize their fellow workers through some genetically produced signal. Nest populations in close physical proximity to one another didn’t necessarily demonstrate either extremely aggressive or passive behavior toward each other, indicating that nest proximity does not influence recognition. Additionally, nest distance did not correlate with genetic similarity. [...] Essentially, F. polyctena has adapted some form of genetically-based cue that allows nestmates to distinguish between each other and foreign individuals. Beye, Neumann and Moritz believe that these genetic cues act to keep nest colonies separate in homogenous environments that offer no other nestmate recognition strategies.|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} that many animals are promiscuous has challenged {{the importance of}} Hamilton’s Rule because it reduces the net benefits of helping nestmates. To resolve this challenge, biologists have investigated animals’ abilities to determine degrees of relatedness among individuals using kin recognition mechanisms. I conducted a literature review and found that most animals use one of two mechanisms: “familiarity” whereby kin are remembered from interactions early in life, such as in a nest, or “phenotype matching” whereby putative kin are compared to a template of what kin should look, smell, or sound like based on relatives encountered during early life or on one’s own phenotype (called “self-referent phenotype matching”). Theory suggests that familiarity should evolve when being born together is a reliable cue of relatedness, and phenotype matching should evolve when familiarity is unreliable. However, the conditions favouring the evolution {{of one of these}} mechanisms over the other has been largely unstudied. In my thesis, I begin to fill this gap using two promiscuous fish species, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and guppies (Poecilia reticulata), and suggest other life history (brood size) and environmental (predation) factors that might influence <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In bluegill, I show that kin recognition can lead to enhanced anti-predator shoaling behaviour, and that high promiscuity, which causes low levels of relatedness within broods, leads to the expression of self-referent phenotype matching. In guppies, I use six guppy populations to show that average brood size and predation regime cannot explain kin <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and in contrast to my findings in bluegill, brood relatedness does not explain <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism,</b> but it is correlated with the intensity of recognition. Furthermore, I use phylogenetic analysis to show that <b>recognition</b> <b>mechanism</b> is not evolutionarily constrained in guppies.
