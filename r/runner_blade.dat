25|$|Blade Runner is an American neo-noir {{science fiction}} media {{franchise}} originating from the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, {{about the character}} of Rick Deckard. The book has been adapted into several media, including films, comics, a stage play, and a radio serial. The first film adaptation was Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott in 1982. Although the film initially underperformed at the American box office, it became a cult classic, and has had a significant influence on science fiction. A novelization and a comic adaptation of the film were released in the same year. From 1995 to 2000, three novels serving as sequels to both Blade Runner and the original novel were written by K. W. Jeter, a friend of Dick's. A film sequel to Blade <b>Runner,</b> <b>Blade</b> Runner 2049, was released in 2017. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Blade Runner in 2012, a short film was released, and in the lead up {{to the release of}} Blade Runner 2049, several more short films detailing events that occurred between 2019 and 2049 were released.|$|E
30|$|To {{improve the}} design speed {{and reduce the}} design cost for the {{previous}} blade design method, a modified inverse design method is presented. In the new method, {{after a series of}} physical and mathematical simplifications, a sail-like constrained area is proposed, which can be used to configure different <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> shapes. Then, the new method is applied to redesign and optimize the <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> of the scale core component of the 1400 -MW canned nuclear coolant pump in an established multi-optimization system compromising the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). After the execution of the optimization procedure, three optimal samples were ultimately obtained. Then, through comparative analysis using the target <b>runner</b> <b>blade,</b> {{it was found that the}} maximum efficiency improvement reached 1.6 %, while the head improvement was about 10 %. Overall, a promising <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> inverse design method which will benefit the hydraulic design of the mixed-flow pump has been proposed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Kaplan turbine is an inward flow {{reaction}} turbine, which means, {{working fluid}} changes pressure {{as it moves}} through turbine and change its energy. Power is recovered from kinetic energy of the flowing water. During this process stresses are built up among many parts of Kaplan turbine like guide vane, <b>runner</b> <b>blade,</b> screws, hub, shaft etc. However, wall thickness of hub is much bigger in size therefore stress analysis of hub is not necessary. The screws, pins etc. parts do not contribute much in weight & cost of turbine. Guide vanes are also show less stress parameters compared to runner blades. The <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> design is the main factor for optimizing the Kaplan turbine design. Parameters which affect the <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> optimization are material of blade, runner diameter, stress relive groove, thickness of blade. This paper investigates, static stresses, weight & cost of the blade and {{it was found that}} blade weight is reduced up to 500 Kg's and cost is reduced up to 4472 USD per blade. Key words: Kaplan turbine, guide vane, static analysis...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the sensitivity of the index test with focus on the behavior of the guide vane and <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> angles. This was achieved by comparing the cam curves from an index test with a design of experiment. Index tests are a popular method for determining cam curves for Kaplan turbines. Index tests, as they are performed today, do not take into account a suspected hysteresis phenomenon in the guide vane and <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> mechanism. If and how this affects the cam curve is today unknown which this project has investigated. An experiment was designed based on the “design of experiment” method. The difference from a traditional index testing is that the measurements were performed in a random order and only two propeller curves were plotted, but with eight replicates. Ten different guide vane angles were used; five for each <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> angle and a total of 80 measurements were performed over the span of two days. Then, the measurements were compared with the results from an index test performed the day before on the same machine, a full-scale turbine in the Lule Älv-river using the same equipment. When analyzing the distribution of the efficiency, it has a larger spread on the left hand side of the propeller curve compared to the best efficiency point and negligible variation around the best efficiency point. The difference in the cam curves between the two methods was smaller than the estimated measurement error at the best efficiency point. The peak efficiency in the experiment was found for a slightly higher flow rate at one of the <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> angles but this point was between two settings at the index test. The variations in efficiency are at their largest before the peak and may vary between a high efficiency and significantly lower efficiency at this point. Additional measurements may reduce the risk for choosing a guide vane angle at which such behavior occurs. A constant difference in the readings between the fixed scale and the station sensor were observed for the <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> mechanism. This difference varied with the <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> angle and amounted to 0. 26 ° for 1 ° and 0. 70 ° for 4 ° <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> angle. For the guide vane mechanism no hysteresis could be validated. A difference between the fixed scale and the station sensor which varied depending on the direction was spotted and could be validated with 95 % significance. The difference in the readings from the fixed scale and the station sensor was in average 0. 15 ° larger when increasing the guide vane angle than when decreasing the angle.

40|$|In this study, a Francis turbine with {{specific}} speed of 130 m-kW was designed {{on the basis}} of the port area and loss analysis. The meridional shape of the runner was designed focusing mainly on the combination of the guide vane loss analysis and experience. The <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> inlet and outlet angles were designed by calculation of Euler’s head, while the port area of blade was modified by keeping constant angles of the blade at inlet and outlet. The results show that the effect of the port area of <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> on the flow exit angle from runner passage is significant. A correct flow exit angle reduces the energy loss at the draft tube, thereby improving the efficiency of the turbine. The best efficiency of 92. 6 % is achieved by this method, which is also similar to the design conditions by the one dimension loss analysis...|$|E
30|$|As a result, the {{averaged}} meridional velocity is {{the intermediate}} variable and becomes gradually stable during {{the design process}} above, so that the swirl velocity becomes the unique variable determining the loading pressure {{as well as the}} blade shape.

30|$|After the {{calculation}} of the wrap angles, the results are then imported into a three-dimensional modelling software among with the other established variables, such as blade thickness, meridional shape and blade number.

40|$|In this diploma thesis two partial {{studies of}} the {{instrumentation}} of a hydropower unit are conducted. These are carried out {{within the scope of}} the JUSPOWER-project. The first part of the thesis deals with the instrumentation of the runner. The incorporation of sensors in a Kaplan <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> is tested in a experimental set-up on a laboratory scale without dismantling the runner. A further development of the design is suggested that enables damaged sensors to be replaced. The sensors are calibrated with a system destined to be used on site. The results show that the sensors function properly in the test set-up. Further calibration will though be needed during the installation on the <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> and under operational conditions. The suction cup of the calibration system may have to be modified depending on the shape of the <b>runner</b> <b>blade.</b> The second part is a comparison study concerned with the choice of sensors for radial load measurements at the guide bearings. To measure the load on the bearing segments, the dowel peg on the bearing segment would either be replaced by a load cell or modified so strain gages could be bonded onto the peg itself. The performance of the sensors is evaluated in a loading machine with respect to linearity, hysteresis and sensitivity. Furthermore, the stiffness of the load cell is experimentally determined in a load machine. The results show that the strain gages bonded on the modified dowel peg do not have a reliable output signal. However, the installation of the tested load cell would alter the stiffness of the dowel peg. The load cell had a stiffness that was almost 50 % lower than the dowel peg...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{standardized}} rules on how the fluid in the turbine should be included in rotor models of hydraulic machinery. This thesis is an attempt to shed some light on this issue. We approach the problem from two viewpoints, situated at place at a hydropower plant and by mathematical analysis. One goal of the thesis is to develop a measurement system that monitors the instantaneous pressure at several locations of a <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> on a 10 MW Kaplan prototype in Porjus along Lule river. Paper A outlines the development of the measurement system and the instrumentation of the <b>runner</b> <b>blade.</b> Miniature piezo-resisitive pressure transducers were mounted flush to the surface. If instrumentation is successful, the pressure field of the <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> could be measured simultaneously as the loads and displacements of the guide bearings and the generator. The second objective is concerned with how the motion-induced fluid force affects the dynamic behaviour of the rotor. Inertia and angular momentum of the fluid and shrouding are expected to influence the dynamic behaviour of the turbine. Paper B scrutinizes this assumption by presenting a simple fluid-rotor model that captures the effects of inertia and angular momentum of the fluid on the motion of a confined cylinder. The simplicity of the model allows for powerful analytical solution methods. The results show that fluid inertia, angular momentum and shrouding of hydraulic turbines could have substantial effects on lateral rotor vibrations. This calls for further investigation with a more complex fluid-rotor model that accounts for flexural bending modes.

40|$|The {{technical}} development of hydraulic machinery has gone towards lighter components and higher power concentration levels. A {{deregulation of the}} power market world-wide means that the machines experience more transient loads and are sometimes operated at off-design points. Those facts demand a more precise dynamic analysis at the design level of hydraulic machinery than what was formerly customary. Mechanical engineering needs enhanced tools for this purpose. Prediction models need to be validated against experimental data. There are limited possibilities to perform experimental investigations of hydropower prototypes. Fundamental in an experimental dynamic analysis {{is to determine the}} forces acting on the machine. This paper is concerned with a monitoring system to estimate the angular resolved pressure field on the suction- and pressure side of a prototype Kaplan <b>runner</b> <b>blade.</b> By measuring the pressure at different positions on the <b>runner</b> <b>blade,</b> we have a tool to determine the hydraulic load acting on the runner.

Past research works have shown that the optimization of theFrancis turbine <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> shapes can decrease erosion by a signicant amount. This study conductedas a Master's Thesis has taken the proposed designs from past works and conducted a CFDanalysis on a single passage of a Francis <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> to choose an optimized design in terms of erosionand eciency. Structural analyses have been performed on the selected design through one-way andtwo-way FSI to compare the structural integrity of the designs. Two types of cases have been considered in this thesis work to dene the boundary condition of thestructural model. In the rst case, a <b>runner</b> <b>blade</b> is considered to have no in uence of the joint andother stier components. In the second case, a sector of the whole runner has been modeled withnecessary boundary conditions. Both one-way and two-way FSI have been performed on the casesfor the designs. Mesh independent studies have been performed for the designs, but only for the rstcase, whereas in the second case, a ne mesh has been used to make the analysis appropriate. The loads have been imported into the structural domain from the uid on the interfaces for one-wayFSI. In the case of two-way FSI, the Multi-Field Solver (MFX) supported by ANSYS has been usedto solve the coupled eld analysis. A fully coupled FSI in ANSYS works by writing an input le inthe structural solver containing the information about the interfaces in the structural domain, whichis imported in the uid solver. The interaction between the two domains is dened in ANSYS-CFX,including the mesh deformation and solver setups. The results have been post-processed in CFX-Post,where the results from both the elds are included. It has been found that the structural integrity ofthe optimized design is better than the reference design in terms of the maximum stress induced inthe runner. The two-way FSI analysis has been found as an inevitable part of the numerical analysis.
