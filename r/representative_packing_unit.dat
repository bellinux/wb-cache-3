50|$|An annular blowout {{preventer}} uses {{the principle of}} a wedge to shut in the wellbore. It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an elastomeric <b>packing</b> <b>unit,</b> reinforced with steel ribs. The <b>packing</b> <b>unit</b> is situated in the BOP housing between the head and hydraulic piston. When the piston is actuated, its upward thrust forces the <b>packing</b> <b>unit</b> to constrict, like a sphincter, sealing the annulus or openhole. Annular preventers have only two moving parts, piston and <b>packing</b> <b>unit,</b> making them simple and easy to maintain relative to ram preventers.|$|R

30|$|Following the {{occurrence}} of bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases in cattle, Japan established a traceability system for beef (Food Rink News 2003). Compared with cattle, eels are small and cannot be sold separately, {{making it difficult to}} establish traceability for every individual fish. However, it is possible to attach a traceable RFID chip to every <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> of eel. Each <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> of eel exported to the Japanese market weighs 20  kg, and every 20  kg package carries a traceable RFID chip. The cost of a piece of RFID chip is 20 NT$. The price of eel is unstable and keeps changing. It can range from 200 NT$ to 600 NT$ per kg. The price of a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> (20  kg) can range from 4, 000 NT$ to 12, 000 NT$. If an RFID chip is attached to every <b>packed</b> <b>unit,</b> the cost will increase by about 0.5 % when the price of a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> is 4, 000 NT$, and the cost will increase by about 0.17 % when the price of a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> is 12, 000 NT$. For eel farmers and exporters, costs will slightly increase, but this extra cost is justified by the ease of traceability. RFID aside, eel farmers should keep records of their production process and the materials they use during production, as these are helpful in setting up a proper traceability system.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Ado N. Vujasinovic {{was awarded}} a patent for a {{variation}} on the annular preventer known as a spherical blowout preventer, so-named because of its spherical-faced head.

Both types of annular preventer are in common use.|$|R

40|$|Radioactive wastes require {{strict rules}} for {{manipulation}} with them {{due to the}} hazards for the human health and environment, not excluding the hazards during their internal transport. The article deals with the transport of <b>packing</b> <b>unit</b> inside {{of the company and}} it proposes the possible alternatives so that meet the limit conditions and reduce the manipulation time with the radioactive material in the <b>packing</b> <b>unit.</b> The <b>packing</b> unite isolates fixated liquid waste from the environment while it also serves as protection. There are also important external radiation characteristics of package unit, which consist of measurable values of the scratch contamination surface and dose power on the surface of package unit. Thus, the paper is aimed to point out the necessity of the logistics during manipulation with the package unit in the process of internal transport so that the dose power of exposed employees would achieve the lowest possible level and meet the strict limits in a full extent...|$|R
40|$|Lattice-model {{simulations}} and experiments of {{some small}} proteins suggest that folding is essentially {{controlled by a}} few conserved contacts. Residues of these conserved contacts form the minimum set of native contacts needed to ensure foldability.

Two short backbone fragments of width five centred at the C? atoms in contact is called an H-form, {{which serves as a}} candidate for the <b>packing</b> <b>units.</b> The structural alignment of protein family members or even across families indicates that there are conservative H-forms which are similar both in their sequences and local geometry, and consistent with the structural alignment.
