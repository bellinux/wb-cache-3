50|$|Proposed {{structures}} {{have included}} modified cruise ships, <b>refitted</b> oil <b>platform,</b> a decommissioned anti-aircraft platform, and custom-built floating islands. No {{one has yet}} created a state {{on the high seas}} that has been recognized as a sovereign state.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with flying-off {{platforms}} {{mounted on the}} roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. During the 1928 <b>refit</b> the <b>platform</b> was removed from 'X' turret. The platform on 'B' turret was removed in 1933.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with flying-off {{platforms}} {{mounted on the}} roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. During the 1933-34 <b>refit,</b> the <b>platforms</b> {{were removed from the}} turrets and a catapult was installed on the roof of 'X' turret, along with a crane to recover a seaplane.|$|R
50|$|Engineered from a <b>refitted</b> oil <b>platform</b> {{and based}} on the natural forms of baobob trees, the Tree of Life is located on Discovery Island, roughly {{in the center of the}} park. Its leaves are made out of kynar. At the structure's {{interior}} base is a 400-seat theater that hosts It's Tough to be a Bug!, a 4-D film attraction based on A Bug's Life.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with flying-off {{platforms}} {{mounted on the}} roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. During her early-1930s <b>refit,</b> the <b>platforms</b> {{were removed from the}} turrets and an extending Type EIT catapult was installed on the roof of 'X' turret, along with a crane to recover a floatplane. This was initially a Fairey IIIF until it was replaced by a Fairey Swordfish in 1938.|$|R
50|$|In the Vietnam War, the United States {{introduced}} {{fixed and}} rotary wing gunships, cargo aircraft <b>refitted</b> as gun <b>platforms</b> {{to serve as}} close air support and air interdiction aircraft. The first of these was the AC-47 Spooky. Later models include the Fairchild AC-119 and the Lockheed AC-130; the latter was used extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|R
5|$|Hood was {{initially}} fitted with flying-off platforms mounted {{on top of}} 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which Fairey Flycatchers could launch. During her 1929â€“31 <b>refit,</b> the <b>platform</b> was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding catapult was installed on her quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a seaplane. She embarked a Fairey IIIF from No. 444 Flight of the Royal Air Force. During the 1932 West Indies cruise, the catapult proved {{to be difficult to}} operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with flying-off {{platforms}} {{mounted on the}} roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. In 1927 a rotating aircraft catapult was installed on Resolutions quarterdeck. It was removed during her 1929-31 <b>refit.</b> The flying-off <b>platforms</b> were removed in 1932-33. A catapult was added {{on the roof of}} 'X' turret by September 1936 as well as a crane to handle the aircraft.|$|R
500|$|The ship's heavy {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) armament {{consisted of}} twelve 25-caliber Mk 10 five-inch guns which were mounted on single mounts, three each fitted on sponsons {{on each side}} of the bow and stern. No light AA guns were initially mounted on Lexington, but two sextuple [...]30-caliber (7.62mm) machine gun mounts were installed in 1929. They were unsuccessful and were replaced by two [...]50-caliber (12.7mm) machine guns by 1931, one each on the roof of the superfiring eight-inch turrets. During a <b>refit</b> in 1935, <b>platforms</b> mounting four [...]50-caliber machine guns were installed on each corner of the ship, and an additional platform was installed that wrapped around the funnel. Six machine guns were mounted {{on each side of}} this last platform. In October 1940, four 50-caliber Mk 10 three-inch AA guns were installed in the corner platforms; they replaced two of the [...]50-caliber machine guns which were remounted on the tops of the eight-inch gun turrets. Another three-inch gun was added on the roof of the deckhouse between the funnel and the island. These guns were just interim weapons until the quadruple 1.1-inch gun mount could be fielded, which occurred in August 1941.|$|R
