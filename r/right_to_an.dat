5|$|The ACLU {{regularly}} tackled {{police misconduct}} issues, {{starting with the}} 1932 case Powell v. Alabama (<b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attorney), and including 1942's Betts v. Brady (<b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attorney), and 1951's Rochin v. California (involuntary stomach pumping). In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues. During the 1950s and 1960s, the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct. The Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia, in 1958, to create the nation's first civilian police review board. In 1959, the Illinois affiliate published the first report in the nation, Secret Detention by the Chicago Police, which documented unlawful detention by police.|$|E
5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence {{is related to the}} primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E

Several of these rights are trial rights: the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial, the right to confront witnesses at trial, the right to a public trial, the right to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography, and the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself. Others, such as the assistance of counsel and due process rights, have application throughout the proceeding.|$|E

On March 5, 1974, two new defendants (Jeannette Jefferson and Robert Hayes) were named in an indictment involving the same charges. On April 26, while Shakur was pregnant, New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne signed an extradition order to move Shakur to New York to face two counts of attempted murder, attempted assault, and possession of dangerous weapons related to the alleged ambush; however, Shakur declined to waive her <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> extradition hearing, {{and asked for a}} full hearing before Middlesex County Court Judge John E.

In this document, Otto II granted Theophanu the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> extensive dower for personal use throughout her life (legitima dos), as well as her entry into a consortium imperii with Otto II, meaning that both would share imperial authority over the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her most famous and influential work. Wollstonecraft's fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesmen Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{generated}} several controversies {{related to its}} violence and depiction of women. A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers, who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste. The mission also received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups. The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women, particularly {{in the wake of}} backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit when she claimed the game was misogynistic in her review. After Petit's review webpage received more than 20,000 largely negative comments, many journalists defended her <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> opinion and lamented the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism. Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses. Their lawsuits were later dismissed. Australian department store Target pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition against depictions of violence towards women in the game.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{fairness}} {{is essential to}} the administration of justice. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial embodies this notion of fairness and informs the development of almost every aspect of law. This is most clearly visible in the criminal process. However, the practical application of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial raises a number of issues. In part, its presence in almost every area of law means that the right is composed by a number of other rights. Further, because the concept of fairness is not static, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial has an ever changing scope, content and meaning. These considerations have resulted in the absence of clear principles guiding the application of the right in the everyday administration of justice. If left unattended, there is real risk that this lack of guidance may eventually dilute the substance of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial. As a consequence of its fundamental nature, a weakening of the right brings implications for the continued public confidence in the administration of justice. This paper will contend that the application of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial should be directed toward the goals of the criminal process. This means that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial should protect the rights of the defendant to promote the legitimacy of the verdict. Fundamentally however, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial means the right that all persons have <b>to</b> <b>a</b> factually accurate verdict. The continued significance of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial therefore requires the formation and application of the law to be directed toward the goal of factually accuracy in the verdict and also, <b>to</b> reach such <b>a</b> verdict {{in a way that is}} fair to all parties...|$|R

50|$|There is {{no federal}} {{constitutional}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{trial by jury}} in a state civil case under the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, and not all states preserve <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> civil jury in either their state constitution or state statutes. In practice, however, civil jury trials are available, generally on <b>a</b> similar basis <b>to</b> their availability in federal court, in every state except Louisiana. In these states, there is <b>a</b> general <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> jury trial in cases that would arise at law in colonial England, which generally includes most cases seeking simple money damages and no other relief. In practice, about three-quarters of all civil jury trials involved personal injury cases, {{and most of the}} rest involve breaches of contracts. In states where a state constitution provides for <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> jury trial, or <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> open courts, this has sometimes been interpreted to confer not only <b>a</b> procedural <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain type of trial, but also <b>a</b> substantive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have redress through the courts for the kinds of injuries that were compensable at common law.|$|R
