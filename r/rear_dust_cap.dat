5000|$|In some {{loudspeaker}} designs <b>dust</b> <b>caps</b> {{can also}} {{be part of the}} acoustic design of the driver by radiating high frequency energy or suppressing it. Typically the <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> is made of the same material as the cone. In some tweeter designs, the dome is in fact the only sound radiating surface and so it performs both roles.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> (also {{known as}} dust dome, or dome) is a gently curved dome mounted either in concave or convex {{orientation}} over the central hole of most loudspeaker diaphragms. It protects the inner mechanics (such as the pole pieces {{and the voice}} coil) from small particles (which can cause rubs) and other contamination. <b>Dust</b> <b>caps</b> can also contribute structural integrity to the voice coil assembly or the cone.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, <b>dust</b> <b>caps</b> (famale) and <b>dust</b> plugs (male) are available, but do {{not have}} an industry-standard [...] "type" [...] designation.|$|R

5000|$|A {{more common}} {{approach}} is to employ the <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> as a high frequency radiator. The <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> radiates low frequencies, moving {{as part of the}} main assembly, but due to low-mass and reduced damping, radiates increased energy at higher frequencies. As with whizzer cones, careful selection of material, shape and position are required to provide smooth, extended output. High frequency dispersion is somewhat different for this approach than for whizzer cones. A related {{approach is to}} shape the main cone with such profile, and of such materials, that the neck area remains more rigid, radiating all frequencies, while the outer areas of the cone are selectively decoupled, radiating only at lower frequencies. Cone profiles and materials can be modeled in FEA software and the results predicted to excellent tolerances.|$|R
50|$|The woofer is {{made from}} pure, long carbon fibers that were {{fabricated}} into sheets. Eight of the sheets are bonded together to make the cone. The <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> in the center is also a carbon fiber sheet formed into a dome. The woofer magnet is 11,350 Gauss and 220,000 Maxwell. The frame is diecast aluminum.|$|R

5000|$|Phase plugs may {{be placed}} in front of woofer cones, {{especially}} in horn-loaded loudspeaker designs. In the same fashion as compression driver phase plugs, the intent is to minimize higher-frequency wave interference near the driver. In this case, [...] "high frequency" [...] is relative to the intended bandpass; for example, a 12 in cone woofer might be expected to reproduce 550 Hz energy near the top of its intended range, however, the wavelength of 550 Hz is approximately twice the diameter of the woofer, so wave energy at that frequency traveling laterally {{from one side to the}} other will be out of phase and will cancel. With a phase plug in the center, such lateral wave energy bounces off of the obstruction and is reflected outward toward the listener. Phase plugs for woofer cones are typically solid plugs positioned over the woofer's central <b>dust</b> <b>cap,</b> or in the center of the woofer, replacing the <b>dust</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R
50|$|Construction is of {{the usual}} cast brass housing for {{plumbing}} parts, with a threaded connection to the pipework at the base. The top has a small outlet, usually hidden beneath a plastic <b>dust</b> <b>cap.</b> Internally {{there is a large}} hollow body, normally filled with water, and containing a float valve. The valve must always be installed vertically, usually {{at the top of a}} short vertical pipe.|$|R
5000|$|Some bass {{amplifier}} combos have a [...] "whizzer cone" [...] {{attached to}} the low frequency woofer's centre. The whizzer cone {{is about the same}} size as a <b>dust</b> <b>cap,</b> although it resembles a miniature speaker cone. The whizzer cone handles the upper frequencies that are too high for the woofer. Roland's 60 watt and 120 watt bass combos contain both a woofer and a whizzer cone.|$|R
50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, {{to the metal}} ring that covers the {{bearings}} in a cup-and-cone ball-bearing hubset. These types of <b>dust</b> <b>caps,</b> being press-fit, are difficult to remove with bending or damaging them. It is suggested to press them out {{from the other side}} of the hub using a screw driver. In this role the dustcap reduces the dust that enters the bearing races, and extends service intervals.|$|R
5000|$|Some early Super Reverb {{amplifiers}} {{came with}} the option of factory equipped JBL speakers instead of the Jensen, Oxford or Utah speakers widely used {{in the majority of}} Fender amplifiers. The JBL speakers had aluminum <b>dust</b> <b>caps</b> with larger magnets and voice coils, this gives a fuller response range and handles more power reducing the risk of [...] "blowing a speaker". These models also add to the overall weight of the amp, making casters (wheels) a very good option.|$|R
5000|$|Even though {{acoustic}} suspension cabinets {{are often}} called [...] "sealed box" [...] designs, {{they are not}} entirely airtight. A small amount of airflow must be allowed so the speaker can adjust to changes in atmospheric pressure. A semi-porous cone surround allows enough airflow for this purpose. Most Acoustic Research designs used a PVA sealer on the foam surrounds to enable a longer component life and enhance performance. The venting was via the cloth spider and cloth <b>dust</b> <b>caps,</b> not so much through the surround.|$|R
50|$|A {{metered-dose inhaler}} {{consists}} of three major components; the canister which is produced in aluminium or stainless steel by means of deep drawing, where the formulation resides; the metering valve, which allows a metered quantity of the formulation to be dispensed with each actuation; and an actuator (or mouthpiece) which allows the patient to operate the device and directs the aerosol into the patient's lungs., The formulation itself {{is made up of}} the drug, a liquefied gas propellant and, in many cases, stabilising excipients. The actuator contains the mating discharge nozzle and generally includes a <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> to prevent contamination.|$|R
50|$|Even if {{only one}} non-terminated coupler acts as the bus because all devices (bus controller, remote terminals, etc.) are {{connected}} to the couplers stubs, the external bus connections of the coupler must be terminated. A dual-terminated coupler (with or without non-functional bus connectors) can be employed where the coupler acts as the bus without other couplers. RFI <b>dust</b> <b>caps</b> (with or without safety chains) are recommended for all unused stub ports. Data bus couplers are readily available in 2 through 8 stubs and in various sizes and shapes of boxes and slim inline models. Also a variety of connectors are offered with couplers.|$|R
50|$|MIL-PRF-28876 (formerly MIL-C-28876) is a {{performance}} specification describing for circular, plug and receptacle style, multiple removable termini, fiber-optic connectors that are for DoD applications {{and that are}} compatible with multiple transmission element cables. This specification describes a family of general purpose, interconnection hardware providing a variety of compatible optical coupling arrangements, and includes connector shells, connector inserts, connector insert retention nuts, connector backshells, and connector <b>dust</b> <b>caps.</b> These connectors are unique for military applications and must operate satisfactorily in systems under demanding conditions of 10 g's vibration (10 g's), shock (over 1000 g's), and temperature excursions (from -40 degrees C to +70 degrees C).|$|R
2500|$|The M3/M3A1's 30-round {{magazine}} {{was the source}} of complaints throughout the service life of the weapon. [...] Unlike the Thompson, the M3 fed from a double-column, single-feed detachable box magazine which held 30 rounds and was patterned after the British Sten magazine; the single-feed design proved difficult to load by hand, and was more easily jammed by mud, dust, and dirt than double-column, double-feed designs like the Thompson. [...] Additionally, the feed lips of the single-feed design proved more susceptible to feed malfunctions when slightly bent or damaged. Plastic <b>dust</b> <b>caps</b> were later issued to cover the feed end of the magazine and keep out dust as well as protect the sensitive feed lips.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{for use in}} underground coal mines measures the response times of machine-mounted methane monitors. This technique uses a calibration cup to deliver gas to the sensor head to measure response times. For comparison, in the current study, response times were measured by placing methane sensor heads in a specially designed test box where they were exposed to an atmosphere containing a constant concentration of methane. Response time readings measured in the test box were shorter than the readings obtained using the calibration cup. The response times measured in the test box were comparable for sensors from three different manufacturers. The effects of <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> and flame arrestor design on response times were also evaluated using the test box...|$|R
50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, to the crankarm bolt cover. It {{is usually a}} piece of metal or plastic that, on the crankarm, is snapped or screwed into the {{threaded}} counterbore, which houses the bolt that holds the crankarm to its axle, the bottom bracket spindle. The dustcap serves to protect the threads (on {{the inside of the}} counterbore), which are used with a crankarm puller to remove the crankarm from the spindle. It is also possible for the crank arm to squirm on the bottom bracket spindle, causing the crankarm nut/bolt to become loose, leading to the nut/bolt working its way out of the bottom bracket spindle. The <b>dust</b> <b>cap</b> limits the amount of dangerous loosening that can occur.|$|R
50|$|An Elsie mine is {{constructed}} mainly from plastic, {{which makes it}} difficult to detect. The mine comprises two separate items; the body and charge. The body is fitted with a protective <b>dust</b> <b>cap,</b> which is removed in order to insert the charge. Around the shaft of the charge there is a restraining safety clip to prevent it moving downwards whilst in transit, which could accidentally trigger detonation. The safety clip is removed when the mine is emplaced, at which point the mine becomes armed and will detonate if someone steps on it. Elsie mines are supplied with an aluminium detector ring fitted. However, the ring is designed to be easily removed, and without it the mine becomes a minimal metal mine.|$|R
50|$|MIL-PRF-64266 is a {{performance}} specification describing the performance requirements for circular, plug and receptacle style, multiple removable genderless termini, fiber optic connectors for DoD applications—including aerospace and maritime—and that {{are compatible with}} multiple transmission element cables. These fiber optic connectors cover a family of general purpose, interconnection hardware providing a variety of compatible optical coupling arrangements, including connector shells, connector inserts, connector backshells, connector backshell accessories, and connector <b>dust</b> <b>caps.</b> All connector styles are designed to assure proper orientation of the mating halves prior to mating, and provide engagement between mated shells prior to terminus engagement and have the termini so located as {{to be protected from}} handling damage. The plug and receptacle styles permit straight, wall (panel) mounted, jamnut mounted, right angle and other connector configurations.|$|R

40|$|PIRATE (Physics Innovations Robotic Astronomical Telescope Explorer) {{consists}} of a 14 inch (35 cm) f/ 10 Schmidt Cassegrain telescope (a Celestron 14) on a robotic mount, in a robotic dome {{on top of the}} main observatory building at the Observatori Astronomic de Mallorca (OAM). PIRATE's main duties are for supporting research and teaching and it is the latter that brings quite stringent requirements for security whilst still offering the students comprehensive access and a rich experience. We cannot rely on the students closing the dome in bad weather, it must happen automatically. Additionally the observatory site is commonly unmanned during observing sessions, i. e. there is no one there to re-boot PCs, remove <b>dust</b> <b>caps,</b> attach dew shields, or make the telescope safe during bad weather. We have to achieve all these things without local assistance or remove the need for them in the first place. ...|$|R
