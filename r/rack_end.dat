50|$|By {{the early}} part of the 17th century Standlake had three or four public houses, {{including}} the Chequers, which traded until at least 1781. By the latter part of the 18th century Standlake had between seven and 11 pubs. The Black Horse is a 16th-century building that was a pub by 1761 and continues to trade today. By 1790 The Bell had opened in <b>Rack</b> <b>End,</b> but by 1804 it had moved to the High Street to a building part of which is timber-framed infilled with brick nogging, and the remainder of which is built of Cotswold stone. The Bell was closed for refurbishment for some time after the sale of the pub by Greene King in 2008, but reopened in August 2010 as a free house run by Few Inns.|$|E
50|$|The airer {{consists}} of a rack with several horizontal wooden rails, usually 4 to 7, known as laths, with two <b>rack</b> <b>ends,</b> originally cast iron. The <b>rack</b> <b>ends</b> are brackets that separate the laths and also act as points to secure the cords that raise and lower the unit. Cords go from the metal tether points to pulleys mounted on the ceiling, {{and then to a}} cleat mounted on the wall.|$|R
50|$|Many {{currently}} manufactured automobiles worldwide use MacPherson strut suspension, which utilises one {{ball joint}} per side, between {{the lower end}} of the strut and the control arm, with the necessary small amount of articulation at the top of the strut being usually provided by an elastomeric bearing, within which is a ball bearing to allow free rotation about the steering axis. So, there are commonly only two ball joints in the suspension, however there will be at least four (track rod <b>ends</b> and <b>rack</b> <b>ends)</b> in the steering linkage.|$|R
50|$|Pockets, usually rimmed at {{the back}} with leather or plastic, may have leather mesh or cloth bags or plastic cups, or {{elongated}} wire racks, to catch the balls, common in home billiard rooms and pool halls, or in the coin-operated tables found in bars/pubs may instead lead to ball-return troughs inside the table, which channel the balls into a collection chamber {{on one side of}} the table (or, in non-coin-op models, on the <b>racking</b> <b>end</b> of the table). A disadvantage to pockets with bags or cups is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.|$|R
50|$|At {{about the}} halfway point between Täsch and Zermatt, there is the Kalter Boden {{crossing}} point, opened in 1972 simultaneously {{with the introduction of}} shuttle services. Here the last <b>rack</b> section <b>ends.</b> Due to the heavy usage of this section of the line, almost all trains must wait there, to cross with a train operating in the opposite direction.|$|R

50|$|During the Great Depression {{traffic on}} the <b>rack</b> railway was <b>ended</b> on 14 September 1932. On 11 December 1936 the {{concession}} to operate the railway ended and in the 1940s the line was dismantled.|$|R
5000|$|A sucker pole is a pole {{that appears}} to be safe to lock a bike to, but can easily be {{dismantled}} by bicycle thieves. It may be a sign, fence, or bike <b>rack</b> that <b>ends</b> in the ground or pavement; such poles are never secured to the base, making vehicles attached to them easy targets.In Chicago, 252 bicycles were stolen in this manner in 2012. Another source says thieves can easily take the parked bike in as little as [...] "10 seconds", in plain view and broad daylight.|$|R
60|$|As I {{stood in}} the dark shadow of the tunnel's <b>end</b> <b>racking</b> my brain for a {{feasible}} plan the while I watched, catlike, the old man's every move, he took up the money-pouch and crossed to {{one end of the}} apartment, where, bending to his knees, he fumbled with a panel in the wall.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to design a method to measure weight and center of gravity (C. G.) location for Space Station Modules by adding sensors to the existing <b>Rack</b> Insertion <b>End</b> Effector (RIEE). Accomplishments included alternative sensor placement schemes organized into categories. Vendors were queried for suitable sensor equipment recommendations. Inverse mathematical models for each category determine expected maximum sensor loads. Sensors are selected using these computations, yielding cost and accuracy data. Accuracy data for individual sensors are inserted into forward mathematical models to estimate the accuracy of an overall sensor scheme. Cost of the schemes can be estimated. Ease of implementation and operation are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The line uses {{adhesion}} {{as far as}} Grafenort station. Then {{after this}} station the line enters theGrafenort to Engelberg Tunnel, using rack propulsion through the tunnel.At the point of entering the tunnel, the pre-2010 surface alignment can be seen diverging to the right. The line formerly continued on adhesion as far as Obermatt ZB station, where the rack section started for the climb via Grünenwald station. Here the main road originally crossed the line via an unusual double bascule bridge, used instead of a level crossing {{because of the presence}} of the rack rail. The <b>rack</b> section <b>ended</b> above Grünenwald at the Ghärst passing loop.|$|R
50|$|The {{emotional}} {{weight of}} the symphony is resolved by the long final movement, which incorporates and ties together music from the earlier movements, whereby the opening passage of the symphony, now transferred to the horns, {{is found to be}} the answer to tame the savage dissonance that had <b>racked</b> the <b>end</b> of the first movement. The music of the flute solo that was heard after the introductory funeral scene can now return to close the symphony peacefully, and unexpectedly, in the principal key of F major. The draft for this movement reveals that Mahler had originally written the ending in B major, but in the process of revision worked the same music into F, the key of the first movement.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{is a collection}} of technical reports on research conducted by the participants in the 1993 NASA/ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program at KSC. The basic common objectives of the Program are: to further the professional knowledge of qualified engineering and science faculty members; to stimulate an exchange of ideas between participants and NASA; to enrich and refresh the research and teaching activities of participants' institutions; and to contribute to the research objectives of the NASA centers. 1993 topics include wide band fiber optic communications, a prototype expert/information system for examining environmental risks of KSC activities, alternatives to premise wiring using ATM and microcellular technologies, <b>rack</b> insertion <b>end</b> effector (RIEE) automation, FTIR quantification of industrial hydraulic fluids in perchloroethylene, switch configuration for migration to optical fiber network, and more...|$|R
500|$|A unique {{feature of}} the line, which is still fully operational, is its oldest and steepest track uses rack and pinion technology. Currently the line runs for , up to the {{foothill}} station of Kallar, where the rack rail portion begins. The <b>rack</b> rail portion <b>ends</b> at Coonoor railway station. The longest tunnel of this section measures [...] The route has a gradient of 1:12.5 till Coonoor and past Coonoor to the final station, the track has a ruling gradient of 1:23.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Lev Leviev and Vyacheslav Mirilashvili set up Selectel and {{established}} a data centre {{to meet the demands}} of VK in terms of data processing and storage. The social network fully adopted it by 2009, and, prior to running its own data centre in 2012, depended on a single service provider. This allowed Selectel to become a large company with a 11% share in the data centre market according to the number of server <b>racks</b> at the <b>end</b> of 2011.|$|R
5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II {{coaches were}} designed for long-distance service and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms {{at one end of}} the car. There is a baggage <b>rack</b> at the <b>end</b> of the car. On some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} {{sequencing}} of requests in an automated storage/retrieval system with dedicated storage. We consider the block sequencing approach, where {{a set of}} storage and retrieval requests is given beforehand and no new requests come in during operation. The objective for this static problem {{is to find a}} route of minimal total travel time in which all storage and retrieval requests may be performed. The problem of sequencing a list of retrievals is equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and thus NP-hard in general. We show that the special case of sequencing under the dedicated storage policy can be solved in polynomial time. The results apply to systems with arbitrary positions of the input and output stations. This generalizes the models in the literature, where only combined input/output stations are considered. Furthermore we identify a single command area in the <b>rack.</b> At the <b>end</b> we evaluate the model against heuristic procedures...|$|R
5000|$|Passengers {{are allowed}} to carry {{a limited number of}} smaller bags with them in the vehicle, these are known as hand luggage (more {{commonly}} referred to as carry-on in North America), and contain valuables and items needed during the journey. There is normally storage space provided for hand luggage, either under seating, or in overhead lockers. Trains often have luggage <b>racks</b> at the <b>ends</b> of the carriage near the doors, or above the seats if there are compartments. There are differing views between North America and Europe in relation to the rules concerning the amount of baggage carried on to aircraft. In North America there is considerable debate as to whether passengers carry too many bags on board and that their weight could be a risk to other passengers and flight safety. US airlines are beginning to introduce weight and size restrictions for carry-on baggage. Whereas in Europe, many airlines, especially low-cost airlines, impose what is commonly known as [...] "the one-bag rule". This is a restriction imposed to stop excessive weight on board and airlines claim that this policy allows them to speed the boarding of the aircraft. Airports in Europe have mounted a campaign with the European Commission in an attempt to overturn these hand luggage regulations. They claim that it is affecting their duty-free and other airport retail sales and is reducing their revenues.|$|R
40|$|Debris flows are {{dangerous}} phenomena {{due to their}} large run-out distances and high velocities. The time-space evolution of the interstitial pore water pressures much affects the propagation stage of debris flows. Thus, a quantitative physically-based combined modelling of both flow propagation and pore water pressure changes is a fundamental issue for landslide risk analysis and to design effective control works. The paper provides a contribution to this topic {{through the use of}} an enhanced numerical model, which combines a 3 D depth-integrated hydro-mechanical coupled SPH (Smooth Particles Hydrodynamics) model for the propagation analysis and a 1 D vertical FDM (Finite Difference Method) model for the evaluation of the pore water pressure along the height of the flowing mass. In this paper, the SPH-FDM model is used to simulate, in 2 D and 3 D analyses, well-documented flume tests performed in USA through a 90  m long channel exiting at a sub-horizontal pad. The model is later used to simulate other flume tests, performed in Japan in a 3. 4  m long channel, equipped without or with a (permeable) <b>rack</b> at the <b>end</b> of the channel, which allows the pore water pressures reducing until the mass eventually stops. Doing so, the paper shows that the SPH-FDM model is capable to properly reproduce the time-space evolution of the pore water pressures during the propagation stage with different geometries of experimental flumes and different hydraulic boundary conditions, such as an impervious or permeable bottom...|$|R
50|$|The {{release lever}} (L) holds the rack (M) {{up when the}} clock is not striking. On the shaft of the minute hand (not shown), which rotates once per hour, there is a {{projection}}. As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly lifts the release lever, allowing the rack to fall until its point rests on the snail (N). The amount the rack can fall, and thus the number of strikes, {{is determined by the}} position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train (G, H, K) is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the pins (G) repeatedly lift the hammer (F) and allow it to drop, ringing the gong (E). The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel (H) makes one revolution each strike. A small pin (S) on this wheel engages the rack teeth, lifting the rack up by one tooth each turn. When the <b>rack</b> reaches the <b>end</b> of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, {{in such a way that}} gear (H) is held stationary with the pin (S) not engaging the rack, so that the rack is able to fall freely again on the next hour). So the number of strikes is equal to the number of teeth of the rack which are used, which depends on the position of the snail.|$|R
