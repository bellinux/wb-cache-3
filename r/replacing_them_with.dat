5|$|Tim Webber of VFX house Framestore CFC was {{responsible}} for the three-and-a-half minute single take of Kee giving birth, helping to choreograph and create the CG effects of the childbirth. Cuarón had originally intended to use an animatronic baby as Kee's child {{with the exception of the}} childbirth scene. In the end, two takes were shot, with the second take concealing Clare-Hope Ashitey's legs, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> prosthetic legs. Cuarón was pleased with the results of the effect, and returned to previous shots of the baby in animatronic form, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> Framestore's computer-generated baby.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of these problems, in 1954 serious {{consideration}} was given to scrapping the class and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> Britannia class locomotives. However, the locomotives had excellent boilers and several other good features and so the decision was taken to rebuild them, removing several of Bulleid's less successful ideas.|$|E

5|$|Burger King and McDonald's {{opened on}} the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1983. This marked a {{transition}} from sit-down to fast-food dining on the turnpike by popular demand. The Marriott Corporation purchased the remaining Howard Johnson's restaurants in 1987, incorporating it into its Host Marriott division and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> restaurants such as Roy Rogers and Bob's Big Boy.|$|E
5|$|This {{two-tier system}} of local {{government}} lasted until 1996 when the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 came into effect, abolishing the regions and districts and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> 32 unitary authorities. Arran {{is now in the}} North Ayrshire council area, along with some of the constituent islands of the old County of Bute.|$|E
5|$|A roadway has {{connected}} Benton City to Richland {{since at}} least 1926, while a road with an alignment more {{similar to that of}} the current highway first appeared on maps in 1939, with termini at the concurrent highways U.S. Route 410 and PSH3. The highway now known as SR224 was numbered Secondary State Highway 3R (SSH3R) between 1937 and the 1964 state highway renumbering, which abolished the Primary and Secondary highway numbers, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> Sign Route numbers, later renamed State Routes.|$|E

5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties {{from the district}} and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.|$|E
5|$|Matthias visited Slavonia and {{dismissed}} the two Bans Nicholas Újlaki and Emeric Zápolya, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> Jan Vitovec and John Tuz in 1466. Early the following year, he mounted a campaign in Upper Hungary against {{a band of}} Czech mercenaries who were {{under the command of}} Ján Švehla and had seized Kosztolány (now Veľké Kostoľany in Slovakia). Matthias routed them and had Švehla and his 150 comrades hanged.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} opening {{took place on}} 19 November 1927 by King Haakon VII. When the line opened there were 21 manned station on the line. Up to 70 people worked on the line, in addition to station employees. In 1932, the operations were rationalized, cutting costs from NOK426,000 to NOK310,000 per year. This involved removing the station masters at fifteen stations and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> a clerk.|$|E

5|$|Under Section 16, the Act {{applies to}} {{servants}} of the crown, while Section 17 repeals all previous common law and statutory offences relating to bribery, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> {{provisions of the}} Act. Section 18 provides that the Act applies to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; while the separate consent of the Scottish Parliament is usually required in such cases, as is made clear in Section 19, a Legislative Consent Motion was passed on 11 February 2010, allowing {{for the application of}} the Act within Scotland.|$|E
5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E

Bond meets Octopussy, a wealthy woman who leads the Octopus cult. Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> replicas, while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West, via Octopussy's circus troupe.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth's {{plan to have}} Mary {{married to}} Louis of France divided the court. The Lackfis, {{the master of the}} {{treasury}} Nicholas Zámbó and the judge royal Nicholas Szécsi openly opposed it and renounced their allegiance to the queen dowager in August, which resulted in her depriving them of all their offices and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> Garai's partisans. The kingdom {{was on the verge of}} a civil war when Charles decided to invade, encouraged by John Horvat and his brother Paul, Bishop of Zagreb. Charles' imminent arrival forced Elizabeth to yield and abandon the idea of French marriage. While her envoys in Paris were preparing for Louis's journey, Elizabeth came to terms with her opponents and designated Szécsi as the new palatine.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to complain of exhaustion and accused management of overuse. A second consecutive last-place finish, along with declining talent, their fans stopped attending home games, with attendance numbers averaging 50 paid spectators. John Clarkson, {{who went on}} to win 328 games in a 12-season career, and was the only Hall of Famer to have played for the franchise, began his career for the 1881 Ruby Legs. When the season ended, the NL decided to drop the team from the league, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> the Philadelphia Quakers, who later became the Phillies.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major modernisation, removing the murals {{installed on the}} Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> plain white tiles, in a style {{similar to those used}} when the station opened in 1900. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} things the mutineers did was to show disrespect to their {{commanding}} officers. The mutineers then removed the official military tribunes loyal to Rome, and <b>replaced</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> their own ringleaders. They proceeded to plunder the towns and areas around the Sucro fort. In addition they removed the normal Roman military insignias and <b>replaced</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> the insignia of fasces and axes (a symbol of death).|$|R

5|$|In late 1996, {{after more}} than five years of {{addiction}} to heroin, Frusciante quit it cold turkey. However, months later he was still unable to break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol. In January 1998, urged by longtime friend Bob Forrest, Frusciante checked into Las Encinas, a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, to begin a full recovery. Upon arrival, he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his rotten teeth and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> dental implants. He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms. About a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas and re-entered society.|$|E
5|$|The Bribery Act 2010 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} the {{criminal}} law relating to bribery. Introduced to Parliament in the Queen's Speech in 2009 after several decades of reports and draft bills, the Act received the Royal Assent on 8 April 2010 following cross-party support. Initially scheduled to enter into force in April 2010, this was changed to 1 July 2011. The Act repeals all previous statutory and common law provisions in relation to bribery, instead <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> the crimes of bribery, being bribed, the bribery of foreign public officials, {{and the failure of}} a commercial organisation to prevent bribery on its behalf.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May also depicts an execution, {{an early}} {{event in the}} {{so-called}} Peninsular War between France and Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain in 1808, capturing its royal family and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> his brother, Joseph. The French were as unpopular in Spain as they later were in Mexico, and they encountered a fierce insurrection, which ultimately triumphed. The Third of May execution was an indiscriminate killing of civilians by French soldiers in reprisal for a guerrilla attack the previous day. Goya's painting of the massacre, which shows terrified civilians facing a firing squad, was intended to arouse anger and hatred {{on the part of}} Spanish viewers. Goya's is a highly romantic picture of a deeply emotional episode.|$|E
