40|$|Inductive Pulsed Plasma Thruster (IPPT) pulse circuits, such {{as those}} needed to operate the Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT), are {{required}} to quickly switch capacitor banks operating at a period of s while conducting current at levels {{on the order of}} at least 10 kA. [1, 2] For all iterations of the PIT to date, spark gaps have been used to discharge the capacitor bank through an inductive coil. Recent availability of fast, highpower solid state switching devices makes it possible to consider the use of semiconductor switches in modern IPPTs. In addition, novel preionization schemes have led to a reduction in discharge energy per pulse for electric thrusters of this type, relaxing the switching requirements for these thrusters. [3, 4] Solid state switches offer the advantage of greater controllability and reliability, as well as decreased drive circuit dimensions and mass relative to spark gap switches. The use of solid state devices such as Integrated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs), Gate Turnoff Thyristors (GTOs) and SiliconControlled Rectifiers (SCRs) often involves the use of power diodes. These semiconductor devices may be connected antiparallel to the switch for protection from reverse current, or used to reduce power loss in a circuit by clamping off current ringing. In each case, higher circuit efficiency may be achieved by using a diode that is able to transition, or 'switch,' from the forward conducting state ('on' state) to the <b>reverse</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>state</b> ('off' state) in the shortest amount of time, thereby minimizing current ringing and switching losses. Silicon Carbide (SiC) PiN diodes offer significant advantages to conventional fastswitching Silicon (Si) diodes for high power and fast switching applications. A wider band gap results in a breakdown voltage 10 times that of Si, so that a SiC device may have a thinner drift region for a given blocking voltage. [5] This leads to smaller, lighter devices for high voltage applications, as well as reduced forward conduction losses, faster reverse recovery time (faster turnoff), and lowermagnitude reverse recovery current. In addition, SiC devices have lower leakage current as compared to their Si counterparts, and a high thermal conductivity, potentially allowing the former to operate at higher temperatures with a smaller, lighter heatsink (or no heatsink at all) ...|$|E

40|$|In this letter, {{we propose}} an AlGaN/GaN {{normally}} off high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with <b>reverse</b> drain <b>blocking</b> capability. The device features a Schottky-ohmic drain electrode {{in which a}} Schottky-controlled normally off channel is inserted between the gate and the conventional ohmic drain contact.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology Supervisor: Prof. R. Tzoneva Co-supervisor: Prof. P. Petev 2013 Busbars {{are the most important}} components in the distribution networks. Faults on the busbar are uncommon, however an occurrence of a busbar fault can lead to a major loss of power. Busbars are the areas in a substation where the levels of current are high and therefore the protective relay application is very critical. In order for the protection scheme to be successful it is important to carry out the following specifications: Selectivity, Stability, Sensitivity, and Speed. To meet all of the above requirements protection must be reliable, meaning that the protection scheme must trip when called up to do so (dependability) and it must not trip when it’s not supposed to (security). The thesis focuses on the <b>reverse</b> <b>blocking</b> busbar protection scheme with aim to improve the speed of its operation {{and at the same time}} to increase operational reliability, flexibility and stability of the protection during external and internal faults by implementation of the extended functionality provided by the IEC 61850 standard-based protective IEDs. The practical implementation of the scheme by the use of IEC 61850 standard communication protocol is investigated. The research analyzes in detail the <b>reverse</b> <b>blocking</b> busbar protection scheme that is used at the moment in the power systems and it develops an improved IEC 61850 based <b>reverse</b> <b>blocking</b> busbar protection scheme for a distribution network. The proposed scheme is designed for a radial type of a distribution network and is modeled and simulated in the DigSILENT software environment for various faults on the busbar and its outgoing feeders. The results from the simulations are used further for implementation of the designed protection scheme. A laboratory test bench is build using three compliant with the IEC 61850 standard ABB IEDs 670 series, CMC 356 Omicron test injection device, PC, MOXA switch, and a DC power supplier. Two ways of the <b>reverse</b> <b>blocking</b> signals between the IEDs implementation are considered: hard wired and Ethernet communication by using IEC 61850 standard GOOSE messages. Comparative experimental study of the operational trip response speed of the two implementation shows that the performance of the protection scheme for the case of Ethernet communication is better The thesis findings and deliverables will be used for postgraduate studies of other students, research, short courses, and solution of industrial problems.
