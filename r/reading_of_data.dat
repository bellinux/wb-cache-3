25|$|The {{cassette}} {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a streamer cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable write-protect tab on only one side of the top edge of the cassette, with {{the other side of the}} top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> hence only one side of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E

Modern magnetic tape is most commonly packaged in cartridges and cassettes. The device that performs writing or <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> is a tape drive.

50|$|Destructive reading. Since {{both the}} reading and {{the writing of}} data are carried out with laser beams, there is a {{potential}} for the reading process to cause a small amount of writing. In this case, the repeated <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> may eventually serve to erase it (this also happens in phase change materials used in some DVDs). This issue has been addressed by many approaches, {{such as the use of}} different absorption bands for each process (reading and writing), or the use of a reading method that does not involve the absorption of energy.|$|E
50|$|OTP (one time programmable) {{memory is}} a special type of {{non-volatile}} memory (NVM) that permits data to be written to memory only once. Once the memory has been programmed, it retains its value upon loss of power (i.e., is non-volatile). OTP memory is used in applications where reliable and repeatable <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> is required. Examples include boot code, encryption keys and configuration parameters for analog, sensor or display circuitry. OTP NVM is characterized, over other types of NVM like eFuse or EEPROM, by offering a low power, small area footprint memory structure. As such OTP finds application in products from microprocessors & display drivers to Power Management ICs (PMICs).|$|E

40|$|RFID emerges {{to be one}} of the key {{technologies}} to modernize Logistics and supply chain management. In a typical RFID enabled logistics and supply chain application, there exist RFID readers to detect and identify the goods with RFID tags attached. Considering the huge amount of goods, the successful <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> RFID <b>data</b> becomes a crucial issue. Many algorithms and models to improve the RFID reading have been proposed, yet most of them focus on addressing the problem in a single reading node. In this paper, we introduce a P 2 P model to identify and remove inaccurate <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> RFID <b>data</b> by utilizing the information exchanged among related nodes along the business processing route of each RFID tagged item. The successful deployment of this model will ease the demand for high accurate <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> each RFID <b>reading</b> node while reducing the total cost of the RFID network. Our simulation shows the RFID network correct function against the business requirements will be ensured while the overall performance of the RFID network can be guaranteed. © 2008 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|MTConnect is a {{protocol}} {{designed for the}} exchange of data between shop floor equipment and software applications used for monitoring and data analysis. MTConnect {{is referred to as}} a read-only standard, meaning that it only defines the extraction (<b>reading)</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from control devices, not the writing of data to a control device. Freely available, open standards are used for all aspects of MTConnect. Data from shop floor devices is presented in XML format, and is retrieved from information providers, called Agents, using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as the underlying transport protocol. MTConnect provides a RESTful interface, which means the interface is stateless. No session must be established to retrieve data from an MTConnect Agent, and no logon or logoff sequence is required (unless overlying security protocols are added which do). Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is recommended for discovery services.|$|E

50|$|Scientists around Daniel Rugar and John Mamin at the IBM {{research}} laboratories in Almaden {{have been}} the pioneers in using heated AFM (atomic force microscope) probes for the modification of surfaces. In 1992, they used microsecond laser pulses to heat AFM tips to write indents as small as 150 nm into the polymer PMMA at rates of 100 kHz. In the following years, they developed cantilevers with resonance frequencies above 4 MHz and integrated resistive heaters and piezoresistive sensors for writing and <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> This thermo-mechanical data storage concept {{formed the basis of}} the Millipede project which was initialized by Peter Vettiger and Gerd Binnig at the IBM Research laboratories Zurich in 1995. It was an example of a memory storage device with a large array of parallel probes, which was however never commercialized due to growing competition from non-volatile memory such as flash memory. The storage medium of the Millipede memory consisted of polymers with shape memory functionality, like e.g. cross-linked polystyrene, in order to allow to write data indents by plastic deformation and erasing of the data again by heating. However, evaporation instead of plastic deformation was necessary for nanolithography applications to be able to create any pattern in the resist. Such local evaporation of resist induced by a heated tip could achieved for several materials like Pentaerythritol tetranitrate, cross-linked polycarbonates, and Diels-Alder polymers. Significant progress in the choice of resist material was made in 2010 at IBM Research in Zurich, leading to high resolution and precise 3D-relief patterning {{with the use of the}} self-amplified depolymerization polymer polyphthalaldehyde (PPA) and molecular glasses as resist, where the polymer decomposes into volatile monomers upon heating with the tip without the application of mechanical force and without pile-up or residues of the resist.|$|E
