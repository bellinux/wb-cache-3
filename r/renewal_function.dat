40|$|Scale {{functions}} play {{a central}} role in the fluctuation theory of spectrally negative Lévy processes and often appear in the context of martingale relations. These relations are often complicated to establish requiring excursion theory in favour of Itô calculus. The reason for the latter is that standard Itô calculus is only applicable to functions with a sufficient degree of smoothness and knowledge of the precise degree of smoothness of scale functions is seemingly incomplete. The aim of this article is to offer new results concerning properties of scale functions in relation to the smoothness of the underlying Lévy measure. We place particular emphasis on spectrally negative Lévy processes with a Gaussian component and processes of bounded variation. An additional motivation is the very intimate relation of scale <b>functions</b> to <b>renewal</b> <b>functions</b> of subordinators. The results obtained for scale functions have direct implications offering new results concerning the smoothness of such <b>renewal</b> <b>functions</b> for which there seems to be very little existing literature on this topic...|$|R

Frees (1986 a, Warranty analysis and <b>renewal</b> <b>function</b> estimation, Naval Res. Logist. Quart, 33, 361 - 372) proposed the nonparametric estimator of <b>renewal</b> <b>function</b> for large values of t. Frees’s estimator {{is easy to}} apply in practice. It is a preferred estimator for large values of t. However, its statistical properties still have not been investigated in detailed. For this reason, in this study, we investigate asymptotic properties of this estimator such as consistency, asymptotic unbiasedness and asymptotic normality. Also Monte Carlo simulation study is given to assess the performance of this estimator according to value of <b>renewal</b> <b>function.</b> Simulation results indicate that in the large values of t, Frees estimator is sufficiently close to the <b>renewal</b> <b>function</b> for the Gamma distribution with various parameters...|$|E

It is, therefore, a subject of interest in maintenance research. An issue that is addressed in this study is the extension of capacity analysis to quantification of health condition of railway infrastructure under certain traffic profile. Such integrity indicator or measure of infrastructure performance gives an additional measure of capacity limitation on a line. Using infrastructure performance indicators in capacity analysis help to relate maintenance and <b>renewal</b> <b>functions</b> to the capacity condition of a network and also facilitate effective maintenance decision making.|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>renewal</b> <b>function</b> {{is widely}} {{useful in the}} areas of reliability, {{maintenance}} and spare component inventory planning. Its calculation relies on the type of the probability density function of component failure times which can be, regarding the region of the component lifetime, modelled either by the exponential or by one of the peak-shaped density functions. For most peak-shaped distribution families the closed form of the <b>renewal</b> <b>function</b> is not available. Many approximate solutions {{can be found in the}} literature, but calculations are often tedious. Simple formulas are usually obtained for a limited range of functions only. Objectives: We propose a new approach for evaluation of the <b>renewal</b> <b>function</b> by the use of a simple discrete approximation method, applicable to any probability density function. Methods/Approach: The approximation is based on the well known renewal equation. Results: The usefulness is proved through some numerical results using the normal, lognormal, Weibull and gamma density functions. The accuracy is analysed using the normal density function. Conclusions: The approximation proposed enables simple and fairly accurate calculation of the <b>renewal</b> <b>function</b> irrespective of the type of the probability density function. It is especially applicable to the peak-shaped density functions when the analytical solution hardly ever exists...|$|E

40|$|This thesis will {{consider}} methods associated with irregularly spaced sampling of a real-valued continuous time stationary process. The problem of Monte Carlo simulation {{as well as}} parametric estimation under irregularly spaced sampling times will be discussed. For the simulation problem, the {{focus will be on}} the spectral simulation method. A novel algorithm has been proposed for the determination of the spectral simulation scheme, which is optimal in the sense of achieving required accuracy with minimal computational costs. The problem of parametric estimation under irregularly spaced sampling times will also be discussed. We will adapt the framework stochastic sampling times, in which the irregularity of the sampling times is modeled through a renewal point process over the real line. By constructing a second order discrete time stationary process from sampling, a parametric estimation method based on the well-known Whittle log-likelihood function will be proposed. Asymptotic consistency of the resulting estimator will be proved by borrowing existing results from literature of renewal theory. Moreover the performance issue of this proposed estimation procedure will be investigated further. It will be shown that by calculating the spectral density of the sampled discrete time process through a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) approximation, the Whittle log-likelihood function can indeed be evaluated relatively efficiently. This estimation method, however, will induce information loss, which will be shown {{to be related to the}} unique properties of the <b>renewal</b> kernel <b>function.</b> Although a accurate analysis of the <b>renewal</b> kernel <b>function</b> is not easy, it is still possible to provide some insights on the determining factors of the information loss through asymptotic calculations...|$|R
