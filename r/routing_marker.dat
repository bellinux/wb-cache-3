40|$|There are no reported, {{convenient}} {{in vitro}} models for studying polarized functions in salivary epithelial cells. Accordingly, we examined three often-used salivary cell lines {{for their ability}} to form a polarized monolayer on permeable, collagen-coated polycarbonate filters. Only the SMIE line, derived from rat submandibular gland, had this ability. The SMIE cell monolayer exhibited junctional complexes, with a tight-junction-associated protein, ZO- 1, localized to cell-cell contact areas. The Na+/K+-ATPase alpha 1 -subunit was detected predominantly in the basolateral membranes, while the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 2 appeared primarily in the apical membranes. Using adenovirus-mediated cDNA transfer, SMIE cells were shown to be capable of <b>routing</b> <b>marker</b> proteins (beta-galactosidase +/- a nuclear targeting signal, alpha 1 -antitrypsin, aquaporin- 1) to appropriate locations. Furthermore, this salivary cell monolayer provided a convenient tool for studying aquaporin- 1 -mediated, osmotically directed, transepithelial fluid movement in vitro. Thus, SMIE cells appear to be a useful experimental model with which to study some polarized functions in a salivary epithelial cell line. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
30|$|In {{spite of}} their promises, these first {{attempts}} do not yet fulfill the expectations of a systematic and generic framework for the programming of decentralized systems. They rarely allow developers to think about distributed applications as a woven composition of decentralized mechanisms (e.g., overlay topologies, <b>routing</b> paths, <b>markers),</b> or to reason in a systematic manner about the fundamental aspects of these decentralized mechanisms such as their spatial extent, their interactions (bindings, events, regulations) and their life cycle. Similarly, these first attempts provide very few mechanisms for recursion in the structures they produce (a recurring property of composable systems), for example by allowing a network to exist within one another, while feeding on the data and context provided by its host network.|$|R
40|$|Security in {{wireless}} sensor networks {{is critical}} due to its way of open communication. Packet modification is a common attack in {{wireless sensor networks}}. In literature, many schemes have been proposed to mitigate such an attack but very few detect the malicious nodes effectively. In the proposed approach, each node chooses the parent node for forwarding the packet towards sink. Each node adds its identity and trust on parent as a <b>routing</b> path <b>marker</b> and encrypts only the bytes added by node in packet before forwarding to parent. Sink can determine the modifiers based on trust value and node identities marked in packet. Child node observes the parent and decides the trust on parent based on successful and unsuccessful transactions. Data transmission is divided into multiple rounds of equal time duration. Each node chooses the parent node {{at the beginning of}} a round based on its own observation on parent. Simulated the algorithm in NS- 3 and performance analysis is discussed. With the combination of trust factor and fixed path routing to detect malicious activity, analytical results show that proposed method detect modifiers efficiently and early, and also with low percentage of false detection...|$|R
40|$|Security in {{wireless}} sensor networks {{is critical}} due to its way of open communication. In this paper we have considered suite of attacks - packet modification, packet dropping, sybil attack, packet misrouting, and bad mouthing attack, and provided a solution to detect attacks. In literature, many schemes have been proposed to mitigate such attacks but very few detect the malicious nodes effectively and also no single solution detects all attacks. In the proposed approach, each node chooses the parent node for forwarding the packet towards sink. Each node adds its identity and trust on parent as a <b>routing</b> path <b>marker</b> and encrypts only the bytes added by node in packet before forwarding to parent. Sink can identify the malicious node based on trust value and node identities marked in packet. Child node observes the parent and decides the trust on parent based on successful and unsuccessful transactions. Data transmission is divided into multiple rounds of equal time duration. Each node chooses the parent node {{at the beginning of}} a round based on its own observation on parent. Simulated the algorithm in NS- 3 and performance analysis is discussed by comparing the results with other two recently proposed approaches. With the combination of trust factor and fixed path routing to detect malicious activity, simulation results show that proposed method detect malicious nodes efficiently and early, and also with low percentage of false detection...|$|R
