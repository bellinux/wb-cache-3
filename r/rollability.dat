40|$|The {{development}} of a new method to measure a behavioral shape property of sand grains is presented. This property "rollability " is related to the angle of slope on which a grain will roll down in air. It is measured on the inside of a slightly inclined revolving cylinder mantle. The grains emerge from {{the lower end of the}} cylinder and the time it takes them to reach this lower end is a measure for their <b>rollability.</b> The property "rollability " correlates well with the influence of grain shape in other processes such as settling in water. The <b>rollability</b> is measured on ~ phi sieve fractions. The measurements are transferred to relative <b>rollability</b> values. For a certain area, the mean of all the <b>rollability</b> values is calculated per sieve fraction and the individual measurements are expressed as percentile deviations of this mean value. In this way, the strong influence of the source of the material on the shape characteristics is largely excluded and the observed shape differences between samples can be attributed exclusively to shape sorting phenomena. This facilitates the comparison between sediments of same depositional circumstances but different source. Per sample, graphs are plotted which show the distribution of the relative <b>rollability</b> values over the size fractions. This property is called the Shape Distribution Character (S. D. C.). It appears to be characteristic for the mode of origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} b-glucan on corn tortilla texture were evaluated. Barley flour (9. 7 % b-glucan) was {{substituted}} at 2. 5, 5 and 10 % for dry masa flour in corn tortillas. Texture was evaluated after 4 hr {{and up to}} 7 d storage at 4 ?C. Substitution of 2. 5 - 10 % barley flour significantly improved tortilla texture. Combined effects of barley flour (0 - 2. 5 %), maltogenic amylase (0 - 1650 MAU) and carboxymethylcellulose (0 - 0. 5 %) were evaluated using surface response methodology. Barley flour increased <b>rollability,</b> pliability, energy dissipated and reduced rupture force and final stiffness. Overall, maltogenic amylase decreased rupture force and Young's modulus but decreased rupture distance, <b>rollability</b> and pliability at levels above 825 MAU. CMC improved <b>rollability,</b> pliability, and rupture distance. The best response was found using barley flour and CMC with 825 MAU, where <b>rollability,</b> pliability, rupture distance and energy dissipated increased while rupture force, Young's modulus and final stiffness decreased. A 70 % barley b-glucan concentrate combined with amylase (550 MAU) or CMC (0 - 0. 5 %) was evaluated in corn tortillas. Amylase combined with b-glucan did not improve texture. Tortillas with b-glucan and CMC had significantly improved pliability, <b>rollability,</b> final stiffness and energy dissipated. Texture measurements analysis showed that depending {{on the stage of}} storage, objective and subjective methods correlate differently. Subjective and objective measurements of texture were not correlated at 4 hr storage. At the end of storage, pliability had significant correlations with stress relaxation measurements, but <b>rollability</b> had higher correlation coefficients with extensibility measurements. Pliability had higher R 2 and lower coefficients of variation compared to <b>rollability.</b> Sensory evaluation was conducted using reheated 14 -day-old tortillas of control, 825 MAU with 0. 25 % CMC, 0. 12 % b-glucans, 0. 18 % b-glucan with 0. 375 % CMC, and 0. 24 % b-glucan with 0. 25 % CMC. All tortillas had similar appearance, flexibility, gumminess, flavor and overall quality. Softness and chewiness of treatments with 0. 12 % b-glucan or 0. 24 % b-glucan with 0. 25 % CMC were similar to control. Other tortillas were significantly tougher and chewier. b-glucan may be the active ingredient in barley flour that modifies firming of corn tortillas during storage.

40|$|Advances in {{high-throughput}} wheat breeding {{techniques have}} resulted in the need for rapid, accurate and cost-effective means to predict tortilla making performance for larger numbers of early generation wheat lines. Currently, the most reliable approach is to process tortillas. This approach is laborious, time consuming, expensive and requires large sample size. This study used a multivariate discriminant analysis to predict tortilla quality using kernel, flour and dough properties. A discriminant rule (suitability = diameter > 165 mm + day 16 flexibility score > 3. 0) was used to classify wheat lines for suitability in making good quality tortillas. One hundred eighty seven hard winter wheat (HWW) varieties from Texas were evaluated for kernel (hardness, diameter, and weight), flour (protein content, fractions and composition), dough (compression force, extensibility and stress relaxation from TA-XT 2 i) and tortilla properties (diameter, rheology and flexibility). The first three principal components explained 58 % of variance. Multivariate normal distribution of the data was determined (Shapiro-Wilk p > 0. 05). PCA identified significant correlation between stress relaxation force and <b>rollability.</b> Canonical correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between kernel and tortilla properties (p? = 0. 75), kernel diameter and weight contributed the highest to this correlation. Flour and tortilla properties were highly correlated (p? = 0. 74). Glutenin to Gliadin ratio (GGratio), IPP and peak time contributed highest to this correlation and can explain > 60 % of variability in tortilla texture (force, distance and work to rupture). The second canonical variate of flour properties is a measure of flour protein content and can explain 26 % of the variability in tortilla <b>rollability.</b> Dough and tortilla properties were significantly correlated (p? = 0. 82, 0. 68, 0. 54, 0. 38 and 0. 29). Dough stress relaxation force after 25 seconds is negatively correlated with tortilla diameter (r = - 0. 73). Kernel hardness, diameter and weight are the best predictors of tortilla texture after 16 days. Glutenin to gliadin ratio and IPP contributed significantly to tortilla texture. This is the first study to identify the contribution of protein content on tortilla <b>rollability</b> score. Dough extensibility can explain 37 % of tortilla <b>rollability.</b> Stress relaxation is the best predictor of tortilla diameter. Tortilla quality variation is attributed to kernel, flour, and dough properties. Logistic regression and stepwise variable selection identified an optimum model comprised of kernel hardness, GGratio, dough extensibility and compression force as the most important variables. Cross-validation indicated 83 % prediction efficiency for the model. This emphasizes the feasibility and practicality of the model using variables that are easily and quickly measured. This is the first model {{that can be used to}} simultaneously predict both tortilla diameter and <b>rollability.</b> It will be a useful tool for the flat bread wheat breeding programs, wheat millers, tortilla processors and wheat marketers in the United States of America...|$|E
40|$|Gluten, {{the storage}} protein in wheat, barley and rye is {{associated}} with coeliac disease, wheat allergy and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. The clinical symptoms include diarrhoea, anaemia, nausea, mouth sore and psychological symptoms {{and in some cases}} a gluten free diet may reduce the severity of irritable bowel disease (IBD). Gluten-related disorders can be prevented by the omission of gluten from the diet. Currently, there is an increasing demand for gluten-free foods due to consumer awareness of gluten-related disorders as well as people seeking to reduce possible dietary risks. New Zealand’s market for gluten-free foods is presently estimated at nearly four million US dollars. The development and production of gluten-free bread presents major technological challenges due to the role of gluten in developing the characteristic structure of both the raw dough and subsequent loaf texture. The main ingredients of bread are water and cereal flours which provide the primary structure to the baked product. Wheat grain is a traditional and common cereal that is milled into bread flour. When wheat flour is hydrated with water, gluten, the protein component hydrates to become a continuous cohesive viscoelastic network entrapping starch granules. This highly elastic network retains CO 2 gas produced by yeast and sugar during leavening, thus forming the foam structure of bread. Gluten replacements that mimic the viscoelastic properties of gluten have been widely investigated for gluten free baked products including flatbread. Flatbread is popular for use in ready-to-eat convenient foods due to its large crust to crumb ratio. Wrap bread is a typical flatbread that can be rolled to hold various fillings. The manufacture of gluten-free wrap breads mainly suffers from poor <b>rollability</b> which is an essential property of the product. Thus, the present study investigated the development of gluten-free wrap bread (GFW) using xanthan gum, guar gum, carboxmethyl cellulose (CMC) as possible replacers for gluten, coconut oil was also added to improve flexibility of the bread. The formulations were investigated and optimised in four integrated phases. In phase 1, guar and xanthan gums were studied as possible gluten replacers during the development of GFWs. GFW samples (n = 16) made from four formulations under four baking conditions (200 °C/ 2 min, 200 °C/ 4 min, 220 °C/ 2 min, 220 °C/ 4 min) were analysed for baking weight loss and <b>rollability.</b> Baking weight loss was determined as moisture loss during baking, while <b>rollability</b> was measured as the ability of the freshly cooked bread to conform to shape (1 - 5 scale) as it was rolled around a 3 -cm diameter wooden dowel (rod). A mixture of guar and xanthan gums (1 : 1) produced GFWs with better <b>rollability</b> and less baking weight loss than either gum alone. GFW samples baked at the higher temperature for the longer time generally had higher <b>rollability.</b> The highest average <b>rollability</b> score (3) obtained for this phase was considered low for wrap breads developed in phase 2. In phase 2, GFWs (n = 20) made from five formulations containing both xanthan and guar gums (1 : 1), CMC, and coconut oil were baked at 230 °C for 2 or 4 min or at 240 °C for 2 or 4 min. Freshly baked GFWs were analysed for baking weight loss, water activity, and colour. <b>Rollability</b> using 1 1 -cm diameter dowel and visible mould growth of the GFWs were determined during storage for 28 days (4 °C). Products produced in phase 2 had no visible mould growth during storage for 3 weeks (4 °C). The inclusion of xanthan-guar gum, CMC and coconut oil into GFWs baked at 240 °C/ 2 min may have contributed to high <b>rollability</b> and low baking weight loss. The effect of each test ingredient (xanthan-guar, CMC, and coconut oil) on the properties of GFWs was the subject of phase 3. In phase 3, a basic formulation made with three levels (9 formulations) each of coconut oil, CMC and xanthan-gum gum were optimized using the Taguchi method to test the effect of each ingredient in the basic formulation. GFWs made using the 9 formulations were analysed by physical and sensory tests over three weeks storage at 4 °C during which mould growth was assessed visually. Products in phase 3 had no visible mould growth during storage for three weeks (4 °C). GFWs with high level of coconut oil (12 %) were characterised by high baking weight loss, high whiteness index and a shorter firmer texture (high rupture force and low rupture distance). CMC (0. 3 %) and xanthan-guar gum (1 %) may have contributed to low water activity, high <b>rollability,</b> high rupture distance and high rupture force during storage. Results indicated that 0. 3 % CMC and 1 % xanthan-guar gum were the optimum levels for these ingredients. As the optimized levels of coconut oil could not be confirmed in this phase, three promising formulations with different levels of coconut oil (8, 10, 12 %) were evaluated in phase 4. In phase 4, three products were produced using 3 optimised formulations from phase 3 and were analysed by physical tests and sensory evaluation during storage for two weeks (4 °C). The 3 optimised formulations selected from phase 3 were: (1) base formulation plus 8 % coconut oil, 0. 3 % CMC and 1 % xanthan-guar gum; (2) base formulation plus 10 % coconut oil, 0. 3 % CMC and 1 % xanthan-guar gum; (3) base formulation plus 12 % coconut oil, 0. 3 % CMC and 1 % xanthan-guar gum. Among the three formulations, samples containing 12 % coconut oil, 0. 3 % CMC and 1 % xanthan-guar gum had the highest consumer sensory acceptability and were characterised by high <b>rollability,</b> and a more flexible texture (moderate rupture force and greater rupture distance) and low baking weight loss...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Feasibility of the stress relaxation technique which has a strong potential for texture characterization of dough and food products, was evaluated with both corn masa and corn tortillas (These are "low-moisture tortillas" which are ready to be fried). The effects of moisture content and resting time on corn masa textural property were investigated. Texture of properties of corn tortilla (fresh up to stale) was evaluated using the stress relaxation technique in two different modes, pure tension and bending-tension. Experimental data were fitted to the 7 -element Maxwell model as well as the Peleg and Normand's model. Biomechanical parameters (stiffness and total energy dissipated) were calculated and used to interpret the changes on textural properties of both corn masa and corn tortilla. The results for tortilla were compared with the subjective <b>rollability</b> score. Stress relaxation technique successfully detected: (1) the textural differences between masa samples with different initial moisture content, and (2) changes in texture of masa as a function of resting conditions and time. Mathematical models were developed to predict the changes. Stress relaxation under pure tension mode showed good correlation with the subjective <b>rollability</b> scores. Stiffness and energy dissipated for tortilla were chosen as best texture property predictors. Stress relaxation under bending-tension mode also exhibited high correlation with the subjective <b>rollability</b> scores for tortillas. Peleg and Normand's model was used to fit the experimental data. k, (an indicator of the rate of stress decay) was selected as the best predictor for corn tortilla. High correlation was observed between the total energy dissipated for fresh corn masa and the value of stiffhess of fresh corn tortilla tested under tension mode.

The parents and progeny crosses were characterized for % resistant starch (RS), gelatinization, and retrogradation characteristics. The RS was measured from the extracted starch targeting the measurement of RS 2, which is present in ungelatinized starch, by using the Megazyme Resistant Starch kit. The RS values from the 10 parent lines varied from 18. 3 % to 52. 2 %, and the values from the 20 progeny crosses ranged from 16. 6 to 34. 0 %. Greater RS in parents was correlated to greater RS in the progeny crosses (r = 0. 63, P ≤ 0. 05). The Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) was used to measure the gelatinization and retrogradation characteristics of the starches. Peak gelatinization temperature and change in enthalpy were positively correlated to % RS (r = 0. 65 and r = 0. 67, P ≤ 0. 05); however, the retrogradation parameters, a measure of RS 3, did not correlate with % RS (RS 2 type). All parents, with the exception of Guat ae, and progeny crosses had % RS greater than that of commercial cornstarch (8. 9 %), but lower than that of a high-amylose standard (50 % apparent amylose, 40. 2 % RS). The % RS and onset temperature increased with the addition of the ae gene. Tortillas are a simple food system made from whole corn that has been nixtamalized. A high-amylose, non-floury corn type with 55. 2 % RS, a floury corn type with 1 % RS, and a 1 : 1 blend with 28. 2 % RS were used to make traditional tortillas. Whole corn was nixtamalized and ground to make masa. The masa was evaluated for pasting properties on a Rapid-Visco Analyser. The high-amylose masa slurry gelatinized only slightly, as noted by a small change in peak viscosity during the 95 y C heat treatment. The floury masa had the greatest peak viscosity, whereas the blend was intermediate in value. Tortillas were evaluated by an 11 -member sensory panel who evaluated the textural attributes of grittiness, moistness, chewiness, <b>rollability,</b> and tearability. The floury tortillas were chewier, more rollable, and grittier than the high-amylose tortillas. The blend tortillas were intermediate in most parameters. The cutting force of the high-amylose tortillas, as measured by a texture analyzer, was very low, whereas the blend and floury tortillas required more force. Chewiness was correlated to <b>rollability</b> (r = 0. 99, P ≤ 0. 05). The RS percentage was correlated to <b>rollability</b> (r = 0. 99), and cutting force (r = 0. 99). The floury and blend tortillas had a firm texture that would be expected when eating a tortilla with a filling. The high-amylose tortillas fell apart with very little force, and would not roll around a filling, making them unsuitable for this use. Although the high-amylose tortillas had increased dietary fiber in the form of RS, it had very poor textural attributes. The blend tortillas retained enough of the textural properties of the floury tortilla to make it a suitable product. Understanding the impact of RS on the gelatinization characteristics of starches and the texture of food products will help the food industry understand its impact on food processing, especially processing involving heating...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Magnesium alloys show low {{deformability}} at {{low temperature}} because of hcp structure and inactiveness of basal slip. Manufacturing of thin sheet is difficult in industries. Some approaches, such as small-draft multi-pass rolling, intermediate annealing, isothermal rolling and high-speed rolling were proposed {{to overcome the}} deformability. However, small edge cracks are still formed on the sheet. In this study, rolling speed of 1000 m/min was employed to warm-roll AZ 31 B magnesium alloy {{in a single pass}} at different temperatures. The edge cracks formed after the rolling were classified into three main groups: minor, regular and zigzag edge cracks. ‘Crack contact length ’ are introduced to explain the morphology of edge cracks. The results show that the critical reduction for crack initiation depends on the pre-heating temperature. The spacing between edge cracks increases linearly with the crack contact length regardless of roll diameter, speed and reduction. It is suggested that this approach is useful to understand the formation mechanism of edge cracks and to evaluate the <b>rollability</b> of magnesium alloys...|$|E

In this regard, developing new materials with high- k characteristics at low cost is of great scientific and technological importance in the area of both academia and industry. Here, we introduce a simple solution-based technique to fabricate high- k metal oxide dielectric system (ATO) at low-temperature, which can be used effectively to realize low-voltage operation of OTFTs. On the other hand, it is well known that the properties of the dielectric/semiconductor and electrode/semiconductor interfaces are crucial in controlling the electrical properties of OTFTs.

The superwetting properties of solid surface has crucial applications in our daily {{life as well as}} engineering fields, such as self-cleaning, digital microfluidic devices, biomedical engineering, and silicon hybrid solar cells [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. There are two ways to obtain the superwetting properties of existing artificial surface.

Recently, numerous approaches have been explored to fabricate solid surface with superwetting property, such as self-assembly, lithography selective etching of solid substrates and chemical etching [12, 13, 14], etc. However, there are still some existing limitations in the fabrication of large-scale superwetting surface and practical applications because of low stability and durability, costly and complicated fabrication procedures. Furthermore, most of the superhydrophobic surfaces have pretty high CA, chemical or geometrical heterogeneous surface which usually exhibits contact angle hysteresis and droplets adhere to the surface, so that they are greatly restricted to the applications [15].|$|E

The primary objective is to verify the theoretically predicted extinction boundary, using oxygen percentage and flow velocity as coordinates. Of particular interest are the low-speed quenching limits and the existence of the critical oxygen flammability limit. Detailed flame spread characteristics, including flame spread rate, flame size, and flame structure are sought. Since the predicted flame behavior depends on the inclusion of flame and surface radiation, the measured results will also be used to assess the importance of radiative heat transfer by direct comparison to a comprehensive numerical model. The solid fuel used in this experiment is a custom-made fabric consisting of a 1 : 1 blend of cotton and fiberglass. This choice was made following an extensive search to yield a material with favorable properties, namely, <b>rollability,</b> non-cracking behavior during combustion, strength after combustion, and flammability in a range of oxygen limits permissible within the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) on the International Space Station. At the present time, an effort is being made to characterize both the radiative properties of the fuel and the flame spreading behavior in normal gravity at reduced pressure. These will provide a basis for comparison with the microgravity results as well as aid in bracketing the anticipated flammability boundary for the flight experiment.

Desirable characteristics {{for good}} quality tortilla include large diameter, softness, flexibility and long shelf stability. Important components influencing quality are wheat flour properties, {{which have not}} been optimized for tortilla industrial production thus far. The studies presented here investigated the effects of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) on tortilla quality. Two approaches were employed: biotypes derived from Centurk and OK 102 cultivars expressing defined HMW-GS compositions and transgenic wheat lines over-expressing HMW-GS 10. Analysis of protein expression and protein extractability were conducted to characterize wheat flours and suitable assays carried out to determine the respective dough properties. Tortillas were prepared by the hot-press method and quality parameters were measured at days 0, 2, 4, 7 and 14. Tortillas derived from Centurk biotypes possessing HMW-GS 2 *, 7 + 9, 2 + 12, 2 *, 7 + 8, 5 + 10 and 2 *, 7 + 9, 5 + 10 exhibited superior texture profiles over time, but smaller diameters than the biotype 2 *, 7 + 8, 2 + 12. Tortillas containing HMW-GS 7 + 9 and 2 + 12 revealed a texture profile similar to tortillas containing 5 + 10. Tortillas from the OK biotype 2 *, 7 + 9, 3 + 12 exhibited larger diameter and texture profiles equivalent to tortillas containing 5 + 10. Therefore, this biotype showed the best quality within this cultivar. Tortillas derived from transgenic flours over-expressing HMW-GS 10 exhibited an undesirable rough appearance with decreased diameter, greater thickness, lower <b>rollability</b> scores, lower stretchability and greater rupture force over time. Over-expression of HMW-GS 10 in a wheat line containing 1 RS-translocation did not promote the same deleterious effects in tortilla quality {{as it did in}} transgenic lines without 1 RS translocation...|$|E

This software has proven to be a great tool for integrated research of the impact of an underslung load on the parameters of a helicopter controllability, and allows carrying out an analysis of the impact of an underslung load on the parameters of controllability under its dyna- mic behavior. The performed computational experiments have shown that the helicopter maximum angular acceleration with an underslung load significantly rises, as compared to a helicopter without cargo or a helicopter carrying the same load inside the cargo compartment. The data obtained during computational experiments corresponds to the results of analytical computations, and is in line with the literature based on the experience of helicopter flight operations. The cause of the variation in the helicopter controllability parameters during transportation of an underslung load has been found, that is - the underslung load considerably increases the main rotor thrust, due to sling load, as compared to a helicopter without cargo. When compared to a helicopter carrying a load inside the cargo compartment, this increased efficiency is mainly attributed to the fact that a helicopter with an underslung load has lower rotational inertia, since the load is not inside the cargo compartment, but outside. The obtained results can be used to improve flight manuals and flight personnel training publications, which could play a significant part in ensuring flight safety and security, and increasing the operational efficiency of helicopters with external slung load systems...|$|E
40|$|A cost-effective, {{faster and}} {{efficient}} way of screening wheat samples suitable for tortilla production is needed. Hence, we developed prediction models for tortilla quality (diameter, specific volume, {{color and texture}} parameters) using grain, flour and dough properties of 16 wheat flours. The prediction models were developed using stepwise multiple regression. Dough rheological tests had higher correlations with tortilla quality than grain and flour chemical tests. Dough resistance to extension was correlated best with tortilla quality, particularly tortilla diameter (r= - 0. 87, P< 0. 01). Gluten index was significantly correlated with tortilla diameter (r = - 0. 67, P less than 0. 01) and specific volume (r = - 0. 73, P less than 0. 01). Tortilla diameter was the parameter best predicted. An r 2 of 0. 87 was obtained when mix-time and dough resistance to extension were entered into the model. This model was validated using another sample set, and an r^ 2 of 0. 91 was obtained. Refined and whole wheat flours, dough and tortillas were compared using five wheat samples. Refined flour doughs were more extensible and softer than whole wheat flour doughs. Whole wheat flour tortillas were larger, thinner and less opaque than refined flour tortillas. Refined wheat flour had much smaller particle size and less fiber than whole wheat flour. These are the major factors {{that contributed to the}} observed differences. In general, refined wheat tortillas were more shelf-stable than whole wheat tortillas. However, whole wheat tortillas from strong flours had excellent shelf-stability which must be considered when whole wheat tortillas are processed.. Different objective rheological techniques were used to characterize the texture of refined and whole flour tortillas during storage. Differences in texture between 0, 1 and 4 day-old tortillas were detected by rupture distance from one and two-dimension extensibility techniques. In general, the deformation modulus was not a good parameter to differentiate tortilla texture at the beginning of storage. It detected textural changes of 8 and 14 day-old tortillas.

QPM had similar test weight, density and kernel size with 45 % more lysine and 38 % more tryptophan compared to FGM. HPC {{had the largest}} kernel with density and test weight similar to FGM. During alkaline cooking, HPC absorbed water faster than QPM and FGM. White QPM required shorter cooking time and had less dry matter losses compared to FGM. All corn varieties had excellent pericarp removal at the optimum cooking time. Tortillas from QPM had better pliability and <b>rollability</b> after storage compared to FGM and HPC. HPC tortillas had lower rupture force after storage. The use of QPM for tortilla production may reduce energy and sewage cost, and could produce a tortilla with longer shelf stability with improved nutritional value. Decorticated and non-decorticated QPM, FGM and HPC grain were processed into corn meal and direct expanded snacks. A modified short scale dry milling system was used to produce the corn meal. QPM produced more coarse meal with greater fat content compared to FGM. Decortication decreased fiber content and coarse meal yield. Non-decorticated meal had greater protein, fiber and fat content compared to decorticated meal. The modified short flow milling system provides reduced lost fractions for extrusion into nutritionally improved products. Extrusion was performed in a low cost friction extruder. QPM extruded faster than FGM and HPC. FGM required greater specific mechanical energy than QPM. Extrudates from FGM were the most expanded followed by QPM and HPC.

40|$|Antistaling {{properties}} of enzymes (xylanase, bacterial maltogenic and conventional a-amylases), CMC and {{vital wheat gluten}} on corn tortillas were evaluated during storage for up to 21 days. Effect of storage time (0 - 21 days) and temperature (- 40, - 20, 3, 10 and 21 oC) on tortilla staling was evaluated with or without additives. Addition of 275 - 1650 AU of ICS maltogenic amylase effectively reduced amylopectin retrogradation without reducing tortilla yields, but did not improve tortilla flexibility. The combination of 825 AU of ICS amylase (to interfere with intra-granular amylopectin re-crystallization) and 0. 25 % CMC (to create a more flexible inter-granular matrix than retrograded amylose) produced less stiff, equally flexible and less chewy tortillas than 0. 5 % CMC. Corn tortilla staling followed the basic laws that control aging in starch-based semi-crystalline systems such as starch gels, bread and other baked products. Amylopectin re-crystallization was {{the driving force behind}} the staling of corn tortillas. Increasing levels of re-crystallized amylopectin measured by DSC correlated significantly with increased tortilla stiffness and reduction in tortilla <b>rollability,</b> pliability and rupture distance during storage. Re-crystallization of amylopectin in fresh tortillas was not detected. It increased rapidly during the first 24 hr reaching a plateau after 7 days storage. The level of amylopectin re-crystallization on tortillas showed a bell-shaped trend along the evaluated storage temperature range with a maximum around 7 oC. However, a negative linear relationship of peak pasting viscosity with storage temperature of tortilla extracts without additives after 21 days suggests other compounds besides amylopectin affect tortilla staling. Thus, interfering with amylopectin re-crystallization is not the only way to retard staling. Further research is required to optimize the addition of maltogenic amylases in continuous processing lines that use fresh masa instead of nixtamalized corn flour, to determine how these amylases interfere with amylopectin re-crystallization and to elucidate if amylose retrogradation continues during storage and plays a role in tortilla staling...|$|E
40|$|Having {{the lowest}} density among all {{structural}} metals, magnesium has opened new horizons for developing commercial alloys with successful {{use in a}} wide variety of applications [1 - 2]. However, the plasticity of Mg is restricted at low temperatures because: (a) only a small number of deformation mechanisms can be activated [3 - 4], and (b) a preferred crystallographic orientation (texture) develops in wrought alloys, especially in flat-rolled sheets [5 - 7]. Therefore, manufacturing processes such as rolling and stamping should be performed at elevated temperatures [1, 8]. These barriers to the manufacturing process increase the price of magnesium wrought alloy products and limits the use of Mg to castings [9 - 10]. As a result, many studies have been conducted to improve formability by investigating the effect of manufacturing process. Therefore the current sheet production techniques, based on DC casting and hot rolling, are basically slow because the demand is easily met [11]. Twin roll casting followed by hot rolling appears to be processing route which can fulfil high volumes and reduced costs. The present authors succeeded in single-pass large draught rolling of various magnesium alloy sheets at low temperature (< 473 K) by high speed rolling [12]. Based on the data available in those works [13 -  17], the sheet obtained by high-speed rolling exhibited a fine-grained microstructure (mean grain size of 2 - 3 μm), with good mechanical properties. For these advantages, the high speed rolling is a promising process to produce high-quality rolled magnesium alloy sheets at a low cost. For these advantages, the HSR is a promising process to produce high-quality rolled magnesium alloy sheets at a low cost. The goal of this research is thus to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the much higher <b>rollability</b> and the grain refinement after HSR. To do that, in this study, different rolling speeds from 15 to 1000 m/min were employed to twin rolled cast AZ 31 B magnesium alloy and different reductions...|$|E

Masas from white, brown and black sorghums were adjusted to pH levels of 7 (neutral), 9 (control) and 11 (alkaline) and processed into tortillas and tortilla chips. Citric acid and lime solutions were used to adjust the pH. Textural changes of tortillas stored for 2 and 24 hr were evaluated objectively using the extensibility test and subjectively using bending, pliability and <b>rollability</b> tests. Texture of chips was also evaluated using the rupture test. Pasting properties, color, and level of phenolic compounds of tortillas and tortilla chips were determined. Sensory evaluation was conducted with selected tortilla chips. White tortillas required more force to extend and were more extensible than brown and black tortillas at every pH. Alkaline pH tortillas for each sorghum type retained fresh characteristics longer during storage compared to tortillas at neutral and control pH. Methanol extracted flours prepared from black tortillas and tortilla chips developed lower pasting viscosities than brown and white tortilla residues. The shorter peak time of alkaline pH tortilla and chip residues might be related to repulsion between negatively charged starch molecules. A darker pericarp color and higher pH produced darker tortillas and tortilla chips. The colors of tortillas and chips at pH 7, 9 and 11 were reddish brown, brown and dark brown for brown sorghum; dark brown, reddish black and black for black sorghum; pinkish tan, yellowish tan and dark yellow for white sorghum. Phenols were mostly retained during tortilla and tortilla chip processing. Brown and black sorghums have a potential use in the production of dark color tortillas and chips since consumers are relating dark color to healthy food...|$|E

However, inclusion of fiber diminishes {{the final product}} quality and consumer acceptability of cereal products. The overall objective of this project was to produce fiber-enriched, pre-cooked wheat flours using extrusion processing {{in order to enhance}} their nutritional value, while maintaining functional and sensory properties in baked products such as cookies and tortillas. In {{the first part of this}} study, extrusion processing was utilized to pre-cook wheat flours substituted with 0, 10, 20 and 30 % wheat bran in order to enhance their rheological properties and functionality with regards to cookies and tortillas. Two extrusion conditions, low-temperature-low-shear (LTLS) and high-temperature-high-shear (HTHS) were studied for pre-cooking the flours. Results showed that for all flours, as % bran increased, RVA peak viscosity (PV), and mixograph peak time (PTM) and peak height (PH) decreased. At all bran levels, PV and PH were significantly lower for pre-cooked flours as compared to uncooked. As the percent bran increased, the quality of cookies (weight and spread factor) and tortillas (specific volume, <b>rollability</b> and extensibility) deteriorated for both uncooked and pre-cooked wheat flours. In the second part of this study, effect of extrusion pre-cooking on the dietary fiber profile of wheat flour substituted with 0, 10, 20 and 30 % wheat bran was evaluated. Pre-cooking by extrusion significantly increased SDF in flours (by 22 to 59 %), although in most cases it also led to a significant decrease in TDF. Cookies and tortillas, produced from uncooked and pre-cooked flours with 0 and 20 % substituted bran, were evaluated for consumer acceptability using a 9 -point hedonic scale. Organoleptic properties of cookies from uncooked flour did not change significantly with increase in bran substitution from 0 to 20 %. However, consumer ratings for tortillas did decrease slightly but significantly with increase in bran level. To summarize, pre-cooking of the flours using extrusion did not improve the sensory properties of cookies and tortillas, although the products were still found acceptable by consumers and also contained higher soluble fiber...|$|E

Tortillas were prepared by adding 1 % wheat cellulose with two lengths, 1 % commercial hydrocolloid blend (xanthan, guar and food starch), 0. 5 % carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), 8 % zein and 8 % zein + 0. 5 % CMC to nixtamalized corn flour (NCF). Tortilla texture was evaluated using subjective and objective techniques. Subjective parameters included bending, <b>rollability</b> and pliability. Objective methods using a texture analyzer included 1 -D extensibility stress relaxation with a 7 -element Maxwell model. Tortillas were ground, extracted with methanol, dried and Udy milled before the residues were analyzed for pasting properties, water solubility and water absorption. Subjective and objective tests were able to identify changes in tortilla texture during aging for all treatments. CMC (0. 5 %) had the greatest positive effect on texture of tortillas, followed by cellulose fiber with the longest length (250 []m). The cellulose fiber (30 []m) and the commercial hydrocolloid blend did not affect tortilla properties. The effects of CMC were apparent throughout storage. The cellulose fiber showed significant improvement initially (0. 33 - 9 h), but not during 24 - 72 h of storage. Zein was difficult to incorporate into the masa. Different dispersion methods were attempted with no significant effect. Formation of a hard film, after alcohol evaporation, on tortilla surface may affect tortilla texture. Tortillas containing zein broke quicker (less structure) and had lower pasting viscosities (increased retrogradation) compared to the control. The addition of 0. 5 % CMC and zein slightly improved the texture of tortillas; they were almost comparable to control tortillas. Most polymers added to NCF did not improve tortilla texture. Only CMC yielded improved texture during storage...|$|E

Two {{different}} wheat flours were prepared into tortillas using laboratory-scale, commercial equipment with fixed processing parameters. Dough and tortilla properties were evaluated using subjective and objective methods. Tortillas were stored in plastic bags at 22 ????C for evaluation. The effects of nine enzymes (amyloglucosidase 1, amyloglucosidase 2, bacterial 1, bacterial 2, fungal, maltogenic 1, maltogenic 2, malted barley and xylanase) on quality of wheat flour tortillas were evaluated. Dough absorption was adjusted to attain uniform dough for tortillas. Enzyme addition to tortilla flour did not significantly affect tortilla weight, moisture and pH. Bacterial 2 amylase extended shelf stability while maltogenic 1 and xylanase exhibited smaller improvements in shelf stability and other tortilla properties. Addition of 0. 05 activity unit bacterial 2 amylase improved tortilla diameter and improved tortilla shelf life from 12 to 28 days. Maltogenic 1 at 280 ppm improved tortilla diameter, opacity and shelf life. Addition of 100 ppm of xylanase effectively improved tortilla diameter and shelf life. Bacterial 1 amylase at 60 ppm improved tortilla diameter but did not improve shelf stability. Amyloglucosidase 2, maltogenic 2 and malted barley amylase did not improve tortilla quality at any of the evaluated levels. Amyloglucosidase 1 and fungal amylase reduced overall tortilla quality at all the evaluated levels. Bread-making quality of wheat flour is correlated with the damaged starch present in the flour. Damage was induced by grinding the samples for 0, 1, 4 and 8 hr {{to determine the effects of}} starch damage on tortilla quality. Processing increased starch damage of control tortilla flour from 5. 4 % to 12. 6 %. Damage starch increased dough water absorption, toughness and press rating and reduced diameter and opacity of tortillas.

Increased intake of dietary fiber, omega- 3 fatty acids, and antioxidants may help prevent or manage these diseases. Tortillas {{are now part of}} the American diet, and are excellent carriers of higher amounts of fiber and other nutraceutical ingredients. This study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} incorporating nutraceutical ingredients (flaxseed, sorghum bran, oat flour, buckwheat flour) on whole white wheat tortilla quality. Tortillas were prepared using a hot-press, gas-fired oven and were evaluated for physical properties, texture and shelf-stability. Objective and subjective tests demonstrated that whole white wheat and multigrain tortilla doughs were harder, rougher and less extensible than refined flour tortilla dough. Multigrain flour tortillas were thinner, larger and more translucent than the refined flour treatment. Incorporation of whole multigrain flours affected color of the product, giving darker tortillas. Tortilla flexibility decreased over time. After 16 days of storage <b>rollability</b> scores of tortillas decreased drastically. The most pronounced decrease in tortilla flexibility was observed for 5 % sorghum bran, 10 % buckwheat, and for the treatment prepared with of 5 % flax, 5 % sorghum, 5 % oat, 5 % buckwheat. The flexibility loss was higher for whole white wheat and multigrain tortillas than for the refined one which was confirmed with objective and subjective tests. To extend shelf stability of whole multigrain tortillas various amounts of commercial hydrocolloid and ?-amylase were added to the formulation. Tortillas with 75 ppm, 100 ppm of ?-amylase, 1 % and 1. 5 % of gum retained their flexibility during 16 days of storage. Consumer acceptability of the whole multigrain tortillas (5 % flaxseed, 5 % sorghum bran, 5 % oat, 5 % buckwheat) was compared with commercial multigrain tortillas and whole white wheat flour tortillas using an untrained sensory panel. The multigrain tortillas were liked by the panel as much as the other samples. Prepared multigrain tortillas had improved nutritional value. Each multigrain treatment contained at least 3 g of dietary fiber, 0. 29 g of ?- linolenic fatty acid, lignans and antioxidants. It makes possible to claim them as a ?good source of dietary fiber? and ?an excellent source of ?-linolenic fatty acid?.

In this study, 1 - 2. 5 % NbC added Galfenol rolled sheet was used because NbC particles enhance the <b>rollability</b> of and abnormal grain growth (AGG) in polycrystalline Galfenol rolled sheet. Driving forces, due to grain boundary energy, surface energy, deformation energy and magnetic fields are generally considered to explain grain growth phenomena. In this dissertation, the effect on grain boundary energy for influencing AGG was studied for the case of high temperature annealing at 1200 °C. Both Coincident Site Lattice (CSL) and High Energy Grain Boundary (HEGB) models were investigated as possible mechanisms to explain the contribution of grain boundary energy to Goss-textured AGG. Results support the HEGB model as a suitable model for the observed development of Goss-textured AGG in Galfenol rolled sheet. Next, the effect of deformation energy on AGG was studied by using tension annealing and strain annealing methods in the temperature range of 900 °C to 1100 °C. This study was built on results from studies of grain boundary energy on other alloys. For the tension annealing investigation, Galfenol rolled sheet was simultaneously subjected to tensile loading during high temperature annealing. No AGG was observed from the tension annealing method. For the strain-annealing investigation, homogeneously recrystallized Galfenol rolled sheet with a taper was subjected to tensile loading under different strain rates and post-strain high temperature anneal conditions to investigate the resultant grain growth phenomena. Different grain growth modes, including Cube- and Goss-textured AGG, were observed in this study. Assessment {{of the extent of}} AGG resulting from these was conducted using Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD) patterns that were captured and analyzed using Orientation Imaging Microscope (OIM) software to obtain Inverse Pole Figures (IPF) and Orientation Distribution Function (ODF). Additionally, Ga loss, which lowers the magnetostrictive properties, under different conditions was investigated by Electron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA). No significant Ga loss was observed during the annealing process at 1000 °C, however, about 2 % Ga loss was observed during the annealing process at 1100 °C and 1200 °C in the areas with a high density of grain boundaries...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Flours from 12 wheat cultivars, grown in two locations (Uvalde and McGregor) over two years (1999 and 2000), were processed into tortillas. The environment and cultivars affected protein content and quality, which significantly affected tortilla quality. Cultivars grown in McGregor had low protein and poor mixogram characteristics (3. 8 MU and short mixing time), which produced thick, small and translucent tortillas. Some of the flours within the range of 3. 0 - 4. 5 MU and 10. 5 - 13. 0 % produced good tortillas. Flour with higher mixing resistance and low protein content or lower mixing resistance and higher protein content produced good quality tortillas. This suggests that some combination of flour mixing resistance and protein content may be useful to predict tortilla quality. Tortillas were stored at - 60, - 12, 0, 4, 22, and 35 ?C to evaluate staling. Subjective <b>rollability</b> and two-dimensional extensibility tests measured changes in texture of tortillas. Frozen tortillas stored for over 25 days retained their fresh attributes. However tortillas staled more when stored at 22 ?C than at 0, 4, or 35 ?C. Tortillas stored at 0, 4, 22, and 35 ?C had increasing force, work and modulus of deformation values during storage. More staling occurred at 4 ?C for first 3 days and, then at 22 ?C after 7 days. Tortillas stored at 22 ?C and 35 ?C had less than two weeks shelf stability while tortillas stored under refrigeration had more than three weeks shelf stability. Tortillas began to stale at the optimum staling temperature of bread but much of the firming of tortillas occurred at a similar temperature to the staling of cakes (22 ?C). The higher temperature of optimum staling for tortillas suggests that more firming could be due to protein changes than from starch retrogradation. Measured flour properties did not directly correspond to improved tortilla qualities of larger diameter, increased opacity and longer shelf stability. Some combination of flour protein content and mixing resistance, however, may be useful to predict tortilla quality...|$|E

Selected wheat protein fractions can separately modify dough resistance and extensibility. This may yield tortillas with increased diameter, opacity and stability. Tortillas were prepared using laboratory-scale, commercial equipment with fixed processing parameters. Dough and tortilla properties were evaluated using a texture analyzer and subjective methods. Tortillas were stored in plastic bags at 22 ?C for 28 days. The effects of ten wheat proteins (donated by Midwest Grain Products, Inc; at 3. 0 baker's percent) on processing and quality of flour tortillas were determined. Mixograph parameters varied but were not significantly affected by added wheat proteins. Dough absorption, mixing time, and cysteine level were adjusted slightly to attain uniform dough for tortillas. Wheat protein fractions added to pastry, tortilla and bread flours did not significantly affect tortilla weight, moisture, pH, opacity or specific volume, except for glutenin and vital wheat gluten, which decreased opacity in pastry flour tortillas. Protein fractions yielding improved tortilla properties and stability were FP 600, FP 6000, FP 5000 and Gliadin in pastry and tortilla flour. Addition levels of selected wheat proteins were evaluated in weak protein tortilla formulas. Addition of 1 % FP 5000 or PF 6000 improved tortilla stability. Calcium peroxide was added to the formula to better incorporate added protein fractions in a reduced-oxidized dough system. A combination of 7. 5 ppm calcium peroxide with 1 % Gliadin resulted in tortillas with improved shelf stability. Bread-making quality of wheat flour is correlated with the insoluble polymeric protein fraction. The insoluble polymeric proteins in flour correlated with smaller diameter and improved <b>rollability</b> score at 12 days of storage for tortillas made from different wheat flours. The insoluble proteins correlated only with tortilla stability for tortillas prepared with added wheat protein fractions to flours with different protein strengths.

A low fat tortilla was developed by optimizing lipids, emulsifiers and fat replacers. Hot-press wheat tortillas were prepared from wheat flour with 11. 6 % protein. Lard, pie shortening (PS), all-purpose shortening (AP), liquid frying oil (LF) and salad oil (SO) were used at levels of 1, 4, 7, 10 and 15 %. Tortillas were made with 0. 5 and 1. 0 % glyceryl monostearate (GM), succinylated monoglycerides (SMG), ethoxylated monoglycerides (EMG) and diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides (DATEM). Finally, tortillas were made with commercially available, carbohydrate-based fat replacers: potato maltodextrins, tapioca maltodextrins, pregelatinized rice flour, modified rice solids, and pea starch. Dough water absorption, mixing time, mixability and machinability were determined. Tortillas were evaluated for puffing during baking, weight, moisture, diameter, <b>rollability,</b> penetrability and organoleptic properties. As lipid levels decreased, mixing time decreased, water absorption increased and mixability decreased. As lipid levels decreased tortilla puffing and diameter decreased, weights were similar and moisture increased. Rollabilities of tortillas containing 4 - 15 % lipid were better than those containing 1 % lipid. Rollabilities of tortillas containing lard, PS and SO were better than those containing AP and LF. Textures of tortillas containing > 7 % lard were significantly worse that those with 4 % lard were ranked higher than those containing 1 % lard. Tortillas containing SMG had better dough mixability and larger diameter tortillas during hot pressing than tortillas containing EMG or DATEM. Rollabilities of tortillas containing 1. 0 % SMG, GM and DATEM were better than the control after ten days of storage. Rollabilities of tortillas containing 0. 5 and 1. 0 % SMG were similar.

Texture of tortillas was evaluated subjectively using <b>rollability</b> and crinkle methods and objectively using bending and extensibility methods on a texture analyzer. Absorption, starch solubility at 95 'C, and starch pasting properties were evaluated. Alcohol, grinding, centrifugation, and an oven at 50 'C were utilized to quickly stabilize and dehydrate gelatinized starch during processing. Analyses of starch-related properties were conducted on the dried flour. The hot-press method caused tortillas to puff extensively during baking which imparted an attractive appearance and excellent texture, however, hot-pressing did not affect the staling rate. Hot-pressing is an alternative method to produce corn tortillas. More changes in starch functionality related to texture changes of tortillas occurred during the initial 24 -h period than {{during the rest of the}} storage time. RVA pasting viscosities below 65 'C were substantial in fresh tortillas and decreased during the initial 24 h of storage; those between 75 - 90 'C increased significantly during the initial 24 h of storage. Smaller changes in viscosities were observed upon further storage. Solubility of amylose and amylopectin decreased during the initial 24 h of storage. Starch and texture changes during storage of acidic and alkaline commercial tortillas containing carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC) were monitored. CMC improved stability of tortillas stored for 15 days, and interacted better with starch during processing and storage of alkaline tortillas. Amylose or amylopectin were substituted for 20 % of nixtamalized corn flour. Partially retrograded amylose stabilized the initial tortilla structure and induced rapid changes in starch pasting properties after baking. Amylopectin retrograded slowly and imparted softness and extensibility when present in a gelatinized state. Extensive amylopectin retrogradation occurred after 24 h storage, yielding a brittle, less flexible tortilla. Reheating renewed desirable textural properties lost during staling at 22 'C for 15 days. Corn tortillas underwent staling during storage, corresponding to rapid changes in starch functionality, amylose solubility and amylopectin crystalinity. Texture in fresh tortillas corresponds to increased RVA viscosity at low temperatures.

40|$|Flexible {{monolithic}} ultra-portable {{ground penetrating radar}} using {{inkjet printing}} technology A Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) performs nondestructive detection of buried objects, or subsurface imaging by transmitting electromagnetic waves and detecting and analyzing the reflections. The main challenge of GPR is the reduction in detection range due to the severe signal attenuation that is caused by subsurface conductivity that becomes more severe at high frequencies. In order to increase the detection range, GPR uses lower frequencies than non-GPR radars and thus requires larger antennas that may limit system portability. Most GPR systems use impulse radars however the FMCW (frequency modulated continuous wave) radar can provide some advantages such as frequency versatility, reduced system maintenance and improved range resolution. Frequencies below 1 GHz were initially uncommon in short-range FMCW radars but are now finding their way back in systems such as ultra-wideband (UWB) ground penetrating radars for mine detection and {{as well as other}} applications. When measurements are performed on vehicles, large antenna fixtures are not a problem. Portability, however, can become an issue in geophysical studies or emergency work in which one may need to transport the system through rugged, unexplored and/or hazardous locations without vehicle access and perform measurements. Inaccessible environments may require climbing up and down, squeezing through, jumping over, crawling under, maneuvering through or swimming through obstacles (mountains, caves, lakes, rocky areas). In addition to transportation, rapid system setup is critical in difficult conditions such as freezing temperatures or extreme heat where exposure time is costly and limits measurement time. One solution to enhance the portability and deployability of a GPR system for wide area rugged measurements is to realize a complete system on a continuous substrate that is rollable around a reasonably small radius and storable in a scroll or poster-like fashion for easy backpack transportation. Electronics that can flex and bend have already used in military applications and for outdoor sporting gear. Currently, there are a few types of technology available to realize flexible electronics that have been a major topic of research, each with different levels of integration. Inkjet printing technology offers a cost effective, versatile and efficient method for realizing flexible devices. In this work a classical FMCW radar system is designed and an effort is made, for the first time, to apply inkjet printing technology to a radar system. The system is referred to as a portable monolithic radar system in which all actives, passives and antenna are meant to share the same continuous rollable substrate. In doing this, a medium level of integration is used to investigate limits of system complexity, resolution and ultra miniaturization for tight <b>rollability.</b> Various design challenges of a large system are overcome that will hopefully give insight to new designs as the integration level using inkjet printing technology increases...|$|E
40|$|Wraps are an unleavened, flat, and {{circular}} {{bread that}} is 1 - 2 mm thick. White bread flour made from wheat is extensively {{used in the}} manufacture of wraps in South Africa. Low grade flour is a by product of milling and {{can be used as a}} cheaper alternative to white bread flour. Its high phenolic content and associated antioxidant activity may offer potential health benefits such as reduction in the risk of lifestyle diseases related to oxidative stress. In addition, its relatively higher dietary fibre content offers potential anti-diabetic properties unlike white bread flour which has a high glycaemic index. However the weak gluten quality of low grade flour can compromise the dough rheological properties and quality of wraps. Xanthan gum can improve weak gluten quality by mimicking the viscoelastic properties of gluten. Xanthan is also known to improve the quality of baked products. The objective of this research was to produce a health beneficial wrap of good quality using low grade flour with added xanthan gum. Low grade wheat flour was used to manufacture wraps. Xanthan gum (0. 5 % and 0. 25 % (w/w)) was added to low grade flour. The dough rheological properties of the flour, the quality, and shelf life of the wraps were determined. White bread flour was used as a reference sample in this research. Water absorption, and Farinograph mixing stability of low grade flour increased with increasing concentration of xanthan gum. Low grade flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum had similar mixing stability to white bread flour. Mixing tolerance index (MTI) of low grade flour decreased with addition of xanthan gum, and the MTI of low grade flour with 0. 25 % xanthan gum was similar to white bread flour. At 50 % flour hydration (constant hydration), as well as at flour hydration according to Farinograph water absorption (adapted hydration), the dough tenacity of low grade flour was increased by the addition of xanthan gum, while the dough extensibility was decreased by xanthan gum addition. At adapted hydration, the dough extensibility of low grade flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum was similar to the dough extensibility of white bread flour. The P/L ratio expresses the relationship between the dough strength, and the dough extensibility. The P/L ratio of low grade flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum had a value of 0. 5 which makes it suitable for bread making. The pasting viscosities of low grade flour increased with the addition of xanthan gum. Wraps made from low grade flour did not puff during baking. Xanthan gum addition however did improve puffing in wraps made from low grade flour. The puffing of wraps made from low grade flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum was similar to the puffing of wraps made from white bread flour. Wraps could only be stored for three days before mould growth was visible. Wraps made from low grade flour with 0. 25 % xanthan gum had the lowest <b>rollability</b> score, a lower modulus and higher extensibility over time. On day 0, all wraps exhibited a B-type crystallinity as determined by X-Ray diffractometer. The % crystallinity of all wraps increased over storage time. Percent crystallinity increased from 5 % to 11. 6 % for wraps made from white bread flour; for wraps made from low grade flour it increased from 7 % to 11 %; for wraps made from low grade flour; with added xanthan gum (0. 25 %) it increased from 7 % to 12 %, and for wraps made from low grade flour with added xanthan gum (0. 5 %) it increased from 5. 1 % to 13 %. A thermogram peak on the DSC was only visible on day 3 of storage between 95 and 102 ◦C for the wrap made from white bread flour. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of wraps made from low grade flour were higher than those of wraps made from white bread flour. Simulated gastro-intestinal digests of the wraps had higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity than the acidified methanol extract. The relatively higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of wraps made from low grade flour indicates that they may offer potential health benefits. Low grade flour however produces a poor quality wrap, with a reduced shelf life. Addition of xanthan gum to low grade flour improves dough rheology, as well as the quality of wraps. This is possibly due to the interactions which occur between xanthan gum and wheat proteins, as well as between xanthan gum with the amylose of the starch molecule. The wraps with 0. 25 % xanthan gum produce wraps with a better quality. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2014. lk 2014 Food ScienceMScUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|In Micro-rolling process, {{metal sheet}} is {{imprinted}} with micron level textures by feeding into {{the gap between}} one smooth roll and one textured roll. To enhance the <b>rollability</b> of thin metal sheet and dimensional accuracy, high density current is sent through workpiece to soften the material by increasing temperature. This manufacturing process is called by Electrically-Assisted Micro-rolling (EAμR). EAμR, as a high efficiency and environment protection manufacturing process, {{can be used for}} production of key components in Micro-electromechanical Systems and bio-engineering. To control the quality of product, it is essential to monitor the pressure distribution in workpiece-roll interface during micro-rolling process. Comparing with process monitoring in conventional rolling process, sensing method in micro-rolling process monitoring not only demands to maintain surface integrity of roll surface, but also is limited by narrow space for sensors installation. Thus, a new sensing method based on embedded capacitance sensor array has been developed and prototyped for real-time monitoring in Electrically-Assisted Micro-rolling process. In the optimal structural design of embedded sensor, Finite element modeling is investigated to study the influence of sensor parameters and electrical current on sensor. To improve the spatial resolution of embedded sensor array mounted in a limited space, a new pressure reconstruction algorithm is presented to retrieve continuous spatial distribution of rolling pressure from a limited number of measured points. In this context, three research tasks has been identified and examined {{during the course of this}} thesis: 1) Design of a new embedded sensing method and its modeling The new sensing method monitors micro-rolling process by an embedded capacitance sensor array integrated into smooth roll of micro-rolling mill. The new embedded sensor using limited sensor installation space provides a new method to measure contact pressure between roller and workpiece without damaging the roller surface. It consists of a cylindrical plastic rod as the physical carrier of sensor array, a group of metal foils attached on cylindrical surface as receiving layer of capacitance array, and a thin plastic film as dielectric material of capacitance. The excitation layer of capacitance sensor is attached on inner surface of mounting hole in smooth roll. When the sensing rod is mounted into mounting hole, a series of capacitance is formed along axial direction of roll. In the design of mechatronics system, multi-physics modeling, based on finite element method, is developed not only to study the relationship between sensor parameters and the sensitivity of sensor, but to understand the thermal and electro-magnetic effect of electrical current passing through workpiece quantitatively as well. 2) Development of prototyping micro-rolling sensing system Micro-rolling sensing system is developed for real-time monitoring of Electrical-Assisted Micro-Rolling process. The whole system consists of one or two embedded capacitance sensor arrays, smooth roll, and capacitance measurement electronic device. Two 1 x 12 pixel capacitance sensor arrays are inserted into sensor mounting holes in smooth roll. Two pieces of printed circuit boards (PCB) are mounted at both ends of smooth roll for capacitance measurement and wireless data transmission. The electronic device measures capacitance in sensing rod using capacitance-to-digital converter chip for stable and precise capacitance measurement. To decrease the noise caused by signal cable, ZigBee communication module is used to transmit the digital signal from circuit to remote PC. In PC receiver, software interface has been developed for real-time monitoring and data analysis. A calibration process on micro-rolling mill has been investigated to calibrate the relationship between capacitance increase of each electrode and rolling pressure. 3) Reconstruction of Spatio-Temporal Distribution of rolling pressure Since roll misalignment and unevenness of workpiece can cause unexpected pressure distribution, monitoring of spatio-temporal distribution of rolling pressure at workpiece-roll interface is critical to control the accuracy of channel dimension. During micro-rolling process, micro-rolling sensing system embedded in rolling mill can transfer a set of capacitance data. To convert capacitance increases of one dimensional sensor array to pressure distribution along axial direction of roll, Back-proejection method is investigated to solve the inverse problem. The pressure-to-capacitance transducer is calculated by numerical method. To increase the spatial resolution of pressure-to-capacitance conversion, interpolation method is investigated to estimate the continuous deformation of dielectric layer under rolling pressure from limited number of sensing points. In this context, three interpolation methods (Kriging, Thin Plated Spline, and Bezier interpolation) and four back-projection methods (Tikhonov regularization, iterative Tikhonov regularization, Landweber iteration, and Offline Iteration Online Reconstruction) are discussed. The best combination of interpolation and back-projection method is determined by numerical experiment. In addition to these focal areas, prototyped micro-rolling sensing system has been equipped to micro-rolling mill for pressure monitoring during EAμR. Pressure reconstruction algorithm has also been tested by outputs of micro-rolling sensing system. The experimental verification was utilized for reliability evaluation of embedded sensing method and pressure reconstruction algorithm...|$|E
