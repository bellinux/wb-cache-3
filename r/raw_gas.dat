25|$|Part of {{a series}} on Canada's {{petroleum}} industry, this entry focuses on the second of these two functions of gas processing - removing impurities from the gas stream - rather than recovering natural gas liquids, described elsewhere. Of course, most large plants perform both functions, and plants have no other ultimate purpose than to quickly, safely and profitably turn <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> into products to be safely shipped (mostly by pipeline) to market. The discussion covers gas processing as an engineering feat, critical developments in exploration and development and the fundamentals of the marketplace.|$|E
25|$|Forgetting the <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E
2500|$|There are a {{great many}} ways in which to {{configure}} the various unit processes used in the processing of <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas.</b> The block flow diagram below is a generalized, typical configuration for the processing of <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> from non-associated gas wells. It shows how <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> is processed into sales gas pipelined to the end user markets. [...] It also shows how processing of the <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> yields these byproducts: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> {{feedstock}} from a {{gas well}} {{or a group}} of wells is cooled to lower the gas temperature to below its hydrocarbon dew point at the feedstock pressure. This condenses {{a large part of the}} gas condensate hydrocarbons. The feedstock mixture of gas, liquid condensate and water is then routed to a high pressure separator vessel where the water and the <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> are separated and removed. The <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> from the high pressure separator is sent to the main gas compressor.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the quality}} of <b>raw</b> {{produced}} natural <b>gas</b> is also often characterized by the term GPM meaning the gallons of liquifiable hydrocarbons contained in [...] of the <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas.</b> In such cases, when the liquifiable hydrocarbons in the <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> are characterized as being ethane or higher molecular weight components, they are reported as GPM (C2+). Similarly, when characterized as being propane or higher molecular weight components, they are reported as GPM (C3+).|$|R
2500|$|In 2007 {{she spoke}} out {{in support of}} the Shell to Sea {{campaign}} against the proposed construction of a high-pressure <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline through Rossport by Shell, saying the Shell contract was invalid and needed [...] "to be renegotiated on behalf of the people of Ireland". She is also a director at Dublin Community Television.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> is then pipelined to a gas {{processing}} plant where the initial purification {{is usually the}} removal of acid gases (hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide). There are many processes that are available for that purpose {{as shown in the}} flow diagram, but amine treating is the process that was historically used. However, due to a range of performance and environmental constraints of the amine process, a newer technology based on the use of polymeric membranes to separate the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from the natural gas stream has gained increasing acceptance. [...] Membranes are attractive since no reagents are consumed.|$|E
2500|$|The liquids {{extraction}} plant {{closed in}} 1927 and reopened in 1933 {{after the company}} revamped the facility. The new plant used [...] "lean oil" [...] absorption, a process that forced <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> into contact with lean oil in chains of steel bubble caps. Improvement of the absorption medium and contact between the gas and the oil made for substantially higher rates of liquids recovery. The new plant was so successful that other companies built two similar plants in Turner Valley, and Royalite built a second plant to handle its production from {{the south end of}} the field. Gas and Oil Products Ltd. built a similar plant at Hartell in 1934 and British American (BA) opened one at Longview in 1936.|$|E

50|$|Natural-gas {{condensate}} is a low-density {{mixture of}} hydrocarbon liquids that are present as gaseous {{components in the}} <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> produced from many natural gas fields. Some gas species within the <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> will condense to a liquid state if the temperature is reduced to below the hydrocarbon dew point temperature at a set pressure.|$|R

50|$|There are {{numerous}} impurities that freeze at low temperatures {{that are found}} in <b>raw</b> <b>gas.</b> Since these would block the cryogenic section of the plant, the gas must be purified {{before it can be}} liquified.|$|E
50|$|Through {{these early}} years, the company {{operated}} its own coal mines and consumed 50 tons daily producing <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> to fire its melting pots. It also used natural gas produced {{from its own}} wells. The abundant supply of natural resources {{had been one of}} the main reasons for locating this factory in Ohio.|$|E
50|$|There {{is local}} {{resistance}} to Shell's decision to process <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> from the Corrib gas field at an onshore terminal. In 2005, five local men were jailed for {{contempt of court}} after refusing to follow an Irish court order. Subsequent protests against the project led to the Shell to Sea and related campaigns.|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} <b>raw</b> fire product <b>gas</b> {{analysis}} for true toxic gas measurements {{in the room}} of origin in the fire is explained. All current methods of fire toxic gas analysis involve some dilution of the fire products prior to analysis and {{this is likely to}} promote oxidation of the toxics and re-equilibration of CO. The hot gas handling requirements for <b>raw</b> fire product <b>gas</b> analysis are outlined. Heated Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysers are available capable of analysing <b>raw</b> hot samples <b>gases,</b> these were developed for automotive direct exhaust gas analysis but are shown to be ideally suited to fire toxicity analysis in <b>raw</b> fire <b>gases...</b>|$|R
25|$|Natural {{gas from}} gas wells and from {{condensate}} wells, {{in which there}} is little or no crude oil, is called non-associated gas. Gas wells typically produce only <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas,</b> while condensate wells produce <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> along with other low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Those that are liquid at ambient conditions (i.e., pentane and heavier) are called natural gas condensate (sometimes also called natural gasoline or simply condensate).|$|R
25|$|<b>Raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> comes {{primarily}} from {{any one of}} three types of wells: crude oil wells, gas wells, and condensate wells.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, a new {{security}} firm, Integrated Risk Management Services, {{was brought in}} to defend Shell's preparations for the landfall of the <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline. In August, S2S began training for marine protests in anticipation of the arrival of the Allseas pipe-laying ship Solitaire, the biggest {{of its kind in the}} world with a collection of small boats.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), which {{comprises}} around 15% of the <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> stream, will {{be stripped}} out then injected into formations 2 kilometers below the island. This forms the world's largest {{carbon capture and storage}} project, with 3.4 to 4 million tonnes of [...] {{planned to be}} stored each year.

50|$|Before a raw {{natural gas}} {{containing}} hydrogen sulfide and/or carbon dioxide can be used, the <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> {{must be treated}} to reduce impurities to acceptable levels and this is commonly done with an amine gas treating process. The removed H2S is most often subsequently converted to by-product elemental sulfur in a Claus process or alternatively converted to valuable sulfuric acid in a WSA Process unit.|$|E
50|$|Compressed Biogas may be {{used for}} Internal Combustion Engines after {{purification}} of the <b>raw</b> <b>gas.</b> The removal of H2O, H2S and particles can be seen as standard producing a gas which has the same quality as Compressed Natural Gas. The use of biogas is particularly interesting for climates where the waste heat of a biogas powered power plant cannot be used during the summer.|$|E
50|$|Propane is {{produced}} as {{a by-product of}} two other processes, natural gas processing and petroleum refining. The processing of natural gas involves removal of butane, propane, and large amounts of ethane from the <b>raw</b> <b>gas,</b> {{in order to prevent}} condensation of these volatiles in natural gas pipelines. Additionally, oil refineries produce some propane as a by-product of cracking petroleum into gasoline or heating oil.|$|E
5000|$|The gas {{condensate}} {{from the high}} pressure separator flows through a throttling control valve to a low pressure separator. The reduction in pressure across the control valve causes the condensate to undergo a partial vaporization referred to as flash vaporization. The <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> from the low pressure separator is sent to a [...] "booster" [...] compressor which raises the gas pressure and sends it through a cooler, {{and then to the}} main gas compressor. The main gas compressor raises the pressure of the gases from the high and low pressure separators to whatever pressure is required for the pipeline transportation of the <b>gas</b> to the <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> processing plant. The main gas compressor discharge pressure will depend upon the distance to the <b>raw</b> natural <b>gas</b> processing plant and may require a multi-stage compressor.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} adding CO to the raw-gases for {{methanol}} synthesis from the hydrogenation {{of carbon dioxide}} over the CuO/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalysts has been reported, Small amount of CO in the <b>raw</b> <b>gases</b> can increase the selectivity and yield of methanol by 38 % and 25 %, respectively, TPD-MS and TPSR-MS results indicate that CO can suppress the adsorption of CO 2 on the sites, which bring about the reverse water-gas shift reaction and hence promote the selectivity of methanol...|$|R
5000|$|Raw {{natural gas}} {{consists}} primarily of methane (CH4), the shortest and lightest hydrocarbon molecule, {{as well as}} various amounts of heavier hydrocarbon gases such as ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), normal butane (n-C4H10), isobutane (i-C4H10), pentanes and even higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. The <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> also contains various amounts of acid gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and mercaptans such as methanethiol (CH3SH) and ethanethiol (C2H5SH).|$|E
50|$|Natural Gas wells {{was once}} part of the area to the west, in the former Tilbury East township, with the <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> going to a Union Gas pumping station at Port Alma. With the capping of the wells and the closing of pumping station in the 1980s, Union Gas sold the {{facilities}} and the main pumping building is no longer there in Port Alma, but some maintenance sheds and an office building still remain there.|$|E
50|$|Ethane: In addition, Iran has a {{competitive}} advantage in the gas consuming stream of the petrochemical industry due to its vast reserves of natural gas. In the Assalouyeh region near the South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf, Iran is able to convert <b>raw</b> <b>gas</b> to ethane (a raw material for the petrochemical industry) and then to petrochemical products at a gross margin of up to 88%. In 2009, Iran consumed domestically over 95% of the natural gas that was produced.|$|E
