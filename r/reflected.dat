The <b>reflected</b> lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The <b>reflected</b> lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E

50|$|The {{issue of}} the {{photoswitch}} that the <b>reflecting</b> efficiency of the <b>reflecting</b> member may be drastically lowered due to dewing and clouding of the <b>reflecting</b> surface due {{to a change in}} the ambient temperature. The dew on the <b>reflecting</b> surface causes a random reflection. In order to avoid the clouding of the <b>reflecting</b> surface, it has been proposed to apply silicon or the like {{to the surface of the}} <b>reflecting</b> member. This countermeasure, however, cannot prevent condensing of dew onto the lower part of the <b>reflecting</b> surface. Thus, there are many problems in the prior art.|$|R
5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was <b>reflected</b> in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that <b>reflected</b> the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E

5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the <b>reflected</b> wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally <b>reflected</b> and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus <b>reflected)</b> wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is <b>reflected</b> from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is <b>reflected.</b> The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is <b>reflected,</b> making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
