40|$|Currently, the FCC assigns <b>radio</b> <b>licences</b> {{after making}} a {{determination}} of the public interest. Conflicting licence applications are resolved through comparative hearings.

The analysis suggests that increasing the spectrum allocation will create more assignments than will be demanded by MDS. Rough calculations suggest that auctions offer a more efficient selection mechanism. Lotteries with resale of the license are better than hearings, but {{not as good as}} auctions.
