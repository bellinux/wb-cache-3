40|$|Edge {{detection}} {{in images}} {{has been a}} fundamental problem in computer vision from its early days. Edge detection on surfaces, on the other hand, has received much less attention. The most common edges on surfaces are ridges and valleys, used for processing range images in computer vision, {{as well as for}} non-photorealistic rendering in computer graphics. We propose a new type of edges on surfaces, termed <b>relief</b> <b>edges.</b> Intuitively, the surface can be considered as an unknown smooth manifold, on top of which a local height image is placed. <b>Relief</b> <b>edges</b> are the edges of this local image. We show how to compute these edges from the local differential geometric surface properties, by fitting a local edge model to the surface. We also show how the underlying manifold and the local images can be roughly approximated and exploited in the edge detection process. Last but not least, we demonstrate the application of <b>relief</b> <b>edges</b> to artifact illustration in archaeology. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends to}} {{surfaces}} the multi-scale approach of edge detection on images. The common practice for detecting curves on surfaces requires {{the user to}} first select {{the scale of the}} features, apply an appropriate smoothing, and detect the edges on the smoothed surface. This approach suffers from two drawbacks. First, it relies on a hidden assumption that all the features on the surface are of the same scale. Second, manual user intervention is required. In this paper, we propose a general framework for automatically detecting the optimal scale for each point on the surface. We smooth the surface at each point according to this optimal scale and run the curve detection algorithm on the resulting surface. Our multi-scale algorithm solves the two disadvantages of the single-scale approach mentioned above. We demonstrate how to realize our approach on two commonly-used special cases: ridges & valleys and <b>relief</b> <b>edges.</b> In each case, the optimal scale is found in accordance with the mathematical definition of the curve.

50|$|The multi-spiral {{bracelet}} with zoomorphic (snake?) ends, {{found in}} 1859 with a treasure from Feldioara, is different {{because of the}} widened muzzle of the protome terminals. In {{the middle of the}} snake head the Dacian silversmith engraved braids, by the use of puncheons, consisting of two rows of small, oblique, divergent traits. The snake's eyes are depicted as two circles. A strong profile separates the head from a relatively rectangular plaque with rounded corners, and slightly arched edges representing the mane of the Dacian dragon. The profiled <b>relief</b> <b>edges</b> of the bracelet's rectangular plaque and its decoration with two rows of divergent slashes are suggestive of the mane of a dragon or wolf.|$|R

The lights through the PDMS relief was phase-shifted against the lights passing through the air at the PDMS/air boundaries, attenuating the dose to shadow the photoresist (PR) located {{at the edge of}} the PDMS reliefs. For our preliminary experiment, this method was innovatively combined with interference lithography (hologram lithography).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on finding the optimal tools for {{modelling}} of the overland flow and verification of its reliability and limits in an extreme relief of the Bohemian Switzerland. This paper focuses on the Open Source tools for modelling of the overland flow implemented in the geographic information system GRASS GIS.

40|$|Tumour cell {{invasion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} critical steps in malignant progression. It includes a broad spectrum of mechanisms, including both individual and collective cell migration, which enables them to spread towards adjacent tissue, and form new metastases. Understanding the mechanisms of cell spreading, and invasion, is crucial for effective anticancer therapy. Two modes of individual migration of tumour cells have been established in a three-dimensional environment. Mesenchymally migrating cells use proteases to cleave collagen bundles, and thus overcome the ECM barriers. Recently described protease-independent amoeboid mode of invasion has been discovered in studies of cancer cells with protease inhibitors. During my PhD study, I have focused on determining the molecular mechanisms involved in amoeboid invasion of tumour cells. We have examined invasive abilities in non-metastatic K 2 and highly metastatic A 3 rat sarcoma cell lines. We have shown that even though highly metastatic A 3 rat sarcoma cells are of mesenchymal origin, they have upregulated Rho/ROCK signalling pathway.

40|$|The {{availability}} of a bathymetric database that covers about 80 % of the Icelandic shelf {{has made it possible}} to produce a geomorphological map of the glacial landforms.

Trough <b>edges,</b> bulging trough mouths, moraines, eskers, melt water channels, streamlined bedrock and streamlined drift, mostly hitherto unmapped, distributed all around the island have been identified. Moraines are found on the shelf, within troughs and inside fjords. Streamlined landforms are always confined to the bottom of troughs. Troughs appear to have been cut by ice streams draining an ice sheet that likely covered the entire shelf. At the shelf break, most troughs terminate with contours that bulge in a convex-outwards fashion.

The Jurassic beds (clay and sandy clay) are capped by glacial till or boulder clay, left from glaciations that occurred in the British Isles during the Anglian and Wolstonian stages respectively1. In former times, this till made the land too difficult for the early farmers to use as arable land and too wet and tenacious to be ideal for pasture. It is natural therefore, to find that much of it has been left as woodland, which was in itself, a valuable resource for fuel and constructional material.

30|$|Typically, relief {{generation}} from {{an input}} 3 D scene {{is limited to}} either bas-relief or high-relief modeling. This paper presents a novel unified scheme for synthesizing reliefs guided by the geometric texture richness of 3 D scenes; it can generate both basand high-reliefs. The type of relief and compression coefficient can be specified according to the user’s artistic needs. We use an energy minimization function to obtain the surface reliefs, which contains a geometry preservation term and an edge constraint term. An <b>edge</b> <b>relief</b> measure determined by geometric texture richness and edge z-depth is utilized to achieve a balance between these two terms. During relief generation, the geometry preservation term keeps local surface detail in the original scenes, while the edge constraint term maintains regions of the original models with rich geometric texture. Elsewhere, in highreliefs, the edge constraint term also preserves depth discontinuities in the higher parts of the original scenes. The energy function can be discretized to obtain a sparse linear system. The reliefs are obtained by solving it by an iterative process. Finally, we apply non-linear compression to the relief to meet the user’s artistic needs. Experimental results show the method’s effectiveness for generating both bas- and high-reliefs for complex 3 D scenes in a unified manner.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{article focuses}} on flexskins {{comprising}} of a cellular substructure and pre-tensioned facesheet for shear morphing applications. The unit cell of the substructure is a strand with some strain-relief feature, and it supports a segment of pretensioned facesheet. The function of the strain-relief feature {{is to reduce the}} peak strains in the strand and consequently the actuation work during shear morphing. Central hexagonal cells, elliptical cells, and half elliptical cells in the strand provided the sought strain <b>relief</b> at the <b>edges</b> of the strand, but the sharp corners and the proximity of these central features to those from adjacent strands during shear morphing led to a tendency for the facesheet to wrinkle. Alleviating wrinkling by increasing facesheet pretension increases the morphing actuation work requirement. Facesheet wrinkling can also be reduced by increasing strand separation, but this too requires higher prestrain in the facesheet to limit out-of-plane displacement under aerodynamic loads. The best solution was found to be the use of Gaussian- or Cosine-shaped curved strands which reduced morphing actuation force requirements by around 30 % compared to straight strands used on a previous demonstration aircraft, and the peak strain levels to about 1. 2 % (down from 3. 3 % for straight strands), while avoiding facesheet wrinkling.
