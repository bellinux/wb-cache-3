40|$|Topological <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> {{objects in}} space are of great {{importance}} in many disciplines. Due {{to the lack of}} local topological information between components, i. e. faces, in the model of topological <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> complex regions, recently, localized topological relationships have been defined for complex regions based on the <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> simple regions with holes. However, unlike for simple regions, topological <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> simple region with holes are not widely implemented. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to derive topological <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> simple regions with holes based on well known topological <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> the simple regions as their components. This will allow localized topological predicates between complex regions to be implemented using only topological <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> simple regions. Furthermore, localized topological predicates between complex regions can be used to implement topological <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> complex regions. Therefore, this work allows topological <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> complex regions to be implemented using only topological <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> simple regions. ...|$|R
40|$|Everyday {{inductive}} reasoning {{draws on}} {{many kinds of}} knowledge, including knowledge about causal <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> properties and knowledge about similarity <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> objects. Previous accounts of inductive reasoning generally focus on just one kind of knowledge: models of causal reasoning often focus on <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> properties, and models of similarity-based reasoning often focus on similarity <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> objects. We present a model of inductive reasoning that incorporates both kinds of knowledge. Two experiments show that our model makes accurate quantitative predictions in a task where subjects combine knowledge about causal <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> properties with knowledge about similarity between biological species. ...|$|R
30|$|To summarize, first, {{regardless}} of the <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> KIC and organizational effectiveness or the <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> KIC and organizational commitment, no significant effects were found. The <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> KPC and organizational effectiveness and the <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> KPC and organizational commitment have significant effects. Meanwhile, KPC, through organizational commitment, positively influences organizational effectiveness. Our findings confirm that KMC is not solely sufficient to drive organizational effectiveness and that organizations also need to encourage organizational commitment.|$|R

5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> strings and five-dimensional branes {{remained}} conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> strings and branes was reduced to a <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E

40|$|The {{associative}} {{argument for}} political obligation {{has taken an}} important place in the debate on political obligation.

40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, China’s {{economic}} power has experienced great changes and {{has brought about}} {{a profound impact on}} the world economy. This led us to ask a question: do changes in China’s economic power shift the geo-economic <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> China and its neighboring countries? To answer this question, we researched the evolution of geo-economic <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Using the Euclidean distance method, we explored the changes in these geo-economic <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> China and ASEAN countries from 1980 to 2014. Our findings resulted in five conclusions: (1) Over time, geo-economic <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> China and ASEAN countries remained relatively stable. (2) Geographically, the main geo-economic <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> China and continental ASEAN countries were complementary, while the main geo-economic <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> China and island ASEAN countries were competitive. (3) Geopolitics and geo-culture were attributed to the changes in geo-economic relationships. (4) The evolution of geo-economic relationships was characterized by path dependence. (5) Geo-economic <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> China and ASEAN countries could be classified into four types: game type, with high cooperation and competition; complementary type, with high cooperation and low competition; fight type, with low cooperation and high competition; and loose type, with low cooperation and competition. Our findings contribute to improving the understanding of geo-economic relationships...|$|R

No <b>relationship</b> was observed <b>between</b> the “guilty” dimension of emotional competence and task performance. Non-hierarchical cluster analysis was selected and K-means cluster analysis was performed to determine the emotional competence levels of participant banking professionals. The seven pre-specified emotional competences were classified by using Ward’s method. Cluster analysis revealed that the emotional competences of the participants were clustered in two groups as high and low. Regression analyses revealed insignificant <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> the emotional competence and task performance of employees, but positive significant <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> emotional competence and contextual performance. Significant differences were also observed in the emotional competence levels and task-contextual performances of employees.
