50|$|Considering {{the animal}} source of {{pharmaceutical}} heparin, {{the numbers of}} potential impurities are relatively large compared with a wholly synthetic therapeutic agent. The range of possible biological contaminants includes viruses, bacterial endotoxins, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents, lipids, proteins, and DNA. During the preparation of pharmaceutical-grade heparin from animal tissues, impurities such as solvents, heavy metals, and extraneous cations can be introduced. However, the methods employed to minimize the occurrence and to identify and/or eliminate these contaminants are well established and listed in guidelines and pharmacopoeias. The major challenge {{in the analysis of}} heparin impurities is the detection and identification of structurally <b>related</b> <b>impurities.</b> The most prevalent impurity in heparin is dermatan sulfate (DS), also known as chondroitin sulfate B. The building-block of DS is a disaccharide composed of 1,3-linked N-acetyl galactosamine (GalN) and a uronic acid residue, connected via 1,4 linkages to form the polymer. DS is composed of three possible uronic acid (GlcA, IdoA or IdoA2S) and four possible hexosamine (GalNAc, Gal- NAc4S, GalNAc6S, or GalNAc4S6S) building-blocks. The presence of iduronic acid in DS distinguishes it from chrondroitin sulfate A and C and likens it to heparin and HS. DS has a lower negative charge density overall compared to heparin. A common natural contaminant, DSis present at levels of 1-7% in heparin API, but has no proven biological activity that influences the anticoagulation effect of heparin.|$|E

40|$|A {{selective}} method {{based on}} HPTLC using reflectance scanning densitometry {{was developed and}} validated for the simultaneous separation and quantification of Fluconazole in formulations and its structurally <b>related</b> <b>impurities.</b> The chromatographic separation was accomplished on TLC aluminum plates precoated with silica gel 60 F 254 as the stationary phase using a saturated mixture of butanol: water: acetic acid (8 : 2 : 1 v/v). For visualisation, the plate was dipped in to a modified anisaldehyde reagent and heated at 120 °C for 30 minutes in a drying oven. Densitometric quantification was performed at 254 nm by reflectance scanning. Fluconazole appeared as a brown spot (Rf 0. 67 ± 0. 02) and resolved well from the two impurities. The standard fluconazole curve is linear (r => 0. 9995) over a concentration range of 100 - 800 ng/spot. Recovery from tablet formulation was statistically equal to 100 %. The limits of detection and quantification were 91. 39 and 304. 66 ng/spot respectively. The precision of the method with respect to concentration is acceptable with a relative standard deviation of 0. 73 %. The proposed method is specific for fluconazole {{in the presence of}} its structurally <b>related</b> <b>impurities</b> and proved to be a valuable complimentary method for impurity profiling and quality control.

40|$|A stability-indicating RP-UPLC {{method was}} {{developed}} for the quantification of <b>related</b> <b>impurities</b> of amlodipine basylate (AB) and Benazepril hydrochloride (BH) in solid pharmaceutical dosages form. The chromatographic separation employs a C 18 column using a gradient elution, being solvent-A (1. 36 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate dissolved in one liter of water, adjusted to pH 3. 0 with orthophosphoric acid) and solvent-B (acetonitrile) delivered at a flow rate of 0. 3 mL min- 1. The analytes were detected and quantified at 217 nm and 240 nm using photo diode-array detector. The method was validated demonstrating to be accurate and precise within the corresponding linear range of all components. The stability of the method was investigated under different stress conditions including hydrolytic, oxidative, exposed to photolytic, humidity and thermal as recommended by ICH guidelines. Relevant degradation was found under hydrolytic and oxidative conditions. Robustness against small modification in mobile phase pH, column oven temperature, flow rate and percentage of the mobile phase composition was ascertained. Lower limit of quantification and detection was also determined. The peak purity indices (purity angle < purity threshold) obtained {{with the aid of}} PDA detector and satisfactory resolution between <b>related</b> <b>impurities</b> established the specificity of the determination...|$|E

Four <b>related</b> substances (<b>Impurities)</b> {{were observed}} during laboratory process development and pilot scale preparation of Eletriptan. They are desbromo eletriptan, dimer impurity of eletriptan, dehydro analogue and novel intermediate of eletriptan.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{reliable}} and widely used methods to calculate electronic structure of strongly correlated models is the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) developed over two decades ago. It is a non-perturbative algorithm which, in its simplest version, takes into account strong local interactions by mapping the original lattice model on to a single impurity model. This model has to be solved using some many-body technique. Several methods have been used, the most reliable and promising {{of which is the}} Density Matrix Renormalization technique. In this paper, we present an optimized implementation of this method based on using the star geometry and correction-vector algorithms to solve the <b>related</b> <b>impurity</b> Hamiltonian and obtain dynamical properties on the real frequency axis. We show results for the half-filled and doped one-band Hubbard models on a square lattice. Received: 31 March 2017, Accepted: 6 June 2017; Edited by: D. Domínguez; Reviewed by: A.
