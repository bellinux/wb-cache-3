5000|$|The pear-shaped pad is a {{triangular}} area of keratinized tissue that forms from the scarring after {{removal of the}} most distal molar. The <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> is a non-keratinized area of tissue and is a posterior continuation/extension of the pear-shaped pad. It {{is also known as}} piriformis papilla. It is a small inclination going up and posteriorly and is bordered by muscles {{in the back of the}} jaw. The denture base should only extend one-half to two-thirds up the <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} a {{mucocele}} is {{found on the}} palate, <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad,</b> and posterior buccal mucosa. Known as a [...] "superficial mucocele", this type presents as single or multiple vesicles and bursts into an ulcer. Despite healing after a few days, superficial mucoceles recur often in the same location. Other causes of bumps inside lips are, aphthous ulcer, Lipoma, benign tumors of salivary glands, submucous abscess and haemangiomas.|$|E
50|$|Oral Fordyce {{granules}} {{appear as}} rice-like granules, white or yellow-white in color. They are painless papules (small bumps), about 1-3 mm in greatest dimension. The most common site is {{along the line}} between the vermilion border and the oral mucosa of the upper lip, or on the buccal mucosa (inside the cheeks) in the commissural region, often bilaterally. They may also occur on the mandibular <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> and tonsillar areas, but any oral surface may be involved. There is no surrounding mucosal change. Some patients will have hundreds of granules while most have only one or two.|$|E
40|$|An Australian {{family in}} which two members were {{affected}} by focal palmoplantar and gingival mucosal hyperkeratosis syndrome is reported. The propositus and his daughter had symptoms which suggested that esophageal lesions might be present. In view {{of the association of}} tylosis with esophageal carcinoma in other families, both patients were investigated by barium swallow or endoscopy. No esophageal lesions were found. Previously unreported paranuclear bodies were described in the keratinocytes of the spinous and granular cell layers of the finely papillated gingival epithelium of the propositus. Similar paranuclear bodies, although rare, were identified in cytologic smears from the four members of the family examined, two of whom had slight whitening of the mucosa of the <b>retromolar</b> <b>pads</b> only. By electron microscopy and histochemistry, these bodies were characterized as condensations of tonofilaments and not heteromorphic keratohyalin...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} of patients from failing dentition to complete-arch implant rehabilitation often {{means that the}} patient is rendered edentulous and has to wear a removable complete denture for a time. Many patients find this objectionable. A staged treatment approach provides a fixed interim prosthesis for use throughout the rehabilitation process, allowing patient comfort and prosthodontic control. This clinical report describes a staged approach protocol with {{a new type of}} interim prosthesis. The prosthesis is supported by hopeless teeth and the soft tissues of the maxillary tuberosities and mandibular <b>retromolar</b> <b>pads</b> for the complete-arch implant rehabilitation of a patient with failing dentition. This protocol allows for a fixed interim prosthesis with combined tooth and mucosa or implant support during the entire rehabilitation process, thus avoiding the use of complete dentures. The implants and prostheses were functioning successfully after 3 years of clinical service. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Background: The occlusal plane {{position}} {{is considered to}} be the primary link between esthetic and function. Aim: To evaluate the relationship between extraoral and intraoral soft tissue landmarks with the occlusal plane in dentulous subjects on both sides and to check for any variations. Study and Design: An in vivo study and 100 subjects with all healthy permanent teeth in normal arch and alignment were selected from Modern Dental College and Research Centre, Indore. Materials and Methods: Three custom made instruments (occlusal plane analyzer, buccinator groove relator, and level analyzer) were indigenously designed to check parallelism of the interpupillary line, ala-tragus line, buccinator groove with the occlusal plane. Relation of <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> with the occlusal plane was checked with the metallic scale. Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test. Results: In 20. 0 % subjects, the occlusal plane was parallel to the interpupillary line. The posterior reference point for ala-tragus line was middle point on right side in 56 % and left side in 58 % subjects. Intraorally, right side 59 % and left side 62 % subjects had the occlusal plane at the same level as that of buccinator groove. Right side 48 % and left side 45 % subjects showed occlusal plane at the middle one-third of <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad.</b> Conclusion: The occlusal plane is not generally parallel to interpupillary line. The occlusal plane is parallel to the ala-tragus line with middle point of tragus as posterior reference point on right and left sides. Both sides, the buccinator groove and the middle one-third <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> are coinciding with occlusal plane level...|$|E
40|$|Sclerosing polycystic adenosis {{is a rare}} {{pathological}} lesion that affects salivary glands. The majority of cases involve the parotid and its occurrence in minor glands is exceedingly rare. Here, we report the first case of this lesion in the <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> area and discuss its histological features and immunohistochemical reactivity with αSMA and Ki 67 markers.

40|$|In nongrowing {{patients}} with mild skeletal Class-III malocclusion, premolar extraction or molar distalization {{in the lower}} arch can be done {{as a part of}} camouflage treatment. Temporary anchorage devices are widely used for this purpose because they do not produce undesirable reciprocal effects and do not depend on the patient′s cooperation. However, most reported cases in this regard have used interradicular miniscrews in the mandibular arch and these have a risk of failure as they can loosen due to collision with adjacent roots. This article showcases mandibular molar distalization utilizing miniscrews, inserted at the retromolar area to correct a Class-III problem. A 24 -year-old girl with a mild skeletal Class-III malocclusion and dental Class-III molar and canine relationship bilaterally was referred for orthodontic treatment. The treatment plan included distalization of the lower molars bilaterally followed by full fixed appliance therapy, after third molar extractions. For the lower molar distalization, the miniscrews were inserted at the <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad.</b> At the end of 21 months, a Class-I molar and canine relationship, normal overjet and overbite were obtained. The average amount of distalization of mandibular first molar was 3. 2 mm at the crown level. In conclusion, placing miniscrews at the <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> area for lower molar distalization was found to be a simple and effective method for correcting anterior cross bite and mandibular anterior crowding or protrusion, without the need for patient compliance...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of a new collagen matrix (Mucograft®; Geistlich Pharma AG, Wol- husen, Switzerland) in the soft tissue reconstruction after excisional biopsy. The healing of soft tissues after bioptical excision tends to heal by secondary intention. To avoid this, the soft tissue grafts can be harvested from the palate, <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad,</b> or (if available) edentulous site. Disadvantages of harvesting the graft from the <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> and edentulous site are minimal amount of tissue availability and thinner grafts are obtained. The use of collagen matrix is also reported in literature and could represent an optimal solution in the future. Mucograft® is a pure collagen type I and III matrix of porcine origin without further cross-linking. Mucograft® consists of pure porcine collagen obtained by standardized, controlled manufacturing processes. The product made up of porcine collagen has a bilayer structure. The compact layer consists of compact collagen fibers which has cell occlusive properties and allows tis- sue adherence as a prerequisite for favourable wound healing. This layer protects against bacterial infiltration in open healing situations and has appropriate elastic properties to accommodate suturing. A second layer consists of a thick, porous collagen spongious structure. In this paper, we report about a case of surgical site healing after biopti- cal excision proliferative verrucous leukoplakia of the hard palate...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: Orientation of the occlusal plan in {{complete}} denture prostheses therapies {{plays an important}} role, leading to appropriate esthetics, stability and mastication. Purpose: The aim {{of the present study}} was to define the best soft tissue index, by which the location and inclination of the occlusal plane {{in complete}} dentures could be established. Materials and Method: This cross-sectional study consisted of 200 individuals (76 male, 124 female), with the mean age of 26. 05 (SD± 4. 39). In order to determine the relationship between maxillary occlusal plane and ala-tragus line, fox plane and J plane were used. The relationships between maxillary occlusal plane and ALT 1 (ala-superior border of tragus), ALT 2 (ala-mid-tragus) and ALT 3 (ala-inferior border of tragus) were evaluated. In the lower jaw, the occlusal plane was evaluated with the line between the upper and middle parts (ret 1) and that between the middle and lower part of <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> (ret 2). Data were analyzed by Chi-square test. Results: Evaluation of the difference between the number and percentage using Chi–square test (p ret 2). Conclusion: Superior one third of the tragus and the upper and middle one third of the <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> are suggested as a reference points for determining the posterior part of the occlusal plane in comparison with the middle and lower one third of the tragus and middle and inferior one third of the retromolarpad...|$|E
40|$|Many {{methods have}} been used to {{establish}} the occlusal plane in complete denture prosthodontics. However, no single method seems to be fully accepted. Anteriorly, esthetic considerations help define the occlusal plane, and posteriorly the tongue, <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad,</b> and Stenson′s duct are considered. Some dentists bisect the space between the residual ridges. The technique of using the ala-tragus line (Camper′s line) to establish the occlusal plane is well documented. However, definitions of the ala-tragus line cause confusion, because the exact points of reference do not agree. For example, the glossary of prosthodontic terms states that the ala-tragus line runs from the inferior border of the ala of the nose to the superior border of the tragus of the ear while Spratley′ describes it as running {{from the center of the}} ala to the center of the tragus. This article concerns us the exact relationship between the occlusal plane and ala-tragus line in dentate individuals...|$|E
40|$|Crohn?s disease (CD) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although the GI tract {{is the primary}} site of involvement, many patients, particularly in pediatric cases, first present with non-intestinal manifestations, including oral lesions. Oral manifestations of CD in children occur in around 50 - 80 % of cases, and about 30 % of CD cases in children occur first in the mouth. Recognizing such oral lesions in the pediatric population, and requesting a biopsy, may expedite the diagnosis of CD. We describe a 15 year old male who presented with oral findings of multiple aphthous ulcers and plaques of pink papules of the buccal vestibule. We highlight the initial pathology findings, including non-caseating granulomas, sialadenitis, and a notable plasmacytosis, from biopsy of the left <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> area, which triggered further testing for CD. We provide discussion of how CD was eventually diagnosed and treated and highlight {{the significance of the}} pathological findings in this case as they relate to the pathogenesis of CD...|$|E
40|$|Background: The ideal teeth {{arrangement}} {{is an important}} step for success in complete denture fabrication. There are different methods for determining the posterior denture teeth location. The {{purpose of this study was}} the comparison of posterior mandibular teeth location in the study group with Pound or Misch theory. Material and methods: An alginate mandibular impression of 80 dentate patients was taken and poured with dental stone. <b>Retromolar</b> <b>pad</b> area, mesial of canine and the lingual cusps of each posterior tooth marked on the cast and then transferred to the graded paper. Distance of each lingual cusp from the internal line of Pound triangle was measured. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 16. 0. Result: In the study group, the average distance of lingual mandibular cusp from the internal line of Pound triangle was 1. 69 mm in first premolars, 0. 94 mm in second premolars, 0. 7 mm in first molars and 0. 75 mm in second molars. Conclusion: In most cases, distance of lingual mandibular cusps was within 1 mm of Pound triangle. Results were more similar to the Pound rather than the Misch theory...|$|E
40|$|A 55 -year-old {{man had a}} polypoid-like lesion neigh-boring the uvula. The lesion was symptomless {{apart from}} slight {{discomfort}} caused by irritation. In view {{of the lack of}} signs of malignancy, surgical removal with security margins was decided. The pathologic study of the excised material showed a mass of tissue covered by squamous mucosa with a small fibrous pedicle (Fig 1). The mass of the tumor was composed of mature plasma cells in a well-vascularized stroma. The immunohisto-chemical analysis disclosed a pattern of monoclonal reactivity with l antibodies (Fig 2). A hematologic study of peripheral blood, a bone marrow analysis, a general bone survey, and a study of urine and serum proteins were performed and showed no relevant alter-ations. Considering these results, a diagnosis of primary extramedullary plasmacytoma of the palate was estab-lished. No radiation therapy was undertaken. The patient has been followed up closely with no evidence of recur-rence for 2. 5 years. Extramedullary plasmacytomas have been found in different locations within the human body. In the oral cavity alone, extramedullary plasmacytomas have been described on the palatal tonsil, gingiva, <b>retromolar</b> <b>pad,</b> lip, tongue, and palate. 1 - 3 Surgical treatment, radiother-apy, or a combination are the most suitable therapies. The clinical behavior of extramedullary plasmacytomas differs widely. 4 There are descriptions of patients who have remained disease free from 16 months up to 15 years since treatment.
