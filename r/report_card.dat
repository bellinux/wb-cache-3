40|$|The {{national}} program to report hospital-level outcomes for transplantation {{has been in}} place since 1991, yet it has not been addressed in the existing literature on hospital <b>report</b> <b>cards.</b> We study the impact of reported outcomes on demand at kidney transplant centers. Using a negative binomial regression with hospital fixed effects, we estimate the number of patients choosing each center as a function of reported outcomes. Parameters are identified by the within-hospital variation in outcomes over five successive <b>report</b> <b>cards.</b> We find some evidence that <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> influence younger and college-educated patients, but overall <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> do not affect demand. Quality <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> for providers and health plans have proliferated in recent years. While <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> supply valuable feedback to the profiled institutions, the primary objective of releasing the data publicly is to influence patient behavior (Wicks and Meyer 1999; Palmer 1995). Most of the previous literature on the impact of provider <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> has focused on the cardiac surgery profiling programs in New York and Pennsylvania. Each led to improvements in patient outcomes and the process of care (Baker et al. 2002; Bentley and Nash 1998; Chassin 2001; Hannan et al. 1994), though it is unclear whether the <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> wer...|$|R

40|$|The use of government-mandated <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> to {{diminish}} {{uncertainty about the}} quality of products and services is widespread. However, <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> will have little effect if they simply confirm consumers' prior beliefs. Moreover, documented "responses" to <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> may reflect learning about quality that would have occurred in their absence ("market-based learning"). Using panel data on Medicare HMO market shares between 1994 and 2002, we examine the relationship between enrollment and quality before and after <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> were mailed to 40 million Medicare beneficiaries in 1999 and 2000. We find evidence that consumers learn from both public <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> and market-based sources, with the latter having a larger impact during our study period. Consumers are especially sensitive to both sources of information when the variance in HMO quality is greater. The effect of <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> is driven by beneficiaries' responses to consumer satisfaction scores; other reported quality measures such as the mammography rate did not affect enrollment decisions. ...|$|R

Hospital <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> may encourage surgeons to allocate patients in more efficient ways to boost hospital scores.

This phenomenon may have been driven by the intense competition faced by hospitals and surgeons in Manhattan...|$|R
40|$|Although policymakers have {{increasingly}} turned to provider <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> {{as a tool}} to improve health care quality, existing studies provide mixed evidence on whether they influence consumer choices. We examine the effects of providing consumers with quality information in the context of fertility clinics providing Assisted Reproductive Therapies (ART). We report three main findings. First, clinics with higher birth rates had larger market shares after the adoption of <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> relative to before. Second, clinics with a disproportionate share of young, relatively easy-to-treat patients had lower market shares after adoption versus before.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{provides}} a signaling-game theoretical foundation for empirically testing {{the effects of}} quality <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> in the U. S. health care industry. It shows that, when health care providers face an identical distribution of patient illness severities, the multidimensional measures in the existing <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> render them a mechanism that reveals the providers' qualities without causing them to select patients. However, non-identical patient type distributions between providers, attributed to the referring physician, may force the high-quality provider to shun patients in order to signal himself. Despite this imperfection, the existing <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> cause the minimum provider selection compared with alternative report mechanisms. Since the <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> not only may cause providers to select patients, but also cause patients to select providers, the single difference-in-differences estimates used in previous studies are not sufficient to indicate providers' selection behavior. In an updated empirical framework, a treatment effect shall be estimated once every period. <b>Report</b> <b>cards</b> Signaling game Difference-in-differences Experts...|$|R

40|$|Background: During {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} growing a trend to develop and disseminatereport cards {{to the public in}} the {{healthcare}} industries of the UnitedStates. The purposes of this article were to understand the willingness of hospitalsin Taiwan to use <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> and to explore the factors that influencethe willingness of hospitals to use them. Methods: A postal survey study was conducted on 495 hospitals to explore factorsinfluencing the willingness of hospitals to use <b>report</b> <b>cards.</b> A multiple logisticregression was performed to identify statistically significant factors relatedto the willingness of the hospitals to use <b>report</b> <b>cards.</b> Results: In total, 52. 0 % of the sampled hospitals were "very willing" or "willing" touse <b>report</b> <b>cards.</b> The top three factors which respondents felt most influencedthe willingness of hospitals to use <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> were the provision forincorrect data, the upgrading of the image of the hospital, and the increase inadministrative costs. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that thewillingness of hospitals to use <b>report</b> <b>cards</b> was positively significantly associatedwith the score of the factor "to upgrade the image of the hospital" (OR= 8. 0; 95 % CI 1. 8 - 36. 0), and it was negatively associated with the score ofthe factor "to increase the possibility of malpractice suits" (OR = 0. 5; 95 %CI 0. 2 - 0. 9).
