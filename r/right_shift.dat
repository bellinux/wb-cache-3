5|$|Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the {{receptor}} target and, in general, {{cannot be}} removed; inactivating the receptor {{for the duration}} of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker—it permanently binds to α adrenergic receptors, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves and a <b>right</b> <b>shift</b> in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored.|$|E

50|$|Logical <b>right</b> <b>shifts</b> are {{equivalent}} to division by {{a power of}} the radix (usually 2) only for positive or unsigned numbers. Arithmetic <b>right</b> <b>shifts</b> are {{equivalent to}} logical <b>right</b> <b>shifts</b> for positive signed numbers. Arithmetic <b>right</b> <b>shifts</b> for negative numbers in N&minus;1's complement (usually two's complement) is roughly equivalent to division by a power of the radix (usually 2), where for odd numbers rounding downwards is applied (not towards 0 as usually expected).|$|R
3000|$|We {{will choose}} proper {{cells from the}} right-shifting group to move them to the right. Firstly, we need to {{calculate}} the <b>right</b> <b>shifting</b> priority for all the cells within the group. <b>Right</b> <b>shifting</b> priority has taken into account the factors of traffic and interference, and the <b>right</b> <b>shifting</b> operation will increase the interference to other cells and reduce the interference to itself. The value of Prior_R^i [...] may be positive, zero, or negative. Positive value means that the <b>right</b> <b>shifting</b> operation will make the network performance better, negative value means the opposite, and zero value indicates that the gain and loss are balanced.|$|R
25|$|The logical {{instructions}} {{consist of}} those for performing bitwise logical operations and conditional moves on the integer registers. The bitwise logical instructions perform AND, NAND, NOR, OR, XNOR, and XOR between two registers or a register and literal. The conditional move instructions test a register as a signed quadword to zero and move if the specified condition is true. The specified conditions are equality, inequality, {{less than or}} equal to, less than, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The shift instructions perform arithmetic <b>right</b> <b>shift,</b> and logical left and right shifts. The shift amount is given by a register or literal. Logical and shift instructions use the integer operate instruction formats.|$|E
