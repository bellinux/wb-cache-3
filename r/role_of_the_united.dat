5|$|The Cold War {{continues}} to influence world affairs. The post-Cold War world {{is considered to}} be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. The Cold War defined the political <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States after World WarII—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which in west Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea). The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science. These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance of the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow {{was part of a larger}} tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{why and how}} China upgraded its engagement with the European Union (EU) in the years between 2001 and 2004, with reference to pre-existing foreign policy traditions and practices in reform-era China.

First, the changing international environment, mostly with regard to <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and <b>the</b> EU, challenged the established approach to foreign policy inherited from Deng Xiaoping, China’s pre-eminent leadership figure from the late 1970 s to the mid- 1990 s. In this sense, the shift towards the EU was part of wider efforts to solve this dilemma. Second, differences in how various groups in the Chinese foreign policy establishment understood and implemented Deng’s guidelines and their respective influence in policy-making can help to grasp some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more specific developments in Chinese policy towards the EU in the early 2000 s. To supplement this main claim, the article also critically evaluates the changes less well explained by these two dynamics and proposes additional explanations...|$|R
