40|$|The {{dynamics}} of inflationary trends, {{which has been}} a macroeconomic concern in Nigeria over the last decade, is considered to be very hazardous to the aggregate economic activity of any country. In order to determine the practical effect of higher currency note introduction on the Nigerian economy, an empirical investigation on the casualty between inflation, <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> fiscal deficit and broad money supply was carried out using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model (Forecast Variance and Impulse Response) model. Time series data of 1980 to 2014 were employed and the results confirm {{that in the long run}} there is a relationship between inflation, <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> fiscal deficit and broad money supply. The Cholesky ordering (<b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> inflation, fiscal deficit and broad money supply) is used in the VAR estimates, which indicates that the shocks in <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> affect the other variables and result to inflation. It is therefore recommended that the Nigerian government should implement inflation management policies and also ensure that lower currency notes in circulation are more than higher currency notes in circulation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Currency</b> <b>denomination</b> {{recognition}} is one the active research topics at present. And this wide interest is particularly {{due to the}} various potential applications it has. Monetary transaction {{is an integral part}} of our day to day activities. However, blind people particularly suffer in monetary transactions. They are not able to effectively distinguish between various denominations and are often deceived by other people. Also, a reliable currency recognition system could be used in any sector wherever monetary transaction is of concern. Thus, there is an ardent need to design a system that is helpful in recognition of paper currency notes correctly. <b>Currency</b> <b>denomination</b> detection is a vast area of research and significant progress had been achieved over the years. This paper presents an extensive survey of research on various developments in recent years in identification of <b>currency</b> <b>denomination.</b> A number of techniques applied by various researchers are discussed briefly in order to assess the state of art...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores how {{international}} money markets reflected {{credit and}} liquidity risks during {{the global financial}} crisis. After matching the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> we investigate how the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) was synchronized with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) denominated in the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Regardless of the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination,</b> TIBOR was highly synchronized with LIBOR in tranquil periods. However, the interbank rates showed substantial deviations in turbulent periods. We find remarkable asymmetric responses in reflecting market-specific and currency-specific risks during the crisis. The regression results suggest that counter-party credit risk increased the difference across the markets, while liquidity risk caused the difference across the <b>currency</b> <b>denominations.</b> They also {{support the view that}} a shortage of US dollar as liquidity distorted the international money markets during the crisis. We find that coordinated central bank liquidity provisions were useful in reducing liquidity risk in the US dollar transactions. But their effectiveness was asymmetric across the markets. ...|$|R

First, the results indicate presence of ARCH effects in the Eurocurrency rate series. This result suggests that modelling of Eurocurrency rates requires the inclusion of time-varying risk premia. Second, our evidence reveals that short- and long-term Eurocurrency rate series have the same volatility process. the results point out that a common time-varying volatility process characterises most Eurocurrency rate series across maturities and <b>currency</b> <b>denominations.</b> Hence, the common ARCH results imply that a common time-varying variance model would be the appropriate specification of the conditional heterscedasticity for most Eurocurrency rates.

We find that the intertemporal risk-return relation differs significantly under different <b>currency</b> <b>denominations.</b> The slope coefficient is the largest at around seven when the returns are denominated in Japanese yen, moderate at about five when the returns are denominated in the Canadian or US dollars, and the smallest at around three when the returns are denominated in pound or euro and its predecessors. The ranking of the risk-return coefficients across different <b>currency</b> <b>denominations</b> remains the same when we replace country equity indices with global industry portfolios in estimating the intertemporal relations, when we change the return frequency from monthly to daily, and when we consider different specifications for the conditional covariance process.

The selection of explanatory variables for exchange rate volatility is motivated using a New Keynesian Policy model. The model predicts that not only traditional optimal currency area variables, but also variables considered by the literature on currency preferences, such as money velocity, should be relevant for explaining exchange rate volatility. The findings show that measures of inflation synchronization, money velocity synchronization, and interest rate synchronization can be useful indicators for decisions on the <b>currency</b> <b>denomination</b> of foreign debt.
