5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationship of}} insects to other animal groups <b>remains</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sivaladapids of {{southern}} and eastern Asia are best known from the Miocene, and the only adapiforms to survive past the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (~34mya). Their relationship to the other adapiforms <b>remains</b> <b>unclear.</b> They had vanished {{before the end of}} the Miocene (~7mya).|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationship between}} archaea and eukaryotes <b>remains</b> <b>unclear.</b> Aside from the similarities in cell {{structure and function}} that are discussed below, many genetic trees group the two.|$|E
50|$|The eastern {{boundary}} of Parkinson {{is marked by}} the Mount Lindesay Highway. The western boundary is aligned with the Sydney-Brisbane rail corridor. The Logan Motorway bisects the suburb. The northern half is mostly residential in nature with some parkland. The south <b>remains</b> <b>uncleared</b> with some industrial development emerging in the southeast corner. This corner of Parkinson is the southernmost part of the Brisbane City Council area.|$|R

30|$|The optimal {{treatment}} for hydrosalpinx in infertile patients <b>remains</b> still <b>unclear.</b> Essure method offers a less invvasive {{approach to this}} patients.|$|R
5|$|There are {{two forms}} of the Javan slow loris, {{distinguished}} mainly by differences in hair length. These have occasionally been recognized as separate species, N.javanicus and N.ornatus, but are currently both classified as a single species, although their exact taxonomic status <b>remains</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{researchers}} have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number still <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and {{little is known}} about them {{due to the lack of}} detailed records.|$|E
5|$|Model's true {{opinion on}} the value of the {{offensive}} <b>remains</b> <b>unclear.</b> Manstein took his recommendation at face value, while Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking. It has similarly been suggested that Model, in fact, hoped to scuttle the operation by causing it to be delayed until the Soviet forces launched their own attack.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the area is unclear, because of a dearth of evidence. According to the Bosavi people, they have always inhabited the plateau. The relationship of the various ethnic groups and languages <b>remains</b> somewhat <b>unclear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hugh of Northwold - Bishop of Ely (1229-1254), buried next to {{a shrine}} to St Etheldreda in the presbytery that he built, his tomb {{was moved to the}} north choir aisle but the {{location}} of his <b>remains</b> is <b>unclear</b> ...|$|R
5|$|RAFA domains, or {{polymorphic}} interphase karyosomal associations, {{were first}} described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function <b>remains</b> <b>unclear,</b> {{though they were}} not thought {{to be associated with}} active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).|$|E
5|$|The U.S. State of New York {{has been}} known by many {{nickname}}s, most notably as the Empire State, adopted {{as late as the}} 19thcentury. This nickname has been incorporated into the names of several state buildings and events, and is commonly believed to refer to the state's wealth and resources. However, the origin of the term <b>remains</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} {{of the old man}} <b>remains</b> <b>unclear,</b> though context implies that he may be Pattern Recognition's protagonist Cayce Pollard's father, having removed himself from the channels of normal life to focus on disrupting what he sees as criminal elements operating in the United States Government.|$|E
5000|$|Notably, in the Epic of Oghuz Khan, Ay Tanrı also is {{mentioned}} {{as the father}} of Oghuz Khan, even though that part <b>remains</b> somewhat <b>unclear.</b> It's also notable Oghuz Khan's second son was named Ayhan (Ay Khan, [...] "moon khan").|$|R
5000|$|Turkey-based Acar remains Original Gangsters' {{leader in}} Europe, but {{handed over the}} title of as the gang's [...] "president" [...] in Sweden in 2008.

50|$|The {{presence}} of ‘foamy’, ‘spheroid’, or ‘cytoid’ bodies in affected neuronal tissues {{has been noted}} but what they are and their origin <b>remains</b> somewhat <b>unclear.</b> They {{are believed to be}} swollen axonal bodies, but some evidence exists that they may be astrocytic in origin.|$|R
5|$|Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TRPM1 gene {{have been}} {{identified}} as closely associated with the LP mutation, although the mechanism by which the pattern is produced <b>remains</b> <b>unclear.</b> A commercially available DNA based test is likely to be developed in the near future, which breeders can use to determine if LP is present in horses that do not have visible Appaloosa characteristics.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis <b>remains</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|E
5|$|As an {{illiterate}} child, she {{had been}} told Bible stories by her mother. The particular variety of her early Christian belief <b>remains</b> <b>unclear,</b> but she acquired a passionate faith in God. She rejected {{the teachings of the}} New Testament that urged slaves to be obedient and found guidance in the Old Testament tales of deliverance. Tubman was devout, and when she began experiencing visions and vivid dreams, she interpreted them as revelations from God. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life.|$|E
50|$|Para Wirra Conservation Park is {{not only}} {{important}} as an educational resource, but also for its conservation and recreation value. The boundary of the conservation park is contiguous with, and forms part of a 2573 ha block of native vegetation. As only twenty six percent (26%) of the Mount Lofty Ranges <b>remains</b> <b>uncleared,</b> a block of native vegetation of this size is {{important in terms of}} its representativeness of vegetation types, for the maintenance of diversity of animal and plant species, maintenance of water quality, and as a valuable recreational resource for the community. Para Wirra Conservation Park also provides a range of recreation opportunities consistent with its conservation significance and its importance and proximity to the expanding population of the northern metropolitan area.|$|R
50|$|Edmund {{was buried}} near his {{grandfather}} Edgar at Glastonbury Abbey in Somerset, however the abbey was destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, any {{remains of a}} monument or crypt would have been plundered {{and the location of}} his <b>remains</b> is <b>unclear.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{scientific}} {{rationale behind}} the values suggested by EFSA <b>remains</b> largely <b>unclear.</b> EFSA {{points out that}} an effect size of 20 % is ‘often taken as the trigger value for further, higher-tier studies’ [3]. No further indication is made in which context these trigger values are to be used.|$|R
5|$|Conflicting reports {{initially}} made {{it impossible}} to determine who had made the first kill, which would be the first North Korean plane shot down by the United Nations forces in the war. Later research indicated Hudson had successfully shot down the first aircraft. The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories <b>remains</b> <b>unclear,</b> and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|In total, 1,650 Whites {{died in the}} Red terror, while around 10,000 Reds {{perished in}} the White terror, which {{eventually}} became political cleansing. The White victims have been recorded exactly, while in particular {{the number of the}} Red troopers executed immediately after the combats <b>remains</b> <b>unclear.</b> Together with the prison camp experiences of the Reds in summer 1918, the executions caused the deepest mental war wounds and scars among the Finns, regardless of their political allegiance. Some of those, who carried out the killings were seriously traumatized, a phenomenon that was later to become well-documented.|$|E
30|$|To sum up, the {{literature}} finds {{evidence for the}} existence of the economic channel in producing high intergenerational correlations in education. It <b>remains</b> somewhat <b>unclear</b> if short-run credit constraints or the long-run economic situation are more important determinants. It seems, however, that in developing countries, both contribute to the low educational mobility.|$|R
30|$|The {{extent to}} which this bias also impacts the {{selection}} (or article creation) process of notable people <b>remains</b> however <b>unclear.</b> Interestingly, we find that women that are depicted in Wikipedia {{tend to be more}} notable than men from a global perspective, which can be seen as an indication of gender-specific entry barriers.|$|R
30|$|An anaphylactoid purpura affects small {{capillaries}} in {{the skin}} and other organs. Although two cases of anaphylactoid purpura exacerbated by cellulitis {{have been reported in}} Japanese literatures, its prognosis <b>remains</b> still <b>unclear.</b> Because cellulitis exacerbates various cutaneous inflammations, it has been speculated that cellulitis might also exacerbate cutaneous inflammation, such as vasculitis.|$|R
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is known}} only from Lagoa Santa, where the genus no longer occurs; the nearest records are about 70km (43.5mi) to the southeast. It {{is one of}} several Lagoa Santa fossil rodents that no longer occur in the area. Although the precise {{environmental}} background of the Lagoa Santa fossil assemblage <b>remains</b> <b>unclear,</b> they may have been deposited in a period of climatic cooling that led to higher local diversity.|$|E
5|$|Later, in the Central Asian campaign, {{a second}} plot against {{his life was}} revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His {{official}} historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after. It <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he {{had fallen out of}} favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
