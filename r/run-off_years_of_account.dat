5000|$|Certified Public Accountant (CPA) is {{the title}} of {{qualified}} accountants in numerous countries in the English-speaking world. In the United States, the CPA is a license to provide accounting services directly to the public. It is awarded by each of the 50 states for practice in that state. Additionally, almost every state (49 out of 50) has passed mobility laws to allow CPAs from other states to practice in their state. State licensing requirements vary, but the minimum standard requirements include passing the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination, 150 semester units of college education, and one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> related experience.|$|R

Business returns were practically uniform and, as the sales were spread over a great number of customers, the risk of loss by bad debts was exceptionally small relative to the large annual trade. The average profit for the previous three financial years had been higher than any previous similar average and the profit for 1896/7 was the highest <b>of</b> the seven <b>years</b> under review.|$|R

With a unique perspective from both professional and academic experiences, Dr. Morris’ research explores international advertising and how visuals can be read which highlight values found in different countries. Underlying social dimensions, that may otherwise go unnoticed because of their ”naturalness,” can be exposed.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the empirical validity {{of two of}} the variables suggested in the literature as relevant to the choice between income increasing and income decreasing accounting methods. 2 ̆ 7 Political costs 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 debt covenant related costs 2 ̆ 7 are the variables examined {{on the basis of a}} sample of seventy two firms that adopted voluntary accounting changes in 1981. For testing purposes, political costs are represented by four measures of firm size and a measure of profitability. Five financial ratios are used to represent debt covenant related costs. After specifying the type <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> change implied by each measure probit models are estimated for hypothesis testing. Separate models are estimated on the basis of data for the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> changes as well as for the preceding year. Except for a few univariate models with a fairly low level of significance, none of the models are found to be significant. Based on the premise that the variables are relevant to only certain subsets of firms the sample is partitioned into high political cost and low political cost subsets and also into high debt and low debt subsets. Several models estimated for subsets of firms with either a lower financial leverage or a higher level of profitability are significant. In both cases the most significant models are based on the data for the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> changes rather than for the preceding year. While the results based on the total sample do not support the theory, the significant models estimated on the basis of subsets indicate a potential area for further investigation. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades human {{population}} has increased exponentially, causing great stress on natural systems. The oceans are no exception. Demand at times has exceeded its capacity to supply the resources desired. As a result it has suffered greatly being over exploited and severely degraded. Over fishing, sewage <b>run-off</b> and <b>years</b> <b>of</b> failed environmental policies have taken their toll. In response to the general state of the oceans. We are now searching for remedies to the problems we have caused. One such solution is marine protected areas. Marine protected areas, if designed and implemented correctly, can greatly benefit those dependent on the oceans for their livelihood, as well as benefit the greater human population. They can serve to conserve and protect biodiversity and areas of special interest to industry, fishing and/or tourism. The key is in the design. The general design of a marine protected area can determine its success.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{structural}} {{model for the}} valuation of defaultable securities of a firm which models the effect of deliberate misreporting done by insiders in the firm and unobserved by others. We derive exact formulas for equity and bond prices and approximate expressions for the conditional default probability, recovery rate, and credit spread under the proposed credit risk framework. We propose a novel estimation approach to structural model estimation which accounts for noisy observed asset values. We apply the proposed method to calibrate a simple version of our model {{to the case of}} Parmalat and show that the model is able to recover a certain amount of misreporting during the <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> irregularities.

40|$|Agents {{with more}} {{experience}} make better choices. We measure learning dynamics using a panel with four million monthly credit card statements. We study add-on fees, specifically cash advance, late payment, and overlimit fees. New credit card accounts generate fee payments of $ 15 per month. Through negative feedback — i. e. paying a fee — consumers learn to avoid triggering future fees. Paying a fee last month reduces {{the likelihood of}} paying a fee in the current month by about 40 %. Controlling for account fixed effects, monthly fee payments fall by 75 % {{during the first three}} <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> life. We find that learning is not monotonic.

It drew criticism from environmental groups and the Federal Government's climate change advisor, Professor Ross Garnaut. Garnaut said {{the government}}'s conditional 2020 emission targets were too low, and said the planned assistance measures for Australian emissions intensive industries pose [...] "profound" [...] financial risk for the Government.

The aim of the research is to perform the comparative analysis <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> policy adopted in Latvia and internationally regarding the investment property and to develop suggestions for its improvement. The research methodology is based on the comparative analysis of the requirements set in the documents regulating accounting in Latvia, the European Union Directives regulating accounting and the International Accounting Standards. The paper covers also the analysis of authors’ conclusions, publications in the periodicals, the results of the survey of the members of the Accountants’ Association of the Republic of Latvia, and other bibliographic sources. The authors of the research draw a conclusion that there had been several requirements set in the documents regulating accounting in Latvia, which only partially comply with the regulations adopted internationally regarding the recognition, evaluation and <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> investment property.
