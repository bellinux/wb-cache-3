40|$|AbstractS-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) -dependent {{methylation}} {{is central}} to the regulation of many biological processes: more than 50 AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases methylate a broad spectrum of cellular compounds including nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Common to all AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase reactions is the release of the strong product inhibitor S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy), as a by-product of the reaction. S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase is the only eukaryotic enzyme capable of <b>reversible</b> AdoHcy <b>hydrolysis</b> to adenosine and homocysteine and, thus, relief from AdoHcy inhibition. Impaired S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase activity in humans results in AdoHcy accumulation and severe pathological consequences. Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is characterized by elevated levels of homocysteine in blood, also exhibits a similar phenotype of AdoHcy accumulation due to the reversal of the direction of the S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase reaction. Inhibition of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase is also linked to antiviral effects. In this review the advantages of yeast as an experimental system to understand pathologies associated with AdoHcy accumulation will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{reaction}} kinetics and chemical equilibrium of the <b>reversible</b> catalytic <b>hydrolysis</b> reaction of a methyl acetate to acetic acid and methanol using a strongly acidic {{ion exchange resin}} catalyst named Amberlyst 15 were studied. To investigate the different behavior of Amberlyst 15 in the adsorption of reactants and product species, the equilibrium behavior of binary non-reactive liquid mixtures, consisting of one reactant and one product were studied experimentally. The Langmuir model was {{used to describe the}} equilibrium condition, quantitatively. Then the employed model was compared with the more complicated thermodynamic models to describe the equilibrium between the catalytic polymer resin and the liquid phase. The results indicated a good agreement. The effects of temperature, catalyst weight, and feed molar ratios on {{reaction kinetics}} were investigated. Results revealed that the reaction rate was strongly temperature dependent. The chemical equilibrium compositions were measured {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and feed molar ratios. Finally, pseudo homogeneous and LHHW (Langmuir Hinshelwood Hougen Watson) models were developed to calculate the rate of the reaction. Optimization of the model's parameters indicated that the use of activity instead of mole fraction, and also the use of LHHW rather than a pseudo homogeneous model resulted in much smaller residual errors. Also the equilibrium compositions obtained from the equation of rates were in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

The enzyme hydrolyzed cyclic imides with bulky substituents such as 2 -methylsuccinimide, 2 -phenylsuccinimide, phthalimide, and 3, 4 -pyridine dicarboximide to the corresponding half-amides. However, simple cyclic imides without substituents, which are substrates of imidase (i. e., succinimide, glutarimide, and sulfur-containing cyclic imides such as 2, 4 -thiazolidinedione and rhodanine), were not hydrolyzed. The combined catalytic actions of bacterial d-hydantoinase and imidase can cover {{the function of}} a single mammalian enzyme, dihydropyrimidinase. Prokaryotic d-hydantoinase also catalyzed the dehydrative cyclization of the half-amide phthalamidic acid to the corresponding cyclic imide, phthalimide.

40|$|The hairpin {{ribozyme}} {{is a small}} catalytic RNA that catalyses <b>reversible</b> sequence-specific RNA <b>hydrolysis</b> in trans. It {{consists of}} two domains, which {{interact with each other}} by docking in an antiparallel fashion. There is a region between the two domains acting as a flexible hinge for interdomain interactions to occur. Hairpin ribozymes with reverse-joined domains have been constructed by dissecting the domains at the hinge and rejoining them in reverse order. We have used both the conventional and reverse-joined hairpin ribozymes for the design of a hairpin-derived twin ribozyme. We show that this twin ribozyme cleaves a suitable RNA substrate at two specific sites while maintaining the target specificity of the individual monoribozymes. For characterisation of the studied ribozymes we have evaluated a quantitative assay of sequence-specific ribozyme activity using fluorescently labelled RNA substrates in conjunction with an automated DNA sequencer. This assay was found to be applicable with hairpin and hairpin-derived ribozymes.

40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of the {{nitrosation}} of L-cysteine, L-cysteine methyl and ethyl esters, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and glutathione by isopropyl nitrite in acid solution at 25 C was undertaken. The thiols exhibited identical rate laws and in all cases the observed rate constant was reduced by added isopropyl alcohol. The results {{were found to be}} consistent with the mechanism in which a rapid <b>reversible</b> acid-catalysed <b>hydrolysis</b> of isopropyl nitrite occurs to give nitrous acid, which then in its protonated form effects nitrosation. The third-order rate constant for the nitrosation of the thiols by isopropyl nitrite and the equilibrium constant for the formation of isopropyl nitrite were found to be in good agreement with the literature values obtained by direct measurement. A similar kinetic {{study of the}} nitrosation of L-cysteine, L-cysteine methyl and ethyl esters, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, thioglycolic acid and glutathione by various alkyl nitrites, in water at 25 C, in the pH range 6 - 13 was undertaken. The pH dependence of the rate constant is consistent with a mechanism involving a direct nitrosation by alkyl nitrites with the thiolate anion (RS(^-)) of the thiol. A quantitative kinetic analysis yielded macroscopic and microscopic pKa values for RSH ionisation in good agreement with the literature values. One exception is L-cysteine where the microscopic, pKp, value (for NH(_ 2) RSH → NH(_ 2) RS(^-)) differs significantly from the literature value. In the case of simple alkyl nitrites (ethyl, isopropyl, isoamyl and t-butyl nitrites) steric effects appear to be the major influence in reactivity whereas electron-withdrawing substituents in the β-position greatly enhanced the rate constant. The results were found to satisfy Taft's equation and thus a correlation between structure and reactivity of the alkyl nitrites with the thiols was established. This work shows that at least in vitro a direct and rapid reaction occurs between alkyl nitrites and thiols at pH values likely to be encountered in vivo. This confirms that such reactions could occur in vivo and could be an important feature of the chain of events occurring during the vasodilatory action of alkyl nitrites. Finally a preliminary investigation of the reaction of glyceryl trinitrate with cysteine, in oxygen and oxygen-free nitrogen atmosphere, in the pH range 6 - 13 was undertaken. In this case no evidence was found for the formation of S-nitrosocysteine or nitric oxide from glyceryl trinitrate in {{the presence or absence of}} cysteine. Thus the results could not confirm the hypothesis that glyceryl trinitrate owes its vasodilatory action to the formation of the intermediate, S-nitrosocysteine, from the reaction of nitric oxide (formed from glyceryl trinitrate) and cysteine...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} in vitro the functional role of mucoid exopolysaccharide (MEP) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in blocking antibiotic-induced and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) -mediated pseudomonal killing. The serum-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates used were mucoid strain 144 MR and its nonmucoid revertant, strain 144 NM. By timed kill curves, early bacterial effects of amikacin against mucoid strain 144 MR were substantially {{less than those}} observed with nonmucoid strain 144 NM; this effect was <b>reversible</b> with enzymatic <b>hydrolysis</b> of MEP of strain 144 MR by alginase. Also, early tobramycin uptake (15 to 30 min) by mucoid 144 MR cells was less than that seen with nonmucoid strain 144 NM; pretreatment of 144 MR cells with alginase substantially enhanced early tobramycin uptake compared with untreated 144 MR cells (P = 0. 08). In strain 144 NM (but not in strain 114 MR) there was a notable postantibiotic leukocidal enhancement effect manifested by increased nonopsonic killing following brief exposure of these cells to supra-MIC amikacin; pretreatment of strain 144 MR with alginase rendered these cells more susceptible to amikacin-induced postantibiotic leukocidal enhancement. Similarly, direct PMN-mediated nonopsonic killing of mucoid strain 144 MR was significantly less than that observed with strain 144 NM (P less than 0. 05); pretreatment of 144 MR cells with alginase rendered this strain equal to strain 144 NM in susceptibility to nonopsonic killing. In addition, exogenous sodium alginate or extracted MEP of strain 144 MR interfered with effective nonopsonic killing of strain 144 NM by PMNs. Studies also indicated that mucoid strain 144 MR was phagocytosed significantly less well than its nonmucoid mate (P less than 0. 00001), an effect reversed by pretreatment of the mucoid cells with alginase. These data confirm that P. aeruginosa MEPs functionally decrease the uptake and early bactericidal effect of aminoglycosides in vitro and interfere with effective PMN-mediated nonopsonic phagocytosis and killing of mucoid strains...|$|R

We report here the biological functions of tomato SlSAHHs in stress response. The tomato genome contains three SlSAHH genes that encode SlSAHH proteins with high level of sequence identity. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that SlSAHHs responded with distinct expression induction patterns to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC 3000 and Botrytis cinerea {{as well as to}} defense signaling hormones such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and a precursor of ethylene. Virus-induced gene silencing-based knockdown of individual SlSAHH gene did not affect the growth performance and the response to Pst DC 3000. However, co-silencing of three SlSAHH genes using a conserved sequence led to significant inhibition of vegetable growth. The SlSAHH-co-silenced plants displayed increased resistance to Pst DC 3000 but did not alter the resistance to B. cinerea. Co-silencing of SlSAHHs resulted in constitutively activated defense responses including elevated SA level, upregulated expression of defense-related and PAMP-triggered immunity marker genes and increased callose deposition and H 2 O 2 accumulation. Furthermore, the SlSAHH-co-silenced plants also exhibited enhanced drought stress tolerance although they had relatively small roots. These data demonstrate that, in addition to the functions in growth and development, SAHHs also play important roles in regulating biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants...|$|E
40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of the N-nitrosation of 2, 3 -diamlnonaphthalene in acid {{solution}} at 25 C was undertaken. Reaction occurred via both the protonated and unprotonated forms of 2, 3 -dlaminonaphthalene to yield 2, 3 -naphthotrlazole. The reaction is acid-catalysed and is also catalysed by added nucleophiles, The mechanism {{is consistent with the}} rate-limiting formation of the diazonium ion (N-nitrosation followed by rapid proton transfer and loss of a water molecule), which undergoes a rapid cyclisation process, to yield the product, Reactions of nitrosamines involving the N-N heterolytic cleavage with direct transfer of the nitroso group was also investigated. In particular, the denitrosation of N-nitrosoproline was studied. The reaction was carried out In the presence of an excess of nitrite trap to ensure irreversibility, in the presence of added nucleophlles, in high acidic conditions. All kinetic results are consistent with the mechanism involving a rapid reversible N-protonation followed by a rate-limiting attack by the nucleophile (added Br(^-), SCN(^-) or thiourea) giving the nitrosyl derivative, which is rapidly destroyed with the nitrite traps used in these experiments. However, at high nucleophile concentration and for reaction in ethanol, the reaction becomes Independent of added nucleophile. This is because the rate-limiting step is now the proton transfer to the nltrosamine rather than the attack of the nucleophile. N- nitrosopyrrolidine, a heterocycle which does not contain a β-electron withdrawing group reacted less readily in the denitrosation reaction. N- nitrososarcoslne, an acyclic compound containing a g-electron withdrawing group showed similar behaviour to NNP, suggesting that it is the β-electron withdrawing group, rather than the cyclic structure in NMP which is the dominant factor in the loss of the nitroso group. The reaction of N-nitroso compounds containing an electron-withdrawing group was studied. The high reactivity of N-methyl-N-nltrosotoluene-p- sulphonamide (MNTS) with nucleophlles, with the loss of the nitroso group has been explained in terms of either a rapid blmolecular reaction between the nucleophile and the more susceptible nitrosamine, due to the β-electron withdrawing substituent, or the weakening of the N-N bond by –S 0 (_ 2), resulting in extensive bond breaking. MNTS was reacted with powerful nucleophlles, L- cysteine, L-cystelne methyl and ethyl esters and N-acetyl-L-cystelne, In water at 25 ºC in the pH range 6 - 13. The pH dependence of the rate constant Is consistent with a mechanism Involving a direct nitrosatlon by MNTS with the thiolate anion of the thiol. A quantitative kinetic analysis yielded microscopic pKa values for RSH ionlsatlon in good agreement with literature. Nitrosatlon by 0 - and S-nitroso compounds were also studied. The substrates used in this case Include phenols, ascorbic acid and haems. Reaction of iso-amyl nitrite (IAN) (an alkyl nitrite) with phenols and ascorbic acid occurs via a rapid <b>reversible</b> acid-catalysed <b>hydrolysis</b> of iso-amyl nitrite giving nitrous acid, which then In Its protonated form effects nitrosatlon. Reaction of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) with phenols and ascorbic acid, however, showed different characteristics: a possible radical mechanism is suggested on the basis of e. s. r. experiments. Preliminary Investigations of the reactions of both IAN and SNAP with haems showed a complex reaction scheme: the reaction is not a simple single step reaction.

40|$|Abstract D-hydantoinase (DHT) catalyzes a <b>reversible</b> {{ring-opening}} <b>hydrolysis</b> of D, L-p-hydroxyphenyl-hydantoins (D, L-p-HPH). DHT {{has been}} used as biocatalyst for the stereospecific production of optically active non-proteinogenic amino acids, which are valuable synthons for the synthesis of antibiotics. DHT has been successfully exploited in different enzymatic systems in the production of pharmaceuticals. However there is a problem in the application of DHT in these operations, since the solubility of the substrate (D, L-p-HPH) requires a temperature over 50 C. At the temperature of 50 C, activity of the regular DHT is significantly decreased. Therefore, it is important to isolate a thermal stable DHT for this process. Although DHT can be easily expressed in microorganisms, mostly forms inclusion body, and usually does not retain enzyme activity. In this study, the possibility to produce DHT in transgenic rice plants was evaluated. Two full-length of DHT genes (including regular and thermal stable DHTs) were isolated and cloned in plant expression vectors under the control of constitutive (CaMV 35 S and rice actin) or seed specific (Ose 721 and Ose 705) promoters, respectively. These expression vectors were introduced into rice plants through agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. The existence of DHT gene in antibiotic resistant plants was confirmed by southern blot assays. Expression of DHT gene in various tissues was analyzed through western analyses. For gene driven by constitutive promoters, DHT was detected in both leaves and seeds, while gene driven by Ose 721 and Ose 705 promoters, DHT was observed only in seeds. Our preliminary results indicated that the DHTs produced in transgenic rice retain their enzymatic activities. DHT 能夠水解 D,L-p-hydroxyphenylhydantoin(D-p-HPH) 生成 D,L-p-hydroxyphenylglycine(D-p-HPG) 。D-p-HPG 可與 6 -aminopenicillanic acid 合成Amoxicillin，Amoxicillin 和 ß-lactamase inhibitor混合使用後，抗菌效果大為提昇。因此市場上對前驅物(D-p-HPG) 需求擴大，每年成長 12 % 以上。國內D-p-HPG年需求量約 60 公噸，全部仰賴進口，因此國內存在生產D-p-HPG的空間，然而欲發展D-p-HPG 工業必須在技術上有所突破。 目前在工業上希望能以二段酵素法來生產D-p-HPG ，二段酵素法是利用DHT將D-p-HPH轉換成N-carbamoyl-D-HPG，再由N-carbamoylase 將其轉換成D-p-HPG。然而，目前遭遇的困難是D-p-HPH 的溶解度不佳，為解決此一問題，就必須提高反應溫度到 50 oC 增加溶解度，但目前的DHT在此溫度下都已失去或降低活性。為克服此一問題，已從微生物選殖出熱穩定DHT，是由四個次單元組成，每個次單元分子量為 51 kD。DHT酵素分析，發現於 50 ℃恆溫中，半衰期可長達 35 天，能夠突破D-p-HPH受質難溶問題。然而微生物所生產的DHT容易生成 inclusion body，不具酵素活性，因此需要適合的DHT表現系統。 本研究目的在於建立水稻生產DHT蛋白之系統。首先構築含dht 的表現載體，使用Ose 721 、Ose 705 、Actin和CaMV 35 S四種啟動子來啟動dht 基因，利用農桿菌轉殖法送入水稻基因組內，並觀察dht在不同組織之表現。轉殖水稻經由聚合酶鏈鎖反應及南方墨點分析，證明轉殖基因的存在，其嵌入位置及數目也不盡相同。西方墨點分析，可以偵測到DHT 蛋白的表現。Ose 721 、Ose 705 啟動子所啟動的轉殖株，可在種子中偵測到DHT 蛋白的存在，而葉片卻沒有。Actin啟動子所啟動的轉殖株，則在種子和葉片中皆能偵測到DHT 蛋白；至於含CaMV 35 S啟動子的轉殖株，只在葉片偵測到有DHT 蛋白的表現，在種子中卻沒有。以上各種轉殖株所萃取的DHT 蛋白皆具有生物活性。目 錄 目 錄……………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要………………. …………………………………… [...] ……… [...] ….

The market for the antibiotics requirement increased about 12 % annually, this makes the needs for D-p-HPG increased significantly as well. The production of D-p-HPG using DHT and carbamoylase had become a very important industrial process (附表一). Since the solubility of the substrate (D, L-p-HPH) requires a temperature over 50 ºC, the application of a regular DHT in this operation is limited. It becomes very important to isolate a thermal stable DHT for this process. In pervious study，they therefore isolated a thermal stable DHT gene from Brevibacillus agri NCHU 1002. and created transgenic rice which had DHT gene. Advances in plant biotechnology have made the production of recombinant proteins in plants feasible. Plants have considerable potential for the production of recombinant proteins because they are easily transformed and provide a cheap source of protein. Rice {{is one of the most}} important crops in Taiwan and in the world. It can potentially provide a safe and inexpensive factory for the mass production of commercially valuable proteins. By using specific promoters, such as the seed-specific promoters, the recombinant protein can be expressed in rice seeds, which would allow stable storage for an extended period of time. Our lab have previously isolated several seed-specific promoters, such as the promoters of Ose 721 and Ose 705 genes. The promoter of Ose 721 gene, an oleosin gene, will direct its gene product in rice embryo and aleurone layers which are the components of rice bran after milling process of rice. The production of recombinant proteins in rice bran will enrich the add-on utility of rice production industry. In this study, we evaluate the production level of a thermal stable DHT in transgenic rice plants using different promoters and test the activity of the purified plant-based DHT. The enzyme activity of DHT was enhanced by adding Mn 2 + (MnCl 2), Co 2 + (CoCl 2), FeSO 4, or CuSO 4 and inhibited by high concentration of Ni 2 +, EDTA, NH 4 +, Mg 2 +(SO 42 +), Mg(Cl 2 -), Cs(Cl 2 -), or NaCl. The optimal pH for catalytic activity was about pH 8. 5, similar to that obtained using the native enzyme isolated from Brevibacillus agri NCHU 1002, but the optimal temperature was about 80 ℃ higher than that obtained from Brevibacillus agri NCHU 1002. 中文摘要 1 英文摘要 3 前言 5 前人研究 7 一、 生物反應器： 7 三、 稻胚特有表現之基因起動子 11 四、 水稻肌動蛋（Actin）基因及起動子 13 五、 tDHT 基因轉殖水稻 13 材料 14 方法 15 一、 轉殖水稻同質株系篩選 15 二、 萃取質體DNA 15 三、 純化回收DNA 片段 16 四、 抽取水稻總 DNA 16 五、 確認轉殖植物 17 六、 南方墨點分析 17 七、 自動放射顯影 18 八、 蛋白質定量 19 九、 蛋白質膠體電泳 19 十、 西方墨點法 21 十一、 大量表現及純化 E. coli中的 tDHT 21 十二、 萃取水稻的蛋白質 22 十三、 不同 pH 值之 Tris 溶液萃取效果 23 十四、 tDHT 在轉殖水稻穀粒的表現量 23 十五、 tDHT 在穀粒不同時期的產量分析 23 十六、 利用鎳離子管柱純化 tDHT 24 十七、 二維電泳分析 25 第一維電泳 25 十八、 活性分析 27 十九、 轉殖水稻的農藝性狀調查 28 結果 29 一、 篩選及分析 tDHT 同質轉殖株系 29 1. 篩選同質株系 29 2. 農藝性狀調查 29 3. 同質株系南方墨點法分析 30 4. tDHT 表現量分析 32 二、 tDHT 蛋白的純化與分析 35 1. 建立 tDHT 蛋白純化系統 35 2. tDHT 的活性分析 37 討論 41 一、 同質株系篩選 41 二、 tDHT 表現量分析 41 三、 純化水稻生產之 tDHT 42 四、 tDHT 活性分析 43 五、 農藝性狀調查 47 結論 48 參考文獻 49 圖表 56 附圖 8...|$|R

SAH {{is formed as a}} direct product of transmethylation reactions involving S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and is known to be a potent inhibitor of most SAM mediated methyltransfer reactions. An Asparagus officinalis cDNA showing strong homology to previously cloned SHH cDNAs was identified by the random sequencing of cDNAs from a library enriched for wound induced clones. PCR primers were designed which allowed the amplification of a region of the SHH gene from any plant species tested to date. The alignment of sequences from both cloned PCR products, A. officinalis cDNAs, and previously isolated SHH clones, highlights the high level of sequence homology retained between divergent species as well as the presence of an extra polypeptide motif in the amino acid sequence of SHH genes from photosynthetic species. Northern analysis using RNA isolated from asparagus suggested SHH is transcriptionally upregulated from its constitutive low level by a wound stimulus. An Arabidopsis thaliana genomic SHH clone was isolated and used in promoter/reporter gene fusion studies to facilitate a detailed study of the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the SHH gene. Data obtained from this study corroborated evidence obtained from northern, western and enzyme activity analysis, suggesting SHH was expressed in all plant organs. Perturbation of SHH gene expression was also attempted within transgenic plants to try and further elucidate biochemical pathways requiring SHH enzyme activity...|$|E

Unfortunately, at physiological pH, these potent agents undergo a rapid and <b>reversible</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> with the loss of antitumor activity. Previous researchers have shown that the encapsulation of this drug in PLGA nanoparticles could increase its stability and release profile. In this research we investigated PLGA-PEG nanoparticles and their effect on in vitro characteristics of this labile drug. 9 -NC-PLGA-PEG nanoparticles with particle size within the range of 148. 5 ± 30 nm were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method. The influence of four different independent variables (amount of polymer, percent of emulsifier, internal phase volume, and external phase volume) on nanoparticle drug-loading was studied. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry were also evaluated for physical characterizing. The results of optimized formulation showed a narrow size distribution, suitable zeta potential (+ 1. 84), and a drug loading of more than 45 %. The in vitro drug release from PLGA-PEG NPs showed a sustained release pattern of up to 120 hours and comparing with PLGA-NPs had a significant decrease in initial burst effect. These experimental results indicate that PLGA-PEG-NPs (versus PLGA-NPs) have a better physicochemical characterization and can be developed as a drug carrier in order to treat different malignancies...|$|E
40|$|Hyperhomocysteinemia is an {{independent}} and graded risk factor for arterial vascular disease and venous thrombosis. It is still debated via which mechanism homocysteine (Hcy) causes vascular disease. S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) catalyses the <b>reversible</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) to Hcy. As an increase in AdoHcy, a strong inhibitor of many methyltransferases, is observed in hyperhomocysteinemic individuals, AdoHcy {{may play a role}} in the development of cardiovascular diseases by inhibiting transmethylation reactions. We sequenced the entire coding region and parts of the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the AHCY gene of 20 patients with recurrent venous thrombosis in order to identify genetic variation within this gene. We identified three sequence variants in the AHCY gene: a C > T transition in the 5 ' UTR (- 34 bp C > T), a missense mutation in exon 2, which mandates an amino-acid conversion at codon 38 (112 C > T; Arg 38 Trp) and a silent mutation in exon 4 (390 C > T; Asp 130 Asp). We studied the effect of the first two variants on total plasma Hcy and venous thrombosis risk in a case-control study on recurrent venous thrombosis. The two polymorphisms under study seem to have no evident effect on tHcy. The adjusted relative risk of venous thrombosis associated with the 112 CT genotype compared with 112 CC individuals was 1. 27 (95 % CI 0. 55 - 2. 94), whereas the - 34 CT genotype confers a risk of 1. 25 (95 % CI 0. 44 - 3. 52) compared with the wild-type genotype at this locus.

The formation of thethird-liquid or third phase and the catalytic activity of dual-site phase-transfer catalyst underultrasonic irradiation, reaction mechanism, and kinetics will be explored. The purpose of this{{proposal is}} to setup the green process of ultrasound-assisted dual-site phase-transfer catalysis,which behaves high product yield and is an environmentally benign technology without usinghalide-containing solvents. Phase transfer catalysts have been employed to enhance the reaction of immisciblereactants under mild conditions with high conversion and high product selectivity. If amolecule of catalyst contains dual sites, {{it can be used}} to increase the reaction rate more andmore. Thus it is valuable to change the traditional manufacturing method into a phase-transfercatalyzed esterification processes with third phase which is highly concentrated in a separatephase and can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction mixture. The ultrasoundtechnology has been proved to greatly enhance the rate of chemical reaction and product yield. Hence, this proposal is willing to explore the activity of dual-site phase transfer catalysts intri-phase system under ultrasonic irradiation. It is expected to develop the related theory ofphase transfer catalysis and interfacial catalysis. The benzoates are widely used as flavoring agents, perfumery, lacquers and solvent forcellulose derivatives, and as an additive in liquid crystal materials. p-Hydroxybenzoates areused in perfumery, sunscreeing agent, etc. In the past, the manufacturing processes forsubstituted benzoates were to conduct esterification reaction with the corresponding alcoholsin the presence of sulfuric acid, and having the disadvantages of severe reaction conditions,slow reaction rates, and low yields due to <b>reversible</b> reactions and <b>hydrolysis</b> side recations. Moreover, the materials of reactors should be specially considered due to the use of sulfuricacid. Those drawbacks can be overcome by applying phase-transfer catalyzed esterificationprocesses. This proposal is the extended work of the last project and is willing to be completedwithin two years. The goal and items done are as follows. For the first year, the formation ofthe third-liquid or the third phase by the novel dual-site phase-transfer catalyst will beexplored. Effects on the third phase formation investigated will include the aqueous reactant,inorganic salt, dual-site PTC and reaction conditions, etc. the reactivity of dual-site PTC withthe organic reactant and the distribution of the catalytic intermediate between the tri-phases,the interfacial reaction mechanism and kinetics of the overall reaction under ultrasoundirradiation. The kinetic model is also developed to describe the interfacial reactions intri-phase system. For the second year, a continuous flow reactor system with ultrasoundirradiation will be set-up and employed to investigate the catalytic activity of dual-sitephase-transfer catalyst, reaction mechanism, catalyst distribution, and the effect of ultrasound,etc. The system model for the continuous flow reactor in tri-phases will be developed. Theresearch results can be used as the basis for reactor design in the future. 本計畫在探討應用超音波輔助雙活性基相間轉移觸媒於三相系統在批式反應器及續流式反應器合成羥基苯甲酸酯類化學品，探討雙活性基觸媒形成第三液相或第三相之條件、及其在超音波輔助下之催化性能、反應機制與反應動力學等，建立超音波輔助雙活性基相間轉移催化酯化反應的程序。由於反應方法具有高產物產率及不使用有害環境的含鹵素溶劑，因此是對環境親和的綠色化學技術。由於相間轉移觸媒具有增進兩不互溶反應物的反應速率，且其反應條件溫和、轉化率及產物選擇率高，而具有雙重活性基位的相間轉移觸媒，更可促進催化反應速率。當雙活性基相間轉移觸媒集中於第三液相或形成固液共存之第三相時，可提昇觸媒反應之效率；第三相或第三液相之催化反應系統不僅具有高催化活性，更因觸媒高度集中於水油以外的相，而具有觸媒易於分離與回收之優點，與超音波技術結合時，則可在溫和條件下使用環境親和溶劑來合成高價值化學品並提高其產率。本計畫探討在超音波放射下三相系統之雙活性基催化反應現象，期能對相間轉移催化技術及其界面催化的理論有進一步的發展。以苯甲酸為主的酯類廣泛用於調合香料的基材、化粧品香水、食品調味劑等，亦可用於瓷漆、纖維素衍生物及可作為液晶材料之添加劑。以對-羥基苯甲酸所合成的酯類則作為防日晒油、乳霜和化妝水之芳香劑、溶劑。以往製造含取代基苯甲酸酯類的程序，是以其對應醇類在硫酸的催化下進行酯化反應來合成，反應條件嚴苛、反應速率慢、且因可逆反應與水解副反應而有產率低的缺點，也因使用硫酸觸媒，反應器材質需特別考慮，應用相間轉移觸媒的酯化反應製程則可改善這些缺點。本計畫為延續上年度計畫之二年期研究計畫，其目標及預定工作項目如次：第一年進行新穎雙活性基相間轉移觸媒之第三液相與第三相形成研究，探討水相反應物、鹽類、雙活性基相間轉移觸媒及反應條件對第三液相形成之效應，雙活性基觸媒中間體與有機相反應物之本質反應速率及其在三相之分佈情形，在超音波放射條件下界面反應機制，操作變數對總反應速率之影響等，並建立反應系統之動力學模式。第二年則進行超音波輔助雙活性基相間轉移觸媒之三相續流式反應程序研究，以第一年研究結果為基礎，探討雙活性基觸媒在續流式反應器之催化行為、反應機制、觸媒分布、超音波效應等，並建立雙活性基觸媒之三相續流式催化酯化反應模式，本計畫研究結果將可提供未來反應程序設計的基礎...|$|R
40|$|To {{respond to}} {{environmental}} changes, cells must transfer information concerning their environment across their impermeable membranes. One {{solution to this}} problem involves three proteins: a receptor which detects information outside the cell, an effector molecule which alters the intracellular environment, and a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G protein) which couples the receptor to the effector molecules. The features of this system that make it particularly useful for transmembrane signalling are that signals can be amplified at several steps, and that the transfer of information is unidirectional. This three protein system is used by organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, and is versatile, responding to signals from light and smell to hormones and neurotransmitters. The signals regulate rapidly occurring events such as action potentials, and long-term events such as growth and development [reviewed in 1 – 6]. In the kidney, G proteins are involved in the action of hormones such as PTH, vasopressin, and angiotensin II, and the activation of second messenger systems such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipases, and ion channels. This paper examines the basic mechanisms by which G proteins work, focusing on the α chains, the general signalling pathways in which they are involved, and finally considers how what has been learned about their function can be applied to understanding the kidney. G proteins are heterotrimeric proteins composed of α, β and γ subunits which transfer information from receptors to effectors through cyclic changes in conformation driven by GTP binding and hydrolysis. The various G proteins are characterized by their α subunits because the α subunits are the most diverse, and are generally believed to be responsible for the specificity of receptor and effector interactions. The α subunits are also responsible for GTP binding and <b>hydrolysis,</b> <b>reversible</b> interactions with βγ subunits, and are the substrates for ADP-ribosylation by cholera and pertussis toxins. To date, evidence for sixteen α subunits exists (Table 1), all of which show striking structural similarity to one another [1 – 8]. When compared to αs, the other α subunits which have been completely cloned (αolf, αo, αi 1 - 3, αt, and αz) are 42 to 46 % homologous, but if αs is left out of the comparison, the homology ranges from 60 to 72 % [2, 7]. The β and γ subunits are less well understood, but are believed to be important for membrane interactions and receptor coupling, and may in some systems be able to activate effectors. to date, four β and up to four subunits have been identified [MI Simon, personal communication]. The β subunits are similar with only 15 % divergence at the amino acid level [8, 9, M. I. Simon, personal communication]. Transducin γ and brain Go and Gi-associated γ are 55 % homologous [10, 11]. Although βγ subunits purified from retina and brain inhibit cyclase with different efficiency, the functional differences among the β and γ subunits from brain have not been determined [11]. G proteins are implicated in a signalling pathway by one or more of several criteria, activation of the pathway by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs or A 1 F 4 -, inhibition by GDPβS, sensitivity to pertussis or cholera toxins, stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by the receptor agonist, and regulation of receptor affinity for agonist by guanine nucleotides [2, 3]. Although these criteria serve to distinguish G protein-dependent signalling pathways from others such as tyrosine kinase receptors, or ligand-gated ion channels, they frequently do not help to distinguish among the many possible G proteins. Only two systems have been well characterized at the molecular level. Most of the detailed biochemical information on G protein action comes from the study of the retinal rhodopsintransducin-cGMP phosphodiesterase system, and the Gs-adenylyl cyclase system. In the retinal system, large amounts of the three principal components—rhodopsin, the receptor; transducin, the G protein; and cGMP phosphodiesterase, the effector—can be purified relatively easily in large quantities, allowing detailed biochemical studies [5, 6, 12]. The Gs-adenylyl cyclase system has been accessible to study despite small quantities of protein because a mutant cell line lacking Gs, Cyc-, allowed its identification, purification, and characterization by reconstitution [2, 3]. For the other α chains, less precise information is available for a number of reasons. Multiple α chains are present in a single tissue or cell type, they are similar biochemically and difficult to purify to homogeneity, and appropriate mutant cell lines analogous to Cyc- for reconstitution do not exist. Additional problems in identifying the signalling pathways served by a specific G protein are that the components of signalling pathways are present in small quantities in most tissues, and the pathways are complex. Multiple receptors can activate a single G protein, a single G protein can activate multiple effectors, and multiple G proteins may activate the same effectors. Progress has been made with antisera and reconstitution of purified proteins into relatively “complete” systems such as whole cells and membrane patches, but the results are not as clean as for transducin and Gs...|$|R
40|$|S-adenosylhomocysteine {{hydrolase}} (SAHH) {{functions as}} an enzyme catalyzing the <b>reversible</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of S-adenosylhomocysteine to homocysteine and adenosine. In the present work we have investigated {{its role in}} the ripening process of tomato fruit. Among the three SlSAHH genes we demonstrated that SlSAHH 2 was highly accumulated during fruit ripening and strongly responded to ethylene treatment. Over-expression of SlSAHH 2 enhanced SAHH enzymatic activity in tomato fruit development and ripening stages and resulted in a major phenotypic change of reduced ripening time from anthesis to breaker. Consistent with this, the content of lycopene was higher in SlSAHH 2 over-expression lines than in wild-type at the same developmental stage. The expression of two ethylene inducible genes (E 4 and E 8) and three ethylene biosynthesis genes (SlACO 1, SlACO 3 and SlACS 2) increased to a higher level in SlSAHH 2 over-expression lines at breaker stage, and one transgenic line even produced much more ethylene than wild-type. Although inconsistency in gene expression and ethylene production existed between the two transgenic lines, the transcriptional changes of several important ripening regulators such as RIN, AP 2 a, TAGL 1, CNR and NOR showed a consistent pattern. It was speculated that the influence of SlSAHH 2 on ethylene production was downstream of the regulation of SlSAHH 2 on these ripening regulator genes. The over-expressing lines displayed higher sensitivity to ethylene in both fruit and non-fruit tissues. Ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) treatment accelerated ripening faster in SlSAHH 2 over-expressing fruit than in wild-type. Additionally, seedlings of transgenic lines displayed shorter hypocotyls and roots in ethylene triple response assay. In conclusion, SlSAHH 2 {{played an important role in}} tomato fruit ripening...|$|E

40|$|The postgenomic era of {{scientific}} research has yielded an inundation of gene and protein sequences which are available in public databases. This torrent of sequences, literally in the millions, has altered the strategies, methodologies, and approaches taken toward function discovery and annotation. At the forefront, are interdisciplinary approaches; such as, genomic enzymology. Genomic enzymology bridges aspects of classical enzymology, structural and functional genomics, and comparative genomics. These methods also take advantage of evolutionarily related proteins, which have relatively similar sequence similarity but, yield different functions. The amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS), contains proteins of similar chemistry and topology, which are related to one another through a common ancestral progenitor. The AHS has been organized into smaller groups based only on sequence similarity, which are known as clusters of orthologous groups (COG). There are currently 24 COGs within this superfamily. Cog 3618 is comprised of primarily lactonase enzymes. The first identified member of cog 3618 was LigI, which catalyzes the <b>reversible</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of 2 -pyrone- 4, 6 -dicarboxylate. The chemical mechanism was elucidated and {{it was determined that}} this protein is the first member of the AHS that does not require a metal cofactor for catalysis. The mechanistic characteristics of LigI, along with genomic enzymology, were utilized to predicted and identify the functions of two other COG members.

NMR analysis revealed that these enzymes give preference to 6 -member lactones, as opposed to their more stable counterparts. In addition, it is proposed that L-galactono- 1, 5 -lactone participates in a novel L-galactose catabolic pathway, which appears to converge with D-galacturonate degradation through the intermediate of an adjacent dehydrogenase (BVU_ 0222).

40|$|Lipase enzymes {{catalyze}} the <b>reversible</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of triacylglycerol to {{fatty acids}} and glycerol at the lipid–water interface. The metabolically versatile Ralstonia eutropha strain H 16 {{is capable of}} utilizing various molecules containing long carbon chains such as plant oil, organic acids, or Tween as its sole carbon source for growth. Global gene expression analysis revealed an upregulation of two putative lipase genes during growth on trioleate. Through analysis of growth and activity using strains with gene deletions and complementations, the extracellular lipase (encoded by the lipA gene, locus tag H 16 _A 1322) and lipase-specific chaperone (encoded by the lipB gene, locus tag H 16 _A 1323) produced by R. eutropha H 16 was identified. Increase in gene dosage of lipA not only resulted in an increase of the extracellular lipase activity, but also reduced the lag phase during growth on palm oil. LipA is a non-specific lipase that can completely hydrolyze triacylglycerol into its corresponding free fatty acids and glycerol. Although LipA is active over a temperature range from 10 °C to 70 °C, it exhibited optimal activity at 50 °C. While R. eutropha H 16 prefers a growth pH of 6. 8, its extracellular lipase LipA is most active between pH 7 and 8. Cofactors are not required for lipase activity; however, EDTA and EGTA inhibited LipA activity by 83 %. Metal ions Mg[superscript 2 +], Ca[superscript 2 +], and Mn[superscript 2 +] were found to stimulate LipA activity and relieve chelator inhibition. Certain detergents are found to improve solubility of the lipid substrate or increase lipase-lipid aggregation, as a result SDS and Triton X- 100 were able to increase lipase activity by 20 % to 500 %. R. eutropha extracellular LipA activity can be hyper-increased, making the overexpression strain a potential candidate for commercial lipase production or in fermentations using plant oils as the sole carbon source.

40|$|S-Adenosylhomocysteine Hydrolase (SAHase) catalyzes the <b>reversible</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to {{adenosine}} and homocysteine in an addition-elimination mechanism. This mechanism {{could follow}} {{one of four}} possible stereochemical pathways. To distinguish between possible pathways, 5 '(R) -(5 '-(' 2) H(, 1)) -adenosine, 5 '(S) -(5 '-(' 2) H(, 1)) -adenosine, 5 '(R) -(5 '(' 2) H(, 1)) -SAH, 5 '(S) -(5 '(' 2) H(, 1)) -SAH, (E) -(5 '-(' 2) H(, 1)) - 4 ', 5 '-dehydro- 5 '-deoxyadenosine, and (Z) -(5 '-(' 2) H(, 1)) - 4 ', 5 '-dehydro- 5 '-deoxyadenosine were chemically synthesized. SAHase was isolated from calf liver. Incubation of the stereospecifically deuterated adenosines and homocysteine with SAHase gave SAH with retention of configuration at C- 5 '. Addition of homocysteine to the (E) and (Z) isomers of (5 '-(' 2) H(, 1)) - 4 ', 5 '-dehydro- 5 '-deoxyadenosine by SAHase occurred with syn geometry. Therefore, the overall reaction is a syn elimination-syn addition process, indicating a single base mechanism. A variety of nucleoside analogs {{have been shown to}} inactivate SAHase. Several different mechanisms of inactivation have been suggested. However, none of the inactivators appear to be suicide substrates. Analogous to the reaction of 3 -decynoyl-S-NAC with (beta) -hydroxy decanoyl dehydrase, an acetylenic derivative of adenosine would be expected to undergo propargylic rearrangement upon activation by SAHase. The synthesis of acetylenic adenosine is described, as well as the radiolabelled 2 -(' 3) H -acetylenic adenosine and 6 '-(' 3) H -acetylenic adenosine. The irreversible inhibition of acetylenic adenosine on SAHase is dependent on both time and inhibitor concentration. The K(,i) was determined to be 173 nM. Binding studies conducted with radiolabelled acetylenic adenosine showed a binding stoichiometry of 4 moles of acetylenic adenosine per mole tetrameric enzyme. Aristeromycin is one of the better inactivators of SAHase. Binding studies between biosynthetically prepared 2 -(' 3) H -aristeromycin and SAHase were conducted. A binding stoichiometry of 2. 5 moles aristeromycin per tetrameric enzyme was determined...|$|E
40|$|Topotecan (TPT) is a semi-synthetic {{derivative}} {{of the natural}} extract camptothecin, which {{has been found to}} act as an inhibitor of the DNA enzyme topoisomerase I in a specific and reversible fashion. The drug undergoes <b>reversible</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> from the pharmacologically active parent lactone form (TPTL) to an inactive hydroxy acid form. In the cytoplasm the irreversible inactivation of TPTL is catalysed by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Over-expression of the human breast cancern resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG 2) has been linked to high levels of resistance to the anti-cancer agent TPT by promoting an active efflux pump mechanism. The expressions of both ALDH and BCRP have been experimentally identified in a large number of solid tumours and thus {{play an important role in}} clinical drug resistance of cancers. To investigate the catalytic reaction and efflux pump mechanism, a compartmental model for the in vitro uptake kinetics of TPT has been extended to better describe the drug activity and delivery of TPTL to the DNA target as well as the catalysis by ALDH and the elimination of drug from the cytoplasm via the efflux pump. All unknown model parameters were uniquely estimated to a high level of confidence. Model simulations have been compared with live human breast cancer cells (MCF- 7 cell line) data and found to give good qualitative agreement. The kinetic model has then been linked to a cell cycle model, based on [1], which facilitates analysis of the response of the growth of single cells in the presence and absence of TPT. Parameter estimation is performed using green fluorescent protein tagged cyclin B 1 (cell cycle regulatory protein) data for the osteosarcoma cell line U- 2 OS. Linking both models allows the study of drug perturbation to the cell cycle as well as in silico estimation and prediction of the relationship between the target binding and the dose, also permitting the effects of different expressions of the drug resistance protein and the ALDH enzyme. Such a coupled kinetic/dynamic model, once fully validated, has the potential for enhancing the design of optimal dosing regimens...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} mathematical modelling in studying the kinetics and dynamics of the anti-cancer agent topotecan (TPT), a semi-synthetic derivative of the natural extract camptothecin (CPT), which {{has been found to}} act as an inhibitor of the DNA enzyme topoisomerase I in a specific and reversible fashion. The drug undergoes <b>reversible</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> from the pharmacologically active parent lactone form (TPTL) to an inactive hydroxy acid form (TPTH). In the cytoplasm the irreversible inactivation of TPTL is catalysed by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Over-expression of the human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG 2) has been linked to high levels of resistance to the anti-cancer agent TPT by promoting an active efflux pump mechanism. The expressions of both ALDH and BCRP have been experimentally identified in a large number of solid tumours and thus {{play an important role in}} clinical drug resistance of cancers. To investigate the catalytic reaction and efflux pump mechanism, a state-space model for the in vitro uptake kinetics of TPT has been extended to better describe the drug activity and delivery of TPTL to the DNA target as well as the catalysis by ALDH and the elimination of drug from the cytoplasm via the efflux pump. All unknown model parameters were uniquely estimated to a high level of confidence. Model simulations have been compared with live human breast cancer cells data and found to give good qualitative agreement. In addition, a cell cycle model has been extended to include the inhibition effect of the protein p 21 CIP 1 /WAF 1 on the cell cycle traverse and the kinetic model has then been linked to the cell cycle model, which facilitates analysis of the response of the growth of single cells in the presence and absence of TPT. All unknown model parameters were uniquely determined by the output structure corresponding to the experiment. Parameter estimation was performed using green fluorescent protein tagged Cyclin B 1 data for the osteosarcoma cell line U- 2 OS. The novel coupling of both models allows the study of drug perturbation to the cell cycle as well as in silico estimation and prediction of the relationship between the target binding and the dose, also permitting the effects of different levels of expression of the drug resistance protein and the ALDH enzyme. Such a coupled kinetic/dynamic model, once fully validated, has the potential for enhancing the design of optimal dosing regimens.
