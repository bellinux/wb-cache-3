5|$|Gaddafi was <b>ready</b> <b>now</b> for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive {{began in}} June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.|$|E
25|$|All was {{practically}} <b>ready</b> <b>now,</b> and a train had run from Plymouth to Truro on 12 April 1859. {{in a ceremony}} on 2 May 1859 the Prince Consort opened the new bridge, giving consent to naming it the Royal Albert Bridge. The line was opened throughout from Plymouth to Truro for passenger trains on 4 May 1859, and goods trains started on 3 October 1859. Passenger trains were limited to 30mph throughout and goods trains to 15mph; due to the shortage of money, the rolling stock fleet was very small and the train service sparse, with correspondingly low income.|$|E
500|$|The {{developments}} {{in the relationship between}} Brittany and Santana received considerable attention. John Kubicek of BuddyTV thought the plot was pointless, and said it [...] "boiled down to: I'm not ready to come out. I'm <b>ready.</b> <b>Now</b> I'm not again." [...] He added, [...] "If you're going to have Santana question herself, at least show it and don't have it all happen off screen." [...] Both Hankinson and Respers France were impressed by the acting of both Morris and Rivera. Hankinson wrote, [...] "It feels like their relationship is developing organically", while Respers France commended Morris for Brittany's breakup scene with Artie, and Rivera for far surpassing her expectations.|$|E

500|$|Cagney's {{next film}} was Mister Roberts, {{directed}} by John Ford and slated to star Spencer Tracy. [...] Tracy's involvement ensured that Cagney accepted a supporting role, {{although in the}} end, Tracy did not take part. Cagney had worked with Ford before on What Price Glory?, and they had gotten along fairly well. However, as soon as Ford met Cagney at the airport, the director warned him that they would [...] "tangle asses", which caught Cagney by surprise. He later said, [...] "I would have kicked his brains out. He was so goddamned mean to everybody. He was truly a nasty old man." [...] The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set, incensing Ford. Cagney cut short his imminent tirade, saying [...] "When I started this picture, you said that we would tangle asses before this was over. I'm <b>ready</b> <b>now</b> – are you?" [...] Ford walked away, {{and they had no}} more problems, though Cagney never particularly liked Ford.|$|E
500|$|On July 1, Emery {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent as his injury deemed him unable to play until he recuperates. In August, {{he was given}} the go ahead to begin the grueling and tedious workout and rehabilitation process. In November 2010, TSN visited Emery during an on-ice workout and were surprised to see him get down into the butterfly position and play {{for the first time since}} surgery. Emery stated that he did not [...] "care if [...] walk in seven years," [...] and he [...] "just [...] to play." [...] To the surprise of his doctors and trainers, Emery has been doing better than expected. In January 2011, Emery began skating with an OHL team, taking shots and training with Eric Lindros, working with personal trainer Matt Nichol and goalie coach Eli Wilson. According to Wilson, Emery was [...] "as sharp and <b>ready</b> <b>now</b> as he was the summer before Ottawa's Stanley Cup Final run." ...|$|E
2500|$|That night Perkins {{began working}} on a song based on the incident. His first thought was to frame it with a nursery rhyme. He considered, and quickly {{discarded}} [...] "Little Jack Horner... and [...] "See a spider going up the wall...", then settled on [...] "One for the money..." [...] Leaving his bed and working with his Les Paul guitar, he started with an A chord. After playing five chords while singing [...] "Well, it's one for the money... Two for the show... Three to get <b>ready...</b> <b>Now</b> go, man, go!" [...] he broke into a boogie rhythm.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the tour}} in 1993, Flea was {{diagnosed}} with chronic fatigue syndrome and was ordered to rest for a year. Flea and Kiedis felt it best to fire Marshall {{due to lack of}} chemistry and briefly replaced him with Jesse Tobias although his tenure was very short and he was quickly replaced by Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, who was once recruited in 1992 to replace Frusciante. The band was <b>ready</b> <b>now</b> to record their next album although Kiedis {{was in the middle of}} a heroin relapse, which forced Flea to assume the role of lyricist, something he had not yet done. He wrote most of the song [...] "Transcending", and the intro to [...] "Deep Kick". Flea also wrote the lyrics to an entire song; [...] "Pea", in which he both played bass and sang. These three songs appeared on the Chili Peppers' sixth record One Hot Minute, which was released on 12 September 1995. The album received mixed reviews and was significantly less commercially successful than Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The One Hot Minute Tour was ultimately cut short due to various injuries Kiedis and Smith received, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers decided to go on hiatus. Flea was so miserable that at one point during the tour discussed quitting the band. Flea began to practice Transcendental Meditation and yoga, and slowly decreased his marijuana consumption. Due to the Chili Peppers' inactivity, Flea joined Navarro in a Jane's Addiction reunion tour in 1997, filling in for ex-Jane's Addiction bassist Eric Avery. Rumors spread, that the band was breaking up until Navarro stated otherwise: [...] "I want to clarify that the Chili Peppers are not breaking up... Flea and I are more than happy to do both projects, time permitting." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{committee}} {{was formed to}} institute a new government and choose a president. The committee comprises 202 MP's and could have another 40 more representatives. On 18 August, committee co-chairperson Halimo Yarey said: [...] "We have 202 members <b>readied</b> <b>now</b> and {{we are working on}} the reviewing of 40 others that were passed today and we hope the first parliament session will be held around August. The rest of the list is still pending because of inter-clan argument and other reasons related to a lack of fulfillment of the conditions." ...|$|R
