We check whether considering for LM, asymmetries and fat-tails in the stock return's behaviour offer more accurate VaR forecasts. We compute the VaR for two ARCH/GARCH-type models including FIGARCH and FIAPARCH under two density functions: student and skewed student. The obtained results point out that that accounting for long dependence in return and volatility, fat-tails and asymmetry provides better one-day-ahead VaR forecasts. Furthermore, the FIAPARCH model out-performs the other models in the VaR forecasts. Finally, the FIAPARCH model provides for all the stock market indexes the lowest number of violations under the Basel II rules, given a risk exposure at the 99 % confidence level.

5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{difficulty in}} risk assessment is determining {{the rate of}} occurrence since statistical information is not available {{on all kinds of}} past incidents and is particularly scanty in the case of catastrophic events, simply because of their infrequency. Furthermore, evaluating the severity of the consequences (impact) is often quite difficult for intangible assets. Asset valuation is another question that needs to be addressed. Thus, best educated opinions and available statistics are the primary sources of information. Nevertheless, risk assessment should produce such information for senior executives of the organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized within overall company goals. Thus, there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks. Numerous different risk formulae exist, but perhaps the most widely accepted formula for <b>risk</b> <b>quantification</b> is: [...] "Rate (or probability) of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event equals risk magnitude." ...|$|E

30|$|Application of CNTs as an {{electrode}} for biosensors is comparably safe to use. There {{is little}} chance of direct water contact with the CNT electrode. However, a few risk measurements can be followed. Firstly, 1 D CNTs are often combined with 2 D NMs, especially graphene for high electroconductivity and mechanical flexibility. Such superstructures have different physicochemical properties [45] and pose different environmental hazards which should be measured with caution. Secondly, poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)-functionalized CNTs are very common in electrochemical biosensors. CNTs-PDDA is harmful since the polymer has influenced cell viability and haemolysis [46]. Finally, biomolecules such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), aptamers, enzymes and proteins have been widely immobilized onto CNTs for sensing organic, inorganic and biological water pollutants. The preferable immobilization method of these biomolecules is physical adsorption rather than covalent modifications {{in order to maintain}} the CNT’s integrity and biomolecule’s conformations that lead to high electrical conductivity. However, such system is not stable and durable since biomolecules leached from the system are often toxic to humans. Therefore, the quality of a biosensor and its <b>risk</b> <b>quantifications</b> are completely dependent on strategies taken to produce the final product.|$|R

40|$|Risks and {{uncertainties}} are inevitable in engineering projects and infrastructure investments. Decisions about investment in infrastructure such as for maintenance, rehabilitation and construction works can pose risks, and may generate significant impacts on social, cultural, environmental {{and other related}} issues. This report {{presents the results of}} a literature review of current practice in identifying, quantifying and managing risks and predicting impacts as part of the planning and assessment process for infrastructure investment proposals. In assessing proposals for investment in infrastructure, it is necessary to consider social, cultural and environmental risks and impacts to the overall community, as well as financial risks to the investor. The report defines and explains the concept of risk and uncertainty, and describes the three main methodology approaches to the analysis of risk and uncertainty in investment planning for infrastructure, viz examining a range of scenarios or options, sensitivity analysis, and a statistical probability approach, listed here in order of increasing merit and complexity. Forecasts of costs, benefits and community impacts of infrastructure are recognised as central aspects of developing and assessing investment proposals. Increasingly complex modelling techniques are being used for investment evaluation. The literature review identified forecasting errors as the major cause of risk. The report contains a summary of the broad nature of decision-making tools used by governments and other organisations in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and North America, and shows their overall approach to risk assessment in assessing public infrastructure proposals. While there are established techniques to quantify financial and economic <b>risks,</b> <b>quantification</b> is far less developed for political, social and environmental risks and impacts. The report contains a summary of the broad nature of decision-making tools used by governments and other organisations in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and North America, and shows their overall approach to risk assessment in assessing public infrastructure proposals. While there are established techniques to quantify financial and economic <b>risks,</b> <b>quantification</b> is far less developed for political, social and environmental risks and impacts. For risks that cannot be readily quantified, assessment techniques commonly include classification or rating systems for likelihood and consequence. The report outlines the system used by the Australian Defence Organisation and in the Australian Standard on risk management. After each risk is identified and quantified or rated, consideration can be given to reducing the risk, and managing any remaining risk as part of the scope of the project. The literature review identified use of risk mapping techniques by a North American chemical company and by the Australian Defence Organisation.

40|$|Background: Time series {{analysis}} {{is suitable for}} investigations of relatively direct and short-term effects of exposures on outcomes. In environmental epidemiology studies, this method {{has been one of}} the standard approaches to assess impacts of environmental factors on acute non-infectious diseases (e. g. cardiovascular deaths), with conventionally generalized linear or additive models (GLM and GAM). However, the same analysis practices are often observed with infectious diseases despite of the substantial differences from non-infectious diseases that may result in analytical challenges. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, systematic review was conducted to elucidate important issues in assessing the associations between environmental factors and infectious diseases using time series analysis with GLM and GAM. Published studies on the associations between weather factors and malaria, cholera, dengue, and influenza were targeted. Findings: Our review raised issues regarding the estimation of susceptible population and exposure lag times, the adequacy of seasonal adjustments, the presence of strong autocorrelations, and the lack of a smaller observation time unit of outcomes (i. e. daily data). These concerns may be attributable to features specific to infectious diseases, such as transmission among individuals and complicated causal mechanisms. Conclusion: The consequence of not taking adequate measures to address these issues is distortion of the appropriate <b>risk</b> <b>quantifications</b> of exposures factors. Future studies should pay careful attention to details and examine alternative models or methods that improve studies using time series regression analysis for environmental determinants of infectious diseases...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{possible}} health <b>risks,</b> <b>quantification</b> of mercury accumulation in humans {{was included in}} the Flemish biomonitoring programmes FLEHS I (2002 - 2006) and FLEHS II (2007 - 2011). The general objective of FLEHS I was to assess regional exposure levels in order to link possible differences in these internal exposure levels to different types of local environmental pressure. Therefore, Hg and MMHg (methylmercury) were only measured in pooled blood samples per region and per age class. In FLEHS II, mercury concentrations were measured in hair of each participant. About 200 adolescents and 250 mothers (reference group) and two times 200 adolescents (2 hotspots) were screened. The main objectives of the FLEHS II study were: (1) to determine reference levels of mercury in hair for Flanders; (2) to assess relations between mercury exposure and possible sources like fish consumption; (3) to assess dose-effect relations between mercury exposure and health effect markers. The results showed that mercury concentrations in the Flemish population were rather low compared to other studies. Mercury levels in the Flemish populations were strongly related to the age of the participants and consumption of fish. Significant negative associations were observed between mercury in hair and asthma, having received breast feeding as a newborn, age at menarche in girls, allergy for animals and free testosterone levels.
