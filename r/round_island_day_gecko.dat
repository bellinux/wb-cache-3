50|$|The 4180 ha park {{comprises}} the south-easternmost headland of the island. it is 4 km long {{with a sharp}} ridge rising to 233 m and is vegetated with dry shrubland and thicket containing baobabs. It overlaps with the 1600 ha Mlima Choungui and Sazilé Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Comoro olive-pigeons, Comoro blue-pigeons, Mayotte white-eyes, Mayotte sunbirds and red-headed fodies. It {{is also home to}} Robert Mertens' <b>day</b> <b>geckos,</b> <b>island</b> <b>day</b> <b>geckos</b> and Pasteur's <b>day</b> <b>geckos.</b> Its beaches are a nesting site for green, and probably hawksbill, sea turtles.|$|R

50|$|Choungui {{dominates the}} {{southern}} peninsula of the island. Its south-easternmost headland, Sazilé, is 4 km long {{with a sharp}} ridge rising to 233 m. Forest covers the peak {{and most of the}} catchment of the Mroni Bé river, while Sazilé is vegetated with dry shrubland and thickets containing baobabs. The 1600 ha site has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of Comoro olive-pigeons, Comoro blue-pigeons, Mayotte white-eyes, Mayotte sunbirds and red-headed fodies. It is also home to Robert Mertens' <b>day</b> <b>geckos,</b> <b>island</b> <b>day</b> <b>geckos</b> and Pasteur's <b>day</b> <b>geckos.</b> Sazilé’s beaches are a nesting site for green, and probably hawksbill, sea turtles.|$|R
50|$|Benara forms {{part of the}} massif {{that dominates}} south-central Mayotte. The upper slopes of the {{mountain}} rise steeply to a triangular peak. Ridges extend 4 km west to the subordinate peaks of Tchaourembo (581 m), Ngouni Maboungani (510 m), and 4 km east to Trambatsini (297 m). The area down to an elevation of about 200 m, which is typically the upper limit of cultivation on the island, contains what is probably the second largest expanse of forest on Mayotte. It {{has been identified as}} an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Comoro olive-pigeons, Comoro blue-pigeons, Mayotte drongos, Mayotte white-eyes and Mayotte sunbirds. It is also home to Robert Mertens' <b>day</b> <b>geckos,</b> <b>island</b> <b>day</b> <b>geckos</b> and Pasteur's <b>day</b> <b>geckos.</b>|$|R
5|$|The park's fauna {{includes}} notably several endemic {{bird species}}, such as Barau's petrel, the Réunion harrier, and the Réunion cuckooshrike. In total, 18 bird species are found at Réunion, {{half of which}} are endemic. At least 22 bird species have already gone extinct since human colonisation. A major threat to the bird fauna are introduced cats and rats. Of mammals, the Mauritian flying fox recolonised the Réunion after going extinct from the island. Notable butterfly species include Papilio phorbanta and Salamis augustina, and an endemic reptile is the Reunion <b>Island</b> <b>day</b> <b>gecko.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Important Bird Area (IBA) {{consists}} of a forested mountain massif dominated by the peaks of Combani (477 m) and Mtsapéré (572 m). The peaks are connected by a ridge that does not drop below an elevation of 320 m. The terrain is undulating, with steep slopes around Mtsapéré. The IBA includes most land above 200 m, excluding cultivation around the towns of Combani and Vahibéni. The area contains the largest remaining tract of forest on Mayotte. It was identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Comoro olive-pigeons, Comoro blue-pigeons, Mayotte white-eyes, Mayotte sunbirds and Mayotte drongos. It is home to Robert Mertens' <b>day</b> <b>geckos,</b> <b>island</b> <b>day</b> <b>geckos</b> and Pasteur's <b>day</b> <b>geckos</b> {{as well as the}} butterflies Charaxes saperanus, Culapa mayottensis and Neptis mayottensis.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{symbiotic}} relationship, the Agalega <b>Island</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Gecko</b> (Phelsuma borbonica agalegae) feeds off the insects {{trapped in the}} viscous, though thin, sap while depostiting its vitamin-rich droppings {{at the base of}} the tree. Though this may seem to more resemble commensalism than not, the droppings do in fact provide a registrable gain for the cheval tree, though it is not nearly as great as the free and ample sustenance gained by the gecko. Scientists have yet to come up with a satisfactory explanation for this strange [...] "selflessness" [...] on the cheval's behalf, and have set up a research station in the Agalega town of Vingt Cinq for further study.|$|R
50|$|Assumption Island {{was once}} {{home to a}} great {{diversity}} of seabirds, including the Abbott's booby, which is now confined to a single breeding island: Christmas Island, in the eastern Indian Ocean. Efforts are now underway by the Seychelles Islands Foundation, in conjunction with Island Conservation Society and the Islands Development Company, to restore the habitat of the island. The first successful step in this process was the removal of invasive, introduced bird species, Madagascar fody and red-whiskered bulbul.A notable feature of this island is the Assumption <b>Island</b> <b>day</b> <b>gecko,</b> a subspecies of gecko found only on this island. An endemic race of souimanga sunbird once breaded on the island, called Abbott's Booby.The nature documentary of Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle, The Silent World was partially shot on Assumption. The island {{is known for its}} rich fish life.|$|R

50|$|Narcondam {{is a tiny}} {{volcanic}} island, {{not connected}} to land mass, terrestrial mammalian fauna is absent. However, Nicobar Flying Fox Pteropus faunulus and Narcondam Small Flying Fox Pteropus hypomelanus {{are the most common}} mammals on this island. Among reptiles, Andaman Dwarf Gecko Cnemaspis kandiana, widely distributed in Andaman and Malay Archipelago, is also found on Narcondam <b>Island.</b> The Andaman <b>Day</b> <b>Gecko</b> Phelsuma andamanense, is also restricted in distribution to the Andaman group (Daniel 2002). The Common Amphibious Sea Snake Laticauda laticaudata, confined to the Bay of Bengal and Nicobar Island, is seen here, while the Andaman Water Monitor Varanus salvator andamanensis is the only large predator on the island and is a threat to the Narcondam Hornbill, especially its young ones.As Narcondam Island is remote and difficult to reach, there have been only eight visits by ornithologists to date: Osmaston (1905), Baker (1927), Abdulali (1971,1974), Hussain (1984), Vijayan and Sankaran, (2000) and Yahya and Zarri (2000, 2002a).|$|R
