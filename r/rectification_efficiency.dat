But due to fabrication difficulties, two decades passed before the first device could be successfully created. Some of the very first MIM diodes to be fabricated came from Bell labs in the late 60s and early 70's Brinkman et al. demonstrated the first zero-bias MIM tunneling diode with significant responsivity. When they are using tunneling transport, the MIM diode can be very fast. As soon as 1974, this diode was reportedly used as a mixer at 88THz in a setup of the National Institute of Standard and Technology.

The diode concept utilizes terminals made of the same material supporting surface polariton modes in the infrared, but with dissimilar structures. The specific diode design analyzed in this Letter involves a thin film and a bulk, both made of 3 C silicon carbide, separated by a subwavelength vacuum gap. High <b>rectification</b> <b>efficiency</b> is obtained by tuning the antisymmetric resonant modes of the thin film, resulting from surface phonon-polariton coupling, on- and off-resonance with the resonant mode of the bulk {{as a function of}} the temperature bias direction. <b>Rectification</b> <b>efficiency</b> is investigated by varying structural parameters, namely the vacuum gap size, the dielectric function of the substrate onto which the film is coated, and the film thickness to gap size ratio.

By developing a wide DC/DC converter platform based on the DPA-Switch(tm), many advantages are gained.

We demonstrate that nitrogen-doped carbon nanodot (N-CD) interlayer improves electrical and luminescent properties of QD-LEDs. The N-CDs were prepared by solution-based bottom up synthesis and were inserted as a hole transport layer (HTL) between other multilayer HTL heterojunction and the red-QD layer. The QD-LEDs with N-CD interlayer represented superior electrical <b>rectification</b> and electroluminescent <b>efficiency</b> than those without the N-CD interlayer. The insertion of N-CD layer was found to provoke the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from N-CD to QD layer, as confirmed by time-integrated and - resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Moreover, hole-only devices (HODs) with N-CD interlayer presented high hole transport capability, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy also revealed that the N-CD interlayer reduced the highest hole barrier height. Thus, more balanced carrier injection with sufficient hole carrier transport feasibly lead to the superior electrical and electroluminescent properties of the QD-LEDs with N-CD interlayer. We further studied effect of N-CD interlayer thickness on electrical and luminescent performances for high-brightness QD-LEDs.

Such energy level variation of PVK is discussed in terms of heterointerfacial orbital hybridization at PVK/V 2 O 5 - x, which are validated by diverse spectroscopies.

40|$|Graphene, a {{two-dimensional}} hexagonal carbon lattice, {{is a promising material}} for future electronics. High carrier mobility is viable through the two-dimensional plane {{and the true}} atomic thick layer enables to be transparency and flexiblility. The property is unique and never found before in other materials. A sp 2 -hybridized bonding in a lattice leads graphene to have physical strength that is about 100 times higher than steel. Its physical property is sustained while graphene is deformed. This is the reason why the graphene has been most attractive for electronics since it discovered in 2004.   In this thesis, several different sources of graphene are introduced and investigated towards device applications. Among the sources ever known, graphene prepared on transition metal by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is most popular since the method yields a uniform singlelayer without a size limit. For fast and cost-effective synthesis of graphene, photo-thermal CVD (PTCVD) was further developed by investigating the process conditions and parameters, such as, the flow rate of precursor gases, pressure, time, and temperature. Particularly, influence of growth temperature on the graphene quality was further examined. As a result, synthesis of high quality single-layer graphene was achieved on copper at 935 - 950 °C in about 60 s. The quality of graphene was preliminarily determined by scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Employing the CVD graphene, field-effect devices were fabricated and characterized at room temperature. With the control of the gate, highly tunable and switchable devices performing as a rectifier and an inverter were demonstrated. Remarkably, the device exhibiting full-wave rectification for 100 kHz of the AC input was presented utilizing three-terminal T-branch junction (TBJ). By applying the same CVD graphene layer to the gate electrode, transparent functionality through the device structure was additionally achieved.

The output of the cascaded structure was displayed as clear rectification without any external gate.

40|$|The {{mass and}} volume {{required}} for power electronics circuitry is a dominant {{obstacle to the}} miniaturization and integration of many systems. Likewise, power electronics with greater bandwidth and efficiency are becoming vital in many applications. To realize smaller and highly responsive power electronics at low voltages, this thesis explores devices, circuits, and passives capable of operating efficiently at very high frequencies (VHF, 30 - 300 MHz). Operation at these frequencies enables reduction of the numerical values and physical size of the passive components that dominate power converters, and enables increased bandwidth and transient performance which is valuable in a multitude of low-voltage and low-power applications. This thesis explores the scaling of magnetic component size with frequency, and it is shown that substantial miniaturization is possible with increased frequencies even considering material and heat transfer limitations. Moreover, the impact of frequency scaling of power converters on magnetic components is investigated for different design criteria. Quantitative examples of magnetics scaling are provided that clearly demonstrate the benefits and opportunities in VHF magnetics design. It is shown to utilize the advantages of frequency scaling on passive component size that system losses and other limitations must be considered. One such area that is examined is semiconductor device requirements, where {{through a combination of}} device layout optimization for cascode structures and integrated gate drive designs on a 0. 35 -um CMOS process, converter performance (i. e., loss and bandwidth) can be significantly improved in the VHF regime. In this thesis a dc-dc converter topology is developed that is suitable for low-voltage power conversion and employs synchronous <b>rectification</b> to improve <b>efficiency.</b> The converter is also comprised of a high-bandwidth and high-switching-frequency inverter topology that can dynamically adjust the output power from one-quarter to full power, while maintaining good efficiency. Furthermore, with its inherent capability of gate-width switching, the inverter can further reduce gating loss by one-half resulting in substantial performance improvements at light load operation. A major contribution of this thesis is the development of a synchronous rectifier operating in the VHF regime. VHF power conversion is especially challenging at low voltages due to poor <b>efficiency</b> resulting from <b>rectification</b> loss. To overcome diode rectification loss, the benefits of synchronous rectification are discussed {{in the context of a}} 100 MHz class-E resonant rectifier, which results in a 2. 5 x overall converter efficiency improvement.

40|$|The quantum {{oscillations}} of the {{dc voltage}} are induced on segments of asymmetric superconducting loops by an external ac current or noise. The dependencies of the amplitude of the quantum oscillations on amplitude of inducing ac current are measured at different temperatures below superconducting transition Tc on aluminum asymmetric loops and systems of the loops connected in series. The measured values of the maximum amplitude of the quantum oscillations, the amplitude of the ac current inducing this maximum dc voltage and the critical amplitude of the ac current decrease with temperature increase to Tc. The extrapolation of these measured dependencies to the region near superconducting transition allows to make a calibration of asymmetric superconducting loops as quantum detector of noise. The calibration restores an amplitude profile of the noise pulses from a measured temperature dependence of an amplitude of the quantum oscillations induced by this noise. It is found that <b>rectification</b> <b>efficiency,</b> determined as relation of the maximum amplitude of the quantum oscillations to the ac current amplitude inducing it, decreases near superconducting transition Tc.

40|$|The {{quantum dot}} arrays (QDAs) {{embedded}} into inhomogeneous nanowires connected to metallic electrodes show an electron heat rectification effect, which {{is attributed to}} the thermal voltage arising from a temperature bias and the QDA with a broken spatial inversion symmetry. The staircase energy levels of QDAs can be controlled to the resonant and off resonant transports for electrons in the forward and backward temperature biases, respectively. The effect of electron Coulomb interactions on the <b>rectification</b> <b>efficiency</b> of heat diode is clarified by the case of double QDs. We find {{that it is important}} to reduce phonon heat currents for implementing a high efficient electron heat diode at high temperature. Comment: 5 pages and 6 figure...|$|E
