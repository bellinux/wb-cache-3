50|$|Considering the {{majority}} of casualties in both Iraq and Afghanistan {{in terms of the}} Global War on Terror were from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), the need for surveillance has increased with their increased use. In a move to counter this threat and lower the effectiveness of IEDs, the US Marine Corps directed the creation of a persistent surveillance system to identify and counter threats to security of military installations. The Marines requested the system be fielded as soon as possible. The result of this request was the development of the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System ready for rapid deployment to theater.The G-BOSS provides the command operations center with a round-the-clock display and tracking of items of interest through the use of high resolution night and day cameras. The cameras are integrated with enhanced target recognition and radar systems used to increase the ability to detect moving targets. The G-BOSS allows personnel to counter insurgent activities with an emphasis of disrupting placement of improvised explosive devices. The G-BOSS enhances situational awareness by allowing personnel to monitor activities {{in the vicinity of the}} military installation. Common places of surveillance include the gates, along the roads, borders, rivers, pipelines, and chokepoints, among other areas of responsibility and interest. The multiple towers of cameras and surveillance systems allows for 360-degree security with easily understood computer displays. Included on the computer displays are alarms and assessment data through overlay and window pop-ups, with 24/7 network <b>running</b> <b>capability,</b> allowing reduced manpower and hours in relation to personnel on guard. The multiple camera systems have the capability of routing all into a single remote ground system.|$|E

40|$|Within the Bayesian framework, we utilize Gaussian {{processes}} for parametric studies of long running computer codes. Since the simulations are expensive, {{it is necessary}} to exploit the computational budget in the best possible manner. Employing the sum over variances —being indicators for the quality of the fit—as the utility function, we establish an optimized and automated sequential parameter selection procedure. However, it is also often desirable to utilize the parallel <b>running</b> <b>capabilities</b> of present computer technology and abandon the sequential parameter selection for a faster overall turn-around time (wall-clock time). This paper proposes to achieve this by marginalizing over the expected outcomes at optimized test points in order to set up a pool of starting values for batch execution. For a one-dimensional test case, the numerical results are validated with the analytical solution. Eventually, a systematic convergence study demonstrates the advantage of the optimized approach over randomly chosen parameter settings...|$|R

Moreover, the findings reported in the first study (of this thesis) directly challenge the practice adopted previously by researchers in this field of not considering the <b>running</b> <b>capabilities</b> of individual players when calculating their locomotive activities. The consequence of this is that for certain measures (involving speed zones), the values reported herein are a more appropriate reflection of elite players’ movement patterns than has been previously reported.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the effects of carbohydrate and caffeine ingestion on simulated rugby league interchange performance. Eight male elite rugby league forwards completed two trials of a rugby league simulation protocol for interchange players seven days apart in a randomized crossover design, ingesting either carbohydrate (CHO; 40 g·h- 1) or carbohydrate and caffeine (CHO-C) (40 g·h- 1 + 3 mg·kg- 1) drink. Movement characteristics, heart rate, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and countermovement jump height (CMJ) were measured during the protocol. CHO-C resulted in likely to very likely higher mean running speeds (ES 0. 43 to 0. 75), distance in high intensity running (ES 0. 41 to 0. 64) and mean sprint speeds (ES 0. 39 to 1. 04) compared to CHO. Heart rate was possibly to very likely higher (ES 0. 32 to 0. 74) and RPE was likely to very likely lower (ES - 0. 53 to 0. 86) with CHO-C. There was a likely trivial to possibly higher CMJ in CHO-C compared to CHO (ES 0. 07 to 0. 25).

40|$|Hereditary muscular {{hypertrophy}} is {{a character}} that has been selected in several animal species for industrial meat production. The selection of this character in cattle produces animals of exceptional commercial value but ones with a lower aerobic capacity than that of conventional cattle. The purpose of this work was to study the role of cardiac function as a potential limiting factor of aerobic capacity in double-muscled calves. Two groups of healthy calves were studied, one consisting of nine calves of conventional conformation and the other of nine double-muscled calves. Pulmonary arterial and capillary wedge, central venous, and systemic arterial pressures were measured by fluid-filled catheters and recorded together with the electrocardiogram. Cardiac output {{was measured by the}} thermodilution technique. From these measurements, the heart rate, the cardiac and the stroke indices, the pulmonary and the systemic vascular resistances, and the cardiac power output were calculated. The parameters were recorded under basal resting conditions and during incremental dobutamine challenge, which allowed determination of the resting cardiac power output, the cardiac pumping capability, and the cardiac reserve. Dobutamine challenge induced a significant rise in cardiac and stroke indices, heart rate, and cardiac power output, a significant decrease in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances, and no change in systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures. The cardiac reserve obtained {{in the present study was}} low in comparison with those previously reported in humans, dogs, and horses. This may be related to the poor <b>running</b> <b>capability</b> of bovine species relative to that of the former species.

40|$|PEBBLES is a {{code for}} {{simulating}} {{the motion of}} all the pebbles in a pebble bed reactor. Since pebble bed reactors are packed randomly and not precisely placed, {{the location of the}} fuel elements in the reactor is not deterministically known. Instead, when determining operating parameters the motion of the pebbles can be simulated and stochastic locations can be found. The PEBBLES code can output information relevant for other simulations of the pebble bed reactors such as the positions of the pebbles in the reactor, packing fraction change in an earthquake, and velocity profiles created by recirculation. The goal for this level three milestone was to speedup the PEBBLES code through implementation on massively parallel computer. Work on this goal has resulted in speeding up both the single processor version and creation of a new parallel version of PEBBLES. Both the single processor version and the parallel <b>running</b> <b>capability</b> of the PEBBLES code have improved since the fiscal year start. The hybrid MPI/OpenMP PEBBLES version was created this year to run on the increasingly common cluster hardware profile that combines nodes with multiple processors that share memory and a cluster of nodes that are networked together. The OpenMP portions use the Open Multi-Processing shared memory parallel processing model to split the task across processors in a single node that shares memory. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) portion uses messages to communicate between different nodes over a network. The following are wall clock speed up for simulating an NGNP- 600 sized reactor. The single processor version runs 1. 5 times faster compared to the single processor version {{at the beginning of the}} fiscal year. This speedup is primarily due to the improved static friction model described in the report. When running on 64 processors, the new MPI/OpenMP hybrid version has a wall clock speed up of 22 times compared to the current single processor version. When using 88 processors, a speed up of 23 times is achieved. This speedup and other improvements of PEBBLES combine to make PEBBLES more capable and more useful for simulation of a pebble bed reactor. This report details the implementation and effects of the speedup work done over the course of the fiscal year...|$|E
