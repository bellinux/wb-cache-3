2500|$|The {{feasibility}} of water savings in Egyptian agriculture was first assessed through pilot projects under the USAID-supported Egypt Water Use and Management Project (EWUP) begun in 1977. The pilots {{showed that in}} order to achieve water savings, it was important to allow farmers to participate more in irrigation management through water user associations, to provide continuous [...] flow instead of <b>rotational</b> <b>flow</b> in Mesqas, to replace individual by collective pumping, and to create an irrigation advisory service. The 1980 [...] "Strategy for Irrigation Development in Egypt up to the year 2000" [...] already envisaged the improvement of control and distribution of irrigation water as a first phase of the strategy. This was to be followed by the development of field irrigation systems and direct pricing of irrigation water. Based on the lessons of EWUP [...] and the irrigation strategy the government set out the National Irrigation Improvement Program (IIP) in 1984, which was approved by the National Assembly in 1985. Its implementation began, again with support from USAID, in eleven pilot areas, beginning with the Serri Canal with 120,000 feddan (50,400 hectares) in Minya Governorate. The project replaced the old low-lying Mesqas either with raised Mesqas, from which water would flow to the fields via gravity, or with buried pressurized pipes. The Value Engineering techniques have been used to evaluate the optimum Mesqa alternative targeting the minimum cost without affecting the quality of the alternative. By 1998 about 1,100 water user associations had been formed and systems irrigating 129,000 feddan had been modernized. The project reduced water losses, improved water quality {{at the tail end of}} mesqas, made more water available to farmers at the tail end of canals, saved land due to the smaller size of the new mesqas, reduced pumping costs by more than 50% and increased yields between 5% and 30%. Building on this success the concept of farmer participation in irrigation management was extended to branch canals with the creation of Branch Canal Water Users Association (BCWUAs) beginning in 1997 in Qemri, Bahr el Dahram and Balaqtar branch canals (Lower Egypt) and El Reity canal (Upper Egypt), as well as in Fayoum. This process was supported by two USAID-funded projects, the LIFE (Livelihood and Income from the Environment) project (2005-2008) and the Integrated Water Resources Management II project (2009-2012).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{is shown}} numerically that both {{toroidal}} and poloidal <b>rotational</b> <b>flows</b> are intrinsic to a rigid toroid confining a conducting magnetofluid {{in which a}} current {{is driven by the}} application of externally-supported electric and magnetic fields. The computation involves no microscopic instabilities or kinetic theory and is purely magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) in nature. The properties and intensity of the rotations are regulated by dimensionless numbers (Lundquist, viscous Lundquist, and Hartmann) that contain the resistivity and viscosity of the magnetofluid. The computation makes use of the recently developed “penalization method ” to enforce visco-resistive boundary conditions. The point is not that other more exotic kinetic effects may not also contribute to rotational effects in toroidal laboratory devices, but rather that at the most simple magnetohydrodynamic level (uniform mass density and incompressible magnetofluids), they are not necessary. <b>Rotational</b> <b>flows</b> are an irreducible effect inherent in toroidal, driven MHD by itself, without necessary kinetic complications.
