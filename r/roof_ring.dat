40|$|Acetabular {{revision}} of failed cages or rings may be facilitated by previously placed bone graft, enabling {{the use of}} highly porous cementless hemispheric cups. We retrospectively reviewed all 15 patients who had conversion of failed antiprotrusion cages (10 patients) or <b>roof</b> <b>rings</b> (five patients) to cementless cups. All patients had restoration of bone stock (three major column, eight morselized, four combined bone grafts) performed in conjunction with their index cage or ring reconstruction arthroplasty. The minimum followup was 24  months (average, 48. 3  months; range, 24 – 72  months). Failure was defined as radiographic cup migration. In 12 of the 15 patients, there was no radiographic change in cup position at the last followup or symptoms indicative of loosening. The average Harris hip scores improved from 31 (range, 15 – 48) to 69 (range, 56 – 87) at latest followup. Cup failure occurred in three patients. In two patients, the failed cups were revised; the third patient refused additional surgery. Our experience suggests treatment of failed cages by highly porous cementless cups is a reasonable option. However, we recommend patients be followed closely to detect cup migration, which can occur until satisfactory bony ingrowth occurs...|$|R
5000|$|The 1985 repairs were {{necessitated by}} a {{collapse}} of the original 1975 roof around noon EST on March 4, 1985. Heavy, wet snow accumulated on {{the southwest corner of}} the dome and depressed the fabric panels low enough so that the fabric came in contact with a steel lighting catwalk that was positioned just below the inner lip of the <b>roof's</b> <b>ring</b> beam. The hole caused a loss of air pressure and the Dome deflated slowly - there were no injuries. The shift from a [...] "dome" [...] to [...] "bowl" [...] caused all the heavy, wet snow to slide down into the bowl and rupture more roof panels, collapse some precast risers in the SW upper deck, and dislodge more plastic seats [...] "... than a Rolling Stones concert" [...] according to Bob Haney, the Dome's Operations Manager. Crews from Owens-Corning Fiberglas, the dome's original roof installer, were on site by 1:30 pm on March 4. Repair operations began immediately but were interrupted for over a week due to high winds. During the high winds event nearly all of the remaining panels in the deflated roof, 100 in all, were badly damaged. The decision was made to replace the entire roof and incorporate some improvements to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. Repair cost of the roof was just under $8 million.|$|R

6000|$|The second {{appearance}} of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after {{they had gone to}} bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old armour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone floor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost, rubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The twins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged two pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained by long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United States Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in accordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost started up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a mist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so leaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase he recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter. This he had {{on more than one occasion}} found extremely useful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single night, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French governesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly laughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted <b>roof</b> <b>rang</b> and rang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door opened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. [...] "I am afraid you are far from well," [...] she said, [...] "and have brought you a bottle of Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a most excellent remedy." [...] The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at once to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's uncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps, however, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep churchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.|$|R

6000|$|Floppart at {{this moment}} turned the flow of his meditations by making a final and desperate {{struggle}} to be free. She shot {{out of his pocket}} and dropped with a bursting yell on the pavement. Recovering her feet before Bones recovered from his surprise she fled. Thought is quick as the lightning-flash. Bones knew that dogs find their way home mysteriously from any distance. He knew himself to be unable to run down Floppart. He saw his schemes thwarted. He adopted a mean device, shouted [...] "Mad dog!" [...] and rushed after it. A small errand-boy shrieked with glee, flung his basket at it, and followed up the chase. Floppart took round by St. Paul's Churchyard. However sane she might have been at starting, it is certain that she was mad with terror in five minutes. She threaded her way among wheels and legs at full speed in perfect safety. It was afterwards estimated that seventeen cabmen, four gentlemen, two apple-women, three-and-twenty errand-boys--more or less,--and one policeman, flung umbrellas, sticks, baskets, and various missiles at her, with the effect of damaging innumerable shins and overturning many individuals, but without hurting a hair of Floppart's body during her wild but brief career. Bones did not wish to recapture her. He wished her dead, and for that end loudly reiterated the calumny as to madness. Floppart circled round the grand cathedral erected by Wren and got into Cheapside. Here, doubling like a hare, she careered round the statue of Peel and went blindly back to St. Martin's-le-Grand, as if to add yet another link to the chain of fate which bound her arch-pursuer to the General Post-Office. By way of completing the chain, she turned in at the gate, rushed to the rear of the building, dashed in at an open door, and scurried along a passage. Here the crowd was stayed, but the policeman followed heroically. The passage was cut short by a glass door, but a narrow staircase descended to the left. [...] "Any port in a storm" [...] is a proverb as well known among dogs as men. Down went Floppart to the basement of the building, invading the sanctity of the letter-carriers' kitchen or salle-a-manger. A dozen stalwart postmen leaped from their meals to rush at the intruder. In the midst of the confusion the policeman's truncheon was seen to sway aloft. Next instant the vaulted <b>roof</b> <b>rang</b> with a terrible cry, which truth compels us to state was Floppart's dying yell.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} {{in patients}} with developmental dysplasia of the hip can be a complex procedure due to acetabular and proximal femoral deformities. Presentation of case: A 59 -year-old male patient underwent a total hip arthroplasty {{for the treatment of}} end-stage dysplastic osteoarthritis. A <b>roof</b> reinforcement <b>ring,</b> a cemented polyethylene cup, and a cementless stem were used. A portion of the superior rim of the ring was uncovered by the host bone. Morsellized autogenous femoral-head graft was impacted to fill the space between the superior rim of the ring and the superior part of the dysplastic acetabulum. At the follow-up after 5 -years, the patient had no complaints and was very satisfied with the operation result. The hip radiograph revealed no signs of instability of the acetabular component, and no bone graft resorption. Discussion: Favorable results were described using metal rings and conical femoral stems for the treatment of the developmental dysplasia of the hip. The superior rim of the metal ring should be against host bone for 60 % of its support. Despite the suboptimal implantation of the ring compromising, apparently, mechanical stability of the arthroplasty, the outcome was favorable. Conclusion: This result can be supported by the good fixation of the metal ring to the pelvis with screws, the adequate orientation of both components of the total hip arthroplasty, and the bone graft incorporation...|$|R
5000|$|The railway only carried {{first and}} second class passengers, and each class had its own booking hall and waiting room. As the station was some {{distance}} from the centre of Manchester, most passengers purchased a handwritten ticket from an agent at an inn or hotel. Several routes of horse omnibuses then conveyed them to the station. A clerk in the booking hall exchanged the ticket for a counterfoil (similar to a modern airline boarding pass), and made up a waybill from the ticket information for the train guard. (The train guard thus had a passenger list indicating class of travel and destination, the only check against fraud.) The passengers proceeded upstairs to the waiting room, and licensed [...] "outdoor porters" [...] took charge of their luggage, being paid a set scale of fees. [...] "Indoor porters" [...] took charge of the luggage on the station platform and strapped it to the carriage <b>roofs.</b> The <b>ringing</b> of the station bell then announced that the passengers could go through the door on to the platform and board the train. The bell was also rung as a warning of departure, but the actual signal was given by the guard's trumpet or horn. The original bell is still exhibited in the station building. The planning of railway stations was clearly not so advanced at this time as supporting pillars of the building prevented certain carriage doors from opening fully.|$|R
5000|$|Astley did not invent trick-riding, {{which was}} already a popular {{entertainment}} of the period. His invention of the circular arena was successful for two reasons. First, {{it was easier for}} the audience to keep the riders in sight. Second, the circular ring (though Astley called it 'the Ride') helped riders through the generation of centrifugal force, which allowed them to keep their balance while standing on the backs of their galloping horses. Astley never called his 'Astley's Amphitheatre of Equestrian Arts' a circus, as that title was thought up by Charles Dibdin, who in partnership with Astley's rival Charles Hughes, opened the Royal Circus on 4 November 1782, a short distance from Astley's in Lambeth, London.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} - Porous {{tantalum}} cups {{have been introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} various reinforcement rings in revision hip surgery. We hypothesized that porous tantalum cups would be superior to muller acetabular <b>roof</b> reinforcement <b>rings</b> (MARRs) in revision hip surgery with re-revision for aseptic loosening as the primary outcome measure. Patients and methods - 207 hips operated with either a porous tantalum cup (TM cup, n = 111) or a MARR (n = 96) at index procedure were identified in our local arthroplasty register. Acetabular defects were classified according to Paprosky. There were 96 men and 111 women with a median age of 71 (35 - 95) years, presenting acetabular defect size type I in 39 cases, IIA in 22, IIB in 27, IIC in 43, IIIA in 32, and IIIB in 37 cases. Analysis of medical records identified all patients with subsequent re-revision and reasons for re-revisions. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were used to estimate implant survival. Results - With re-revision for aseptic loosening as the end-point, the 6 -year unadjusted cumulative survival was 97 % (95 % CI: 94 - 100) for TM cups and 96 % (CI: 92 - 100) for MARR (p = 0. 6). Using re-revision for any reason as the endpoint, 6 -year survival was 87 % (CI: 81 - 94) for TM cups and 95 % (CI: 90 - 99) for MARR (p = 0. 06). The main reason for re-revision in the TM group was dislocation (n = 10), followed by loosening (n = 3), whereas the main reason for re-revision in the MARR group was aseptic loosening (n = 8). Duration of the index procedure and perioperative blood loss were lower in the TM group. Interpretation - Both TM and MARR lead to good 6 -year results in acetabular revision surgery. The methods differ in their respective failure mechanisms. We conclude that TM cups are a valuable treatment option in acetabular revision surgery, but the reasons underlying dislocations after the use of TM cups must be analyzed further...|$|R
60|$|The clerks' {{house now}} became crammed. The quiet, elderly folks, who had {{continued}} to fret at its noisy occupants, fled in despair to another house, and thereby left room for the newcomers--or greenhorns, as they were elegantly styled by their more knowing fellow-clerks. Now, indeed, {{the corner of the}} fort in which we lived was avoided by all quiet people as if it were smitten with the plague; while the loud laugh, uproarious song, and sounds of the screeching flute or scraping fiddle, issued from the open doors and windows, frightening away the very mosquitoes, and making <b>roof</b> and rafters <b>ring.</b> Suddenly a dead silence would ensue; and then it was conjectured by the knowing ones of the place that Mr Polly was coming out strong {{for the benefit of the}} new arrivals. Mr Polly had a pleasant way of getting the green ones round him, and, by detailing some of the wild scenes and incidents of his voyages in the Saskatchewan, of leading them on from truth to exaggeration, and from that to fanciful composition, wherein he would detail, with painful minuteness, all the horrors of Indian warfare, and the improbability of any one who entered those dreadful regions ever returning alive.|$|R

40|$|Users of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) {{are being}} {{affected}} by diurnal {{motion of the}} synchrotron's storage ring, which undergoes structural changes due to outdoor temperature fluctuations. In order to minimize the effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations, especially on the vertical motion of the ring floor, scientists at SSRL tried three approaches: painting the storage ring white, covering the asphalt {{in the middle of}} the ring with highly reflective Mylar and installing Mylar on a portion of the <b>ring</b> <b>roof</b> and walls. Vertical motion in the storage ring is measured by a Hydrostatic Leveling System (HLS), which calculates the relative height of water in a pipe that extends around the ring. The 24 -hr amplitude of the floor motion was determined using spectral analysis of HLS data, and the ratio of this amplitude before and after each experiment was used to quantitatively determine the efficacy of each approach. The results of this analysis showed that the Mylar did not have any significant effect on floor motion, although the whitewash project did yield a reduction in overall HLS variation of 15 percent. However, further analysis showed that the reduction can largely be attributed to a few local changes rather than an overall reduction in floor motion around the ring. Future work will consist of identifying and selectively insulating these local regions in order to find the driving force behind diurnal floor motion in the storage ring...|$|R
