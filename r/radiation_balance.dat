This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O3). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the Earth's <b>radiation</b> <b>balance.</b> Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly {{fall to the ground}} as acid rain. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles.|$|E
25|$|As Huygens was {{primarily}} an atmospheric mission, the DISR instrument was optimized {{to study the}} <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> inside Titan's atmosphere. Its visible and infrared spectrometers and violet photometers measured the up- and downward radiant flux from an altitude of 145 kilometers down to the surface. Solar aureole cameras measured how scattering by aerosols varies the intensity directly around the Sun. Three imagers, sharing the same CCD, periodically imaged a swath of around 30 degrees wide, ranging from almost nadir to just above the horizon. Aided by the slowly spinning probe they would build up a full mosaic of the landing site, which, surprisingly, became clearly visible only below 25 kilometers altitude. All measurements were timed by aid of a shadow bar, which would tell DISR when the Sun had passed through the field of view. Unfortunately, this scheme was upset {{by the fact that}} Huygens rotated in a direction opposite to that expected. Just before landing a lamp was switched on to illuminate the surface, which enabled measurements of the surface reflectance at wavelengths which are completely blocked out by atmospheric methane absorption.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{physical}} climatology {{research from}} North American alpine tundra environments is summarized and directions {{for further research}} suggested. Despite a rather limited database, the essential themes in the physical climatology of alpine tundra are understood. With numerous permutations of slope angle, azimuth and surface types in the alpine zone, generalizations of alpine tundra <b>radiation</b> and energy <b>balances</b> are hard to define. Several aspects of the alpine tundra radiation budget {{are very similar to}} nonalpine ones, such as the controls exerted on net radiation by atmospheric and surface conditions, and the strong relation between global solar radiation and net radiation. The larger inputs of solar radiation experienced at high altitudes are typically offset by the moderating effects of orographic clouds. Turbulent energy flux partitioning is dependent upon both the effects of macroscale weather and microscale variations in surface soil moisture. Evaporation regimes tend to be moisture-limiting in the dry tundra and energy-limiting in wetter alpine/ subalpine meadows, but there are also significant season-to-season variations. Theory suggests that the surface heterogeneity common to the alpine zone must at times stimulate vigourous horizontal heat advection at a wide range of spatial scales, but the true significance of this process remains almost entirely undocumented. Suggested future research directions include analyses of the spatial variations of albedo, the role of sloping surfaces, and the relative importance of atmospheric and surface controls on the energy balance.

50|$|Normally, when a planet's <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> is perturbed (e.g., by {{increasing}} the amount of sunlight it gets or changing the greenhouse concentration, see Radiative Forcing) it will transition to a new temperature until a stabilizing feedback known as the Stefan-Boltzmann response restores an equilibrium between the amount of energy the body absorbs and that which it emits. For example, if the Earth received more sunlight it would result in a temporary disequilibrium (more energy in than out) and result in warming. However, because the Stefan-Boltzmann response mandates that this hotter planet emits more energy, eventually a new <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> can be reached and the temperature will be maintained at its new, higher value.|$|E

All initial and prescribed boundary conditions were kept identical for all integrations, except the land cover changes. The results show that {{during the dry season}} the post-deforestation decrease in root depth {{plays an important role in}} radiation budget, since there is less soil moisture available for evapotranspiration. In both the scenarios (b) and (c), the downward component of the surface solar radiation decreased due to an increase in the cloud cover over deforested areas, which contributed to even further reduction of the net radiation absorbed at the surface. The cloud mechanism, where an increase in albedo is balanced by an increase in downward solar radiation, was not detected in any of these scenarios. Pages: 6573 - 657...|$|R

40|$|The {{divergence}} {{of horizontal}} radiation in vegetation canopies {{is generally considered}} to be of negligible consequence in algorithms designed for the physically-based interpretation of space borne observations. However, non-zero horizontal <b>radiation</b> <b>balances</b> are likely to occur if the internal variability of a vegetation target and the typical distances that photons may travel horizontally within such three-dimensional (3 -D) media extend to spatial scales that are similar to or larger than those of the nominal footprint of the measuring sensor.

Based on these simulations it is possible to identify a fine spatial resolution limit beyond which pixel-based interpretations of remote sensing data over tall forested areas should be avoided because the horizontal radiation transport at the surface may contribute to 10 % or more of the measured reflectance signature of the target pixel.
