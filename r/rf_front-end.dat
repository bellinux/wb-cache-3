40|$|The {{objective}} of the research presented in this dissertation is to explore the achievable dynamic range limits in high-performance <b>RF</b> <b>front-ends</b> designed using SiGe HBTs, {{with a focus on}} complementary (npn + pnp) SiGe technologies.

30|$|The efficiency-linearity {{trade-off}} is a {{very challenging}} aspect {{in the design of}} radiofrequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>front-ends</b> in modern communication systems [1, 2]. Many techniques have been proposed to improve the efficiency of the power stages in the wireless <b>RF</b> <b>front-ends,</b> such as Doherty amplifiers [3], envelope tracking [4], or linear amplification with nonlinear components (LINC) [5 – 7]. The first one uses an active output impedance load-pulling, increasing the efficiency without compromising the maximum output power. The envelope tracking technique may enable the RF power amplifier (PA) to be operated continuously in the compression region, obtaining an improvement in the power efficiency. The LINC technique can achieve linear amplification while using very nonlinear and power-efficient amplifiers by means of two-phase modulated signals with a constant envelope.|$|R

50|$|IQ {{imbalance}} is a performance-limiting {{issue in}} the design of direct conversion receivers, also known as zero intermediate frequency (IF) or homodyne receivers. Such a design translates the received radio frequency (RF, or passband) signal directly from the carrier frequency (fc) to baseband using only one mixing stage. The traditional heterodyne receiver structure needs an intermediate-frequency (IF) stage between the RF and baseband signals. The direct conversion receiver structure does not have an IF stage, and does not need an image rejection filter. Due to the lower component count, it is easier to integrate. However, a direct-conversion <b>RF</b> <b>front-end</b> suffers from two major drawbacks: one is IQ imbalance and the other is DC offset. When designing a homodyne receiver, control of IQ imbalance is necessary to limit signal demodulation error.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic concept}} of this photonic-assisted all-dielectric <b>RF</b> <b>front-end</b> {{technology}} {{is shown in}} Fig. 1. The Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) in the front-end, functions as a concentrator of incoming electromagnetic field. When the electromagnetic (EM) field excites the resonance of DRA, a mode field pattern is built up inside the structure. The EO resonator is placed {{at the location of}} the peak field magnitude (Fig. 2). The EO resonator converts the received EM signal to an intensity modulated optical signal which is then carried away from the antenna front-end via an optical fiber. At the remote location, the signal is converted back to an RF signal which is then amplified and processed using conventional techniques.This front-end design significantly increases the threshold for damage associated with high power microwave signals. The lack of metal interconnects eliminates the one source of failure. In addition, the charge isolation provided by the optical link protects the electronic circuitry. Good sensitivity can be achieved due to signal enhancement provided by the microwave resonance in the DRA and optical resonance in the EO resonator. The modulating E-field (ERF) applied to the resonator should not be uniform across the disk otherwise no modulation occurs. To prevent this from happening, the EO resonator is placed off center from the symmetrical axis of DRA as shown in Fig. 2. The location of the EO resonator is chosen to coincide with the peak EM field inside the DRA, which is identified using 3-D EM simulations.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we {{investigate}} {{the estimation of}} RF impairments in a large-scale <b>RF</b> <b>front-end.</b> RF impairments in a RF system are described in [16], and the basic insight of signal processing is explained in [1, 2, 8, 9]. The first problem associated with this large scale is that {{the large number of}} RF front-ends span a wide range of RF impairment values. Due to the wide range of RF impairment values, the <b>RF</b> <b>front-end</b> is very likely to experience saturation in an estimation process when transmission power is fixed. In Section 2.1, we solve this problem by designing a method that adjusts the transmission power during the estimation procedure. The second problem is the large number of configurations in a large-scale <b>RF</b> <b>front-end.</b> This problem is tackled by using a design of experiments (DoE) approach and an interpolation procedure as discussed in Section 2.2. These methods are important in a large-scale <b>RF</b> <b>front-end</b> because we cannot simulate (or estimate) all configurations; we can only simulate a limited number of sample configurations. For example, a reconfigurable <b>RF</b> <b>front-end</b> with 63 bits of control means that the number of configurations is about 9.2 × 1018, which results in an impractically time-consuming estimation procedure. Our methods of RF impairment estimation in a large-scale <b>RF</b> <b>front-end</b> are utilized to efficiently extract unknown properties of RF components from known properties that are calculated from simulated data. This method of RF impairment estimation is applied to a large-scale <b>RF</b> <b>front-end</b> of 63 bits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Radio {{frequency}} (<b>RF)</b> <b>front-ends</b> {{constitute a}} fun-damental {{part of both}} conventional and emerging wireless com-munication systems. However, {{in spite of their}} importance they are often assumed ideal, although they are practically subject to certain detrimental impairments, such as amplifier nonlinearities, phase noise and in phase and quadrature (I/Q) imbalance (IQI). The present work is devoted to the quantification and evaluation of the RF IQI effects in the context of realistic wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications over double-Nakagami−m fading channels. Novel closed form expressions are derived for the corresponding outage probability for the case of ideal transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), ideal TX and I/Q imbalanced RX, I/Q imbalanced TX and ideal RX, and joint I/Q imbalanced TX/RX. The offered analytic results have a relatively convenient algebraic representation and their validity is extensively justified through comparisons with respective results from computer simulations. Based on these, it is shown that cascaded fading results to considerable degradations in the system performance and that assuming ideal <b>RF</b> <b>front-ends</b> at the TX and RX induces non-negligible errors in the outage probability evaluation that can exceed 20 % in several V 2 V communication scenarios.
