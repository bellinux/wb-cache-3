50|$|Several UK {{universities}} (e.g. the University of Leeds; the University of Oxford) {{have recently}} dispensed with the reader grade (those currently holding <b>readerships</b> retain the title, but no new readers will be appointed).

5|$|While at the University of Iowa, Godwin's {{dissertation}} {{became her}} first novel, The Perfectionists. By 1976 {{she had become}} a successful writer and author of three books. In particular, two books written by her in the 1980s, A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) and A Southern Family (1987), resulted in further acclaim and expanded the <b>readership</b> of her books. Following The Finishing School (1984), <b>readership</b> of her books dramatically declined until 2006, when Queen of the Underworld was published. Flora (2013) became one of her more commercially successful novels.|$|E

5000|$|All of the textbooks, {{to varying}} extents, decontextualize and recontextualize the Holocaust in terms which are {{alien to the}} event itself or partial, {{in a process of}} (national) {{appropriation}} and ‘domestication’. Authors appeal to local <b>readerships,</b> in particular in countries whose populations have no direct experience or inherited memory of the event. These expedient idiosyncrasies are linked largely to the interests of authors writing in the present day within curricular guidelines for identifiable <b>readerships,</b> meaning that textbook representations of the Holocaust may subsume historical information to values or legal and political interests which are largely the product of the situation within and out of which the textbooks are written.|$|R

5|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{about the}} Tribune made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx {{to reach a}} sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the Tribune had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy. Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses {{of the working class}} of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the Tribune was the most widely circulated journal in the United States. Editorially, the Tribune reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions. Not only did the Tribune have wide <b>readership</b> with the United States and not only did that <b>readership</b> come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class. Marx's first article for the New York Tribune was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the Tribune on 21 August 1852.|$|E

40|$|Literary studies {{increasingly}} investígate texts {{by drawing}} on broader, cul-tural studies approaches. In this article, {{it is argued}} that such approaches may be enriched by combining analysis of mechanisms at work in individual acts of interpretation with ethnographic description of <b>readerships</b> and social dimensions of the circulation or reception of a text. The controversy sur-rounding Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses is re-examined in order to illus-trate how social conflicts over meaning may be illuminated, where they arise as the result of divergent responses made by different cultural groups within a multicultural society, or by different <b>readerships</b> in an increasingly globalised media environment. While obviously less controversial in other cases than The Satanic Verses, it is suggested that corresponding issues arise in the case of other novéis, films, exhibitions or cultural artefacts...|$|R

5|$|The precise {{demographics}} of the <b>readership</b> of street newspapers is unclear.

5|$|The town {{appears in}} the Brother Cadfael novels by Ellis Peters (pen name of Edith Pargeter).

40|$|Visual {{power is}} the degree of visual {{stimulus}} emanating from a given design; the higher the stimulus, the greater the degree for attracting attention. First described by Baird in 1993, it {{was used as a}} method for attributing degrees of design aesthetic in print materials. The visual grammar used by different magazine publications can be ascribed differing levels of visual power. Magazines with homogeneous age group <b>readerships</b> tend to use greater values of visual power than those with wider age group <b>readerships.</b> This pilot case study takes a historical snapshot of the development of visual grammar and illustrates its relationship. Two magazines, The Australian Women's Weekly and The Face, are used for a more detailed study on 16 years of variations in arousal potential, hedonic tone and primary cognition associated with the application of visual power in visual grammar.

5000|$|With erotica forging the way, {{the influx}} of romance into sf/f was not far behind, as writers like Catherine Asaro and Laurell K.

5|$|A {{significant}} {{transition in}} her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and {{sold as a}} set.

5|$|As the {{demographics}} of the <b>readership</b> broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E
5|$|Houston {{is served}} by the Houston Chronicle, its only major daily {{newspaper}} with wide distribution.

5000|$|The most {{important}} service Linacre conferred upon his own profession and science was the foundation by royal charter of the College of Physicians in London, {{and he was}} the first president of the new college, which he further aided by bequeathing to it his own house and library.

Two <b>readerships</b> were founded at Merton College, Oxford, and a lecture St John's College, Cambridge. The Oxford foundation was revived by the university commissioners in 1856 {{in the form of the}} Linacre professorship of anatomy. At St John’s College the funds are still in use today; since 1989 the College has hosted an annual ‘Linacre Lecture’ [...] on a subject in medicine, delivered by a leading research scientist in their field.|$|R
