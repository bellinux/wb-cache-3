The modified plan would have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTechnology <b>roadmaps</b> are {{increasingly}} used by governments to inform and promote technological transitions, {{such as a}} transition to a hydrogen energy system. This paper develops a framework for understanding how current <b>roadmapping</b> practice relates to emerging theories of the governance of systems innovation. In applying this framework to {{a case study of}} hydrogen <b>roadmaps,</b> the paper finds that <b>roadmapping</b> for transitions needs to place greater emphasis on ensuring good quality and transparent analytic and participatory procedures. To be most useful, <b>roadmaps</b> should be embedded within institutional structures that enable the incorporation of learning and re-evaluation, but in practice most transition <b>roadmaps</b> are one-off exercises...|$|R

It has been influential in the propagation and uptake of <b>roadmapping</b> internationally including translations of the T-Plan workbook into Chinese (traditional & modern), German, Japanese and Spanish.

40|$|Practitioners {{are finding}} it {{increasingly}} difficult to develop effective <b>roadmapping</b> efforts for many new products and innovations. We argue that this difficulty stems from the fundamental differences between many of today's innovations and earlier ones. Many current innovations are: using technology differently; more heavily constrained; forcing new business models and increasingly being shaped by drivers. Current <b>roadmapping</b> techniques do not translate well to this new reality. <b>Roadmapping</b> efforts for these innovations are increasingly failing to meet their primary goal of including technology into the strategic process of firms, regions or industries. We seek to address this concern by creating a new <b>roadmapping</b> technique, one we name Technology Landscaping. We build this technique by basing it upon the relevant sections and structures found in first and second generation <b>roadmapping</b> theories and practices. We then apply new theory and processes that are in alignment with the nature of these new products and innovations. We test our model through a case study of new pharmaceutical industry innovations. Finally, we present our new <b>roadmapping</b> technique...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates <b>roadmapping</b> in {{the context}} of its {{application}} to strategic early-stage innovation planning. It is concerned with providing an understanding of how uncertainty and risk are manifested in <b>roadmapping</b> in this application, and with developing and testing a <b>roadmapping</b> process that supports appropriate treatment of uncertainty and risk. <b>Roadmapping</b> is an approach to early-stage innovation planning, which is strategic in nature. It is seeing increasing application in practice and receiving growing attention in management literature. There has, however, been a noticeable lack of attention to uncertainty and risk in <b>roadmapping</b> theory and practice (and generally in strategic planning and at innovation’s early-stages). This is despite the awareness that uncertainty and risk are fundamental to strategy and innovation (i. e. application domains of <b>roadmapping),</b> and that <b>roadmapping</b> is meant to deliver, as part of its benefits, the identification, resolution and communication of uncertainties and risks. There is very limited theoretical or practical direction on what this entails. It is this gap that the research reported in thesis addresses. The research is divided into two phases. The first phase explains the manifestations and mechanisms of uncertainty and risk in <b>roadmapping.</b> It also introduces ‘risk-aware roadmapping’, a concept of <b>roadmapping</b> that includes a conscious and explicit effort to address uncertainty and risk, and points out what the process would entail in terms of necessary steps and procedures. The research here is designed using mixed methods (a combination of experience surveys, archival analysis, and case studies). The second phase provides a practical risk-aware <b>roadmapping</b> process. This practical process is developed {{based on the results of}} the first phase, and is designed according to procedural action research. This thesis contributes to the fields of <b>roadmapping,</b> early-stage innovation and organisational sensemaking. It is found that factors related to the content, process and nature of <b>roadmapping</b> interact to influence the perception and treatment of uncertainty and risk. Characteristics of organisational sensemaking as theorised by Weick (1995) are explored in the light of the findings and challenged. Aspects of early-stage innovation including the generation and selection of innovation ideas are explored {{in the context}} of uncertainty and risk and important paradoxes and constraints at innovation’s early-stages.
