Amy is <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> she is still a maid of honor and the four hug. Leonard later meets Penny {{in the laundry room}} and wants to have sex, but Penny declines.|$|E
5|$|The German Generals, in {{particular}} Guderian, were <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the Luftwaffe had prevented the Allied bombers from knocking out their supply bridges. By nightfall, at least 600 tanks, {{including those of}} the 2nd Panzer Division which had to use the 1st Panzer Division's bridge at Gaulier (owing to theirs not having yet been constructed), were across the Meuse. The German victory in the air battle had been decisive.|$|E
5|$|Back in the car, Jack {{begins to}} lose {{confidence}} in his problem-solving abilities because Liz still wants to break up with Carol. As they talk through Liz's past problems with sex, they {{realize that they are}} all connected to the incident with the Tom Jones poster and that each time she has had a problem, it is because she has been reminded of the singer. Liz is <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> she has found the root of her problem and Jack convinces her to stay with Carol. When they finally reach Newark Airport, Liz realizes that she is supposed to meet him at John F. Kennedy International Airport instead.|$|E

5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> {{they did not have to}} make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, Germans {{accepted}} the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, {{but also because}} to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo. Citizens were <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores. Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors. The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws. Concerned that international opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws, the Interior Ministry did not actively enforce them until after the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin that August.|$|E
5|$|Most Germans were <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the {{conflicts}} and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended. They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels, who promised peace and plenty for {{all in a}} united, Marxist-free country without {{the constraints of the}} Versailles Treaty. The first major Nazi concentration camp, initially for political prisoners, was opened at Dachau in 1933. Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created {{by the end of the}} war. Upon seizing power, the Nazis took repressive measures against their political opposition and rapidly began the comprehensive marginalisation of persons they considered socially undesirable. Under the guise of combating the Communist threat, the National Socialists secured immense power. Above all, their campaign against Jews living in Germany gained momentum.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{had fallen}} ill with {{appendicitis}} {{during the previous}} leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyd's agent, who had been on the lookout for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{were the}} NL champions in 1961, {{and with the}} {{addition}} of Sisler, Dave Hillman, and Moe Drabowsky to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the team's management had high hopes of a return to the World Series. Sisler, who was expected {{to be used as a}} relief pitcher, joined a Reds team that already had his brother Dick, who was their first base coach. His father, still with Pittsburgh, mentioned that he was <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> his son did not play in a recent series between the Pirates and Reds, recalling how the mixed emotions he felt when his elder son, Dick, helped defeat the Dodgers in an important game in 1950 by hitting a home run. The younger Sisler's season did not begin well; in his ten appearances by June 5, he allowed a run in all but three, and had a 4.97 ERA. On June19, Sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the Pirates, the time first time George watched his son pitch as an opponent. Although Sisler's season was a disappointment, he completed the season well, allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games, as well as earning the victory on September23, his final major league appearance. His totals for the season included a 4–3record, a 3.92ERA, and one save in 43⅔innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} leaving Grimsby Town, Beharall {{was on the}} move again, this time to Oldham Athletic on a loan deal {{to the end of}} the season. Beharall made his dèbut in a 0–0 draw against Stoke City on 21 November 2001. He played 17 league games, two FA Cup and two Football League Trophy matches during his loan spell at Oldham, scoring one goal in the 89th minute in a 1–1 draw against Wigan Athletic on 15 December 2001. Beharall was bought by Oldham Athletic on 6 March 2002 for £150,000 on a three-year {{contract}} after impressing during his loan deal. David played one more league game for The Latics during the 2001–02 season against Wigan on 9 March, a match which Wigan won 1–0. In the 2002–03 season Beharall played 32 league, 4 League and 3 FA Cup games for Oldham under the management of Iain Dowie, who replaced Mick Wadsworth in the summer of 2002. In the pre-season of the 2003–04 season, he suffered an injury which left him out of action until October 2003. During this time in August 2003 Beharall was a victim of a carjacking when he and team mate Adam Griffin were attacked when they stopped at a cash machine with Beharall leaving Grffin in the passenger seat and his £21,000 Mercedes-Benz R230 car parked at a Texaco garage in Oldham. Griffin was left defenseless with one of the attackers holding him at knifepoint and another man hit Griffin's left arm with an iron bar, then dragging and throwing Griffin to the ground. Beharall left his wallet and mobile phone in the car but was <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> he and Griffin were OK. During the 2003–2004 season Beharall played 7 league, 2 FA Cup and 2 Football league games, he also scored 2 league goals against Plymouth Argyle on 1 November 2003. After playing only 6 league games during the 2004–05 season new manager Brian Talbot, Beharall left the club on 24 January 2005 after agreeing a settlement figure.|$|E

25|$|Due to the Argentina–Brazil {{football}} rivalry, the Brazilians in {{the crowd}} supported Germany, despite their resounding 7–1 victory over Brazil in the semi-finals, as the Germans had shown respect to the defeated hosts, while Argentine fans had celebrated Brazil's elimination.

25|$|The Germans {{attempted}} {{to renew the}} offensive on 5 April. By now 47th Division had reorganised. Most of 1/19th was with 141 Bde in divisional reserve, but one company was in the front line still attached to 1/20th. The attack was made after an intense bombardment, and fighting went on all day, with reserves fed in progressively. The Germans made some gains, but the line held. 47th Division was <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> night.|$|E

50|$|The Somme {{offensive}} {{was originally}} planned, {{earlier in the}} year, as a joint British-French offensive but due to the increasing pressure on the French at Verdun was fought in part to <b>relieve</b> <b>that</b> pressure without much of the expected French support.

25|$|In late 1938, {{during the}} great crisis in Europe over Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Munich Agreement, Canadians were divided. Francophones insisted on neutrality, as did some top {{advisers}} like Oscar D. Skelton. Imperialists stood behind Britain and were willing to fight Germany. King, who served as his own {{secretary of state for}} external affairs (foreign minister), said privately that if he had to choose he would not be neutral, but he made no public statement. All of Canada was <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the British appeasement at Munich, while sacrificing the rights of Czechoslovakia, seemed to bring peace.|$|E

25|$|For 18 years Hersey {{also taught}} two writing courses, in fiction and non-fiction, to undergraduates. Hersey taught his last class in fiction writing at Yale during 1984. In his {{individual}} sessions with undergraduates {{to discuss their}} work, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author was sometimes known to write his comments in the margin, and having discussed his suggestion with the student, to then take out his pencil and erase his comment. As Master of Pierson College, he subsequently hosted his old boss Henry Luce– with whom Hersey had become reconciled after their dispute years prior– when Luce spoke to the college's undergraduates. Time founder Luce was a notoriously dull public speaker, and his address to the Pierson undergraduates was no exception. After Luce's somnolent speech, the former publisher privately revealed to Hersey {{for the first time}} that he and his wife Clare Boothe Luce had taken LSD while supervised by a physician. Hersey later confessed he was <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> Luce had saved that particular revelation for a more private audience.|$|E
