The STAAR had intensified <b>rigorousness</b> and end of course assessments, instead of a unified 9th, 10th, and 11th grade Mathematics, ELA, Science and Social Studies test. Therefore, one would take an Algebra I test in order to pass Algebra I, and so on. During {{a speech at the}} Texas Association of School Administrators’ Midwinter Conference in Austin, Scott also said the last TAKS-based school accountability ratings will be issued in 2011. Ratings will be suspended in 2012 while a new accountability system is developed. The new state rating system will debut in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|The great {{strength}} of Papworth's Ordinary was the <b>rigorousness</b> of its system of classification by blazon, which (with minor modifications) {{has remained the}} basis for all ordinaries published since: {{there was only one}} possible place for any particular coat of arms to be entered within it. Its weakness was its dependence for its contents on Burke's General Armory and other secondary sources, which meant that it inherited many of their errors and omissions. One of the oddities of the book (and therefore of some of its successors), which resulted in part from Papworth's decision to classify animal charges of all kinds under the primary heading [...] "Beast", and birds of all kinds under [...] "Bird", is that the alphabetical distribution of entries is highly unbalanced: the headings A–F account for roughly 80% of the whole, a point on which the editor had to reassure subscribers while the work was still in progress.|$|E
2500|$|After Campbell {{announced}} his resignation the BC Liberal Party leadership election began, {{the winner of}} which would become premier. In mid-December 2010 Lake endorsed George Abbott, citing Abbott's [...] "collaborative and engaging style to governing" [...] and his profile as a fellow Interior and rural MLA. Christy Clark would eventually win the leadership race. When the 39th Parliament resumed with a third session and Clark as premier, she promoted Lake to Minister of Environment and made him the deputy government house leader. Clark and Lake committed {{to continue with the}} carbon tax and a carbon neutral public service, but backed away from the province's legislated greenhouse gas reduction targets. The issue about BC's participation in the Western Climate Initiative was reviewed by the entire cabinet, who decided to continue with WCI's planned cap-and-trade system. An emphasis in the Ministry of Environment was placed on BC Parks with announcements by Clark and Lake on the elimination of parking fees at parks, a one-year youth passport program, new online tools to facilitate park usage, a park bench sponsorship program, and a $500,000 program to celebrate B.C. Parks' 100th-anniversary. Lake came under criticism for not publicly releasing the report and recommendations of the Species at Risk Task Force. To compensate for the slow action on the task force, the opposition environment critic Rob Fleming re-introduced his own Species at Risk Protection Act in June 2011. Lake released the task force report in July for a public comment period. As the Minister of Environment, Lake had to defend the Environmental Assessment Office following a review by the Auditor General who identified short-comings and continued criticism regarding the <b>rigorousness</b> of the environmental review process as a proposed copper-gold mine, which was approved by Lake's predecessor, was refused by the federal government. Lake came under criticism from fellow BC Liberal MLAs John Les, John van Dongen, and Donna Barnett after Lake approved Metro Vancouver's waste-management plan which included proposals to incinerate garbage; Les and van Dongen felt the plan would significantly lower air quality in their Fraser Valley ridings and Barnett advocated for continuing the hauling of garbage to the Cache Creek landfill in her riding.|$|E

50|$|In 1908, Austrian {{architect}} Adolph Loos had {{summed up}} the extreme <b>rigorousness</b> of radical Modernists by declaring: “Ornament is a crime.” Latour remained faithful to the French tradition he inherited from his father whose taste, in particular for ornament, was resolutely old-fashioned {{in comparison with the}} Modernism of the time. Latour’s first woodcuts for book illustrations—head letters, frontispieces, ex libris, views of Paris, landscapes and still lives—show Latour was still very much influenced by the French tradition, though they also show his tendency to simplification and graphic effectiveness. The same can be observed in his early illustrated books with works by Charles Baudelaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Henri Focillon. Soon, however, Latour’s graphic work took a sharp modern turn, in particular in his posters, his ads for the newspapers, his surprisingly simple and purified bookbinding design and his inventively simple fabric designs. All these creations bear witness to his tasteful use of colour and the refined <b>rigorousness</b> with which he introduced combinations and variations on playful geometry and sparse composition.|$|E

In the Blue-White scrimmage on April 25, Newsome played for both teams and went 9-of-13 for 71 yards, and threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brett Brackett.|$|E

He spent two years seeking treatment for the condition, unable to play at all. Frasca turned to weight training {{as a source of}} help. By keeping a balance between his practice and working out, he regained full use of his hands in 2003.|$|E

50|$|The British {{mathematician}} Henry John Stephen Smith (1826-1883) {{gave the}} following appraisal of Gauss:If we except the great name of Newton {{it is probable}} that no mathematicians of any age or country have ever surpassed Gauss in the combination of an abundant fertility of invention with an absolute <b>rigorousness</b> in demonstration, which the ancient Greeks themselves might have envied.It may seem paradoxical, but it is probably nevertheless true that it is precisely the efforts after logical perfection of form which has rendered the writings of Gauss open to the charge of obscurity and unnecessary difficulty.Gauss says more than once that, for brevity, he gives only the synthesis, and suppresses the analysis of his propositions. If, on the other hand, we turn to a memoir of Euler's, there is a sort of free and luxuriant gracefulness about the whole performance, which tells of the quiet pleasure which Euler must have taken in each step of his work. It is not the least of Gauss' claims to the admiration of mathematicians, that, while fully penetrated with a sense of the vastness of the science, he exacted the utmost <b>rigorousness</b> in every part of it, never passed over a difficulty, as if it did not exist, and never accepted a theorem as true beyond the limits within which it could actually be demonstrated.|$|E

In support of the latter, he also quotes the conclusion of Munck and Verkuilen (2002) that [...] "the aggregate data offered by Freedom House has to be accepted largely on faith", due to the factors that [...] "no set of coding rules is provided, and the sources of information are not identified with enough precision, and because disaggregated data have not been made available to independent scholars".|$|E

The country opened a stock exchange, the Lao Securities Exchange in 2011, {{and has become a}} rising regional player in its role as a hydroelectric power supplier to neighbors such as China, Vietnam and Thailand.

The IB coordinator is 蒋皓 (Dr. Erin Jiang), who is also the IB Chemistry instructor. SHSID is also a test center for the IB examinations and boasts an average IB score of 42.5 (2015). To prevent students from feeling over-pressured from the <b>rigorousness</b> of the program, and from failing, only the top 30% ranked students may apply for IBD. In other words, to maintain a high average IB score for promotion of the school, only students who will achieve high scores in the program are chosen.|$|E
5000|$|Since the mid-1980s, {{through the}} Doi Moi reform period, Vietnam {{has made a}} shift from a highly {{centralized}} planned economy to a mixed economy that uses both directive and indicative planning through five-year plans.

50|$|<b>Rigorousness</b> and freedom, {{modernity and}} independence, {{geometry}} and lyricism: {{these could be}} the key words defining the vast variety of Latour’s talents and skills. The man was an explorer of art and he loved to venture into uncharted territories, meet new challenges and develop new techniques of visual expression. However, to him this diversity of approaches really meant searching for profound coherence. Whether {{it was in a}} landscape, in framing a photograph, etching a vignette, conceiving a poster for an ad or drawing a design for a fabric, he permanently rejected academicism, hackneyed tradition and ready-made solutions. He always showed his independence and resolutely refused to be enrolled in any school or movement. The history of these vanguards and their ideologies bore little relation to his personal history. Latour was certainly a Modernist, but not a diehard revolutionary artist: he sought to reinterpret the artistic tradition in the light of his own perception of the world and reach through it an ideal of essential simplicity.|$|E

5000|$|To {{comply with}} strong strict {{two-phase}} locking (SS2PL) the locking protocol releases both write (exclusive) and read (shared) locks applied by a transaction {{only after the}} transaction has ended, i.e., only after both completing executing (being ready) and becoming either committed or aborted. This protocol also complies with the S2PL rules. A transaction obeying SS2PL {{can be viewed as}} having phase-1 that lasts the transaction's entire execution duration, and no phase-2 (or a degenerate phase-2). Thus, only one phase is actually left, and [...] "two-phase" [...] in the name seems to be still utilized due to the historical development of the concept from 2PL, and 2PL being a super-class. The SS2PL property of a schedule is also called <b>Rigorousness.</b> It is also the name of the class of schedules having this property, and an SS2PL schedule is also called a [...] "rigorous schedule".
