The resultswere as follows: 1) In OAFE and BF, widespread I. japonica was both the dominant species of herb layer, and its important value and niche breadth were higher than other herb species. Total length, surface, volume and total biomass of <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>rhizome</b> of I. japonica were higher than those of total other herbs (P< 0. 05) in unit spatial quadrat (0. 3 m 3). 2) Length of coarse <b>rhizome,</b> <b>and</b> length, surface, volume of <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>rhizome</b> of I. japonica were higher in BF than those in OAFE (P< 0. 01).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of Cyperus rotundus (CR) <b>roots</b> <b>and</b> <b>rhizomes</b> on seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and picrotoxin (PTX). Pretreatment with hydroalcoholic extract of Cyperus rotundus (CR) <b>roots</b> <b>and</b> <b>rhizomes</b> (50 - 200 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent decrease in the incidence of both clonic and generalized tonic–clonic seizures (P≤ 0. 05) following PTZ and PTX administration.

Addition of glucose, sucrose, or succinate also increased the rate of acetylene reduction under anaerobic conditions, with glucose providing the most stimulation. In one experiment, comparison of acetylene reduction assays with 15 N 2 incorporation yielded a ratio of about 2. 6 : 1.

The methanol extract of <b>roots</b> <b>and</b> <b>rhizomes</b> of Smilax zeylanica L were administered p. o. at doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg b. w for 7 days.

Histopathological examination of liver sections was also performed to study the extent of damage to hepatic parenchyma. Preliminary phytochemical screening of the methanol extract was carried out {{to find out the}} presence of various phytoconstituents.
