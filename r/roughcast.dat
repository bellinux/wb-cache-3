5|$|Since the {{widening}} {{of the tower}} arches in 1270 and 1320 the tower of St.Mary's had been structurally weak. The subsequent addition of the bells and belfry and the lead-covered spire added to {{the weight of the}} tower, and the number of burials of local notables within the church and of parishioners immediately outside the church building weakened the structure further. By the 18th century the problems had become severe enough that the west arch of the south transept was blocked up in an effort the strengthen the structure, and a hollow pillar which housed the stairway to the rood loft was filled in. The tower continued to weaken, a situation made worse by the addition in 1812 of a new ring of six bells with a 17cwt(860kg) tenor bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Iron bands were wrapped around the tower to strengthen it but these soon snapped, and by the 19th century large cracks, which had appeared in the tower, were filled with broken bricks and rubble and covered over with <b>roughcast</b> as an interim solution.|$|E

40|$|Tropical theileriosis (Theileria annulata infection) is a {{protozoan}} {{disease of}} cattle transmitted by Hyalomma ticks. This parasite is causing high losses {{in several countries}} in South Europe, North Africa and Asia. Indeed, both symptomatic and subclinical forms are present in infected animals causing live weight decrease, milk yield decrease, abortions {{and in some cases}} death. Due to its high medical and financial impact, the control of this disease is of paramount importance. It can be implemented through five control measures: (i) treatment of infected animals with theilericidal drugs and other symptomatic treatments (this option is used for the treatment of animals and is insufficient to eradicate the parasite), (ii) use of acaricides in animals which contain several side effects for humans, animals and the environment, (iii) <b>roughcasting</b> and smoothing of the outer and inner surfaces of the cattle buildings for endophilic tick species (this control option is expensive but leads to the eradication of the parasite from the farm), (iv) vaccination against ticks, a control option used with success against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) species but not still available for Hyalomma ticks and (v) vaccination against the parasite with live attenuated vaccines. These control options were presented in the paper and their advantages and limits were discussed. The implementation of one (or more) of these control options should take into account other considerations (social, political, etc.); they sometimes cause the failure of the control action...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Hyalomma scupense (syn. Hyalomma detritum) is a two-host {{domestic}} endophilic tick {{of cattle}} and sec-ondarily other ungulates in the Maghreb region (Africa). This species transmits several pathogens, among which two are major livestock diseases: Theileria annulata and Theileria equi. Various other pathogens are also transmitted by this tick species, such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia bovis. Hyalomma scupense {{is common in}} sub-humid and semi-arid areas of several regions in the world, mainly in the Maghreb region. In this region, adults attach to ani-mals during the summer season; larvae and nymphs attach to their hosts during autumn, {{but there is a}} regional differ-ence in H. scupense phenology. There is an overlap between immature and adult ticks, leading in some contexts to a dramatic modification of the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases. This tick species attaches preferentially to the pos-terior udder quarters and thighs. Tick burdens can reach 130 ticks per animal, with a mean of 60 ticks. Calves are 70 times less infested than adult cattle. The control can be implemented through six options: (i) rehabilitation of the farm buildings by <b>roughcasting</b> and smoothing the outer and inner surfaces of the enclosures and walls.

(v) Manual tick removal: this method is not efficient since the ticks can feed on several other animal species in the farm. This control option can lead to a reduction of the tick population, but not a decrease in tick-borne disease incidence. (vi) Vaccination: this control option consists of injecting the protein Hd 86; trials have shown a partial effect on nymphs, with no effect on adult ticks.

2500|$|The early 1890s saw {{a sudden}} change in Birmingham's {{dominant}} architectural style, as High Gothic {{gave way to}} a distinctive local school of Arts and Crafts architecture. Buildings came increasingly to be designed in an understated style that limited ornament and was based on traditional forms of local vernacular architecture, in Birmingham largely brick, <b>roughcast</b> and half-timbering. Design emphasised the simple and honest expression of the building's construction, highlighting structural elements such as the bonds of the brickwork, and often emphasising differences in the function of elements of the building through the deliberate creation of awkward juxtapositions and contrasts. Buildings often featured decorative elements such as furnishings, friezes or paintings by local artists and craftsmen – particularly by the Birmingham Group which formed around the Birmingham School of Art in the 1880s – considering these to be integral to the design of the building to form a [...] "total work of art". [...] The Arts and Crafts philosophy was an approach to design rather than a defined style, however, and the work of Arts and Crafts architects within Birmingham ranged from the eclectic and spectacular Elizabethan revival work of Crouch and Butler to the Methodist purism of Joseph Lancaster Ball; and from the politically-radical austerity of Arthur Stansfield Dixon; to the mystically-charged symbolism of the work of William Lethaby.|$|E

There are 3 bays on each floor at the front, with a French window on each floor on the western wing, where the restaurant is located. Next door is Sessions House, dated to 1900, but with a stucco front with windows in the late 18th-century style. As of 2001 it had 5 double rooms, a bar, and a restaurant; it is the restaurant for which it has earned its reputation. The interior consists of traditional Welsh oak furnishings. In the hallway is a traditional heavy oak Welsh dresser which contains items belonging to the owners. In the sitting room is a wood-burning stove and books and magazines, and in the dining room is a large stone fireplace, with pictures and pieces of armour on the walls and lace-covered tables.

The store had a high, sharp gable to the street, and showed its timbers through the <b>roughcast</b> of its wall, which was {{sprinkled}} with broken glass that glistened in the sun. After a while the building disappeared like a scene shifted at the theatre, and it was probably torn down. Then the boys found another toy store; but they considered the dealer mean; he asked very high prices, and he said, when a boy hung back from buying a thing that it was [...] "a very superior article," [...] and the boys had that for a by-word, and they holloed it at the storekeeper's boy when they wanted to plague him. There were two bakeries, and at the American bakery there were small sponge-cakes, which were the nicest cakes in the world, for a cent apiece; at the Dutch bakery there were pretzels, with salt and ashes sticking on them, that the Dutch boys liked; but the American boys made fun of them, and the bread at the Dutch bakery was always sour. There were four or five taverns where drink was always sold and drunkards often to be seen; {{and there was one}} Dutch tavern, but the Dutchmen generally went to the brewery for their beer, and drank it there. The boys went to the brewery, to get yeast for their mothers; and they liked to linger among the great heaps of malt, and the huge vats wreathed in steam, and sending out a pleasant smell. The floors were always wet, and the fat, pale Dutchmen, working about in the vapory air, never spoke to the boys, who were afraid of them. They took a boy's bottle and filled it with foaming yeast, and then took his cent, all in a silence so oppressive that he scarcely dared to breathe. My boy wondered where they kept the boy they were bringing up to drink beer; {{but it would have been}} impossible to ask. The brewery overlooked the river, and you could see the south side of the bridge from its back windows, and that was very strange.
