30|$|In the K-user {{deterministic}} interference channel, each active level conveys one bit. To avoid collision, {{each level}} at the receiver side should be occupied either by a signal bit or by an interference bit. Actually, this interference bit {{can be a}} modulo- 2 addition of several interference bits, since {{it is not necessary}} to decode each of these interference bits separately. In order to leave as many <b>receive</b> <b>levels</b> as possible “free” for reception of signal bits, it will be advantageous if multiple interference bits fall on one <b>receive</b> <b>level.</b> This is the principle of interference alignment in amplitude space: the alignment of interference saves amplitude levels for desired signals and thus the throughput can be increased.|$|R
