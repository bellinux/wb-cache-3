5|$|The second <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> general path of {{tropical}} cyclones {{in the eastern}} Pacific. They generally move north-westward or westward due to steering by the prevailing upper level winds, which takes them far out to sea and away from land.|$|E
5|$|A Momentary Lapse of <b>Reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> thirteenth studio album by English {{progressive}} {{rock band}} Pink Floyd, {{released in the}} UK and US on 7 September 1987, on the labels EMI and Columbia. It followed guitarist David Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first Pink Floyd album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist, singer, and primary songwriter Roger Waters.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message}} to players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E

5|$|Appeal to <b>Reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fifth studio album by American {{punk rock}} band Rise Against. After touring {{in support of}} their {{previous}} album, The Sufferer & the Witness, Rise Against began recording Appeal to Reason in January 2008 at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado. Recording and production were finished in June, and the album was released in North America on October 7, 2008. The album is the band's first release with guitarist Zach Blair. The album has been certified Gold by the RIAA and platinum by the CRIA.|$|E
5|$|Qiyas or analogical <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fourth {{source of}} the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E

5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E

25|$|Hexacyclic CPT analogues {{have shown}} great potency. For example, {{methylenedioxy}} or ethylenedioxy group connected between 10 and 11 form a 5 or 6 membered ring {{which leads to}} more water-soluble derivates and increased potency. Researches have shown that ethylenedioxy analogues are less potent than methylenedioxy. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> unfavorable steric interactions of ethylenedioxy analogues with the enzyme.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{capacity}} for consciously {{making sense of}} things, establishing and verifying facts, applying logic, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information.

25|$|If the MBS was not {{underwritten by}} the {{original}} real estate and the issuer's guarantee, the rating of the bonds would be much lower.

25|$|Kant {{is one of}} {{the central}} figures of modern philosophy, and set the terms by which all {{subsequent}} thinkers have had to grapple.

One important <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> transfer of the gold trade east to the Niger River and the Taghaza Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline.

In the essay Bluspels and Flalansferes: A Semantic Nightmare he argues that, though <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> organ of truth, imagination is the organ of meaning.|$|E

25|$|The FutureGen Alliance wrote {{a letter}} to the Department of Energy’s Under Secretary C.H. “Bud” Albright Jr. stating that overall {{inflation}} and the rising cost of raw materials and engineering services are driving costs up on energy projects around the world. According to James L.

25|$|The hastati (sing. hastatus) {{consisted}} of raw or inexperienced soldiers, {{considered to be}} less reliable than legionaries of several years' service. The Hastati were placed at the front for several reasons. One <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> city of Rome could ill-afford to lose experienced soldiers, so they put the greenest soldiers at the front. If they survived, the Hastati/tus would gain invaluable experience. Another reason is if the newest soldiers succumbed to battle nerves and broke and tried to run, then there were experienced soldiers behind them to stiffen their resolve.|$|E
