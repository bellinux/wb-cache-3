40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} modern SoC designs makes tasks of SoC formal verification {{a lot more}} complex and challenging. This motivates the research community to develop more robust approaches that enable efficient formal verification for such designs. It is a common scenario to apply a correctness by integration strategy while a SoC design is being verified. This strategy assumes formal verification to be implemented in two major steps. First of all, each module of a SoC is considered and verified separately from the other blocks of the system. At the second step – when the functional correctness is successfully proved for every individual module – the communicational behavior has to be verified between all the modules of the SoC. In industrial applications, SAT/SMT-based interval property checking(IPC) has become widely adopted for SoC verification. Using IPC approaches, a verification engineer is able to afford solving {{a wide range of}} important verification problems and proving functional correctness of diverse complex components in a modern SoC design. However, there exist critical parts of a design where formal methods often lack their robustness. State-of-the-art property checkers fail in proving correctness for a data path of an industrial central processing unit (CPU). In particular, arithmetic circuits of a realistic size (32 bits or 64 bits) – especially implementing multiplication algorithms – are well-known examples when SAT/SMT-based formal verification may reach its capacity very fast. In cases like this, formal verification is replaced with simulation-based approaches in practice. Simulation is a good methodology that may assure a high rate of discovered bugs hidden in a SoC design. However, in contrast to formal methods, a simulation-based technique cannot guarantee the absence of errors in a design. Thus, simulation may still miss some so-called corner-case bugs in the design. This may potentially lead to additional and very expensive costs in terms of time, effort, and investments spent for redesigns, refabrications, and <b>reshipments</b> of new chips. The work of this thesis concentrates on studying and developing robust algorithms for solving hard arithmetic decision problems. Such decision problems often originate from a task of RTL property checking for data-path designs. Proving properties of those designs can efficiently be performed by solving SMT decision problems formulated with the quantifier-free logic over fixed-sized bit vectors (QF-BV). This thesis, firstly, proposes an effective algebraic approach based on a Gröbner basis theory that allows to efficiently decide arithmetic problems. Secondly, for the case of custom-designed components, this thesis describes a sophisticated modeling technique which is required to restore all the necessary arithmetic description from these components. Further, this thesis, also, explains how methods from computer algebra and the modeling techniques can be integrated into a common SMT solver. Finally, a new QF-BV SMT solver is introduced. ...|$|R

50|$|Spain monopolized {{trade with}} the colonies.

Direct trade with other colonies was prohibited; as a result, items from one colony had {{to be sent to}} Spain for <b>reshipment</b> to another colony. The crown also established the routes of transport and the number of ships allowed to trade in the colonies. Merchants involved in intercontinental trade were peninsular-born Spaniards. Finally, the crown circumscribed the type of merchandise that could be traded. The colony could export to Spain only precious metals, gold in particular, and some agricultural products. In return, Spain exported to the colonies most of the manufactured goods that the colonys elites needed, as well as the commodity of African slaves. Domestic products supplemented these items only to a minor degree. The types of goods traded were constrained by the relatively small size and number of ships, so that only high-value, low volume goods could turn a profit.|$|E
50|$|Cowries {{have been}} used as {{currency}} in West Africa since the 11th century when their use was first recorded near Old Ghana. Its use may have been much older. Sijilmasa in present-day Morocco seems to be a major source of cowries in the trans-Saharan trade. In western Africa, shell money was usual tender up until the middle of the 19th century. Before the abolition of the slave trade there were large shipments of cowry shells to some of the English ports for <b>reshipment</b> to the slave coast. It was also common in West Central Africa as the currency of the Kingdom of Kongo called locally nzimbu. As the value of the cowry was much greater in West Africa than in the regions from which the supply was obtained, the trade was extremely lucrative. In some cases the gains are said to have been 500%. The use of the cowry currency gradually spread inland in Africa. By about 1850 Heinrich Barth found it fairly widespread in Kano, Kuka, Gando, and even Timbuktu. Barth relates that in Muniyoma, one of the ancient divisions of Bornu, the king's revenue was estimated at 30,000,000 shells, with every adult male being required to pay annually 1000 shells for himself, 1000 for every pack-ox, and 2000 for every slave in his possession. In the countries on the coast, the shells were fastened together in strings of 40 or 100 each, so that fifty or twenty strings represented a dollar; but in the interior they were laboriously counted one by one, or, if the trader were expert, five by five. The districts mentioned above received their supply of kurdi, as they were called, from the west coast; but the regions to the north of Unyamwezi, where they were in use under the name of simbi, were dependent on Muslim traders from Zanzibar. The shells were used in the remoter parts of Africa until the early 20th century, but gave way to modern currencies. The shell of the land snail, Achatina monetaria, cut into circles with an open center was also used as coin in Benguella, Portuguese West Africa.|$|E
50|$|For {{a number}} of years after the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the {{protective}} practices in England were of the most haphazard and arbitrary kind. In 1721 two vessels laden with cotton goods from Cyprus, then a seat of plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving as indemnity. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752 vessels for the United Kingdom with a foul bill (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to repair to the lazarets of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to perform their quarantine or to have their cargoes sufficiently opened and aired. Since 1741 Stangate Creek (on the Medway) had been made the quarantine station at home; but it would appear from the above clause that it was available only for vessels with clean bills. In 1755 lazarets in the form of floating hulks were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to dews) having been done previously on the ship's deck. There was no medical inspection employed, but the whole routine left to the officers of customs and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to lie forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air the sacks; but owing to remonstrances, which came chiefly from Edinburgh and Leith, grain was from that date declared to be a non-susceptible article. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or within four leagues of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland, to hoist a yellow flag in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, under a penalty of After 1800, ships from plague-countries (or with foul bills) were enabled to perform their quarantine on arrival in the Medway instead of taking a Mediterranean port on the way for that purpose; and about the same time an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near Chatham at an expense of which was almost at once condemned owing to its marshy foundations, and the materials sold for The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with hides from Mogador (Morocco) were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the Nore, the owners receiving About this period it was merchandise that was chiefly suspected: there was a long schedule of susceptible articles, and these were first exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each instalment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired forty days more. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for <b>reshipment</b> of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. The expenses may be estimated from one or two examples. In 1820 the Asia, 763 tons, arrived in the Medway with a foul bill from Alexandria, laden with linseed; her freight was and her quarantine dues The same year the Pilato, 495 tons, making the same voyage, paid quarantine dues on a freight of In 1823 the expenses of the quarantine service (at various ports) were and the dues paid by shipping (nearly all with clean bills) A return for the United Kingdom and colonies in 1849 showed, among other details, that the expenses of the lazaret at Malta for ten years from 1839 to 1848 had been From 1846 onwards the establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the Public Health Act 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the Local Government Board the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague, the powers to deal with cholera ships having been already transferred by the Public Health Act 1875.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{e-commerce}} has {{reached the age of}} maturity. However, there are still some growing pains remaining. An important one is the delivery method of parcels, both the strength of e-commerce as the Achilles heel. First of all, the costs of delivery are substantial. If the cargo interest decides to use his right of withdrawal, such costs remain with the webshop. Moreover, parcels get lost or damaged during delivery, while the risk remains with the webshop and the recourse possibilities against the carrier are often very limited. Finally, e-commerce still can`t provide the same consumer experience as physical sales, as consumers can`t “test” their orders. Even though this is possible at home, the consumer has to pay the costs of <b>reshipment</b> and might see the time investment of <b>reshipment</b> as an obstacle. Webshops meet these concerns by providing for free <b>reshipment,</b> but this further increases the costs. In this paper, two alternatives to deal with these obstacles are introduced. The first one is cooperative e-commerce, whereby different specialized webshops act as mutual delivery points, where parcels of the other webshops can be picked up, tested and left behind in case of a change of preferences. This creates a proximity without having to engage in expensive delivery at home. In the second model this role is performed by individual loyal consumers, who will play a role as ambassadors and accept delivery at home for consumers choosing this delivery point. Albeit such delivery methods seem to be valid complementary alternatives, there are different legal obstacles to such alternative delivery methods. In this paper, after investigating the current obstacles, we investigate the liability impact of both alternatives [...] status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} of the drops that small packages encounter during handling operations in the small parcel ground delivery system of United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express (FedEx), two of the largest small parcel carriers in the USA The purpose {{was to determine if}} the drop heights listed in the International Safe Transit Associations (ISTA) standardized 3 C and 3 D testing procedure for small parcels replicate or are representative of the real environment. This is important to those who use ISTA tests to validate their package designs. The results of the study showed that relying on ISTA tests may result in over packing or under packing. Over packing is costly for the packager and results in unnecessary packaging material in the waste stream. Under packing may result in product damage which is also costly for the packager in terms of actual material costs and other expenses related to damage, such as the filing of damage claims with the carrier, lost business, <b>reshipment</b> of a replacement and customer dissatisfaction to name a few. If the environment is worse than the ISTA test procedure for small parcels, then the results could help the users modify the test procedure using some of the data collected in this study to come up with new drop heights for pre-shipment testing. If the environment is less severe than the current ISTA 3 C and 3 D test procedures, the data from this study could be used to develop a more representative drop test...|$|E
40|$|East Asia is {{characterized}} by intricate production and distribution networks. Higher skilled workers in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan produce sophisticated technology-intensive intermediate goods and capital goods and ship them to China and ASEAN for assembly by lower skilled workers and <b>reshipment</b> throughout the world. These networks have promoted economic efficiency and functioned as an engine of growth. They have also been accompanied by large trade imbalances with the U. S. that could cause Asian currencies to appreciate against the dollar. This in turn would alter relative exchange rates in Asia, given the variety of exchange rate regimes in the region. This paper investigates how such exchange rate changes would affect trade within Asia and between Asia and the U. S. The results indicate that exchange rate changes can cause significant declines in exports of intermediate and capital goods from developed Asia to developing Asia. This evidence implies that exchange rate appreciations in developed Asia relative to developing Asia would disrupt the complimentary relationship that exists between these countries in the trade of sophisticated technology-intensive goods. The results also indicate that exchange rate elasticities for trade between Asia and the U. S. are not large enough to lend confidence that a depreciation of the dollar would improve the U. S. trade balance with Asia. This evidence implies that policymakers in the U. S. should not expect too much from an appreciation of Asian currencies and should focus instead on shortfalls of saving relative to investment if {{they are concerned about}} their trade imbalances. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{constructs}} and analyzes a multi-location inventory {{model to}} examine the value of warehouse risk-pooling in high service-level systems. Specifically, risk-pooling over the outside-supplier leadtime is examined. Two alternative systems of N identical retailers are formulated. In System 1, each retailer operates independently: retailers receive goods directly from an outside supplier after a fixed leadtime (L s + L tr), where L s is the outside supplier's own (e. g., manufacturing) leadtime and L tr is the transportation/receiving leadtime to the retailers. In System 2, the system order is shipped to a warehouse, arriving after a fixed leadtime (L s + L tw), where L tw is the transportation/receiving leadtime to the warehouse. Upon receipt of the goods, the warehouse allocates and ships units to the retailers to equalize their inventory positions. The warehouse does not hold inventory. Allocation and <b>reshipment</b> in System 2 requires a fixed leadtime of (L pw + L tr) time periods, where L pw is the allocation and (re) packaging leadtime at the warehouse. Hence, System 2 pools risk over the outside supplier leadtime, but at the cost of: (1) increased overall leadtime to the retailers; and (2) an `internal' pipeline inventory holding cost. Our analysis asks the question: given equal required service-levels and equal safety stock holding cost (plus pipeline inventory cost for System 2), how large can System 2 's extra leadtimes (L tw, L pw) be? Our analysis concludes that pipeline inventory-holding cost significantly influences the overall value of these breakeven leadtimes. Specifically, when pipeline inventory holding costs can (somehow) be ignored, the corresponding breakeven leadtimes can be quite large. However, if these costs cannot be avoided, then the corresponding breakeven leadtimes are significantly reduced.
