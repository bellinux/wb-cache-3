5000|$|For example, metal {{objects such}} as steel beams can act as antennas by inductively {{receiving}} and then [...] "re-radiating" [...] some of the energy in the radiative near field, forming a new radiating surface to consider.

When a secondary <b>radiating</b> <b>antenna</b> surface is thus activated, it then creates its own near-field regions, but the same conditions apply to them.|$|E
50|$|Two {{continuous}} wave lasers with identical polarisation are required, the lasers with frequency ω1 and ω2 are spatially overlapped {{to generate a}} terahertz beatnote. The co-linear lasers are then used to illuminate an ultra fast semiconductor material such as GaAs. The photonic absorption and the short charge carrier lifetime results in the modulation of the conductivity at the desired terahertz frequency ωTHz = ω1 - ω2. An applied electric field allows the conductivity variation to be converted into a current which is radiated {{by a pair of}} antenna.

40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of wireless communication systems is predominantly dependent on propagation environment and respective <b>radiating</b> <b>antennas.</b> Due to the shorter wavelength at Millimeter Wave (MmW) frequencies, the propagation loss through surroundings in indoor environments is typically very high.

30|$|In {{order to}} improve {{communication}} in a long-distance HSR scenario, leaky coaxial cable (LCX)-based radio communication system [20] was introduced to provide better bandwidth and efficient frequency reuse. The need for repeaters to compensate for transmission losses, high maintenance cost and large deployment cost limits the acceptance of LCX system for high-speed train-ground information transmission. Radio-over-fiber (RoF)-based system [21, 22] with remote antennal units (RAU) deployed along railway lines to transmit data wirelessly to the onboard unit is another promising technology for HSR communication.

40|$|A feed-point lens {{may be used}} {{to match}} an {{electrically}} large, oil-filled, coaxial waveguide to the feed arms of a high-voltage half reflector impulse <b>radiating</b> <b>antenna</b> (HIRA). In this note, we document the design and low-voltage test of a 1. 83 m (6 ft) diameter HIRA, with a focal length-to-diameter (F/D) ratio of 1 / 4, and a titanium dioxide/epoxy feed-point lens with a relative dielectric constant of 7. 0. The on-boresight antenna step response is an impulse with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 70 ps. As a result of compromises {{in the design of the}} feed point, the radiated impulse was broadened somewhat, reducing the peak field. However, the measured effective aperture height of the antenna, 0. 36 m, is approximately one-half the dipole moment of the reflector, as expected. Thus, the antenna performance is consistent with both theory and design. The availability of fast, single-ended, high-voltage pulsers has fueled a demand for suitable antennas to radiate the signal.

40|$|A Half Impulse <b>Radiating</b> <b>Antenna</b> (HIRA) was {{constructed}} from {{one half of}} an aluminum 1 m diameter parabolic dish with a focal length of 0. 383 m. The HIRA had two feed arms with a combined impedance in air of 100 W. The step function response of the HIRA was measured in the time domain using a TEM horn sensor. The radiated field in V/m was computed from the raw voltage by deconvolution with the impulse response of the TEM sensor. The radiated field measurements at 3, 10, and 20 meters are in good agreement with numerical predictions. The HIRA was further characterized by recording the TDR of the antenna, by tabulating the half power and half voltage spot size at 20 m, and by computing the impulse response of the antenna in both the time and frequency domains.
