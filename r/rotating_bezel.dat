50|$|Valbray is an {{independent}} Swiss watch company co-founded by Côme de Valbray and Olga Corsini in 2009. The brand's collection {{is based on a}} patented, camera-shutter-like dial system called Oculus that enables indications, mechanisms or art on the dial to be displayed or concealed by <b>rotating</b> the <b>bezel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 2) The Omega Seamaster Bullhead calibre 930 {{with over}} and under {{chronograph}} function in stainless steel. The watch marketed {{as a sports}} / drivers watch {{as part of the}} chronostop range and featured and internal <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel</b> which could be adjusted through a crown at six o’clock.|$|E
50|$|The Seamaster Professional Diver 300 M {{and then}} later the 600 M Planet Ocean was worn by James Bond in five Bond movies. These Seamasters are made of {{stainless}} steel on a stainless steel bracelet, fitted with a blue dial, unidirectional <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel</b> with blue ring and a sapphire crystal.|$|E
50|$|The Bullhead {{variation}} of the calibre 930 movement was also produced branded by Bucherer and Lemania as well a Richard chronograph. There was also a non date variation produced by Lemania without the internal <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel</b> {{as well as a}} composite cased model produced by Tissot as part of their Sidereal range.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{known as}} the [...] "Flight Officer", a rank in the early Army Air Forces, the watch's unique <b>rotating</b> 12-hour <b>bezel</b> and 23 cities printed on the {{periphery}} of the dial (face) made it possible to calculate changes in the time as a pilot flew across lines of longitude.|$|R

5000|$|... 1938: Commissioned by Senator Harry S Truman {{staff for}} the pilots of the U.S. Army Air Forces, Gallet creates the Flight Officer chronograph. This {{wristwatch}} provides {{a combination of}} innovations. Besides the ability to accurately record events ranging from 1/5 second to 30 minutes in duration, the <b>rotating</b> 12-hour <b>bezel</b> and dial (face) printed with the major cities gives pilots the ability to calculate changes in the time as lines of longitude are crossed. Truman wears a Gallet Flying Officer during his two terms as US president.|$|R
50|$|On diving watches, the <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel</b> used {{to measure}} dive time has a ratchet and can only be turned counter-clockwise. If the bezel is {{inadvertently}} rotated during the dive, it will give a false reading of increased time spent below. This protects the diver from underestimating their decompression obligation, which could cause decompression sickness.|$|E
50|$|A 24-hour {{watch with}} {{multiple}} hour hands or a <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel</b> is particularly useful for displaying {{the time in}} multiple time zones. Rolex was asked to create what {{is considered to be}} the original version of this watch by Pan American Airlines in the 1950s, and as a result they made the Rolex GMT Master II.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a limited}} (20 units) version of Phantom {{inspired}} by the modern metropolis. It included leather upholstery in Aetherius Grey, 6,800 two-tone stitches depicting an abstract image of a skyscraper at the central rear seat, a <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel</b> expressing 24 of the great cities {{of the world and}} their time zones (including Paris) at central console, Darkest Tungsten body colour ...|$|E
50|$|When fully wound, Harwood's watch {{would run}} for 12 hours autonomously. It {{did not have}} a {{conventional}} stem winder, so the hands were moved manually by <b>rotating</b> a <b>bezel</b> around the face of the watch. The watches were first produced with the help of Swiss watch manufacturer Fortis and went on sale in 1928. 30,000 were made before the Harwood Self-Winding Watch Company collapsed in 1931 in the Great Depression. 'Bumper' watches were the first commercially successful automatic watches; they were made by several high grade watch manufacturers during the 1930s and 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|... 5 - Minolta-35 Model EFrom late 1951 {{at about}} serial number 15,000, the camera model {{designation}} was engraved {{on the camera}} front in the upper {{right corner of the}} lens mount plate, starting at model E. At this stage, a mechanical flash synchronization receptacle was provided at the back just below the accessory shoe. The viewfinder now has an eyesight adjustment, accomplished by <b>rotating</b> the eyepiece <b>bezel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{premise of}} Valbray’s {{collection}} was to incorporate an element into the dial of a watch that {{was similar to}} the shutter of a camera. Valbray invented and designed the mechanism over two years and called it the [...] "Oculus". The Oculus dial comprises 16 single blades 0.05 mm in height that changes the look of the dial by covering and uncovering it. It is manually opened and closed by <b>rotating</b> the watch’s <b>bezel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Resistance to salty water. The watches {{under test}} shall {{be put in}} a 30 g/l NaCl (sodium chloride) {{solution}} and kept there for 24 hours at 18 to 25 °C. This test water solution has salinity comparable to normal seawater. After this test, the case and accessories shall be examined for any possible changes. Moving parts, particularly the <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel,</b> shall be checked for correct functioning.|$|E
5000|$|The Autavia {{chronograph}} {{was introduced}} in 1962 and featured a <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel,</b> marked in either hours, minutes, decimal minutes (1/100th minute increments), or with a tachymeter scale. All manual-wind Autavias from the 1960s had a black dial, with white registers. Early cases had a screw-back and later models (from and after 1968) had snap-backs. The [...] "Autavia" [...] name had previously been used on Heuer's dashboard timers (described above).|$|E
50|$|The bezel on the Valbray EL 1 Chrono was {{developed}} to mimic {{the look and feel}} of adjusting the focal distance on the lens of a Leica using Valbray’s own Oculus diaphragm, which comprises 16 single blades and acts as a cover for the dial. It is opened and closed by turning the <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel</b> found on the 46 mm titanium case. The time display is readable whether the Oculus is opened or closed, while the chronograph displays are hidden by it when it is closed.|$|E
50|$|Some {{tachymeter}} {{scales are}} on a <b>rotating,</b> indexed <b>bezel.</b> This allows two additional modes of use: The tachymeter bezel can be aligned with a free running second hand, and, more subtly, {{can be used to}} find the average speed over longer times/distances. Set the rotary bezel index to the position of the minute hand, note the current mileage/distance. Glance at the position of the minute hand on the tachymeter scale 60 units of distance later, and average speed will be indicated. A little mental math allows interim averages, easiest at 1/4 (15 unit) and other integer values. Alternatively, instead of using minute hand, align index bezel to the second hand and observe passing one unit of distance when position of the second hand will then indicate average speed.|$|R
50|$|Tuomas Vohlonen {{was granted}} a patent number 16121 on October 12, 1934. It was for a device in a compass to measure the angle. It was {{described}} as being in a bezel, in which there were diagonal grooves, screws or other alike to place a ruler, pen or alike, to <b>rotate</b> a <b>bezel</b> to align with the north of map. On a first trial, Physica sued Vohlonen on a basis that the device already existed and was well known before the date of patent application. On the second trial of the same question, Physica sued Vohlonen, because they didn’t consider the device to be any followance of creative work to be considered an innovation, let alone to be worth patenting. Also, they considered the patent to disturb their business and thus, they demanded the patent to be void. On the first trial, the supreme court judged the patent to be effective. On the second trial, Vohlonen family didn’t even respond, saying the matter was already solved in the first trial. The supreme court gave its final statement on February 25, 1944, according to which the court didn’t chance the verdict of the first trial.|$|R
50|$|The {{exclusive}} {{use of a}} <b>rotating</b> <b>bezel</b> is considered a rudimentary diving technique in the 21st century, suitable for basic, shallow single gas (air) diving only. Non-basic diving profiles and depths past 30 m require other more advanced timing and measuring methods to establish suitable decompression profiles to avoid decompression sickness.Besides for basic diving and as a backup for monitoring time during more complex preplanned diving, the one-way bezel {{can also be used}} for other situations in which a measurement of elapsed time of under one hour might be useful, like cooking.|$|E
