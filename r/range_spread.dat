5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host <b>range.</b> <b>Spread</b> of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E
500|$|The global {{population}} of the common starling {{is estimated to be}} more than 310million individuals and its numbers are not thought to be declining significantly, so the bird is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. It had shown a marked increase in numbers throughout Europe from the 19th century to around the 1950s and 60s. In about 1830, S. v. vulgaris expanded its range in the British Isles, spreading into Ireland and areas of Scotland where it had formerly been absent, although S. v. zetlandicus was already present in Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. The common starling has bred in northern Sweden from 1850 and in Iceland from 1935. The breeding <b>range</b> <b>spread</b> through southern France to northeastern Spain, and there were other range expansions particularly in Italy, Austria and Finland. It started breeding in Iberia in 1960, while the spotless starling's range had been expanding northward since the 1950s. The low rate of advance, about [...] per year for both species, is due to the suboptimal mountain and woodland terrain. Expansion has since slowed even further due to direct competition between the two similar species where they overlap in southwestern France and northwestern Spain.|$|E
2500|$|The Ochoco Mountains {{in central}} Oregon form {{the western end}} of the Blue Mountains province. [...] The Blue Mountains are not a single {{cohesive}} range, but rather a complex of ranges and inter-mountain basins and valleys that extend from southeast Washington into central Oregon, ending near Prineville. [...] The Ochoco portion of the province is part of a wide uplifted plateau made of rocks from the Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic periods (300 to 200million years old) that were transported by the Pacific Plate and accreted in the late Mesozoic era (about 100million years ago) as part of a vast shallow sea, then slowly uplifted by volcanic eruptions during the Eocene epoch (50 to 37million years ago) to form the Clarno Formation. [...] From 37 to 17million years ago, eruptions in the western Cascade <b>Range</b> <b>spread</b> ash across eastern Oregon, forming the John Day Formation. [...] From 17 to 14million years ago, major volcanic eruptions covered much of the province with basalt flows, creating the Columbia River Basalt Group.

5000|$|The {{disease can}} infect trees {{as young as}} 6 years-old, and infects trees {{throughout}} their lifespan. Diagnostic symptoms include crown yellowing and thinning, a distress crop of cones, red brown stained outer heartwood, and laminate decay (decay that separates along annual rings). The disease tends to occur in patches due to a primarily short <b>range</b> <b>spread</b> mechansism. Infected or decayed roots break close to the root collar forming “root balls.” [...] Laminated root rot is frequently detected during ground survey when canopy openings and standing dead and fallen trees are observed. Signs of laminated root rot include the setal hyphae (tiny hairlike hyphae) between sheets of decomposing wood and also buff colored mycelium {{on the outside of}} the roots.|$|E
5000|$|APOLLO {{is based}} on {{measuring}} the time-of-flight of a short-pulse laser reflected from a distant target—in this case the retroreflector arrays on the Moon. Each burst of light lasts 100 picoseconds (ps). [...] One millimeter in range corresponds to only 6.7 ps of round-trip travel time.However, the retroreflectors on the Moon introduce more than one millimeter of error themselves. They are not usually at an exact right angle to the incoming beam, so the different corner cubes of the retroreflectors are at different distances from the transmitter. This is because the Moon, although it keeps one face to the Earth, does not do so exactly—it wobbles {{from side to side}} and up and down, by as much as 10° in magnitude. (See libration.) These librations occur since the Moon rotates at constant speed, but has an elliptical and inclined orbit. This effect may seem small, but it is not only measurable, it forms the largest unknown in finding the range, since {{there is no way to}} tell which corner cube reflected each photon. The biggest array, the [...] Apollo 15 reflector, can have a corner-to-corner <b>range</b> <b>spread</b> of ≈ 1.2 sin(10°) m, or 210 mm, or about 1.4 ns of round-trip time. The root-mean-square (RMS) <b>range</b> <b>spread</b> is then about 400 ps. To determine the distance to the reflector to 1 mm precision, or 7 ps, by averaging, the measurement needs at least (400/7)2 ≈ 3000 photons. This explains why a much larger system is needed to improve the existing measurements—the pre-APOLLO 2 cm RMS range precision required only about 10 photons, even at the worst-case orientation of the retroreflector array.|$|E

50|$|Its {{original}} <b>range</b> <b>spread</b> {{from far}} northern Canada to {{as far south}} as North Carolina, but it has been extirpated from the southerly portions of its original range. Like most plants in North America, deforestation and competition with invasive ornamentals (especially shade-loving groundcovers, such as English ivy or winter creeper commonly sold at garden centers) probably hurts the creeping snowberry significantly. As a result, it has been extirpated from some of its original range and classified as rare in several states. Despite this, its international status has been evaluated as secure. This is because it is still quite common in its more northerly range of greater Canada. However, deforestation and exotic invasion are continuing problems that affect all forest species in both Canada and the United States.|$|E

40|$|On December 25, 2004, a {{large-scale}} ionospheric plasma bubble was observed over Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, inducing significant <b>range</b> <b>spreading</b> on ionograms.

A derivation of the dispersion relations for X and O mode waves transmitted from an ionosonde and an analysis of the collisional Rayleigh-Taylor instability leading to an expression for the growth rate are presented as background information. Ray tracing code developed by Nathan Dalrymple, a previous graduate student of Professor Min-Chang Lee, is extended, first to draw refractive index surfaces to illustrate a key principle in ray tracing and later to simulate <b>range</b> <b>spreading</b> due to depleted ionospheric ducts [1]. Data from Arecibo incoherent scatter radar and Arecibo's CADI digisonde is examined showing strong evidence {{for the development of a}} plasma bubble following a rise in the plasma layer and the appearance of a horizontal density gradient. In one portion of the ionosphere, this gradient is found to be at an angle of approximately 70 degrees to the Earth's magnetic field, a favorable condition for the excitation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability over Arecibo. by Seth E.
