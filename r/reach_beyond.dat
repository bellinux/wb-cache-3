5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> {{the boundaries of the}} cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E
25|$|After World War II Capital Airlines joined Eastern at RDU; Piedmont Airlines {{arrived in}} 1948. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 36 departures a day: twenty Eastern, eight Capital and eight Piedmont. Nonstop flights did not <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> Washington, Atlanta, or the Appalachians (but Eastern started a Super Constellation nonstop to Newark in 1958). The next airline (aside from United's {{takeover}} of Capital in 1961) was Delta Air Lines in 1970. In April 1969 nonstops didn't <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> New York or Atlanta, and Chicago {{was the only}} nonstop west of the Appalachians.|$|E

25|$|The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 11 weekday departures on Braniff, 10 TWA, 4 Continental, 3 Central and 2 Ozark. Nonstop flights did not <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> Denver, Amarillo, Oklahoma City and Kansas City. TWA had {{the first}} {{scheduled}} jet flights, in 1964.|$|E
25|$|While space {{limitations}} prevent a detailed overview {{of all of}} the programming on the Blue Network during its 1943–1945 period, there are a few examples of programming that can be cited to show how the Blue was striving to <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> its previous reputation, and compete head-on with CBS and NBC as a stand-alone network.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} {{waited until}} smoke and fire overcame them. The fire department arrived quickly {{but was unable}} to stop the flames, as there were no ladders available that could <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> the sixth floor.

25|$|Map {{coloring}} {{is another}} form of symbology, one whose importance can <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the gamut that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the mid-1990s, China Southern {{sought to}} expand its {{international}} <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> Asia. In December 1995, the Chinese and US governments signed an aviation agreement {{that would allow the}} commencement of non-stop air services between the two countries. After having been granted the right to establish services to Amsterdam in early 1996, the airline started Guangzhou–Beijing–Amsterdam, its first long-haul route, in November 1996. The following year, the carrier commenced non-stop trans-Pacific services Los Angeles, as well as services to Brisbane.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine Iconoclasm {{acted as}} a barrier to {{developments}} in the East, but by the 9th century art was again permitted. The Transfiguration of Jesus was a major theme in the East and every Eastern Orthodox monk who took up iconography had to start his craft by producing the icon of the Transfiguration. Whereas Western depictions aim for proportion, the abolition of perspective and alterations in the size and proportion of an image in Eastern icons aim to <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> man's earthly dwellings.|$|E

25|$|A classic {{symbol of}} Native America, the canoe {{has become a}} notable object scene {{throughout}} Lowe's work. A canoeist by recreation, Lowe attempts to <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> stereotypes and classic imagery by using the iconic canoe in his work. He also embraces his fascination with primitive structures, seeing the canoe both as a shelter and as a vehicle. Many of the canoes appear like wigwams; constructed wooden skeletons of various shapes and sizes, with curved aspects. The canoe is also represented mnemonically in selected works by way of highly constructed small sculptures.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} Byzantine Iconoclasm {{acted as a}} barrier to {{developments}} in the East, but by the 9th century art was permitted again. The Transfiguration of Jesus was a major theme in the East and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon painting had to prove his craft by painting an icon of the Transfiguration. However, while Western depictions increasingly aimed at realism, in Eastern icons a low regard for perspective and alterations in the size and proportion of an image aim to <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> earthly reality to a spitual meaning.|$|E
25|$|He also {{introduced}} the major advance of hull shapes which can plane, and which can therefore <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> the usual speed limits for small sailing boats. In effect, a boat which is planing is skimming along the surface, with {{the bow of}} the boat not in the water. This results in less friction because of reduced waterline length, reduced displacement (the amount of water needing to be pushed aside by the boat), and reduced 'wetted area'. The driving force provided by the sails has to overcome less resistance, and therefore speed increases dramatically.|$|E

25|$|The {{first five}} {{airlines}} of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport were TWA, Capital Airlines (later part of United), Northwest, All American (later Allegheny Airlines, then USAir, and finally US Airways), and Eastern Airlines. The April 1957 Airline Guide shows 58 weekday departures on Capital, 54 TWA, 18 Allegheny, 8 United, 7 Eastern, 4 Northwest, 3 American and 2 Lake Central. Eastern had nonstops to Miami, but westward nonstops did not <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> St Louis. TWA had an overnight Lockheed 1049G Super Constellation nonstop from Los Angeles ("Berths Available"). The first jets were TWA 707s on the LAX-ORD-PIT round trip in summer 1959.|$|E
25|$|M. robusta was not {{considered}} to be separate from the New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) until 1962, when it was suggested as a subspecies. It was not recognized as a completely separate species within Mystacinidae until 1985, long after it was thought to have become extinct. Morphologically, M. robusta is larger than M. tuberculata with specimens of the former having a mean forearm length of 45.3-47.5mm as opposed to the latter, 40-45mm, which also has larger ears that <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> the muzzle when pushed forward. It is described as having a wingspan of 300mm and a body length of 90mm.|$|E
25|$|The American command {{did not see}} {{the need}} for {{long-range}} fighters in 1942, and like Bomber Command in the early war period, believed the bomber would always get through. On that understanding, there was no rush to develop fighter aircraft of this type. The twin-engined mid-range Lockheed P-38 Lightning had been designed as a high-altitude interceptor and was adequate in the escort role. Production had not yet reached the output needed and losses in the Mediterranean had diverted the P-38 strength there. As an interim solution the Americans were given the British Spitfire, but it lacked the range to <b>reach</b> <b>beyond</b> the coastal areas of western Europe.|$|E
