40|$|This {{project has}} been {{developed}} at the company Gavlegardarna. The company owns {{a large part of}} the buildings of Gävle and two of them are the objective of the project. Gavlegardana is highly concerned about the environment; for this reason, they cooperate on the subject with the energy management from their technical department. Gävle is one of the Swedish cities where the DH (district heating) network is distributed, arriving to most of the dwellings, industries and commercial buildings. As DH uses environmentally friendly sources of energy, Gavlegardana is introducing it in its buildings. Electrical <b>radiators</b> <b>and</b> <b>boilers</b> were installed in the buildings when the price of electricity was more affordable than nowadays. The price of the electricity can be considered 1, 23 SEK/kWh while the DH price is 0, 45 SEK/kWh. Consequently, this is another reason why the objective of the company at the present time is to replace electrical space heating systems by means of district heating. The energy balance of the buildings is analysed in order to study their current energy situation. This entails the consideration of heat gains and losses involved. The heat gains of the building are the heat from solar radiation which arrives at the building trough the windows, the heat internally generated (by persons, lighting and other devices) and the heat supplied. The heat losses are composed by the transmission trough walls and windows, the infiltrations, the heat used for hot tap water and the ventilation losses. An important part of the work required to calculate the energy balance has consisted of the collection and organization of all the data (areas, types of material, electrical devices, lighting, number of employees, opening hours [...] .). This data comes from the drawings of the buildings provided by the company and from the information gathered during the visits to the installation. In addition, the ventilation flows were measured in-situ using the tools provided by Theorells. Gavle Energi, the DH distributor company, has been contacted in order to fix the cost and other details related to the district heating connection. The heat exchanger models, selected from Palmat System AB, are TP 20 for Building A and TP 10 for Building B. TP 20 provides 100 kW of heating and 0, 4 l/s of hot tap water and TP 10 provides 50 kW and 0, 31 l/s respectively. The capital cost is 187500 SEK which includes the heat exchangers and the connection cost. As the secondary circuit is not currently installed because the existing system is composed by electrical radiators, the installation of the piping network in the building has been designed. The radiators’ power is calculated taking into account the need of heat in each room which is estimated as the transmission losses. This need of heat calculated is higher than the energy currently supplied which means that the thermal comfort is not achieved in all the rooms of the buildings. In spite of using more energy for space heating, the change of heat source entails a lower energy cost per year. The selected radiators are from Epecon and the investment cost (including the installation) is 203671 SEK. The brand of the selected pipes is Broson and the investment cost of the total piping system is 66000 SEK. The initial investment of the new installation is 457171 SEK, considering the DH connection, heat exchangers, radiators and pipes. If the initial investment is totally paid in cash by the company the payback will be fulfilled in 6 years. In case of borrowing the money from the bank (considering an interest rate of 5...|$|E

40|$|NASA is {{considering}} {{the establishment of}} a manned lunar base within the next few decades. To house and protect the crew from the harsh lunar environment, a habitat is required. A proposed habitat is an spherical, inflatable module. Heat generated in the module must be rejected to maintain a temperature suitable for human habitation. This report presents a conceptual design of a thermal control system for an inflatable lunar module. The design solution includes heat acquisition, heat transport, and heat rejection subsystems. The report discusses alternative designs and design solutions {{for each of the three}} subsystems mentioned above. Alternative subsystems for heat acquisition include a single water-loop, a single air-loop, and a double water-loop. The vapor compression cycle, vapor absorption cycle, and metal hydride absorption cycle are the three alternative transport subsystems. Alternative rejection subsystems include flat plate radiators, the liquid droplet <b>radiator,</b> <b>and</b> reflux <b>boiler</b> <b>radiators.</b> Feasibility studies on alternatives of each subsystem showed that the single water-loop, the vapor compression cycle, <b>and</b> the reflux <b>boiler</b> <b>radiator</b> were the most feasible alternatives. The design team combined the three subsystems to come up with an overall system design. Methods of controlling the system to adapt it for varying conditions within the module and in the environment are presented. Finally, the report gives conclusions and recommendations for further study of thermal control systems for lunar applications...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary notes When {{heat pumps}} {{are used in}} {{refurbishment}} of complex HVAC systems in buildings, high ratio of produced thermal energy and consumed electric energy must be achieved, while operating conditions of existing installations which are usually not renewed have to be maintained. The results of energy efficiency study for hospital complex situated in Rovinj (Croatia) have been presented in the paper. Possible heat pump systems suitable for renewal of the existing thermal energy supply system have been presented and analyzed. New concept has been proposed. Existing <b>boiler</b> room <b>and</b> distribution pipelines, including <b>radiators</b> <b>and</b> hot water <b>boilers</b> in buildings would remain unchanged as the backup system. VRF heat pump systems with water loop as the heat source and sink would be added. Eventual lack or surplus of thermal energy in water loop would be exchanged with sea water or a first stage heat pump. The reconstruction enables achievement of higher comfort level with still acceptable investment in energetic infrastructure. Numerica...|$|R

40|$|The NASA Swift {{mission has}} a 600 -km {{altitude}} and a 22 degrees maximum inclination. The sun angle varies from 45 degrees to 180 degrees in normal operation. As a result, environmental heat fluxes {{absorbed by the}} Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) <b>radiator</b> <b>and</b> loop heat pipe (LHP) compensation chambers (CCs) vary transiently. Therefore the equivalent sink temperatures for the <b>radiator</b> <b>and</b> CCs varies transiently. In thermal performance verification testing in vacuum, the <b>radiator</b> <b>and</b> CCs radiated heat to sink targets. This paper presents an analytical technique for generating orbit transient equivalent sink temperatures and a technique for generating transient sink target temperatures for the <b>radiator</b> <b>and</b> LHP CCs. Using these techniques, transient target temperatures for the <b>radiator</b> <b>and</b> LHP CCs were generated for three thermal environmental cases: worst hot case, worst cold case, and cooldown and warmup between worst hot case in sunlight and worst cold case in the eclipse, and three different heat transport values: 128 W, 255 W, and 382 W. The 128 W case assumed that the two LHPs transport 255 W equally to the radiator. The 255 W case assumed that one LHP fails so that the remaining LHP transports all the waste heat from the detector array to the radiator. The 382 W case assumed that one LHP fails so that the remaining LHP transports all the waste heat from the detector array to the <b>radiator,</b> <b>and</b> has a 50 % design margin. All these transient target temperatures were successfully implemented in the engineering test unit (ETU) LHP and flight LHP thermal performance verification tests in vacuum...|$|R
