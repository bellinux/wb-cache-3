50|$|During {{the early}} 1940s Axis {{engineers}} developed a sonic cannon {{that could cause}} fatal vibrations in its target body. A methane gas combustion chamber leading to two parabolic dishes pulse-detonated at roughly 44 Hz. This sound, magnified by the dish reflectors, caused vertigo and nausea at 200 - 400 m by vibrating the middle ear bones and shaking the cochlear fluid within the inner ear. At distances of 50 - 200 m, the sound waves could act on organ tissues and fluids by repeatedly compressing and releasing compressive resistant organs such as the kidneys, spleen, and liver. (It had little detectable effect on malleable organs such as the heart, stomach and intestines.) Lung tissue was affected at only the closest ranges as atmospheric air is highly compressible and only the blood rich alveoli resist compression. In practice, the weapon system was highly vulnerable to enemy fire. Rifle, bazooka and mortar <b>rounds</b> easily <b>deformed</b> the parabolic reflectors, rendering the wave amplification ineffective.|$|R
40|$|The Restacked Rod Process (RRP) is the Nb 3 Sn strand {{technology}} presently {{producing the}} largest critical current densities at 4. 2 K and 12 T. However, when subject to plastic deformation, RRP subelements (SE) {{were found to}} merge into each other, creating larger filaments with a somewhat continuous barrier. In this case, the strand sees a larger effective filament size, deff, and its instability can dramatically increase locally leading to cable quench. To reduce and possibly eliminate this effect, Oxford Instruments Superconducting Technology (OST) developed for FNAL a modified RRP strand design with larger Cu spacing between SE’s arranged in a 60 / 61 array. Strand samples of this design with sizes from 0. 7 to 1 mm were first evaluated for transport current properties. A comparison study was then performed between the regular 54 / 61 and the modified 60 / 61 design using 0. 7 mm <b>round</b> and <b>deformed</b> strands. Finite element modeling of the deformed strands was also performed with ANSYS...|$|R
40|$|The lower oceanic crust largely {{consists}} of cumulates, representing crystallization products from melt that erupt {{on the ocean}} floor. Removal of interstitial melt from the cumulate minerals {{is believed to be}} efficient, driven by compaction. Reaction between percolating melts and cumulate minerals can result in micron-to-meter-scale variations in the phase assemblage and composition. Here we report on the results of a highly detailed petrological study of a sequence of lower crustal gabbroic rocks, using textural and chemical criteria to reconstruct the complex interplay between reactive melts and a highly crystallized gabbroic mush. The exceptionally well-preserved gabbroic sequence was recovered during IODP Legs 304 and 305 at the Atlantis Massif. These gabbros are characterized by high-frequency magmatic refilling of a mush zone, as attested by the cm-m thick succession of magmatic layers, with sharp to diffuse contact. The main gabbroic body (between 300 and 1100 mbsf) is bounded by two layers of olivine rich troctolites interpreted as pervasively fluxed mantle rocks. Closely spaced sampling of the intervals 930 - 980 and 1130 - 1190 mbsf reveal evolved gabbroic lithologies closely interspersed with more primitive members. Olivine and plagioclase consumption is accompanied by progressive crystallization of clinopyroxene (cpx) and later orthopyroxene (opx). Both initially appear as interstitial grains, followed by poikilitic and granophyric textures. The onset of reactive percolation is often associated with deformation, recorded as kink bands in relict olivine and plagioclase and wavy mineral contacts wet by thin cpx layers. As a result, plagioclase and olivine chadacrysts in cpx and opx have resorbed appearance (<b>rounded</b> <b>deformed</b> chadacrysts in large undeformed oikocrysts). Typical chemical signatures of this incomplete resorption are high Ni in pyroxene-hosted low-Fo olivines. Resorbed plagioclases have higher REE and positive Sr correlation with Ba attesting to a progressive equilibration with evolved melts. Simple fractional accumulation in a closed system is unable to fit the observed cpx and opx trends. Large deviations from linear correlations require an influx of primitive material in an ongoing differentiating system. Based on the observed consumption of the primitive assemblage we calculate high rates of assimilation of primitive cumulates. However, the assimilation ratio estimated from cpx trace element contents is much higher than that required to fit the opx trends. These observations attest for a multistage evolution of the sampled rocks: the process starts as near-fractional crystallization, reaching high degrees of crystallinity before melt percolation induces olivine and plagioclase resorption, increasing porosity and crystallizing clinopyroxene. The subsequent crystallization of opx is characterized by a decrease of the assimilation rate and porosity reduction. As such reactive signatures have been reported from other oceanic gabbros, AFC processes in the lower oceanic crust are possibly widespread and may strongly contribute to the compositional systematic observed in global MORB...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{demonstrated}} {{here for the}} first time how Palaeoproterozoic stromatolites survived seismic disturbance of their substrate. The stromatolites under study could have been cyanobacteria or any other photoautotrophic microbes, which formed mats that covered a substrate of very fine-grained sandstones and mudstones of the Chaibasa Fm. in eastern India. The sediments represent a shelf environment. The local abundance of the stromatolites suggests that the low-energy environment formed a suitable habitat. The common phases of tectonic quiescence were, however, occasionally interrupted by seismic shocks. These were sufficiently strong to deform the mat layers, the lower parts of which might already have been (semi-) consolidated. The mats became partly folded, partly faulted, and already consolidated parts of the stromatolite layers broke off. This can be deduced from the angular shapes of part of the broken-off fragments. It appears, however, that part of these fragments were still sufficiently soft to become <b>rounded</b> and <b>deformed</b> by rolling over the seafloor, probably under the influence of tidal currents. When come to rest, these fragments served as a new substrate for new generations of the micro-organisms. These micro-organisms thus survived by continued growth on the reworked fragments and built up new stromatolites that may show an ‘angular disconformity’ with the stromatolites of their substrate. It thus is shown that stromatolites have an adequate response to a sudden disturbance of their habitat, and that they survive earthquakes by colonization of broken-off fragments. We call the ‘healed’ fragments ‘tomboliths’ (tumbled stones) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of concrete-rebar bond and fibre content on the {{capacity}} and ductility of steel fibre reinforced concrete beams. In this paper, beams with different proportions of steel fibre and different bar types are tested. Three sets of steel fibre reinforced concrete beams are made with 0 %, 1 %, and 2 % steel fibres by volume. All beams are singly reinforced with three different bar types; <b>deformed</b> bars, plain <b>round</b> bars, and <b>deformed</b> bars unbonded in the central one-third length. All beams are designed for flexure failure, and two equal point loads are applied symmetrically to generate a constant moment region in the central span between the point loads. Test results show that beams containing steel fibres have higher yield load, possess better post-yield load carrying capacity, and are more ductile than the beams made of plain concrete. Although beams with deformed bars possess higher post-yield load carrying capacity and are more ductile than beams with round and unbonded bars, this difference diminishes {{with the addition of}} fibres...|$|R
5000|$|An unanticipated {{problem was}} that the drivers complained of {{disorientation}} when the turret was rotated, contrary to the predictions of the designers who felt the location of the cupola near the center of rotation would eliminate this effect. The German 120mm gun proved excellent, but the XM-150 gun/launcher had serious problems. The similar but smaller XM81 gun/launcher mounted on the M551 Sheridan proved to be just as troublesome.There were also several problems with the ammunition. The caseless design made conventional tank rounds too vulnerable to water. Wet rounds expanded so they would not fit into the barrel anymore or left hard residues after being fired. The auto-loader was capable of handling the Shillelagh missile without problems, but the combustible cases of the tank <b>rounds</b> could be <b>deformed</b> by it. As is often a problem with caseless ammunition, the ammunition also had a tendency to [...] "cook-off", or fire prematurely, due to heat build-up in the barrel from previously fired rounds. The attempted solution, to only carry a single round with the balance in missiles, also proved unacceptable. Deployment of the 20mm anti-aircraft cannon also proved difficult and the weapon itself was overcomplicated and nearly impossible to use effectively.|$|R
40|$|The {{island of}} Iona is {{composed}} predominantly of Lewisian gneisses with Torridonian sediments outcropping {{on the east}} side. The Lewisian gneisses include {{a wide range of}} lithological types. The prevalent quartzfeldspathic gneisses are biotite-hornblende-bearing, potash-rich and potash-poor varieties and hypersthene-biotite-garnet gneisses. Metasediments outcrop in two associations (i) within a sequence of basic and ultrabasic rocks (the ‘Amphibolite Group’) and (ii) in the NW of Iona (the NW Paragneisses). The Amphibolite Group contains concordant marble and iron-rich horizons which delineate the major fold structures in south and west Iona. Chemical analyses of the metasediments and basic rocks in the Amphibolite Group indicate that the sequence was probably originally a supracrustal group composed of tuffs, lavas, impure limestone and iron-rich chemical deposits. The NW paragneiss group may be a younger group of metasediments comprising graphite-quartz marbles, calc-silicate layers, graphitic schists, and garnet schists. The tectonic history of the gneisses divides into six main deformations. The first (D₁) is represented by isoclinal intrafolial hinges with a penetrative S₁ foliation. The second deformation produced isoclinal folds with <b>rounded</b> hinges <b>deforming</b> the S₁ foliation. D₃ generated tight asymmetrical folds accompanied by a hornblende granulite facies metamorphism with syntectonic mineral growths defining S₃ and L₃, and axial planar pegmatite veins. The axial planes are generally at low angles to the foliation, which typically trends NE or E. D₄ folds are mostly large close folds with shallow short limbs and axial planes trending NE with NW dips, whilst D₆ formed open folds with N-trending axial planes, and accompanied by a high amphibolite facies metamorphism. Basic dykes were intruded at various stages of the tectonic sequence: before D₁, between D₁ and D₂, D₂ and D₃, and D₅ and D₆. The dykes can be divided into distinct types on petrographical, chemical, and structural grounds. One set, the Banded Dykes, is composed of two intimately associated assemblages, hornblende-two-pyroxene-plagioclase and garnet-quartz-clinopyroxene-plagioclase. The latter is thought to have developed from the former during waning temperatures at constant pressure during D₃. The Banded Dykes also have distinct selvedges of an unusual mineral assemblage, garnet-orthopyroxene-plagioclase, probably due in part to chilling of the dyke on intrusion but mostly formed by metasomatic interchange with the enclosing gneisses during D₂ and D₃. Another dyke set, the Well-Lineated Dykes, also has these distinctive selvedges. These dykes also display a very well defined lineation formed by elongated clots of mafic minerals, and have a more basic chemistry {{than any of the other}} dyke sets. They appear to be comparable to the two-pyroxene norites of the Assynt district. The Torridonian(?) sediments were deposited on the Lewisian after uplift and erosion. After consolidation they were probably metamorphosed at low greenschist facies. Activity on the Moine Thrust thrust the Moinian on to the Torridonian. Thrusting was accompanied by dynamic metamorphism, mylonitization of the Lewisian/Torridonian boundary, rotation of the Torridonian bedding planes to a steep SE dip and the formation of isoclinal folds, in association with a steep SE-dipping cleavage and an ESE elongation lineation. This deformation (D[subscript(t 1) ]) was followed by a generation of tight asymmetrical folds (D[subscript(t 2) ]) which deformed the mylonite foliation and was accompanied by a weak N-trending axial planar cleavage. D[subscript(t 3) ] produced kink bands and monoclonal folds with sub-horizontal fold axes, whilst D[subscript(t 4) ] caused conjugate or knee folds with NE- and SE-, and N- and E- trending axial planes. A pluton of adamellite, the Ross of Mull Granite, was intruded along the Moine Thrust plane after [subscript(t 2) ], and caused the thermal metamorphism of the Torridonian sediments, the mylonites and nearby Lewisian gneisses. The D[subscript(t 1) ] - D[subscript(t 4) ] events correlate closely with those occurring in the Moine Thrust zone between Durness and Skye...|$|R
