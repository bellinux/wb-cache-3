40|$|Årsliste 2000 The International {{maritime}} Organization (IMO) {{has agreed}} to a plan to implement {{a ban on the}} use of organotin for antifouling on large ships. One element in this plan was to establish a mechanism for addressing and evaluating antifouling systems other than those based on organotin. It was agreed that the mechanism for addressing antifouling systems should include a list of restricted antifouling systems. An expert group established by IMO will review proposals aiming at an inclusion of an antifouling agent/system on this list. The environmental data available to the experts will be of a composite nature covering physical/chemical properties, toxicity tests and community related observations in experimental ecosystems (mesocosms) and in the field. Understanding the full environmental relevance of different types of test results is difficult, even for experts. This report is meant to be a guide to how different types of test results and observations can be evaluated but is not intended as a ready to use manual on how to perform stringent evaluations It is anticipated that the report will be a contribution from Norwegian <b>Maritime</b> <b>Directorate</b> (NMD) to the efforts in IMO to establish methods for addressing and evaluating antifouling systems proposed {{to be included in the}} list of restricted substances.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{performance}} of the three elements of symbiosis in the <b>regional</b> <b>maritime</b> center and the eco-nomic development has been analyzed. At the same time, the coupling relationship between the maritime center and the economic development has been also quantitatively studied through taking the maritime center in Qinzhou as the example. The results show that although there is an apparent symbiosis tendency between the <b>regional</b> <b>maritime</b> center and the eco-nomic development, the symbiotic relationship is in the moderate position and the symbiotic mode is still fragile. The re-sults are consistent with the development of reality. Meanwhile, in view of the demands of integrated symbiotic develop-ment, the advice {{that it is necessary to}} optimize the symbiotic units from the base and optimize the symbiotic environment from the content has been provided in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Reporting {{of human}} {{accidents}} in the Norwegian Fishing Fleet {{has always been}} very difficult {{because there has been}} no tradition in making reports on all types of working accidents among fishermen, if the accident {{does not seem to be}} very serious or there is no economical incentive to report. Therefore reports are only written when the accidents are serious or if the fisherman is reported sick. Reports about an accident are sent to the insurance company, but another report should also be sent to the Norwegian <b>Maritime</b> <b>Directorate</b> (NMD). Comparing of data from one former insurance company and NMD shows that the real numbers of injuries or serious accidents among Norwegian fishermen could be up to two times more than the numbers reported to NMD. ...|$|R
