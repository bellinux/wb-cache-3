5|$|Tesla {{noted the}} hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early {{investigation}} of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the <b>Roentgen</b> <b>rays,</b> but by the ozone generated {{in contact with the}} skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.|$|E
25|$|In 1896 he {{also joined}} the US Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. While in Washington, he also {{continued}} his research at Johns Hopkins under Henry Augustus Rowland. Although he spent time {{working with the}} newly discovered <b>Roentgen</b> <b>Rays,</b> he ultimately graduated in 1903 with a Ph.D. in agriculture with a dissertation On the absorption of water vapor and of certain salts in aqueous solution by quartz. He was also elected to the Cosmos Club the same year.|$|E
500|$|In March 1896, {{after hearing}} of Wilhelm Röntgen's {{discovery}} of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography), Tesla proceeded {{to do his}} own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from {{the output of the}} Tesla Coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation). In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the [...] "instrument will... enable one to generate <b>Roentgen</b> <b>rays</b> of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} March an ironical outcome {{of all this}} spiritual {{severity}} {{that one of the}} greatest modern scientific discoveries should have been made in Wurzburg, and that the <b>Roentgen</b> <b>rays</b> should now be giving her name a splendor destined to eclipse the glories of her past.|$|E
60|$|Whoever {{carries a}} mental kodak with him (as I suspect I {{was in the}} habit of doing long before I knew it) must be aware of the {{uncertain}} value of the different exposures. This can be determined only by the process of developing, which requires a dark room and other apparatus not always at hand; and so much depends upon the process that it might be well if it could always be left to some one who makes a specialty of it, {{as in the case of}} the real amateur photographer. Then one's faulty impressions might be so treated as to yield a pictorial result of interest, or frankly thrown away if they showed hopeless to the instructed eye. Otherwise, one must do one's own developing, and trust the result, whatever it is, to the imaginative kindness of the reader, who will surely, if he is the right sort of reader, be able to sharpen the blurred details, to soften the harsh lights, and blend the shadows in a subordination giving due relief to the best meaning of the print. This is what I fancy myself to be doing now, and if any one shall say that my little pictures are superficial, I shall not be able to gainsay him. I can only answer that most pictures represent the surfaces of things; but at the same time I can fully share the disappointment of those who would prefer some such result as the employment of the <b>Roentgen</b> <b>rays</b> would have given, if applied to certain aspects of the London world.|$|E
