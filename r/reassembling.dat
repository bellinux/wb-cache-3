5|$|On 5October 1915, King {{embarked}} for Egypt aboard HMAT Themistocles, {{as part of}} the reinforcements for the 12th Regiment of the 4th Light Horse Brigade. He {{joined the}} 12th Light Horse at Heliopolis in February 1916, as the unit was <b>reassembling</b> following its service in the Gallipoli Campaign. The regiment was engaged in the defence of the Suez Canal during May, and subsequently undertook patrols and sorties in the Sinai Desert.|$|E
40|$|Initial {{experiments}} in our laboratory have successfully <b>reassembled</b> infectious polyoma virions from dissociated virion products. Virions treated with ethyleneglycol-bis-N,N'-tetraacetic acid and the reducing agent beta-mercaptoethanol at pH 7. 5 were dissociated to a 48 S DNA-protein complex and capsomere subunits. The virion dissociation products were not infectious by plaque assay and lacked hemagglutination activity. These virion dissociation products were <b>reassembled</b> to intact virions by overnight dialysis against a reassembly buffer containing CaCl 2, dimethyl sulfoxide, and Triton X- 100 in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7. 4. The biophysical {{characteristics of the}} <b>reassembled</b> virions were identical to those of untreated virions in that the <b>reassembled</b> virions had a sedimentation value of 240 S in sucrose gradients and a buoyant density of 1. 315 g/cm 3 in CsCl isopycnic gradients. The <b>reassembled</b> virions were intact as determined by electron microscopy and {{were found to be}} 60 % resistant to DNase I treatment. Biologically, the <b>reassembled</b> purified virions were found to partially regain both hemagglutinating activity and plaque-forming ability...|$|R

5|$|The 87th Division {{returned}} to the United States in July 1945 expecting to {{be called upon to}} play a role in the defeat of the Japanese, but the sudden termination of the war in the Pacific while the division was <b>reassembling</b> at Fort Benning changed the future of the 87th. The Division was inactivated on 21 September 1945. The 87th Reconnaissance Troop was deactivated on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace with}} Britain {{proved to be}} uneasy and controversial. Britain did not {{evacuate}} Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and his Act of Mediation, which established a new Swiss Confederation. Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly. The dispute culminated in {{a declaration of war}} by Britain in May 1803; Napoleon responded by <b>reassembling</b> the invasion camp at Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|Burtt {{had visited}} Niagara Falls in 1987 {{and used his}} {{recordings}} from his trip for the sounds of wind. He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed it around {{the parking lot and}} then let it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and <b>reassembling</b> handcuffs.|$|E

40|$|Virus {{particles}} were <b>reassembled</b> {{in vitro}} from tomato aspermy virus strain V (V-TAV) RNA and {{a mixture of}} subunits prepared from V-TAV and 35 S-labelled cucumber mosaic virus strain T (T-CMV). Immunodiffusion tests showed that the <b>reassembled</b> particles reacted with polyclonal antisera raised against both V-TAV and T-CMV. Radioactivity {{was found in the}} precipitin line formed between the <b>reassembled</b> particles and antiserum raised against T-CMV {{as well as in the}} precipitin line formed between the <b>reassembled</b> particles and antiserum raised against V-TAV. This shows that 35 S-labelled T-CMV protein subunits were incorporated with V-TAV protein subunits into the same particles. Thus, coat proteins of V-TAV and T-CMV can coassemble and form mixed-subunit capsids in vitro. B. Chen, J. W. Randles and R. I. B. Franck...|$|R

5|$|Many teleosts form shoals, {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It {{is often more}} efficient to gather food by working as a group, and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and <b>reassembling.</b> Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn.|$|E
5|$|St Mihangel's Church in {{the village}} of Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn is a former parish church now used as the chapel for RAF Valley in Anglesey, north Wales. The date of the first church on the site is uncertain, but in 1862 the {{then-existing}} church was rebuilt. St Mihangel's became the chapel for the nearby Royal Air Force base in 1998, after the Church in Wales had ceased using it for services. It was then extended by dismantling and <b>reassembling</b> another Anglesey church, St Enghenedl's, at the west end of the building.|$|E
5|$|To {{supplement}} the defences of Fiji, the brigade group was reinforced from New Zealand with the 14th Brigade. The 34th Battalion continued performing garrison duties and carrying out training exercises until, with the United States now {{taking responsibility for}} the defence of Fiji, it was relieved by American forces in July 1942. At this time, the 34th Battalion returned to New Zealand on board the SS President Coolidge. It arrived in Auckland on 6 July and its personnel went on leave before <b>reassembling</b> at Manurewa in early August.|$|E

It {{pushed on}} towards {{the north coast}} of Papua, only to be stopped by the Japanese short of their {{ultimate}} objective. The division was forced to fight a bloody battle around Buna, and, together with American troops under Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger, ultimately defeated the Japanese and captured Gona. After the campaign, the 7th Division returned to Australia. The men went on leave before <b>reassembling</b> for training on the Atherton Tableland. Vasey went on leave in Melbourne but wound up being admitted to the Heidelberg Military Hospital for treatment for Malaria.|$|E
5|$|The Fountain was {{released}} on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray in the United States on May15, 2007. The included extras were the theatrical trailer and a six-part featurette gallery about the film's periods and settings. Aronofsky was disappointed with the limited extras available on home video. He reported that Warner Bros. {{did not want to}} have the director record a commentary track because it felt the commentary would not help sales. He hoped to petition for the film to be re-released in the Criterion Collection with extras that were not made available on the initial media. Aronofsky recorded a commentary track on his own and made the track available on his personal website. In December 2008, he expressed interest in <b>reassembling</b> The Fountain, not as a director's cut, but as an alternate story that combined theatrical footage and unused footage.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{remastering}} {{work was}} outsourced to the Shanghai-based studio Virtuos. Square Enix's internal staff was responsible for <b>reassembling</b> the original assets, and helped with a part of redoing the high-definition data. Among the returning original team members were Motomu Toriyama, Yusuke Naora, Toshitaka Matsuda and Masaki Kobayashi who supervised the production. X-2 art director Shintaro Takai remained in the same role for both remastered games. The Chinese side of development was headed by managing director Pan Feng. The team encountered problems in porting the games to PlayStation 3 and Vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to the PlayStation 2 hardware. The loss and repair {{of some of the}} original assets posed another hurdle, with Kitase commenting that it might have been easier to recreate the data from the ground up.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, the Ebenezer Avery House was {{in danger}} of being torn down to {{construct}} apartments and it was purchased by R. Stanton Avery. R. Stanton Avery purchased the property with the intention of turning it over to the Avery Memorial Association. Edwin Park, an architect, assessed the house as in need of extensive reconstruction and the association discussed the plan to move the house to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park. A meeting held on the association on July 24, 1971, was held to discuss the movement plan which involved disassembling and <b>reassembling</b> the house at its new location. The project to move the house was a shared cost between R. Stanton Avery and the Avery Memorial Association. By the 1972 meeting, the total cost of the relocation was $43,000 and the act provoked interest from the State of Connecticut. The house was donated to the State of Connecticut for use as a historic house museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{politician}} Lord Granville {{was offered}} the post of Lord Warden by the new Prime Minister, John Russell in 1865. Russell noted that the role would be expensive for Granville to perform — the salary had been abolished in 1828 — but that it would provide him with a property by the sea, which Granville had been seeking to acquire for a while. Granville took over Walmer in 1865. He expanded the gardens, built new kennels for a hunting pack and spent many years <b>reassembling</b> the furniture and other objects that Pitt and Wellington had used at the castle. He received large numbers of visitors, many of whom stopped off while travelling to or from France. The diplomat Baron de Malortie visited Granville and his family at Walmer, and later praised the homely atmosphere in the castle. He described how, after breakfast, the family and guests would all gather in the drawing room, which was the only large room in the house, and Granville would answer government correspondence amid the daily life {{of the rest of}} the household.|$|E
5|$|With {{the beach}} assault phase {{completed}} the RCTs reorganized into infantry regiments and battalions {{and over the}} course of the next two days achieved the original D-Day objectives. On the 1st divisional front the 18th Infantry Regiment blocked an attempt by two companies from the 916th and 726th Grenadiers to break out of WN-63 and Colleville, both of which were subsequently taken by the 16th Infantry Regiment which also moved on Port-en-Bessin. The main advance was made by the 18th Infantry Regiment, with the 3rd battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment attached, south and south-eastwards. The heaviest opposition was encountered at Formigny where troops of the 2nd battalion 915th Grenadiers had reinforced the headquarters troops of 2nd battalion 916th Grenadiers. Attempts by 3/26 and B/18 with support from the tanks of B/745 were held off and the town did not fall until the morning of June 8. The threat of an armored counterattack kept the 18th Infantry Regiment on the defensive for the rest of June 8. The 26th Infantry Regiment's three battalions, having been attached to the 16th, 18th and 115th Regiments the previous day, spent June 8 <b>reassembling</b> before pushing eastwards, forcing the 1st battalion of the German 726th Grenadiers to spend the night extricating itself from the pocket thus forming between Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin. By the morning of June 9 the 1st Division had established contact with the British XXX Corps, thus linking Omaha with Gold.|$|E
