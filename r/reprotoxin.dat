50|$|Effects of {{nitrogen}} mustard exposure can be long-term or permanent; {{it is also}} a known carcinogen, <b>reprotoxin,</b> and developmental toxin after chronic and acute exposure, causing skin cancer and airway cancers in particular. Blindness from an acute exposure is usually temporary, resolving in days to months depending on severity. Chronic respiratory and eye infections are also common after acute nitrogen mustard exposure. Other consequences of acute exposure include ageusia, anosmia, pulmonary fibrosis, scarring, bronchitis, chronic respiratory disease, mental illness, and central nervous system damage. Consequences of chronic exposure beyond cancer include permanent kidney damage and immunosuppression.|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 8.4 {{million tonnes}} of {{plasticizers}} are consumed globally every year, of which European consumption accounts for approximately 1.5 million metric tonnes. Approximately 70% of those totals are phthalates, down from about 88% in 2005. The remaining 30% are alternative chemistries. Plasticizers contribute 10-60% of total weight of plasticized products. More recently in Europe and the US, regulatory developments {{have resulted in}} a change in phthalate consumption, with the higher phthalates (DINP and DIDP) replacing DEHP as the general purpose plasticizer of choice because DIDP and DINP were not classified as hazardous. All of these mentioned phthalates are now regulated and restricted in many products. DEHP, although most applications are shown to pose no risk when studied using recognized methods of risk assessment, has been classified as a Category 1B <b>reprotoxin,</b> [...] and is now on the Annex XIV of the European Union's REACH legislation, which means that producers and users must submit authorization requests to the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki to continue to use DEHP. Analysis of such applications will involve studies on alternatives and, given the wide number of compounds that have been used as plasticizers, such evaluations are likely to be far-reaching.|$|E
30|$|Interpreting Fig.  14, {{again it}} is evident that NMP, DMF and DMAc are not {{desirable}} solvent choices. The tools developed by AstraZeneca and the ACS GCI are less harsh in their assessment, {{but it is not clear}} why given the reproductive toxicity of the amide solvents. The method by which the AstraZeneca scores are converted for the survey of solvent selection guides rates NMP as greener than ethyl acetate [57]. This clearly highlights an inconsistency between the AstraZeneca approach to solvent selection and known chronic toxicity concerns, especially as NMP is a substance of very high concern is posed for restrictions on its use in Europe [30]. Despite its stability issues at high temperature DMSO seems to be a greener alternative. Sulpholane too had previously been recognised as an improved solvent choice over the reprotoxic dipolar aprotic solvents [58]. Sulpholane receives three green colour coded scores from Sanofi in its EHS assessment, yet only obtains an overall yellow ranking meaning ‘substitution advisable’. This is because it has a moderate-to-low ICH concentration limit in pharmaceuticals (160  ppm) and is further penalised for its high melting point and high boiling point [47]. Overall sulpholane is recommended as a solvent in the survey of solvent selection guides. Unfortunately sulpholane is now suspected to also be a <b>reprotoxin,</b> a fact reflected in the conclusions of the CHEM 21 solvent selection guide (Fig.  13) [56]. Only the most recent safety datasheets contain this information and it is not widely known at the time of writing [59]. Despite being recommended as an alternative solvent decades before the solvent selection guides of the pharmaceutical industry existed, the urea derivative dimethyl propylene urea (DMPU) has not become a prominent green solvent, but may also be worth considering for certain types of chemistry [60, 61].|$|E
