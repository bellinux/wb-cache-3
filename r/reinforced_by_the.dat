5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Jadar Chetniks were attacking Loznica, Račić's Cer {{detachment}} attacked the village of Bogatić in accordance with the Chetnik-Partisan agreement. The gendarmes had been <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 6th Company of the German 750th Infantry Regiment with artillery support. On the second day of the attack, the garrison was <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 7th Company of the 750th Infantry Regiment arriving from Sremska Mitrovica, and an additional platoon sent from Šabac. After two days fighting, Račić's Chetniks withdrew to Cer mountain with considerable losses, after which they marched to Loznica to join the Jadar Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Xuân Lộc had been {{entrusted}} to the 18th ARVN Division, <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 8th Regiment of the 5th Division, the 3rd Armored Brigade, two Ranger and two artillery battalions, and the 81st Airborne Ranger Group. The week-long fighting that erupted on 8 April raged {{in and around}} Xuân Lộc and became the most significant engagement of the entire offensive. The initial attack was conducted by the 341st and 3rd North Vietnamese Divisions, which attacked headlong into the town, a tactic widely used before, hoping to quickly rout the defender. However, they had to call off the attack after meeting 2 weeks of heavy resistance and effective fire support which cost them dearly. The attackers were then <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 7th Division.|$|E

5|$|After the {{successful}} defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943. This advance was mounted {{to divert attention}} from Lae, {{which was one of the}} main objectives of Operation Cartwheel, and proceeded slowly. In late June the 3rd Division was <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> US 162nd Regimental Combat Team which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua. The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view is <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure {{in comparison to the}} immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|Beal was {{a friend}} of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played {{football}} at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as Jim Barrett.

60|$|The {{remainder}} of Darwin's epoch-making work deals, strictly speaking, rather {{with the general}} theory of 'descent with modification' than with the special doctrine of natural selection. It restates and <b>reinforces,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> light of the new additional concept, and with fuller facts and later knowledge, the four great arguments already known in favour of organic evolution as a whole, the argument from Geological Succession, the argument from Geographical Distribution, the argument from Embryological Development, and the argument from Classificatory Affinities. Each of these we may briefly summarise.|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, the British in New York had {{not been}} idle. Lord Howe, {{concerned}} about the French fleet and further <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arrival of ships from Byron's storm-tossed squadron, sailed out to catch d'Estaing before he reached Boston. General Clinton organised a force of 4,000 men under Major General Charles Grey, and sailed with it on 26 August, destined for Newport.|$|E
5|$|MIT OpenCourseWare – the OpenCourseWare {{movement}} {{started in}} 1999 when the University of Tübingen in Germany published videos of lectures online for its timms initiative (Tübinger Internet Multimedia Server).

5|$|Music with a fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> drummers in the stadium; {{nevertheless}} the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide.

5|$|News of the Qurayzah's {{supposed}} {{renunciation of}} the pact with Muhammad leaked out, and Umar promptly informed Muhammad. Such suspicions were <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza. Muhammad became anxious about their conduct, and realised the grave potential danger the Qurayza posed. Because of his {{pact with the}} Qurayza, he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along the Muslims' border with the tribe. The Qurayza also possessed weaponry: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armour, and 500 shields.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March the brigade, <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 4th (ANZAC) Battalion ICCB, {{tried to}} capture Hill 3039 {{south-west}} of Amman. The attack failed and further attempts were postponed until after nightfall. The night assault began at 02:00; two {{troops of the}} 9th Squadron {{were involved in the}} second line to protect the left flank. The attack was successful and the brigade commenced improvements to the defences in order to withstand any counter-attack.|$|E
5|$|Republic of Korea Army units {{had been}} unsuccessfully {{resisting}} advances by the North Korean People's Army {{in the region}} when they were <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States Army's 25th Infantry Division, newly arrived in the country.

In 11 days of fighting, the UN forces performed poorly and were forced to withdraw from Yechon County, the city of Sangju, and the surrounding areas.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{fighting}} was very close, many of the Confederates were killed before {{they had a chance}} to retreat. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry drove the rebels {{to the end of the}} field, only to be partially driven back by a second group of Confederate cavalrymen.

5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, {{and it may be}} that the 260-day count is based on the human gestation period. This is <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.|$|E
5|$|The HV and HVO {{launched}} Operation Southern Move in response, {{removing the}} VRS pressure from Ključ {{and allowing the}} 5th Corps, <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 7th Corps, to resume its advance and capture Sanski Most on 12 October, by which time a comprehensive ceasefire was to come into effect throughout the country. Combat continued for another eight days without significant changes to the frontlines. Fighting did not resume, and the war ended the following month following negotiation and acceptance of the Dayton Agreement.|$|E

On 12 August the 54th Division attacked Kavak Tepe and Tekke Tepe, crossing the Anafarta Plain. The attack failed and Hamilton briefly considered the evacuation of Suvla and Anzac.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was also substantially <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> addition of 1,200 {{men of the}} Glider Pilot Regiment, providing Urquhart with the equivalent of two battalions of infantry for the operation.

5|$|The new government's {{hostility to}} the wartime Polish Government in Exile and its World War II {{underground}} resistance – accused {{by the media}} of being nationalist, reactionary and antisemitic, and persecuted by Berman – further strengthened Żydokomuna sentiment {{to the point where}} in the popular consciousness Jewish Bolshevism was seen as having conquered Poland. It was in this context, <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> immediate post-war lawlessness, that Poland experienced an unprecedented wave of anti-Jewish violence (of which most notable was the Kielce pogrom).|$|E
