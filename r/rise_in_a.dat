5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance should be given to promoting exports.|$|E

Estimates indicate that the government has to increase existing prices by an average of 2.5 times to achieve the lower target and by 4 times for the maximum target. According to the IMF, Iranians can expect the first price hike to lift energy product prices between four and 20 times previous levels, with prices surging even higher eventually.|$|E

For the parameter values {{considered in the}} present study, <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> bubble <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shear-thinning fluid exhibits a three-dimensional behaviour. Both path instabilities (zigzagging/spiralling motion) and topological changes are observed for <b>an</b> air bubble <b>rising</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shear-thinning fluid. However, for a Newtonian surrounding fluid, a bubble maintains azimuthal symmetry and <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> straight path for {{the same set of}} parameters. The mechanism of this three-dimensional behaviour is investigated by inspecting the variation of the vertical vorticity component and viscosity. Experiments have also been conducted using a high speed camera to visualise the bubble <b>rise</b> behaviour <b>in</b> both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids as surrounding media. The shapes and trajectories of the bubble obtained from experiments show a qualitative agreement with those obtained from numerical simulations...|$|R

It was designed as a unitary double casemate, occupying a prominent <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cleared area. In a second phase, Bois-du-Four was to be expanded to a plan that would result in a close resemblance to its neighbor Bréhain, with five additional blocks mounting artillery, as well as remote entrances for munitions and personnel, and an extensive network of deep underground galleries. The rise in tensions between France and Germany in the late 1930s prevented this second phase from being pursued.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{hepatitis}} {{accounts for}} {{a significant portion of}} healthcare expenditures in both developing and developed nations, and is expected to <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> several developing countries. While hepatitis A infections are self-limited events, they are associated with significant costs in the United States. It has been estimated that direct and indirect costs are approximately $1817 and $2459 respectively per case, and that an average of 27 work days is lost per infected adult. A 1997 report demonstrated that a single hospitalization related to hepatitis A cost an average of $6,900 and resulted in around $500 million in total annual healthcare costs. Cost effectiveness studies have found widespread vaccination of adults to not be feasible, but have stated that a combination hepatitis A and B vaccination of children and at risk groups (people from endemic areas, healthcare workers) may be.|$|E
25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the Mugals and the British, the city saw a <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> blend of Hindu, Islamic and Gothic revival styles, {{resulting}} in the distinct Indo-Saracenic style. The architecture for several early institutions such as banking and commerce, railways, press and education, chiefly through the colonial rule, followed the earlier directions of the Neo-Classical and the Indo-Saracenic. The Chepauk Palace in the city, designed by Paul Benfield, {{is said to be the}} first Indo-Saracenic building in India. Since then, many of the colonial-era buildings in the city were designed in this style of architecture, which is most apparent around the Fort St. George built in 1640. Most of these were designed by English architects Robert Fellowes Chisholm and Henry Irwin. The best examples of this style include the Madras High Court (built in 1892), Southern Railway headquarters, Ripon Building, Government Museum, Senate House of the University of Madras, Amir Mahal, Bharat Insurance Building, Victoria Public Hall and the College of Engineering.|$|E

25|$|As {{the fluid}} enters and {{leaves in the}} axial direction, the {{centrifugal}} component in the energy equation does not come into play. Here the compression is fully based on diffusing action of the passages.The diffusing action in stator converts absolute kinetic head of the fluid into rise in pressure. The relative kinetic head in the energy equation is a term that exists {{only because of the}} rotation of the rotor. The rotor reduces the relative kinetic head of the fluid and adds it to the absolute kinetic head of the fluid i.e., the impact of the rotor on the fluid particles increases its velocity (absolute) and thereby reduces the relative velocity between the fluid and the rotor. In short, the rotor increases the absolute velocity of the fluid and the stator converts this into pressure rise. Designing the rotor passage with a diffusing capability can produce a pressure rise in addition to its normal functioning. This produces greater pressure rise per stage which constitutes a stator and a rotor together. This is the reaction principle in turbomachines. If 50% of the pressure <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stage is obtained at the rotor section, it is said to have a 50% reaction.|$|E
