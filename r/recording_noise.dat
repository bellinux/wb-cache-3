Our algorithm tracks points along the midline of the contracting cell.

An LCR was detected when its signal changes sufficiently quickly within a sufficiently large area. The LCR is considered to have died when its amplitude decays substantially, or when it merges into the rising whole cell Ca transient. Our algorithm provides major LCR parameters such as period, signal mass, duration, and path area. As LCRs propagate within cells, the algorithm identifies splitting and merging behaviors, indicating the importance of Ca-induced-Ca-release for the fate of LCRs and for generating a powerful ensemble Ca signal.

40|$|Disclosed is a noise {{communication}} system and method. The {{noise communication}} system comprises a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter indexes {{through at least}} two <b>noise</b> <b>records</b> which comprise a series of randomly generated samples, the <b>noise</b> <b>records</b> being divided into noise segments, to maintain a current noise segment for each <b>noise</b> <b>record.</b> The transmitter modulates a predefined base signal using the segments of the <b>noise</b> <b>records</b> to represent the symbols of the base signal. In modulating the predefined base signal, the transmitter replaces the respective symbols of the base signal with the current noise segments from the <b>noise</b> <b>records,</b> thereby generating a noise signal in which the symbols can not be discerned. The noise signal is transmitted across a communications channel to the receiver which demodulates the noise signal into the base signal. The demodulation employs a number of correlators that equals the number of <b>noise</b> <b>records</b> employed at the transmitter. The receiver includes logic to index through the <b>noise</b> <b>records</b> {{in a similar manner}} to the transmitter to produce the current noise segments.

Figure  4 shows the time courses of the hourly AE hit rate and mean maximum amplitude of two individuals, A 1 and AX 1, as typical examples. They started continuous feeding at 0.6 and 1.0  days, respectively. However, feeding activity ceased between 3.5 and 5.5  days in individual A 1 and between 5.2 and 7.3  days in individual AX 1, and after that, periods of continuous feeding activity and periods of inactivity alternated with each other.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{ability to}} restore {{perceived}} colors for {{the output of}} color imaging devices is of great interest. The quality of color reproduction depends on {{the accuracy of the}} color correction function used, on the recording and rendering illumination {{as well as on the}} spectral sensitivies of the color imaging device used. Much work has been done to develop and evaluate the quality of different color correction functions under different illuminations. In this paper we present a new figure of merit (FOM) for the color reproduction ability of color imaging devices. This FOM overcomes the limitations of previously presented FOM in that its error measure is defined in the percetually uniform CIELab color space, it takes account for <b>recording</b> <b>noise</b> and it is independent on the color correction function used. We can calculate a measure of uncertainty with respect to the perceived colors that might have led to this sensors response...|$|E

In order to tackle the video denoising problem with non-stationary image contents and various noise sources, a critical task is estimation of varieties of noise in video signals. The estimation {{is based on a}} new general integrated surveillance video noise model (GISVNM), which integrates all typical realistic noise models, including signal independent noise model and signal dependent model to model behaviors of Poisson, additive and impulse noises. In particular, the parameters of the Poison and Gaussian based noise models are estimated by using spatial-temporal noise characteristics of the static background of surveillance video, and the parameters of the impulse model are estimated by geometric properties based on spatial characteristics of the video.
