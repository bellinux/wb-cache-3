5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came {{in his first year}} in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist <b>Robert</b> <b>Bork</b> to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use.

Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard right conservative in the mold of a Clarence Thomas or <b>Robert</b> <b>Bork.</b> Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. On the abortion issue, he stated that he would look at that {{with an open mind}} but would not state how he would rule on Roe v. Wade if that issue were to come up before the court.

25|$|On October 20, 1973, after Cox {{refused to}} drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire the special prosecutor.

25|$|Simon rose to {{national}} {{attention in the}} 1960s, {{due in part to}} his well-researched book, Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to White and Rehnquist, Reagan appointee Sandra Day O'Connor began dissenting from the Court's abortion cases, arguing in 1983 that the trimester-based analysis devised by the Roe Court was [...] "unworkable."

2500|$|Originalism is {{actually}} a family of related views. Originalism as a movement {{got off to a}} slow start in 1971, with <b>Robert</b> <b>Bork's</b> Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems. It was not until the 1980s, when conservative jurists began to take seats on the Supreme Court, that the debate really began in earnest. [...] "Old originalism" [...] focused primarily on [...] "intent", mostly by default. But that line was largely abandoned in the early 1990s; as [...] "New originalism" [...] emerged, most adherents subscribed to [...] "original meaning" [...] originalism, though there are some intentionalists within new originalism.|$|R
25|$|In modern times, the {{confirmation}} process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups, which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group's views. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination {{should go to the}} full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report. The committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street, and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955. Once the committee reports out the nomination, the full Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees, most recently <b>Robert</b> <b>Bork,</b> nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Irving Kristol and Leo Strauss were {{founders of}} the movement. The {{magazines}} Commentary and Public Interest were their key outlets, as well as op-ed articles for major newspapers and position papers for think tanks. Activists around Democratic senator Henry Jackson became deeply involved as well. Prominent spokesmen include Gertrude Himmelfarb, Bill Kristol, Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, Norman Podhoretz, Richard Pipes, David Horowitz, Charles Krauthammer, Richard Perle, Robert Kagan, Elliott Abrams and Ben Wattenberg. Meanwhile, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was highly sympathetic but remained a Democrat. Some of Strauss' influential neoconservative disciples included Supreme Court nominee <b>Robert</b> <b>Bork,</b> Paul Wolfowitz (who became Deputy Secretary of Defense), Alan Keyes (who became Assistant Secretary of State), William Bennett (who became Secretary of Education), Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, political philosopher Allan Bloom, writer John Podhoretz, college president John Agresto, political scientist Harry V. Jaffa and novelist Saul Bellow.|$|E
25|$|At the time, however, {{there was}} a concern that the court could split and issue no ruling. Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. had retired from the Supreme Court on June 26, 1987. President Ronald Reagan {{nominated}} Judge <b>Robert</b> <b>Bork</b> of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to fill Powell's seat on July 1, but after a contentious nomination battle the U.S. Senate rejected Bork's nomination 58-to-42 on October 23. Six days later, President Reagan nominated Douglas H. Ginsburg, Bork's fellow judge on the D.C. circuit court of appeals, for the Supreme Court. But Ginsburg withdrew his nomination eight days later after media reports that he had occasionally smoked marijuana as a law student and law professor. Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, for the high court on November 11, 1987. Kennedy was unanimously confirmed on February 3, 1988. Kennedy {{had been unable to}} participate in oral argument in the Beck case, and Supreme Court tradition holds that a justice who has not participated in oral argument cannot participate in the decision a case (with only a few, rare exceptions).|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} campaign centered largely around the Senate, where Republicans defended a large freshmen class of Senators. Despite sweeping Democratic gains, {{many of the}} losing Republicans incumbents lost by small margins. The Republican loss of the Senate put an effective check on any further major conservative legislation during the Reagan administration. The elections also had {{a major impact on}} the Supreme Court, as Republican losses helped ensure that <b>Robert</b> <b>Bork's</b> nomination to the Supreme Court would be defeated by the Senate. After the Senate rejected the conservative Bork, Reagan instead nominated Anthony Kennedy, who became a critical swing vote on the court.|$|R
5000|$|Conservative thinkers, {{especially}} social conservatives, often perceive {{politics in}} a generally pessimistic way. William F. Buckley famously remarked {{that he was}} [...] "standing athwart history yelling 'stop!'" [...] and Whittaker Chambers was convinced that capitalism was bound to fall to communism, though he was himself violently anti-communist. Social conservatives often see the West as a decadent and nihilistic civilization which has abandoned its roots in Christianity and/or Greek philosophy, leaving it doomed to fall into moral and political decay. <b>Robert</b> <b>Bork's</b> Slouching Toward Gomorrah and Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind are famous expressions of this point of view.|$|R
