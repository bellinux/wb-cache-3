40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the flow curve of colloidal systems that develop fluid phases with different mechanical properties, namely shear-banding fluids. The problem involved is that, as different fluid phases coexist in the flow domain of the <b>rheometric</b> cell, measured data cannot be directly converted into <b>rheometric</b> functions. In order to handle this problem, a shear stress vs. shear rate constitutive relation is introduced to interpret the steady state flow curves. The relation derives from a phenomenological description of structural changes, and involves the possibility of multivalued shear rates under a given shear stress. Numerical predictions satisfactorily match up to experimental data of wormlike micellar solutions. A crucial aspect is the adequate computation of the shear rate function from raw data measured in the <b>rheometric</b> cell. Comment: 12 page...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Assessment of the {{extrudability}} of {{mixtures of}} saturated polyglycolysed glycerides used as carriers for poorly soluble drugs. Methods: Three different mixtures of saturated polyglycolysed glycerides were extruded in a mm extruder {{at different rates}} and using different dies. The force applied to the ram and its displacement were recorded and {{used to determine the}} "specific work of extrusion" and pursuit <b>rheometric</b> determinations, according to the Bagley's approach. Results: As the melting range of the mixtures, or the length of the dies increased the higher the "specific work of extrusion" observed. From the <b>rheometric</b> analysis, viscoelastic properties were identified and decomposed into plastic and elastic components. The elastic component contributed more to the total pressure loss, and {{for the majority of the}} cases, was higher than the plastic component. From the Bagley plot it was possible to calculate the wall shear stress (sigma (omega)), that increased with the melting range of the materials and the shear rate applied (gamma) The viscosity (eta) decreased as the shear rate increased reflecting a non-Newtonian behavior of the materials. Finally, materials showing lower viscosities required less work to produce the extrudates. Conclusions: This study has (a) shown the possibility of preparing extrudates from different mixtures of polyglycolysed glycerides alone in a non-aqueous environment, (b) demonstrated the usefulness of the "specific work of extrusion," and (c) revealed through the <b>rheometric</b> studies the viscoelastic nature of the materials quantifying the contribution of the elastic and the plastic components for the total pressure loss...|$|E

ABSTRACT: This work presents a <b>rheometric</b> {{molecular weight distribution}} technique (RMWD) to estimate molecular parameters of low and high poly-dispersity samples of elastomers and polymer melts. Samples of polystyrene, polybutadiene, polyethylene and styrene-butadiene rubbers are considered in this study. Important conclusions are obtained concerning the elimination of experimental information with glassy modes that are not relevant for the RMWD technique. A discussion on the calibration of this technique is pre-sented involving an interplay with size exclusion chromatography and capil-lary rheometry. Estimation of molecular weights Mw and Mn, and polydisper-sity Po through rheometry is a promising technique, which when comple-mented with rheological theories of polymer melts, may give additional infor-mation into the chemical architecture of polymer chains. Correlations between rheological and molecular parameters are also presented.

This study considers the effect of crosslinking of XNBR by magnesium aluminum layered double hydroxide (MgAl-LDH), known also as hydrotalcite (HT), on <b>rheometric,</b> mechano-dynamical and barrier properties.

40|$|This PhD is {{concerned}} with fluid flow through porous media and fluid diversion in oil reservoirs, through the understanding of rheology, colloid science and porous flow experiments. The aim is to better understand porous flow and apply the findings to address field questions {{such as how to}} rheologically deliver fluids to low permeability zones, and what are the effects of shear-thinning and shear-thickening on porous flow. This was approached with both <b>rheometric</b> and porous flow studies on six chemical systems. <b>Rheometric</b> studies were conducted on the Malvern Bohlin CVO and TA AR- 1000 N rheometers with a cone and plate geometry. A porous flow instrument was designed, built and tested, where Ballotini spheres were used as the porous media. Two Newtonian systems, sucrose solutions and silicone oils were used for the porous flow instrument calibration. Four non- Newtonian systems of varying rheological behaviours were used {{to examine the effects of}} rheology on porous flow. These systems were the shear-thinning Xanthan and HMHEC, thixotropic Laponite and shear-thinning and -thickening PEO/silica mixtures. The experimental data were examined with Darcy's Law, the Hagen- Poiseuille equation, the Cross, Herschel Bulkley, and the Power-Law model, Reynolds number and the Kozeny-Carman equation, as well as empirical models proposed by the author. An empirical shear-rate / volumetric flow rate relationship was formulated. This allowed for pressure drop / flow rate relationship predictions based on <b>rheometric</b> viscosity / shear rate data. A new approach to modeling porous flow is also proposed. It is hoped that the findings and proposals can provide a better understanding of porous flow, predict fluid behaviour in porous media, and ultimately translated for field applications, namely the 'heel and toe' problem.

40|$|Long Fiber Thermoplastics (LFT) are {{promising}} new materials with high physical properties and low density. These high properties are obtained by embedding very long fibers (~ 100 mm) into a thermoplastic matrix. Such a high fiber length dictates {{the use of}} a compression molding process for manufacturing as the length of discontinuous fibers in injection molding is limited by pellet length. LFT composites are of great interest for the automotive industry. These materials are already used in some interior and exterior car parts such as bumpers, seat structures, door module etc. This research is inspired by the desire to manufacture load carrying parts for vehicles such as wheel rims which would dramatically reduce vehicle weight and subsequently save fuel. This, however, requires a much better understanding of long fiber orientation and distribution during compression molding. Current orientation models were developed for short fibers(several millimetres). Recently the models are being extended even for the LFT-D fibers which can reach up to 80 mm. Since several of the governing assumptions for short fiber models are not suitable for long fibers, the models can not provide accurate results for long fibers. Due to this limitation long fibers require independent treatments. This thesis presents a new model which is specifically designed for long flexible fibers. This model is confirmed by comparing results obtained for simple shear flow to results found in the literature. The model was implemented in a <b>rheometric</b> squeeze flow, which is defined as flow between two approaching to each other parallel plates, and provided results previously not seen in the literature. Interactions were implemented into the model and tested for <b>rheometric</b> squeeze flow and simple shear flow cases.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the flowing behavior of dense suspensions of non-colloidal particles, by coupling macroscopic <b>rheometric</b> experiments and local velocity and concentration measurements through MRI techniques. We {{find that the}} flow is localized at low velocities, and that the material is inhomogeneous; the local laws inferred from macroscopic <b>rheometric</b> observations must then be reinterpreted {{in the light of}} these local observations. We show that the short time response to a velocity step allows to characterize dense suspensions locally: they have a purely viscous behavior, without any observable influence of friction. In the jammed zone, there may be a contact network, whereas in the sheared zone there are only hydrodynamic interactions: localization consists in a change in configuration at the grain scale. From the concentration and velocity profiles, we have provided for the first time local measurements of the concentration dependence of viscosity; we find a Krieger-Dougherty law η(ϕ) =η_ 0 (1 -ϕ/ 0. 605) ^- 2. Shear induced migration is almost instantaneous and seems inconsistent with most observations: it would imply that the diffusion coefficients strongly depend on the concentration. We finally propose a simple constitutive law for dense suspensions, based on a purely viscous behavior, that accounts for all the macroscopic and local observations.

40|$|International audienceThe {{thixotropic}} {{behavior of}} a colloidal dispersion of clay consisting of disc-shaped particles was studied {{by means of a}} combination of <b>rheometric</b> measurements, static light scattering and small-angle neutron scattering. At rest, the structure of the gel consists of dense micrometer-sized aggregates assembled into a fractal mass of dimension D. Under shear, in the case of volume fractions with (1 ≤ D ≤ 1. 2) at rest, a butterfly-type light scattering pattern is observed. This is attributed to the formation of rollers within the dispersion, which align themselves on average perpendicular to the direction of shearing. This produces a fall in resistance to flow and in viscosity. The influence of shear rate on this disaggregation process was studied and linked to the <b>rheometric</b> measurements. In shear flow conditions, the fall in viscosity is due to orientation and disaggregation processes occurring at length scales of the order of a micrometer. During recovery, the two time scales identified correspond respectively to a rapid relaxation of the particle orientations and a slow aggregation process. Thixotropic behavior is identified as being mainly a reversible aggregation process, for which large length scales of the order of a micrometer associated with a fractal arrangement play a decisive role...|$|E
