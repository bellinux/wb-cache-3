40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{plurality}} of sureties assisting the same debt. After a brief analysis of such topic in Roman law, the contribution sets out the {{issues related to}} the plurality of sureties under current law, with particular regard to the possibility to draw a distinction between the co-suretyship and the plurality of independent sureties. The study is carried out also in a comparative perspective, mainly with reference to German law, and aims at developing a consistent systematic reconstruction of the coexistence of more sureties for the same debt, constantly verifying its validity with regard to the solution of some relevant issues raised by such topic. The topic is discussed in the broader framework of debtors’ joint and several liability. Accordingly, a detailed analysis is dedicated to various aspects of such topic in order to achieve outcomes which may help in the solution of specific problems related to the plurality of sureties. Thus, {{on the basis of the}} conclusions drawn with reference to joint and several liability in general, a focus has been given to aspects concerning the right of contribution and the subrogation among sureties, the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> a <b>guarantor</b> and the settlement with one of the sureties. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a theoretical {{development of the}} relationship of CD premiums to both the risks of the CD issuer and the third party government <b>guarantor</b> <b>of</b> those deposits. The theoretical development shows that the risk <b>of</b> the <b>guarantor</b> derives from the possibility that the guarantee could be repudiated and/or the restitution of the depositor's claim could be costly. The empirical analysis of the premiums for insured CDs indicates that during the years preceding the ultimate collapse of the FSLIC, the market priced the risk <b>of</b> both the <b>guarantor</b> as well as the firm. The guarantor risk pricing was responsive to the insolvency <b>of</b> the <b>guarantor,</b> the attempts to recapitalize the guarantor and the efforts to resolve the insolvent thrifts. During this eventful time period CD premiums rose to 187 basis points and averaged 79 and 54 basis points. Copyright 1994 by Ohio State University Press. ...|$|R
