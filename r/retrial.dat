5|$|Although the High Court {{ordered that}} {{the verdict of}} the {{original}} conviction be overturned and that a <b>retrial</b> be conducted, {{there was never any}} <b>retrial</b> since Dietrich had already served his sentence. Dietrich was released on parole in July 1990, and he subsequently changed his name by deed poll to Hugo Rich.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{was convicted}} of rape in April 2012 and spent {{two and a half}} years in prison. His {{conviction}} was quashed on 21 April 2016 by the Court of Appeal, and a <b>retrial</b> was ordered. On 14 October 2016, he was found not guilty. Prior to the <b>retrial,</b> he joined Chesterfield.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a <b>retrial</b> unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a <b>retrial</b> would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a <b>retrial.</b>|$|E

50|$|The state {{convictions}} {{were all}} initially set aside because of misconduct by the presiding judge, {{who has since}} been disbarred. <b>Retrials</b> were originally slated for {{the summer and fall}} of 2012. The orders for <b>retrials</b> of Davidson and Cobbins were subsequently overturned by the Tennessee State Supreme Court, and their convictions and sentences stand. The Coleman and Thomas <b>retrials</b> resulted in convictions, but with a reduced sentence for Coleman (35 years) and the same sentence for Thomas.|$|R
50|$|Qatada {{resided in}} the United Kingdom until 7 July 2013, when he was {{deported}} back to Jordan to face <b>retrials</b> for alleged involvement in varied Jordanian mayhem. He was freed after both Jordanian <b>retrials,</b> in which by formal agreement with the UK government evidence obtained by torture was discarded. His imprisonment ended in September 2014.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, Warren Jeffs {{was convicted}} in Texas on sexual assault charges {{unrelated}} to Wall's case and {{sentenced to life in}} prison plus 20 years. Since Warren Jeffs would therefore be 100 years old by the earliest time he could be released from prison, Utah decided to drop the <b>retrial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Judge Duff {{ordered a}} <b>retrial</b> for Burge, former Police Supt. Richard Brzeczek, and the City of Chicago on two other {{outstanding}} charges (conspiracy {{and whether the}} City of Chicago's policy toward police brutality contributed to Wilson's injuries). Burge was acquitted of these charges in a second trial, which began on June 9, 1989, and lasted nine weeks.|$|E
5|$|Logan's <b>retrial</b> {{began in}} June 2007, with the {{prosecution}} unable to use Logan's confession to present its case for conviction, for the judiciary had ruled {{that it had been}} obtained with impropriety. In the <b>retrial,</b> the prosecution used the same argument it had used in the original trial back in 2003, arguing that Logan's insanity defense was illegitimate due to his usage of illegal controlled substances. The state's prosecution argued that Logan himself was solely responsible for any deficiencies in his mental health, saying that they were brought about through his consumption of illegal narcotics, such as cocaine and marijuana, two illegal controlled substances which he had used {{on the day of the}} murders. Ultimately, the first attempt at a <b>retrial</b> ended in June 2007 with a mistrial after jurors couldn't come to a verdict after ten hours of deliberations. On July 1, 2007, Logan's attorney died after being involved in an automobile collision on Route 10 in Glen Burnie, further complicating matters. However, a few months later, Logan was subsequently convicted again after pleading guilty and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment on October 24, 2007, with credit for the five years he had already served, much to the disappointment of the victims' surviving family members, who felt he deserved a lifelong imprisonment for his crime.|$|E

25|$|On April 1, 1935, the United States Supreme Court {{sent the}} cases back {{a second time}} for <b>retrials</b> in Alabama.|$|R
25|$|The {{case was}} first {{returned}} to the lower court and the judge allowed a change of venue, moving the <b>retrials</b> to Decatur, Alabama. Judge Horton was appointed. During the <b>retrials,</b> one of the alleged victims admitted fabricating the rape story and asserted {{that none of the}} Scottsboro Boys touched either of the white women. The jury found the defendants guilty, but the judge set aside the verdict and granted a new trial.|$|R
5|$|On 22 March 2016, {{the case}} was heard by the Court of Appeal, which imposed a ban on {{reporting}} details of the legal argument. On 21 April 2016, the appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. A <b>retrial</b> was ordered. This began on 4 October 2016 and on 14 October Evans was found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 2007, after deliberating for two hours, {{the jury}} {{returned}} guilty verdicts against both brother and sister.

Under French law, they each have an automatic right to appeal their conviction, which results in a <b>retrial</b> of the case.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2012 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{rejected}} {{his appeal}} for <b>retrial</b> that asserted, {{based on a}} 2009 report by the National Academy of Science, that forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and accepted into evidence in the original trial was unreliable. It {{was reported to be}} the former death row inmate's last legal appeal.|$|E
40|$|We study a vacation-type {{queueing}} model, and a single-server multi-queue polling model, {{with the}} special feature of <b>retrials.</b> Just before the server arrives at a station there is some deterministic glue period. Customers (both new arrivals and <b>retrials)</b> arriving at the station during this glue period will be served during the visit of the server. Customers arriving in any other period leave immediately and will retry after an exponentially distributed time. Our main focus is on queue length analysis, both at embedded time points (beginnings of glue periods, visit periods and switch- or vacation periods) and at arbitrary time points.

30|$|We define <b>retrials</b> {{as those}} {{vehicles}} that visited the mall earlier {{during the day}} but then rescheduled the delivery/pick up to a later time, perhaps because of congestion. This behaviour {{is similar to the}} phenomenon of cruising, described for the passenger vehicle drivers’ parking behaviour by Shoup (2006) [32] as a “mobile queue of cars that are waiting for curb vacancies”; with the difference that in the current setting, freight vehicles might reschedule the delivery to a later time and perform other tasks in the meantime. Using the data obtained from the video recordings we quantify the <b>retrials</b> during one day at mall A at only 2 % of the arriving vehicles; while during the two days at mall B, <b>retrials</b> are respectively the 4 % and 5 %. We conclude that, in the observed malls, <b>retrials</b> do not represent a significant share of the arrivals and that freight vehicle, once they entered the system, either park in the LB or balk. Similar behaviour was found in Nourinejad et al. [23], noting that compared to passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles spend less time cruising and are more willing to park illegally.|$|R

5|$|A {{class action}} lawsuit, Cook v. Rockwell International Corp., was filed in January 1990 against Rockwell and Dow Chemical (due to the {{indemnity}} of nuclear contractors, the award {{would have been}} paid by the federal government). Sixteen years later, the plaintiffs were awarded $926 million in economic damages, punitive damages, and interest. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently threw out the verdict and ordered a <b>retrial.</b> A further appeal was rejected without comment by the United States Supreme Court in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|Bell's <b>retrial</b> in the Barker {{assault was}} {{scheduled}} for December 6. Three days before the trial began, {{he pleaded guilty to}} a reduced charge of battery, and was sentenced to 18months in a juvenile facility, with credit for time served. He agreed to testify against any of the other assault defendants at trial. All appeals were dropped as part of the plea agreement.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of the spectral resources and mobility of the portables, the call attempts may be blocked during call initiation or terminated during the hand-off process. When the blocking ratio exceeds some grade of service level, {{the capacity of the}} congested cell must be replanned using the call attempt data. However, most of the time, the measurements are inflated by the redials and the <b>retrials.</b> During the replanning process, the first step should be to calculate the effective load from the measured cumulative call statistics. In this paper, we provide simpleto-implement analytical models that compute the average number of <b>retrials</b> and redials per original call attempt using only the operations and maintenance center (OMC) measurements. The effective load is then determined through appropriate scaling. That way, unnecessary waste of channels to sustain <b>retrials</b> and redials is avoided during the cellular capacity replanning phase...|$|R
40|$|In Joseon Korea, {{only the}} king could pass a {{sentence}} of death and give the order for the execution of condemned criminals; because of this, he would take great care in such legal proceedings. In particular, he would order the Board of Punishments to examine a case and the State Council to re-examine it before he approved {{a sentence of}} death. Moreover, he would order treble <b>retrials</b> before he approved the execution of condemned criminals. These proceedings {{were taken from the}} system described in the Confucian classics. The second of the treble <b>retrials</b> was just a screening, so substantial deliberation only occurred in the first and third <b>retrials.</b> Besides, it was not uncommon that the proceedings of treble <b>retrials</b> were completely skipped over. First, these proceedings were not followed in wartime cases. Second, trials for felons were conducted by the officials of the "three departments, " who acted on behalf of the king himself. Therefore, the king received full information from the "three departments, " so {{there was no need for}} him to re-examine a case. Finally, condemned criminals, for whose crimes immediate execution was prescribed in the penal code, were immediately executed in the late Joseon period, even though the procedure of the treble <b>retrials</b> was originally required by the law. The sovereignty of the king, however, was restricted in the case of "border crossings. " Condemned criminals who had committed a crime in China and had been arrested in Korea were executed only after the emperor of the Qing dynasty approved their execution. Therefore, Joseon Korea could be called a dependent of China in terms of legal proceedings...|$|R

5|$|Nixon {{had built}} {{part of his}} {{reputation}} in the House on {{his role in the}} Alger Hiss affair. Hiss's <b>retrial</b> for perjury after a July 1949 hung jury was a cloud over Nixon's campaign; if Hiss was acquitted, Nixon's candidacy would be in serious danger. On January 21, 1950, the jury found Hiss guilty, and Nixon received hundreds of congratulatory messages, including one from the only living former President, Herbert Hoover.|$|E
5|$|Taylor gave up {{appealing}} {{his sentence}} after his request for <b>retrial</b> {{was rejected by}} the Utah Supreme Court. He became the second person to be executed by firing squad in the United States (after Gary Gilmore) since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Taylor said he chose this method of execution to embarrass the state of Utah. On January 26, 1996, the day of Taylor's execution, legislation was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives to eliminate the firing squad.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Phoenix's {{reputation}} takes a hit when {{he fails to}} properly defend a former client, Maggey Byrde, against accusations that she poisoned a talented programmer, Glen Elg. Convinced that someone impersonated him, Phoenix secures a <b>retrial</b> and conducts his own investigation. He discovers that Elg was developing a computer virus on behalf of loan shark Furio Tigre, and that Tigre, needing money to repay a large debt, killed him to steal it, then arranged for Maggey to take the fall. With no conclusive evidence, Phoenix manages to get Tigre arrested by making him say something only the real killer would know.|$|E
5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the <b>retrial.</b> The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E
5|$|Griffin and Collett {{were cleared}} {{of half the}} charges against them—the jury {{remained}} divided on the other charges, and a <b>retrial</b> was ordered. On 10 November 2006, after five hours of deliberations, the jury cleared them of all charges. They were met outside the court by about 200 supporters, who Griffin addressed with a megaphone. He attacked Tony Blair and the BBC, and defended the BNP's right to freedom of speech. BNP Deputy Chairman Simon Darby later claimed that had Griffin been convicted, the BNP leader planned to go on hunger strike.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a finite buffer queueing model with several key features of call centers, such as <b>retrials,</b> feedbacks, and impatience. In addition, {{because we do}} not completely understand the customer impatience behavior, we use a general distribution for the maximum waiting time before abandoning the call. We develop a QBD process with infinite state space for the queue in a call center situation. To solve for the stationary performance measures, we introduce an effective approximation method, and numerical examples have been presented to show the effectiveness of our method.
