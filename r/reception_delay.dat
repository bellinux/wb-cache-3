40|$|Broadcasting {{service is}} an {{important}} application in wireless networks. The goal is to distribute data packets from one source node to all other nodes in the network. Delivery ratio and <b>reception</b> <b>delay</b> are the two primary measures for broadcasting performance. Due to the wireless channel fluctuations, packet loss is often seen in wireless transmissions. However, the existing broadcast schemes have difficulty achieving good performance under severe packet loss. In this paper, we propose the rippling broadcast (RIP-cast) scheme which is able to achieve reliable and efficient transmissions in wireless ad hoc networks. The nodes in the network are designed to distribute data packets cooperatively in a special manner. The broadcast scheme also adopts the use of fountain codes to further enhance the reliability {{as well as the}} diversity of data transmissions. It is observed from the numerical experiments that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the delivery ratio and reduces the <b>reception</b> <b>delay</b> under packet loss compared to the existing broadcast schemes. The results suggest that RIP-cast is highly suitable for broadcasting service in wireless networks.

Thus, we study several strategies for efficient distribution of a certificate chain in regard to channel lad, which are adapted from their counterparts in position-based routing. Thereby, we find that by combining pseudonym certificate buffering with requester based responder selection the requirement for certificate chain distribution in VANETs can be removed completely.

40|$|Abstract — The {{applications}} of VANETs falls {{into two categories}} namely safety application (event-driven applications) and non-safety application (periodic applications). These both categories coexist in the network operation mode proposed for DSRC. High priority {{must be given to}} safety messages as they contain critical information. The proper estimation of network traffic is highly important in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) as they are expected to exchange high-priority critical messages. In reality, the network most of the time will handle low-priority traffic and in emergency situation will have to transfer high-priority traffic also. In this paper, performance evaluations of safety message dissemination in VANETs in Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication (V 2 V) are considered. The vehicles which are considered as nodes in VANET communicate or exchange messages with each other, which is referred to as V 2 V or Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC). V 2 V communication is implemented through Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) protocol. The main advantage of the V 2 V communication with DSRC will be decreased delay and efficient broadcasting of safety messages to far away nodes as possible.

In this thesis, we investigate these two important aspects of data communication jointly by suitably combining models from these two fields. In particular, we model scheduled communication of messages, that arrive in a random process, (i) over multiaccess channels, with either independent decoding or joint decoding, and (ii) over degraded broadcast channels. The scheduling policies proposed permit up to a certain maximum number of messages for simultaneous transmission. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we develop a multi-class discrete-time processor-sharing queueing model, and then investigate the stability of this queue. In particular, we model the queue by a discrete-time Markov chain defined on a countable state space, and then establish (i) a sufficient condition for $c$-regularity of the chain, and hence positive recurrence and finiteness of stationary mean of the function $c$ of the state, and (ii) a sufficient condition for transience of the chain.

The best indicators {{of the quality of}} its effect are the changes in call response time, <b>reception</b> time, <b>delay</b> time - which is defined as time between receiving a call and intervention emergency team arrival to the patient, and protocol compliance. The introduction of the new Croatian Emergency Call Reception Index protocol, which is modified from the Norwegian Index of medical Emergencies, resulted in a new model of aiding criteria-based decisions. We examined the efficiency of the dispatching service which is based on Croatian Emergency Call Reception Index protocol. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of one year period and compared results according to criteria given by the Norwegian index, between index and control group. All the included participants had NACA Severity of Injury or Illness Index score 5 - 7. There {{were no significant differences between}} the participants in both groups based on the subjects’ age and gender. We included 40 participants [20 indexes and 20 control group]. Results: Average call reception and reaction time as well as elapsed time, defined as a time between receiving a call and intervention emergency team arrival to the patient, were significantly shorter in the index group, where the call reception and reaction time were 111 seconds, compared to 180 seconds in the control group. Average elapsed time between receiving a call and the intervention team’s arrival to the patient was 11. 3 minutes for the index group, and it was 15. 5 minutes for the control group. Average time elapsed between receiving a call and the patient’s admission to the emergency department was 32 minutes for the index group and 52 minutes for the control group. Discussion: Seeing as the dispatching service is dynamic, demanding and highly responsible, it is subject to constant monitoring of quality indicators.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how semantically related information facilitates the intelligibility of spoken sentences {{in the presence}} of masking sound, and how this facilitation is influenced by masker type and by individual differences in cognitive functioning. Dutch sentences were masked by stationary noise, fluctuating noise, or an interfering talker. Each sentence was preceded by a text cue; cues were either three words that were semantically related to the sentence or three unpronounceable nonwords. Speech reception thresholds were adaptively measured. Additional measures included working memory capacity (reading span and size comparison span), linguistic closure ability (text <b>reception</b> threshold), and <b>delayed</b> sentence recognition. Word cues facilitated speech perception in noise similarly for all masker types. Cue benefit was related to reading span performance when the masker was interfering speech, but not when other maskers were used, and it did not correlate with text reception threshold or size comparison span. Better reading span performance was furthermore associated with enhanced delayed recognition of sentences preceded by word relative to nonword cues, across masker types. The results suggest that working memory capacity is associated with release from informational masking by semantically related information, and additionally with the encoding, storage, or retrieval of speech content in memory. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

Specifically, we evaluate the performance of a Listen-and-Suppress Carrier Sense Multiple Access (LAS-CSMA) scheme on the duplicate-insensitive exem-plary monotonic aggregates MAX and MIN. These schemes reduce power consumption, network bandwidth usage and delays by suppressing node packet transmissions that are proven to be unnecessary in the query response. This is possible when nodes listen to the transmissions of other nodes as they respond. Scalability tests were performed for 8 networks of various sizes, the largest having 24 Crossbow IRIS wireless mote modules as data nodes. We found that for the largest networks, packet transmissions, <b>receptions,</b> and response <b>delays</b> were reduced 44 %, 65 %, and 38 % respectively.

In order to address the delay problem, various delay-tolerant distributed space-time coding (DT-DSTC) schemes [10 – 14] have been recently reported for distributed MIMO systems. Extending the distributed threaded algebraic space-time (TAST) codes [10], Damen and Hammons designed a delay-tolerant coding scheme in [11] by the extension of the Galois field employed in the coding scheme to achieve full diversity and full rate. A further optimization which ensures that the codes in [11] obtain full diversity with the minimum length and lower decoding complexity has been presented in [12]. The authors of [13] have proposed delay-tolerant linear convolutional DSTC schemes which can maintain the full diversity property under any delay situation among the relays. In [14], a transmit processing technique based on linear constellation precoder (LCP) design has been employed to construct an optimal DT-DSTC scheme to achieve the upper bound on the error probability.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model for the beacon-enabled mode of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 medium-access control (MAC) protocol is provided. A personal area network (PAN) composed of multiple nodes, which transmit data to a PAN coordinator through direct links or multiple hops, is considered. The appli-cation is query based: Upon reception of the beacon transmitted by the PAN coordinator, each node tries to transmit its packet using the superframe structure defined by the IEEE 802. 15. 4 protocol. Those nodes that do not succeed in accessing the channel discard the packet; at the next superframe, a new packet is gen-erated. The aim of the paper {{is to develop a}} flexible mathematical tool able to study beacon-enabled 802. 15. 4 networks organized in different topologies. Both the contention access period (CAP) and the contention-free period defined by the standard are considered. The slotted carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm used in the CAP portion of the superframe is analytically modeled. The model describes the probability of packet successful <b>reception</b> and access <b>delay</b> statistics. Moreover, both star and tree-based topologies are dealt with; a suitable com-parison between these topologies is provided. The model is a useful tool for the design of MAC parameters and to select the better topology. The mathematical model is validated through simulation results. The model differs from those previously published by other authors in the literature as it precisely follows the MAC procedure defined by the standard {{in the context of the}} application scenario described.
