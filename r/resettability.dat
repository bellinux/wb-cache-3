30|$|The final step, {{to obtain}} our Theorem 2, we apply the {{transformation}} of (Deng et al. 2009) (Theorem 6) to our constant-round rsCNMZK protocol to obtain the constant-round simultaneous <b>resettability</b> NMZK. This step can be proved by using the same approach in “The view generated by the simulator” section based on the analysis of (Deng et al. 2009). Intuitively, on the one hand, a protocol with an extra resettably-sound property will not increase {{the power of the}} man-in-the-middle adversary on the right; on the other hand, for a man-in-the-middle adversary with resetting-attack on the left, we can construct a simulator-extractor to simulate its view and extract the witnesses in the right accepted session, otherwise we can use this experiment to break the 4 -robust one-one CCA-secure commitment scheme Com 1 : 1.|$|E
40|$|Current {{methods of}} {{deploying}} spacecraft payloads typically employ explosive-type separation devices {{which do not}} address shock concerns and are not resettable without disassembly from the spacecraft or significant refurbishment of parts. Other separation mechanisms exist which eliminate explosives, but also do not offer reduced shock or the advantages of insitu <b>resettability.</b> Several new, shape-memory alloy (SMA) actuated release mechanisms {{have been developed for}} satellite release applications for loads of 500 lbf and greater. These mechanisms all offer fast, non-pyro releases and are completely testable and reusable while mounted on the spacecraft. The Qwknut and the Low-Force Nut (LFN) are suitable for release applications up to 3000 lbf, while the Fast-Acting, Shockless Separation Nut (FASSN) is suitable for higher load releases above 5000 lbf. FASSNs have been successfully prototyped for release applications of 80, 000 lbf. Shawn H.

40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} resettably-sound resettable zero knowledge {{arguments for}} NP based on standard hardness assumption (the existence of claw-free permutations) in the plain model. This proves the simultaneous <b>resettability</b> conjecture posed by Barak et al. in [FOCS 2001]. Our construction, {{inspired by the}} paradigm for designing concurrent zero knowledge protocols, makes crucial use of a tool called instance-dependent resettably-sound resettable WI argument of knowledge (IDWIAOK (and a special-purpose variant), introduced recently by Deng and Lin in [Eurocrypt 2007]). Roughly speaking, for a NP statement of the form x 0 ∨ x 1, IDWIAOK is an argument for which resettable WI property holds when both x 0 and x 1 are YES instances, and resettably-sound argument of knowledge property holds when x 0 is a NO instance. The heart of the simulator for our protocol is a new technique {{that allows us to}} embed the (non-black-box) straight-line simulation strategy in the (black-box) recursive rewinding simulation strategy. 1 The problem and our result It is well known that randomness is essential to zero knowledge proofs/arguments[17].

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{a notion of}} instance-dependent verifiable ran-dom functions (InstD-VRFs for short). Informally, an InstD-VRF is, in some sense, a verifiable random function [23] with a special public key, which is generated via a (possibly) interactive protocol and contains an instance y ∈ L ∩ { 0, 1 } ∗ for a specific NP language L, but the secu-rity requirements on such a function are relaxed: we only require the pseudorandomness property when y ∈ L and only require the unique-ness property when y / ∈ L, instead of requiring both pseudorandomness and uniqueness to hold simultaneously. We show that this notion can be realized under standard assumption. Our motivation is the conjecture posed by Barak et al. [2], which states there exist resettably-sound resettable zero knowledge arguments for NP. The instance-dependent verifiable random functions is a powerful tool to tackle this problem. We first use them to obtain two interesting instance-dependent argument systems from the Barak’s public-coin bounded con-current zero knowledge argument [1], and then, we 1. Construct the first (constant round) zero knowledge arguments for NP enjoying a certain simultaneous <b>resettability</b> under standard hardness assumptions in the plain model, which we call bounded-class resettable ZK arguments with weak resettable-soundness. Though the malicious party (prover or verifier) in such system {{is limited to a}} kind of bounded resetting attack, We put NO restrictions on the number of the total resets made by malicious party. 2. show that, under standard assumptions, if there exist public-coin concurrent zero knowledge arguments for NP, there exist the resettably-sound resetable zero knowledge arguments for NP...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{notion of}} {{resettable}} zero-knowledge (rZK) {{was introduced by}} Canetti, Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali (FOCS’ 01) as a strengthening of the classical notion of zero-knowledge. A rZK protocol remains zero-knowledge even if the verifier can reset the prover back to its initial state anytime during the protocol execution and force it {{to use the same}} random tape again and again. Following this work, various extensions of this notion were considered for the zero-knowledge and witness indistinguishability functionalities. In this paper, we initiate the study of <b>resettability</b> for more general functionalities. We first consider the setting of resettable two-party computation where a party (called the user) can reset the other party (called the smartcard) anytime during the protocol execution. After being reset, the smartcard comes back to its original state and thus the user has the opportunity to start interacting with it again (knowing that the smartcard will use the same set of random coins). In this setting, we show {{that it is possible to}} secure realize all PPT computable functionalities under the most natural (simulation based) definition. Thus our results show that in cryptographic protocols, the reliance on randomness and the ability to keep state can be made significantly weaker. Our simulator for the aforementioned resettable two-party computation protocol (inherently) makes use of non-black box techniques. Second, we provide a construction of simultaneous resettable multi-party computation with an honest majority (where the adversary not only controls a minority of parties but is also allowed to reset any number of parties at any point). Interestingly, all our results are in the plain model. ...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{engineering}} {{methods and}} microfabrication techniques offer powerful means for meeting biological challenges. In particular, microfabrication processes enable researchers to develop technologies at scales that are biologically relevant and advantageous. In this work, microfabricated posts {{were employed to}} advance cell handling capabilities in both static and dynamic (i. e., microfluidic) systems. Static, substrate-based biophysical properties influence diverse cellular processes. Methods for engineering micropost arrays enable microscale control over the biophysical characteristics of discrete topographic features. Here, unidirectional micropost array gradients of variable micropost stiffness and variable interpost spacing were constructed to regulate cell motility using two distinct biophysical cues: (i) gradients in substrate rigidity (i. e., via durotaxis - a subset of mechanotaxis), and (ii) variable spacing of substrate binding sites - via a phenomenon herein referred to as spatiotaxis. Micropost array stiffness gradients were designed with post-to-post differences in stiffness of 0. 5 nN/µm, 2 nN/µm, 3 nN/µm, and 7. 5 nN/µm. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) seeded on micropost array gradients with variable micropost stiffness exhibited preferential cell migration {{in the direction of}} increasing micropost stiffness. Gradients of elliptical microposts further enhanced unidirectional guidance by limiting cellular movement perpendicular to the direction of increasing micropost stiffness. Micropost array spacing gradients were designed with average post-to-post differences in spacing of 10 nm, 20 nm, and 40 nm. Micropost array gradients with variable interpost spacing were found to promote BAEC migration in the direction of decreasing interpost spacing, which represents the first demonstration of unidirectional spatiotaxis. Higher gradient strengths were observed to enhance the aforementioned migratory behaviors for both biophysical cues. For substrates with simultaneous, anti-parallel stiffness and spatial stimuli, the spatial cues were found to dominate the migratory response. The micropost array gradient methodology offers a powerful technique for investigating the biophysical cellular response, while also providing the basis for new classes of passive substrates capable of directing cell motility in biological fields, such as biomaterials, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. In order to create high-speed lab-on-a-chip devices for quantitative cell biology, drug discovery, and molecular diagnostics, precision hydrodynamic controls of microparticles (e. g., cells and microbeads) are in critical demand. The ability to achieve multi-stage fluidic reaction processes for microparticles is integral to diverse chemical and biological applications; however, microfluidic particulate-based systems remain limited due to particle handling issues. In contrast to suspended cells, which are experimentally complex, microbeads offer a simplified example for initial demonstrations of microfluidic particulate handling. Thus, the ability to manipulate microbeads in microfluidic systems represents a fundamental first step toward advancing microfluidic cell handling. In this dissertation, microposts (15 × 15 µm 2) were arrayed within microfluidic architectures (18 µm in height) to enhance microparticle handling and enable multi-stage fluidic reactions and analyses for suspended particles. The presented microfluidic systems were first characterized using suspended microbeads (15 µm in diameter); thereafter, the potential of employing the platforms for cell handling applications was also investigated using suspended BAECs. A resettable, hydrodynamic microparticle trapping system - termed micropost array trapping (µPAT) - was designed and demonstrated to accomplish controlled particulate arraying and microarray <b>resettability</b> by trapping-and-releasing both microbeads and cells. The µPAT technique was integrated into: (i) a dynamic microarray to detect multiple bio-molecules in parallel via molecular beacon probes conjugated to microbead substrates, and (ii) a "Microfluidic Ping Pong" (MPP) system to achieve multi-stage fluidic reactions under discontinuous flow conditions. As a demonstrative example, the MPP technique was employed to detect an inflammatory cytokine at 100 pM concentrations via an 11 -stage aptamer beacon-based sandwich assay performed using microbeads. Additionally, a microfluidic micropost array railing (µPAR) system was developed to rapidly transport both microbeads and cells into adjacent flow streams under continuous flow conditions. To demonstrate the µPAR technique, a multiplexed layer-by-layer (LbL) molecular synthesis process (i. e., consisting of up to 18 fluidic stages) was accomplished on microbead substrates. This work represents the first demonstration of a microfluidic platform capable of railing either microbeads or cells into adjacent flow streams. Through improved microparticle handling in microfluidic systems, the presented methodologies could further extend the efficacy of dynamic cell-based and bead-based microarrays for applications in diverse chemical and biological fields...|$|E
