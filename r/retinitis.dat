5|$|Red Szell {{became the}} first blind person to climb the Old Man, despite {{suffering}} from <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa that left him with 5 per cent vision. With assistance from Martin Moran and Nick Carter, he scaled the stack in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Henderson {{was born}} in Nuriootpa, South Australia, on 8 September 1992. She has the visual {{disability}} of <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa, a heredity disease {{she was diagnosed with}} when she was four years old. As a child, Henderson was involved in javelin, and only stopped competing in 2010 following taking up goalball. She was also involved in swimming, representing South Australia in a few national competitions, before leaving the sport {{at the same time she}} quit athletics. She graduated from Nuriootpa High School in 2010. , she is studying with the goal of becoming a preschool teacher.|$|E
5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1950 as Bassen-Kornzweig disease, or Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive, childhood-onset disorder {{in which the}} body fails to produce chylomicrons, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa {{and other forms of}} nerve dysfunction. It was first noted by the North American physician Frank Bassen, who later partnered with the ophthalmologist Abraham Kornzweig to identify and describe causes and symptoms of the disease. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive during their first year.|$|E
5|$|DST has mixed {{effects on}} health. In {{societies}} with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; {{whether this is}} beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions. DST shifts are associated with higher rates of ischemic stroke {{in the first two}} days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's {{eyesight}} failed further due to <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa. By that time, {{there were}} ten {{children in the}} Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from sudden infant death syndrome, his mother left the family to live with another woman. Armstrong subsequently {{spent much of his}} youth in various children's homes, and was a serial truant from school. His mother had taught him to shoplift as a child, and he was involved in petty crime throughout his youth in Manchester. At nine years old, he began training at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played football for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he stopped playing football to concentrate on his training in the ring. During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were parents by the time Armstrong was 17.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinitis</b> pigmentosa (RP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of {{inherited}} retinal degeneration.|$|E
25|$|The {{progressive}} {{nature of}} {{and lack of}} a definitive cure for <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa contribute to the inevitably discouraging outlook for patients with this disease. While complete blindness is rare, the patient's visual acuity and visual field will continue to decline as initial rod photoreceptor and later cone photoreceptor degradation proceeds. Possible treatments remain in the research and clinical trial stages; however, treatment studies concerning visual restoration in <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa prove promising for the future.|$|E
25|$|Lobbyists {{for this}} {{provision}} included the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, the National Association of Convenience Stores, and the National <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} pathology, {{it has been}} {{associated}} with processes such as amyloidosis, <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa, infection mechanisms, kidney diseases and various types of congenital hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|British {{researchers}} successfully cure blindness in mice {{using an}} injection of photosensitive cells. Following additional testing, the treatment {{could be used}} to heal human sufferers of <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa.|$|E
25|$|While {{visual field}} and acuity test results {{combined}} with retinal imagery support {{the diagnosis of}} <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa, additional testing is necessary to confirm other pathological features of this disease. Electroretinography (ERG) confirms the RP diagnosis by evaluating functional aspects associated with photoreceptor degeneration, and can detect physiological abnormalities before the initial manifestation of symptoms. An electrode lens {{is applied to the}} eye as photoreceptor response to varying degrees of quick light pulses is measured. Patients exhibiting the <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa phenotype would show decreased or delayed electrical response in the rod photoreceptors, as well as possibly compromised cone photoreceptor cell response.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} an {{engineered}} variant has recently been described that efficiently transduces Muller glia following intravitreal injection, and {{has been used to}} rescue an animal model of aggressive, autosomal-dominant <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa.|$|E
25|$|Several {{diseases}} {{have been}} observed in patients with PMD. However, no causal relationships have been established between any of the associated diseases and the pathogenesis of PMD. Such diseases include: chronic open-angle glaucoma, <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa, retinal lattice degeneration, scleroderma, kerato-conjunctivitis, eczema, and hyperthyroidism.|$|E
25|$|The United States Food and Drug Administration approves {{the first}} {{functional}} commercial bionic eye, the Argus II, {{for the treatment}} of blindness. The device, which became available in Europe in 2011, uses a combination of ocular implants and camera-equipped eyeglasses to restore vision to people blinded by <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa.|$|E
25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} {{is named after}} the Scottish ophthalmologist Charles Usher, who examined the pathology and transmission of this illness in 1914 {{on the basis of}} 69 cases. However, it was first described in 1858 by Albrecht von Gr√§fe, a pioneer of modern ophthalmology. He reported the case of a deaf patient with <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa, who had two brothers with the same symptoms. Three years later, one of his students, Richard Liebreich, examined the population of Berlin for disease pattern of deafness with <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa. Liebreich noted Usher syndrome to be recessive, since the cases of blind-deafness combinations occurred particularly in the siblings of blood-related marriages or in families with patients in different generations. His observations supplied the first proofs for the coupled transmission of blindness and deafness, since no isolated cases of either could be found in the family trees.|$|E
25|$|The goal of {{gene therapy}} studies is to virally {{supplement}} retinal cells expressing mutant genes {{associated with the}} <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa phenotype with healthy forms of the gene; thus, allowing the repair and proper functioning of retinal photoreceptor cells {{in response to the}} instructions associated with the inserted healthy gene. Clinical trials investigating the insertion of the healthy RPE65 gene in retinas expressing the LCA2 <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa phenotype measured modest improvements in vision; however, the degradation of retinal photoreceptors continued at the disease-related rate. Likely, gene therapy may preserve remaining healthy retinal cells while failing to repair the earlier accumulation of damage in already diseased photoreceptor cells. Response to gene therapy would theoretically benefit young patients exhibiting the shortest progression of photoreceptor decline; thus, correlating to a higher possibility of cell rescue via the healthy inserted gene.|$|E
25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} {{is responsible for}} the majority of deaf-blindness. The word syndrome means that multiple symptoms occur together, in this case, deafness and blindness. It occurs in roughly 1 person in 23,000 in the United States, 1 in 28,000 in Norway and 1 in 12,500 in Germany. People with Usher syndrome represent roughly one-sixth of people with <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa.|$|E
25|$|Usher syndrome, {{also known}} as Hallgren syndrome, Usher-Hallgren syndrome, <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa-{{dysacusis}} syndrome, or dystrophia retinae dysacusis syndrome, is an extremely rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation {{in any one of}} at least 11 genes resulting in a combination of hearing loss and visual impairment. It is a leading cause of deafblindness and is at present incurable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa is {{the leading}} cause of {{inherited}} blindness, with approximately 1/4,000 individuals experiencing the non-syndromic form of their disease within their lifetime. It is estimated that 1.5 million people worldwide are currently affected. Early onset RP occurs within the first few years of life and is typically associated with syndromic disease forms, while late onset RP emerges from early to mid adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Havana {{has also}} been a popular health tourism {{destination}} for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, {{for a wide range of}} treatments including eye-surgery, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and orthopaedics. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa, often known as night blindness, has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that the use of DHA-rich fish oil {{capsules}} did not reduce postpartum depression in mothers or improve cognitive and language development in their offspring during early childhood. Another systematic review found that DHA had no significant benefits in improving visual field in individuals with <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa. A 2017 pilot {{study found that}} fish oil supplementation reduced the depression symptoms emphasizing the importance of the target DHA levels.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in four pre-mRNA {{splicing}} {{factors are}} known to cause autosomal dominant <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa. These are PRPF3 (human PRPF3 is HPRPF3; also PRP3), PRPF8, PRPF31 and PAP1. These factors are ubiquitously expressed and it is proposed that defects in a ubiquitous factor (a protein expressed everywhere) should only cause disease in the retina because the retinal photoreceptor cells have a far greater requirement for protein processing (rhodopsin) than any other cell type.|$|E
25|$|Up to 150 {{mutations}} {{have been}} reported to date in the opsin gene associated with the RP since the Pro23His mutation in the intradiscal domain of the protein was first reported in 1990. These mutations are found throughout the opsin gene and are distributed along the three domains of the protein (the intradiscal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains). One of the main biochemical causes of RP in the case of rhodopsin mutations is protein misfolding, and the disruption of molecular chaperones. It was found that the mutation of codon 23 in the rhodopsin gene, in which proline is changed to histidine, accounts for the largest fraction of rhodopsin mutations in the United States. Several other studies have reported various codon mutations associated with <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa, including Thr58Arg, Pro347Leu, Pro347Ser, as well as deletion of Ile-255. In 2000, a rare mutation in codon 23 was reported causing autosomal dominant <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa, in which proline changed to alanine. However, this study showed that the retinal dystrophy associated with this mutation was characteristically mild in presentation and course. Furthermore, there was greater preservation in electroretinography amplitudes than the more prevalent Pro23His mutation.|$|E
25|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} and recessive forms of <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa affect {{both male and}} female populations equally; however, the less frequent X-linked form of the disease affects male recipients of the X-linked mutation, while females usually remain unaffected carriers of the RP trait. The X-linked forms of the disease are considered severe, and typically lead to complete blindness during later stages. In rare occasions, a dominant form of the X-linked gene mutation will affect both males and females equally.|$|E
25|$|Steve Wynn {{suffers from}} the {{degenerative}} eye disease, <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa, which {{he was diagnosed with}} in 1971. In 2010, Wynn switched to a vegan diet after watching the documentary Eating by Mike Anderson. According to Wynn, his vegan diet was also inspired by a guest on his yacht in St. Tropez, who discussed the environmental and health consequences of eating meat. After becoming a vegan, Wynn announced that he would add animal-free menus to all his restaurants.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{receiving}} traditional tourism revenues, Cuba attracts health tourists, generating {{annual revenues}} of around $40 {{million for the}} Cuban economy. Cuba has been a popular health tourism destination for more than 20 years. In 2005, more than 19,600 foreign patients traveled to Cuba {{for a wide range}} of treatments including eye surgery, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and orthopaedics. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa, often known as night blindness, has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.|$|E
25|$|Ojeda {{spent the}} next year {{traveling}} in Spain and Mexico, and was preparing two one-man shows {{to be held in}} Soho and Los Angeles when his health began to fail him. In 1986 he was diagnosed with AIDS. That year his one-man show opened at the Michael Kohn Gallery in Los Angeles, followed in March, 1987, by one at the David Beitzel Gallery in New York. By that time AIDS-related Cytomegalovirus <b>retinitis</b> had begun robbing Ojeda of his eyesight. He died at New York University Medical Center in 1989, aged 30.|$|E
25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} type I can {{be caused}} by mutations in any one of several different genes: CDH23, MYO7A, PCDH15, USH1C, and USH1G. These genes function in the development and maintenance of inner ear structures such as hair cells (stereocilia), which transmit sound and motion signals to the brain. Alterations in these genes can cause an inability to maintain balance (vestibular dysfunction) and hearing loss. The genes also {{play a role in the}} development and stability of the retina by influencing the structure and function of both the rod photoreceptor cells and supporting cells called the retinal pigmented epithelium. Mutations that affect the normal function of these genes can result in <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa and resultant vision loss.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indirect}} symptoms characterize <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa {{along with the}} direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline. Phenomena such as photophobia, which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, and photopsia, the presence of blinking or shimmering lights within the visual field, often manifest during the later stages of RP. Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the {{fundus of the eye}} as the Ophthalamic triad. This includes the development of (1) a mottled appearance of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) caused by bone spicule formation, (2) a waxy appearance of the optic nerve, and (3) the attentuation of blood vessels in the retina.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the genetic}} {{inheritance}} patterns of RP, many isolate populations exhibit higher disease frequencies or increased prevalence {{of a specific}} RP mutation. Pre-existing or emerging mutations that contribute to rod photoreceptor degeneration in <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa are passed down through familial lines; thus, allowing certain RP cases to be concentrated to specific geographical regions with an ancestral history of the disease. Several hereditary studies have been performed to determine the varying prevalence rates in Maine (USA), Birmingham (England), Switzerland (affects 1/7000), Denmark (affects 1/2500), and Norway. Navajo Indians display an elevated rate of RP inheritance as well, which is estimated as affecting 1 in 1878 individuals. Despite the increased frequency of RP within specific familial lines, the disease is considered non-discriminatory and tends to equally affect all world populations.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} genes that, when mutated, {{can cause the}} <b>retinitis</b> pigmentosa phenotype. Inheritance patterns of RP {{have been identified as}} autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and maternally (mitochondrially) acquired, and are dependent on the specific RP gene mutations present in the parental generation. In 1989, a mutation of the gene for rhodopsin, a pigment that plays an essential part in the visual transduction cascade enabling vision in low-light conditions, was identified. The rhodopsin gene encodes a principal protein of photoreceptor outer segments. Mutations in this gene most commonly presents as missense mutations or misfolding of the rhodopsin protein, and most frequently follow autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. Since the discovery of the rhodopsin gene, more than 100 RHO mutations have been identified, accounting for 15% of all types of retinal degeneration, and approximately 25% of autosomal dominant forms of RP.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{field and}} acuity tests measure {{and compare the}} size of the patient's field of vision and the clarity of their visual {{perception}} with the standard visual measurements associated with healthy 20/20 vision. Clinical diagnostic features indicative of <b>Retinitis</b> Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and retinal pigment epithelium physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E
25|$|Human ABC {{transporters}} {{are involved}} in several diseases that arise from polymorphisms in ABC genes and rarely due to complete loss of function of single ABC proteins. Such diseases include Mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, Tangier disease, immune deficiencies, progressive familial intraheptic cholestasis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia, X-linked sideroblastosis and anemia, age-related macular degeneration, familial hypoapoproteinemia, <b>Retinitis</b> pigmentosum, cone rod dystrophy, and others. The human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family is responsible for multiple drug resistance (MDR) against a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. ABCB1 or MDR1 P-glycoprotein is also involved in other biological processes for which lipid transport is the main function. It is found to mediate the secretion of the steroid aldosterone by the adrenals, and its inhibition blocked the migration of dendritic immune cells, possibly related to the outward transport of the lipid platelet activating factor (PAF). It has also been reported that ABCB1 mediates transport of cortisol and dexamethasone, but not of progesterone in ABCB1 transfected cells. MDR1 can also transport cholesterol, short-chain and long-chain analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), sphingomyelin (SM), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Multispecific transport of diverse endogenous lipids through the MDR1 transporter can possibly affect the transbilayer distribution of lipids, in particular of species normally predominant on the inner plasma membrane leaflet such as PS and PE.|$|E
