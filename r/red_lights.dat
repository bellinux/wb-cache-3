5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E
5|$|Members of Howling Bells {{have cited}} The Beatles, Charles Mingus, Peter Green, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Jimi Hendrix as influences. The {{catalyst}} for the change from Waikiki to Howling Bells was Juanita and Joel's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia. They saw this band shrouded in <b>red</b> <b>lights,</b> and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter their musical direction. The band's style {{has been compared to}} that of Siouxsie and the Banshees, PJ Harvey, The Velvet Underground, Nick Cave, Mazzy Star, and The Duke Spirit. Their music has been called folk rock, melodic blues, and country-goth. Juanita disagrees with the group's gothic characterization.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and <b>red</b> <b>lights.</b> Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study types of {{motorized}} vehicles <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running and their characteristics, {{the concept of}} critical distance was introduced, combining with the start and end of <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> to classify motorized vehicles <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running into three categories: deliberate and unintentional <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violation at <b>red</b> onset and <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violation at <b>red</b> end. Based on video observation data, the number of motorized vehicles that commit any of the afore-mentioned three types of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violation was statistically analyzed, and then their characteristics under various traffic control and management conditions were explored using z-test method. The {{results show that the}} majority of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> runners at <b>red</b> start are deliberate, while the unintentional <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violators also share some proportion. At the end of <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> there are a few vehicles violating <b>red</b> <b>light</b> as well. Additionally, the rates of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running are obviously varying between those three classifications of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running under the conditions of countdown timer, automatic <b>red</b> <b>light</b> camera, green flashing device, different speed limits and peak period...|$|R
40|$|The study {{attempts}} to find the effectiveness of adopting <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras in reducing <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violators. An experimental approach was adopted to investigate the use of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras at signalized intersections in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The study locations were divided into three groups. The first group {{was related to the}} approaches monitored with <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras. The second group was related to approaches without <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras, but located within an intersection that had one of its approaches monitored with <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras. The third group was related to intersection approaches located at intersection without <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras (controlled sites). A methodology was developed for data collection. The data were then tested statistically by Z-test using proportion methods to compare the proportion of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violations occurring at different sites. The study found that the proportion of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violators at approaches monitored with <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras was significantly less than those at the controlled sites for most of the time. Approaches without <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras located within intersections having <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras showed, in general, fewer violations than controlled sites, but the results were not significant for all times of the day. The study reveals that <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras {{have a positive effect on}} reducing <b>red</b> <b>light</b> violations. However, these conclusions need further evaluations to justify their safe and economic use...|$|R

5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} actually help {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E

40|$|Short {{exposure}} of the spores of Cheilanthes farinosa to low intensity <b>red</b> <b>light</b> promotes their germination, which is not reversed by a subsequent exposure to far <b>red</b> <b>light.</b> Germination is, however, inhibited by blue light administered before or after <b>red</b> <b>light.</b> Inhibition of germination by blue light is annulled by exposure to a higher intensity of <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> and germination of the repromoted spores is inhibited by far <b>red</b> <b>light.</b> Mutual photoreversibility of germination is also observed in repromoted spores irradiated successively with far <b>red</b> and <b>red</b> <b>light.</b> Although germination appears to be basically under phytochrome control, it is postulated {{that the presence of}} a blue light-absorbing pigment interferes with phytochrome transformations in the spores...|$|R
50|$|In December 2004, Chief Hurtt (when he was {{the former}} chief of Oxnard, CA) stated that when the city of Oxnard {{installed}} their <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras, it has claimed that <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running decreased dramatically although Houston {{was in the process of}} favoring <b>red</b> <b>light</b> camera enforcement.The history of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> camera enforcement goes back to the 78th Texas Legislature where this measure was voted down although a transportation bill authored by a member of the Texas House of Representatives had an inclusion of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> camera enforcement. In December 2004, the Houston City Council unanimously voted for <b>red</b> <b>light</b> camera enforcement although Texas State Representative Gary Elkins (R-TX) introduced legislation to deter Houston from amending its city charter for the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> camera rule to be enforced. This measure failed in the Texas Senate although in 2005, four intersections in downtown Houston were used as testbeds for <b>red</b> <b>light</b> camera equipment. After a contract was approved, the enforcement went online September 1, 2006 to which those running a <b>red</b> <b>light</b> (there are 50 locations) are fined a $75 civil fine as opposed to a $225 moving violation which goes against the vehicle operator.|$|R
40|$|Red light running, a {{significant}} road safety problem at signalized intersections Phil. Kicks and E. Matsoukis As <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running is defined any observation during which a vehicle crossed the stop line after {{the occurrence of}} a <b>red</b> traffic <b>light.</b> A number of studies on <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running behavior have indicated that <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running is {{a significant}} road safety problem. In order {{to gain a better}} understanding of the occurrence of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running and the characteristics of this high accident risk behavior, the Transport Study Unit of the University of Patras, Greece has carried out a relevant project. This work consisted of various parts: 1. Review of existing literature on <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running and its impact on road safety; 2. Analysis of accidents involving <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running; 3. Find out what measures have been taken elsewhere; 4. Conduct an observation pilot study for a signalized intersection in the Patras, to identify <b>red</b> <b>light</b> incidents. In the conclusions it is found, that an analysis of accidents alone, does not provide information on the extent of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running on a road network. The study indicates that a number of other issues ought to be investigated, before countermeasures, such as e. g. <b>red</b> <b>light</b> cameras should be suggested...|$|R
25|$|Croatian level {{crossings}} (prijelaz u nivou in Croatian) {{are similar to}} Slovenian crossings in that the lights are composed of to <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> in a triangle. Many crossings are automatic with barriers and bells.|$|E
25|$|Russia's level {{crossings}} {{have one of}} the loudest bells. Like U.S. {{level crossings}}, Russia has 2 <b>red</b> <b>lights.</b> It acts similar to U.S. level crossings, but the barriers go slightly up for 1 second before going down.|$|E
25|$|In Finland, level {{crossings}} (tasoylikäytävä or tasoristeys in Finnish) with warning lights have {{the more common}} <b>red</b> <b>light(s)</b> and a white light that flashes except when the <b>red</b> <b>light(s)</b> flash. Most, but not all, crossings with lights also have barriers. Full-length barriers are usually used only for pedestrian and bicycle lanes. Half-length barriers are used for motor roads, to avoid {{the risk of a}} vehicle being trapped on the tracks between the barriers. Bells begin to ring when the <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> start flashing and usually stop when the barriers have come down. Red-and-yellow crossbuck is used on both controlled and uncontrolled {{level crossings}}. If there are two or more tracks, {{the lower part of the}} cross is doubled. Only minor agricultural crossings might have no signs at all. On bigger roads there are usually also approach signs as seen in the picture. Finnish level crossings are the sixth safest in Europe. Finland's state railway system has almost 3000 level crossings, according to TraFi. In Finland over the course of railway history many level crossing accidents have occurred, in comparison to other Scandinavian countries. In Finland the maximum speed for trains on the rails with level crossings is 140km/h.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>red</b> <b>light</b> on the aging {{progression}} of the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) hypocotyl segment unit was examined in relation to dwarfism using Kentucky Wonder (tall) and Masterpiece (dwarf) varieties. In both plants, <b>red</b> <b>light</b> promoted the elongation of younger zones and inhibited that of mature zones. The zone exhibiting maximum elongation was shifted to the younger zones by <b>red</b> <b>light</b> irradiation regardless of the plant type, but its extent was greater in the dwarf than in the tall. Thus, <b>red</b> <b>light</b> hastens both the beginning of elongation in the younger portion and its termination in the mature portion of the hypocotyl, particularly of the dwarf plant. These <b>red</b> <b>light</b> responses in each zone of both the tall and dwarf hypocotyl units were reversed by subsequent exposure to far <b>red</b> <b>light</b> regardless of the duration and intensity of <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> thus indicating that the hastened aging {{progression of the}} hypocotyl by <b>red</b> <b>light</b> is mediated by phytochrome. However, {{there is no difference}} in the rate of decay of Pfr between the tall and dwarf hypocotyls...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Highway Administration {{estimates}} that <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running causes more than 100, 000 crashes and 1, 000 fatalities annually {{and results in}} an estimated economic loss of over $ 14 billion {{per year in the}} United States. In Iowa alone, a statewide analysis of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running crashes, using crash data from 2001 to 2006, indicates that an average of 1, 682 <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running crashes occur at signalized intersections every year. As a result, <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running poses a significant safety issue for communities. Communities rarely have the resources to place additional law enforcement in the field to combat the problem and they are increasingly using automated <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running camera-enforcement systems at signalized intersections. In Iowa, three communities currently use camera enforcement since 2004. These communities include Davenport, Council Bluffs, and Clive. As communities across the United States attempt to address <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running, a number of communities have implemented <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running camera enforcement programs.
