5|$|Altair is a type-A main {{sequence}} star with approximately 1.8 times {{the mass of}} the Sun and 11 times its luminosity. Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours. For comparison, the equator of the Sun <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> little more than 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
