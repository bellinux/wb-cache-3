50|$|During the Jurassic period, over {{a period}} of 20 million years, the layered {{materials}} became firmly glued together by sand-clay solder or silicon. The hot and dry climate formed a great amount of iron oxide, or hematite, which gave the rocks their <b>rusty</b> <b>red</b> color. When the earth’s crust started to settle, lighter and smaller sandstones merged with the red conglomerates.|$|R
50|$|Hydnellum aurantiacum is an {{inedible}} fungus, {{commonly known}} as the orange spine or orange Hydnellum for its reddish orange or <b>rusty</b> <b>red</b> colored fruit bodies.

Due to substantial declines in sightings, this species is listed as critically endangered in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Larva has yellow {{upper half}} and brown ventral part. Yellow part is broken by {{longitudinal}} brown bands, which faints towards posterior and becomes intensive again in prolegs. Eggs olive green and speckled <b>rusty</b> <b>red.</b> First few instars are green with three lateral purple brown lines. Late instars are yellowish. Pupa within a slight cocoon of white silk, which spun amongst leaves.|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} two other sprites with yellow faces in South Africa; Pseudagrion gamblesi is much larger, has a striped thorax, and is {{restricted}} to faster-flowing rivers at lower altitudes in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga.

40|$|The {{painting}} {{consists of}} a rainbow of colors with a <b>rusty</b> <b>red</b> in the center.

Although the colors meet and begin to interact with each other, they remain mostly independent. There are spots and blotches as well that creates texture...|$|R
50|$|Iodonitrotetraolium is an {{artificial}} electron acceptor {{which can be}} utilized in a colorimetric assay to determine the concentration of protein in a solution. It can be reduced by succinate dyhydrogenase to Forazan, the formation {{of which can be}} measured by absorbance at 490nm. The activity of succinate dehydrogenase is readily observed by the naked eye as the solution turns from colourless to <b>rusty</b> <b>red.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A deep bodied, {{laterally}} compressed {{fish with}} a blunt snout. [...] Spineless dorsal fin with the posterior ray developedinto a long filament. [...] Usually silver overall, sometimes grey to greenish dorsally. [...] In Victoria {{it has been}} reported to develop a <b>rusty</b> <b>red</b> tinge especially around the mouth which is thought to be related to breeding. [...] Some populations develop a dark blotch on the shoulder.|$|R
