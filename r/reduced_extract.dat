40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this work}} was to verify the {{influence}} of mechanicalharvesting and postharvest treatments on wine composition. Methods and results: Trials were carried out in triplicate on cv. Montunigrapes. The estimated best setting frequency for the mechanical harvesterwas 410 shakes/min. Comparing hand-picked and mechanically harvestedgrapes, the <b>reduced</b> <b>extract</b> and pH results were lower for the hand-pickedgrapes, showing a more evident berry breakage caused by the mechanicalharvester. The wines obtained from mechanically harvested grapes hada lower phenolic compound content than wines produced with hand-pickedgrapes, indicating that oxidation phenomena occurred; the trend forpostharvest treated grapes was different. The significantly lower amountof higher alcohols in the hand-picked grapes trial than in the mechanicallyharvested ones {{could be explained by}} a lower amount of their precursorsand oxygen in musts. The sensory differences among the trials weresignificant for some parameters, but an overall view of the data suggestedthat the differences were not remarkable and all the wines were good. Conclusion: Postharvest treatments reduce the loss of natural antioxidantcompounds found in wines produced from mechanically harvested grapes. Mechanical harvesting does not have a negative influence on winecomposition if matched with the proper vineyard characteristics, machinesettings and postharvest treatments. The typicality of Montuni wine ismaintained in the cases of grapes harvested mechanically with, but alsowithout, any postharvest treatment. The use of these treatments is otherwiseuseful to obtain wines with a better stability. Significance and impact of the study: With respect to mechanicalharvesting, this study highlights the importance of maintaining and/orimproving the quality of mechanically harvested grapes containing theharvesting costs.

40|$|Dehydropyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (DHPAs) are a {{large group}} of globally important plant-derived pro-toxins that can contaminate or are naturally present in animal feed and the human food supply as well as herbal supplements. Their bioactive metabolites are potentially hepatotoxic, pneumotoxic, genotoxic and carcinogenic. Due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of purified DHPAs, toxicity studies have largely relied on single intraperitoneal injections in rodent models, and carcinogenicity studies have been limited to a small handful of the hundreds of isolated DHPAs. To assess the relative toxicity of structurally diverse DHPAs in a more biologically relevant manner, male California White chicks were dosed orally with 0. 01, 0. 04, 0. 13, or 0. 26 mmol of seven different DHPAs and three DHPA N-oxides kg- 1 bodyweight for 7 days. DHPAs were grouped in relation to their toxicity based on clinical, serum biochemical, and histopathological evaluations as well as tissue adduct accumulation rates. Using the same model, a <b>reduced</b> <b>extract</b> from comfrey, a commonly used DHPA containing herb, was compared to its two major constituent DHPAs, intermedine and lycopsamine. Based on the same parameters, the comfrey extract was more toxic than pure lycopsamine or intermedine. Addressing the need for a more sensitive carcinogenicity model, male heterozygous p 53 knockout mice were treated with riddelliine 5, 15 or 45 mg kg– 1 bodyweight day- 1 by oral gavage for 14 days, or given a long-term treatment of riddelliine 1 mg kg- 1 bodyweight day– 1 in pelleted feed for 12 months. Exposure to riddelliine increased the odds of tumor development in a dose-responsive manner (odds ratio 2. 05 and Wald 95 % confidence limits between 1. 2 and 3. 4). The most common neoplasm was hepatic hemangiosarcoma, which is consistent with previously published lifetime rodent studies. The results of this research demonstrate that the California White chick model is sensitive for comparison of DHPA toxicity, and data obtained from this research can be used to validate previous DHPA toxicity research. It also demonstrates that comfrey toxicity may have been previously underestimated. The heterozygous p 53 knockout mouse model is beneficial for further investigation of comparative carcinogenesis of structurally and toxicologically different DHPAs and their N-oxides...|$|E
40|$|Concern {{regarding}} the hazardous health effects {{from exposure to}} chemicals in bitumen fumes has been expressed {{and there is a}} great deal of interest for data on profile of individual compounds in the gas and particulate phases. The purpose of the study was to evaluate a method for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOC), semi-volatile and particulate polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAH) and sulfur poly-heterocylic (PASH) compounds in bitumen fumes. The methylated derivatives of PAH are of particular interest since many of them exhibit carcinogenic activities while the parent compound does not. Bitumen fumes were laboratory generated at 170 °C using a fume generator with controlled characteristics. Sampling of bitumen fumes was carried out with XAD- 2 Orbo tubes for the gas phase chemicals and semi-volatile PAH or PASH. Glass Fiber GF/B were used to sample the fumes aerosol particulates at a flow rate of 1. 2 L/min. PAH profiles and PASH in bitumen fumes were determined by GC-MS further to a multi-step sample treatment and automatic clean-up procedure. The internal standard was added to 0. 1 to 0. 3 g of raw bitumen or bitumen fumes filter samples which were then extracted twice with 25 mL toluene by sonication for 10 min each. The <b>reduced</b> <b>extract</b> was partitioned between cyclohexane and dimethylformamide before elution on a SiO 2 micro column. The eluent was reduced and fractionated by HPLC. The PAH fraction of interest which also contained PASH was separated by capillary column GC-ion trap MS. Quantification was made relative to the respective calibration curves between compounds of interest and the internal standard. The semi-volatile SVPAH and SVPASH were determined by separate desorption of the two distinct parts of the XAD- 2 by 5 mL CS 2 and sonication for 30 min. Microliters of the combined filtered extract were then injected into a GC column and quantified by ion trap MS. Standard reference compounds were used for comparisons of respective spectra. The purified extract enables the determination of PAH profile from 2 to 7 rings including their methyl derivatives and 3 carcinogenic benzonaphthothiophene isomers. The reproducibility of the method was estimated by analyzing 6 bitumen replicates and is around the 30 % overall uncertainty or less. In bitumen fumes generated at 170 °C under standardized conditions, VOC and semi-volatile PAH were sampled with XAD- 2 tubes and were also determined in six replicates. The VOCs are mainly monoaromatic derivatives (4 % of fumes) and aliphatics essentially from C 6 to C 17 (27 %). With regards to the particulate phase PAC, the coefficients of variation from 6 replicates are 5 - 24 % for PAH and 6 - 10 % for PASH.

Microliters of the combined filtered extract were then injected into a GC column and quantified by ion trap MS. Standard reference compounds were used for comparisons of respective spectra. Summary of results VOC: Aliphatic alkanes from C 6 to C 17 amount to several hundreds mg per equivalent gram of particulate fumes collected on the filter. Most of the other volatile present are benzene derivatives and total VOC amounts to 42 mg/g of fumes. Surprisingly, no benzene was detected in all the samples. PAH: Methylnaphthalene substitutes are quantitatively predominant. The well known trend is observed with light semi-volatile PAH found mainly in the gas phase. The trend is being reversed in the particulate phase from the methylphenanthrene and the four ring PAH to heavier molecular weight PAH. The naphthalene and its derivatives account for 93 % of the total (both gas and particulate) PAH from 2 to 7 ring PAH. Methylchrysene derivatives are at higher levels than benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the fumes. The 6 - 7 rings PAH are not detected. PASH: The carcinogenic benzo[b]naphtho[2, 1 -d]thiophene is found in the fumes in higher amount than its two other isomers but less than the predominant dibenzothiophene. The sum dibenzonaphthothiophenes represents 16 % of PASH analysed in the filter, gas phase not included. In conclusion, our analytical procedure is valid and robust enough for the determination of PASH and PAH in bitumen fumes with a relatively low uncertainty (< 35 % for light PAH and < 15 % for higher MW PAH. New data are now available with the numerous methylnaphthalene derivatives and methylchrysene derivatives. VOC data and profile may be of interest for the interpretation of irritation effect The data may be useful for emission modelling purposes...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To quantitatively detect {{proteins}} and cholesterol extracted from worn silicone hydrogel contact lenses {{and determine the}} effect of various lens care solutions on deposit accumulation. METHODS: Contact lenses, made from different polymers and worn on a daily wear schedule with different lens care solutions, were collected. Lipid and protein deposits were extracted by methanol:chloroform (1 : 1, v/v) and protein extraction solution (containing urea and surfactant), respectively. Lipid extracts were separated and cholesterol quantified using thin layer chromatography. Protein extracts were quantified using standard techniques. RESULTS: Among all lenses tested, Balafilcon A lenses exhibited greatest extracted cholesterol (4. 1 to 8. 2 μg/lens) and total protein (5. 4 to 23. 2 μg/lens). AQuify was the most effective solution in <b>reducing</b> <b>extracted</b> deposits, especially extracted protein, from Balafilcon A lenses. AQuify and Opti-Free RepleniSH solutions were most effective in <b>reducing</b> <b>extracted</b> cholesterol from Senofilcon A and Galyfilcon A lenses, respectively. Use of Opti-Free Express solution resulted in more extracted protein from Lotrafilcon B lenses than use of other solutions. Generally, Lotrafilcon B, Senofilcon A, and Galyfilcon A lenses accumulated relatively low amount of proteins. Lotrafilcon B lenses accumulated the least amount of cholesterol deposit among all lenses tested regardless of solution used. CONCLUSIONS: Lens polymer (possibly associated with surface characteristics) is a prominent factor affecting lipid and protein accumulation. Within a lens polymer type, lens care solutions exhibit varying effectiveness in reducing protein and lipid accumulation. 9 page(s...|$|R

Data were obtained from short-term Lead-I ECG records (only one lead) of forty students at Paris Est University (UPEC). Signal averaging was applied to generate ECG databases and templates for reducing the noise recorded with palm ECG signals. Time domain signal processing is performed, which comprises the usual steps of filtering, peak detection, heartbeat waveform segmentation, and amplitude normalization. In this paper, an ECG biometric recognition method, that needs detection of one fiducial point only is introduced, based on classification of coefficients from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the Autocorrelation (AC) sequence of ECG data segments. The FFT is used to <b>reduce</b> <b>extracted</b> features from ECG signals.

GC-PFPD and GC-O analyses of global (XAD) and thiol specific (pHMB) extracts allowed us to identify 2 -sulphanyl- 3 -methylbutanol (2 S 3 MBol) as the key-off-flavour (AEDA Flavour Dilution = 32 – 1024 for 2 S 3 MBol while only 8 – 64 for MBT). 2 S 3 MBol revealed to be synthesized from 3 -methyl- 2 -buten- 1 -ol (MBOH) found in hop extracts. The involved radicalar mechanism is strongly enhanced by light. Although <b>reduced</b> hop <b>extracts</b> improve light stability regarding MBT, aroma-extracts give rise to strong onion-like off-flavours in presence of light. The concentration of the hop allylic precursor should be monitored in commercial hop extracts...|$|R

40|$|Extracts {{from various}} {{vegetables}} and fruits were investigated for their abilities to reduce nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs). The extracts from grape and onion exhibited an interesting selectivity, yielding corresponding hydroxylamines or amines as major products under mild conditions of 30 °C and pH 7. 0. Grape <b>extracts</b> <b>reduced</b> the 4 -nitro- 1, 8 -naphthalic anhydride with the highest conversion rate (> 99 %) and the highest ratio of hydroxylamine to amine (95 : 5). In contrast, the onion <b>extracts</b> <b>reduced</b> 4 -nitro- 1, 8 -naphthalic anhydride with a conversion rate of 94 % and a ratio of hydroxylamine to amine of 8 : 92. The thiol-reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol, and metal cations, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, greatly increased the reductive efficiency. This work provides an alternative strategy for biotransformation of nitro-polycyclic compounds...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} research evaluating {{effectiveness of}} rejuvenators for production {{of very high}} (40 - 100 %) Reclaimed Asphalt pavement (RAP) content mixtures. Nine differently originated softening agents were tested, including plant oils, waste derived oils, engineered products, as well as traditional and non-traditional refinery base oils. Two different dosages of the agents were added to binder extracted from RAP to evaluate their softening potential through testing of kinematic viscosity and penetration at two different temperatures. At 25 °C the softening efficiency varied {{by a factor of}} twelve between the most and least effective rejuvenators. Consistency results at different temperatures were used to express temperature susceptibility by means of Penetration Index (PI), Penetration-Viscosity Number (PVN) and Bitumen Test Data Chart (BTDC) of the softened binders. The PI results varied measurably depending on the rejuvenator and supported the low temperature mixture test results, showing that PI may be a good and simple measure of rejuvenation effectiveness. Low temperature mixture embrittlement was evaluated at - 10 °C through determination of the indirect tensile strength and creep compliance for rejuvenated 100 % RAP mixture samples. It can be concluded that four of the nine tested rejuvenators <b>reduced</b> <b>extracted</b> binder consistency to the necessary level and reduced susceptibility of RAP mixtures to low temperature embrittlement. Of the four, two engineered products tested had notably different performance but neither was superior to similar generic oils...|$|R
40|$|The Prp 19 -associated complex, {{consisting}} {{of at least}} eight protein components, is involved in spliceosome activation by specifying the interaction of U 5 and U 6 with pre-mRNA for their stable association with the spliceosome after U 4 dissociation. We show here that yeast cells depleted {{of one or two}} of the Prp 19 -associated components, accumulate the free form of U 4. In NTC 25 -deleted cells, the level of U 6 was also <b>reduced.</b> <b>Extracts</b> prepared from NTC 25 -deleted cells contained neither free U 4 nor U 6 and were ineffective in spliceosome recycling in the in vitro splicing reaction. Overexpression of U 6 partially rescued the temperature-sensitive growth defect and decreased the relative amount of free U 4 in NTC 25 -deleted cells, indicating that the accumulation of free U 4 was a consequence of insufficient amounts of U 6 snRNA. Extracts prepared from U 6 -overproducing NTC 25 -deleted cells containing free-form U 6 were capable of spliceosome recycling, suggesting a role of free U 6 RNP in spliceosome recycling. Our results demonstrate that in addition to direct participation in spliceosome activation, the Prp 19 -associated complex has an indirect role in spliceosome recycling through affecting the biogenesis of U 4 /U 6 snRNP in the in vivo splicing reaction...|$|R
