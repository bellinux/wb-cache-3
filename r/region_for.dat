30|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the degree to}} which failures to detect changes were associated with gaze falling in both the pre- and post-change regions, we tabulated the percentage of missed and detected changes for which gaze durations in both the pre- and post-change regions afforded opportunity to detect the changes. For 60 % of missed changes, gaze fell within both <b>regions</b> <b>for</b> at least five frames (167 [*]ms). This is similar to Fudali-Czyż et al.’s (2014) 150 -ms criterion for “attentive blank stares”. For 40 % of missed changes, the gaze minimum was at least 10 frames and for 12 % it was at least 30. This compares with 56 % of detected changes for which gaze was in both <b>regions</b> <b>for</b> at least five frames, 34 % of detected changes for which gaze was in both ROIs for more than 333 [*]ms, and 2.7 % of detected changes for which gaze was in both ROIs for at least 1 [*]s. Similarly, for minimum longest within-ROI run-lengths, for 44 % of missed changes gaze was in both <b>regions</b> <b>for</b> at least five continuous frames. For 23 % of missed changes gaze was in both <b>regions</b> continuously <b>for</b> 10 frames, and for 3 % it was continuously in both <b>regions</b> <b>for</b> 30 frames. In comparison, for 51 % of detected changes, gaze was in both <b>regions</b> <b>for</b> at least five frames. For 31 % of detected changes gaze was in both <b>regions</b> continuously <b>for</b> 10 frames, and for 3 % it was continuously in both <b>regions</b> <b>for</b> 30 frames.|$|R
