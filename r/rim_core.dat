In Paramecium, this cytoskeleton {{takes the form of}} a thin dense layer, the epiplasm, segmented into regular territories, the units where basal bodies are inserted. Epiplasmins, the main component of the epiplasm, constitute a large family of 51 proteins distributed in 5 phylogenetic groups, each characterized by a specific molecular design. By GFP-tagging, we analyzed their differential localisation and role in epiplasm building and demonstrated that: 1) The epiplasmins display a low turnover, in agreement with the maintenance of an epiplasm layer throughout the cell cycle; 2) Regionalisation of proteins from different groups allows us to define <b>rim,</b> <b>core,</b> ring and basal body epiplasmins in the interphase cell; 3) Their dynamics allows definition of early and late epiplasmins, detected early versus late in the duplication process of the units. Epiplasmins from each group exhibit a specific combination of properties. Core and rim epiplasmins are required to build a unit; ring and basal body epiplasmins seem more dispensable, suggesting that they are not required for basal body docking. We propose a model of epiplasm unit assembly highlighting its implication in structural heredity in agreement with the evolutionary history of epiplasmins...|$|E
40|$|Abridged: We {{present a}} {{detailed}} multi-wavelength {{study of the}} bright-rimmed cloud SFO 75, including 1. 3 cm and 1. 2 mm continuum, and 13 CO and ammonia spectral line observations. The 13 CO and 1. 2 mm emission reveals {{the presence of a}} dense core located behind the bright rim of the cloud which is approximately coincident with that of the IRAS point source. From an analysis of the IRAS and 1. 2 mm fluxes we derive a dust temperature of 30 K, a luminosity of 1. 6 x 10 ^ 4 L and estimate the core mass to be 570 M. The higher resolution ammonia observations resolve the 1. 2 mm core into two distinct cores, one directly behind the cloud's <b>rim</b> (<b>Core</b> A) and the second located slightly farther back (Core B). Comparing the morphology of Core A with that of the photon-dominated region and ionised boundary layer leaves little doubt that it is being strongly affected by the ionisation front. 2 MASS and GLIMPSE archive data which reveal a small cluster of three deeply embedded high- and intermediate-mass young stellar objects towards Core A leads us to conclude that the star formation found towards this core has been triggered. In stark contrast, Core B appears to have a much simpler, almost spherical, morphology. No stars are found towards Core B. The scenario that emerges from our analysis is one where the two ammonia cores pre-date the arrival of the ionisation front.

40|$|Context. Bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) are {{isolated}} molecular clouds {{located on the}} edges of evolved HII regions. Star formation within the BRCs may have been triggered through the propagation of photoionisation-induced shocks driven by the expansion of the HII region. Aims. The main focus {{of this paper is to}} investigate the current level of star formation within one of these clouds and evaluate to what extent, if any, star formation may have been triggered. Methods. We present a detailed multi-wavelength study of the BRC SFO 75, including 1. 3 cm and 1. 2 mm continuum, and 13 CO and ammonia spectral line observations. To build up a comprehensive picture of the local environment we complement our observations with archival data from the 2 MASS, GLIMPSE and IRAS surveys. Results. The 13 CO and 1. 2 mm emission reveals the presence of a dense core located behind the bright rim of the cloud which is approximately coincident with that of the IRAS point source. From an analysis of the IRAS and 1. 2 mm fluxes we derive a dust temperature of 30 K, a luminosity of L bol = 1. 6 x 10 4 L ⊙ and estimate the core mass to be similar to 570 M ⊙. The higher resolution ammonia observations resolve the 1. 2 mm core into two distinct cores, one directly behind the cloud's <b>rim</b> (<b>Core</b> A) and the second located slightly farther back (Core B). These have masses of 8 - 15 M ⊙ and 3. 5 - 7 M ⊙ for Core A and Core B respectively, which are significantly larger than their virial masses. Comparing the morphology of Core A with that of the photon-dominated region and ionised boundary layer leaves little doubt that it is being strongly affected by the ionisation front. 2 MASS and GLIMPSE archive data which reveal a small cluster of three deeply embedded (A v 20 mag) high- and intermediate-mass young stellar objects towards Core A leads us to conclude that the star formation found towards this core has been triggered.

The scenario that emerges from our analysis is one where the two ammonia cores pre-date the arrival of the ionisation front.

Grt rims equilibrated within the Ky stability field at 550 - 600 oC, 0. 7 - 0. 8 GPa. Equilibrium assemblage diagrams created with Theriak-Domino (TD) using whole-rock geochemistry suggest similar T-P conditions. TD models of Grt isopleth thermobarometry yield a counterclockwise P-T path. The initial (core-moat) stage generates decreasing pressure (0. 1 GPa) with a slight increase (10 oC) in temperature. Moat to rim preserves a nearly isothermal spike in pressure followed by a distinct, near-isobaric temperature decrease.

The gold was concentrated preferentially at the arsenopyrite-Ittlingite grain boundaries during replacement of ldllingite by arsenopyrite, under slightly retrograde metamorphic conditions, apparently due to the inability of the arsenopyrite structure to accommodate the gold at these still relatively high temperatures. This sfudy demonstrates that gold was initially coprecipitated with ldllingite under high P-T conditions and that the particulat...|$|R
40|$|Voluminous {{andesite}} and dacite lavas of Daisen volcano, SW Japan, contain features {{suggesting the}} reverse of normal frac-tionation (anti-fractionation), {{in the sense that}} magma genesis progressed from dacite to andesite, accompanied by rises in tempe-rature. A positive correlation exists between phenocryst content (0 [...] - 40 vol. %) and wt % SiO 2 (61 [...] - 67 %). Phenocryst-rich dacites contain hornblende and plagioclase that are generally unaltered, clear, and euhedral. However, phenocryst-poor rocks contain sieve-textured plagioclase, resorbed plagioclase, and opacite in which hornblendes are pseudomorphed. Some Daisen rocks contain two coexisting pyroxenes. Many orthopyroxene phenocrysts from two-pyroxene lavas have high-Ca overgrowth rims (up to 50 mm), a feature consistent with crystallization from a higher-temperature magma than the <b>core.</b> <b>Rim</b> composi-tions are similar from phenocryst to phenocryst in individua...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the behavior of}} Li in zircon, we have analyzed the abundance and isotopic composition of Li in three zircon standards (Plešovice, Qinghu and Temora) widely used for microbeam analysis of U-Pb ages and O-Hf isotopes. We have mapped Li concentration ([Li]) on large grains, using a Cameca 1280 HR Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (SIMS). All zircons have a rim 5 – 20 [*]μm wide in which [Li] is 5 to 20 times {{higher than in the}} core. Up to ~ 20 ‰ isotopic fractionation is observed on a small scale in the rims of a single zircon grain. The measured δ⁷Li values range from – 14. 3 to 3. 7 ‰ for Plešovice, – 22. 8 to 1. 4 ‰ for Qinghu and – 4. 7 to 16. 1 ‰ for Temora zircon. The [Li] and δ⁷Li are highly variable at the rims, but relatively homogenous in the cores of the grains. From zircon <b>rim</b> to <b>core,</b> [Li] decreases rapidly, while δ⁷Li increases, suggesting that the large isotopic variation of Li in zircons could be caused by diffusion. Our data demonstrate that homogeneous δ⁷Li in the cores of zircon can retain the original isotopic signatures of the magmas, while the bulk analysis of Li isotopes in mineral separates and in bulk-rock samples may produce misleading data. 11 page(s...|$|R
30|$|The South China Sea <b>Rim</b> is a <b>core</b> {{area of the}} Maritime Silk Road, {{ranging from}} South and Southwest China to Southeast Asia. It has {{developed}} a cultural landscape in which all parties are interdependent through very complex processes of ethnic communication and social interaction. In this temporal-spatial process, the cultural exchanges occurring {{in this area are}} not only shaping the cultural ecologies of those involved but also integrating their societies. The networked inter/inter-regional social systems lay a methodological foundation on which the South China Sea Rim is dealt with as a whole. These social systems can be defined as a social unit, transcending the lower levels of family, community, ethnic group, nation and transnational region and making up a significant component of the global society. This concept presents a new research pathway to the interpretation of “community of a shared future for mankind” and the “Belt and Road Initiative”.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of hyalophane [(K,Ba) AII_ 2 Si 3 _ 2 Os] on the North range {{segment of the}} Early Proterozoic Cuyuna Iron Range of east-central Minnesota has shed {{new light on the}} depositional environment of these rocks. This Ba-feldspar occurs in a 10 m thick interval within the main iron-formation and typically contains between 8 and 26 mol. % celsian (BaA 12 Si 208). Its occurrence in several textural settings uggests that barium was being deposited at various tages in the paragenetic history of the iron-formation. Some of the hyalophane grains occur as the cores of micronodules, which are structurally similar to oolites or oncolites, but mineralogically are very complex. The hyalophane also occurs as <b>rims</b> on <b>core</b> grains of diverse mineral composition and as discrete phases in late crosscutting veins. Hyalophane, like other Ba-silicates, has a very restricted paragenesis. They are associated typically either with sedimentary manganese and ferromanganese d posits, or with Cu-Pb-Zn-Ba deposits. The presence of hyalophane in the Early Proterozoic manganiferous iron ores of east-central Minnesota casts doubt on the historic interpretation of these deposits as typical Superior-type sedimentary iron-formations and instead supports the view that these deposits, at least in part, consist of chemical sediments from a hydrothermal fumarolic system. The suggested involvement of a hydrothermal system is also supported by the occurrence of aegirine within the hyalophane-rich layer, and the occurrence of tourmalinites and Sr-rich baryte veins elsewhere in the Cuyuna North range...|$|R
40|$|The Ollo de Sapo Formation {{comprises}} variably metamorphosed felsic peraluminous volcanic {{rocks and}} highlevel granites that crop out over some 600 km from the Cantabrian coast to central Spain {{in the northern}} part of the Central Iberian Zone. The Ollo de Sapo magmatism is not obviously connected with any major tectonic or metamorphic event so its origin is controversial. Some authors, based on trace-elements, have proposed that the Ollo de Sapo magmas originated in a supra-subduction setting but others, based on abnormally high zircon inheritance and field and structural data, favored a rifting environment. Here we present new oxygen and hafnium isotope data from the very characteristic Ollo the Sapo zircons, which in most cases, consist of ca. 485 Ma rims and ca. 590 - 615 Ma cores. We found that the Cambrian-Ordovician rims yielded unimodal distributions that cluster around ∂ 18 O = 10, typical of S-type magmas formed from melting of altered crust. The Ediacaran cores, in contrast, cluster around ∂ 18 O = 6. 5, consistent with being arc-magmas. <b>Rims</b> and <b>cores</b> have the same average Hf isotope composition, but the rims are considerably more uniform. These data, coupled with existing wholerock element and Sr and Nd isotopic data, indicate that the Ollo de Sapo were S-type magmas that resulted from anatexis of younger-than- 600 Ma immature sediments mostly derived from different Ediacaran igneous rocks with a wide range of Hf isotope composition...|$|R
40|$|Ankerite (Ank) grains {{frequently}} contain cores {{of almost}} pure dolomite (Dol) in the garnet zone and at lower grades of three areally extensive stratigraphic units from both Buchan and Barrovian terrains in northern New England, USA. Dol <b>cores</b> and Ank <b>rims</b> have Fe/(Fe+Mg) {{in the range}} 0. 006 - 0. 011 and 0. 16 - 0. 23, respectively. Ank grains with dolomite cores have many features closely analogous to K-feldspar <b>rims</b> around albite <b>cores</b> produced experimentally by incomplete hydrothermal reaction between albite and KCl solution [1]: (a) Ank-Dol contacts are irregular but sharp at the micron scale, (b) The orientations of the Ank and Dol crystal lattices are identical, (c) Fe/(Fe+Mg) of Ank is often slightly greater at the Ank-Dol contact than further away, (d) The Ank-Dol contact is often decorated with open pores. Based on these similarities, Ank appears to have replaced detrital Dol by a dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism during diagnesis or very low grade regional metamorphism...|$|R
40|$|Liquid-phase {{sintered}} {{silicon carbide}} (LPS-SiC) is silicon carbide ceramic which contains sintering additives forming a liquid phase during sintering. These additives segregate in the grain boundary phase during cooling. The usually used Al 2 O 3 dissolves partially in the SiC-grains and therefore changing the conductivity of the SiC (<b>core</b> <b>rim</b> structure). This study {{is focused on}} the electrochemical properties of LPS-SiC with yttria and alumina as sintering additives. Electrochemical corrosion behaviour of LPS-SiC has been determined by linear and cyclic voltammetry in acidic and alkaline solution. The effect of anodic oxidation on the material has been monitored by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) as well as by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The core-rim structure of the investigated materials plays a decisive role in the vulnerability towards corrosion. If oxidative attack was found to occur under anodic polarization, it happened preferentially in the rim region of the SiC-grains, while the core of the SiC-grains remained basically unaffected...|$|R
