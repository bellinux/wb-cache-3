40|$|A new {{learning}} {{in the workplace and}} community policy (LiWC) at Victoria University has been introduced to ensure that graduates are job and career ready. The policy mandates that all programs incorporate at least a 25 % workplace contextual learning component by 2010. For the IT undergraduate program, compliance with this policy poses a number of significant challenges, not least of which is the meeting of professional accreditation criteria. Acquiring a <b>recognized</b> <b>professional</b> <b>body</b> accreditation, like that of the Australian Computer Society (ACS), is pivotal for all IT Australian programs, in that, it is a vital quality assurance measure and it enhances program marketability. For an ACS accreditation, the course structure and content of the IT program is examined against the Society‘s defined core body of knowledge (CBOK) which covers both generic and ICT specific skill sets. This paper describes the current Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree structure with respect to the ACS‘s CBOK. Within this framework, a possible strategy is proposed for realizing the University‘s LiWC policy whilst conforming to accreditation requirements. Finally {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the proposed approach are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The name Mary Addison Hamilton (Addie) {{does not}} appear in any of the {{recorded}} histories of the accounting profession in Australia even though there is ample evidence to suggest that she is deserving of such a place. Addie {{was one of the first}} women to achieve membership of one of Australia’s <b>recognized</b> <b>professional</b> accounting <b>bodies</b> and, thereby, one of the first in the British Empire.

In addition, Addie achieved a permanent position in the public sector at a time when Australian women were traditionally denied such positions.

Intelligent urbanism promotes the professionalisation of the city making process.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of members are needed for <b>professional</b> <b>bodies</b> in the built environment and surveying {{in order to survive}} and thrive in the 21 st century. Wilkinson and Zillante (2007) identified issues of under recruitment and an ageing membership in the Building Surveying profession in Australia; however other built environment <b>professional</b> <b>bodies</b> globally are experiencing similar issues.
