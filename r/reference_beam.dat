5|$|A common path {{interferometer}} is a {{class of}} interferometer in which the <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> and sample beam travel along the same path. Fig.4 illustrates the Sagnac interferometer, the fibre optic gyroscope, the point diffraction interferometer, and the lateral shearing interferometer. Other examples of common path interferometer include the Zernike phase contrast microscope, Fresnel's biprism, the zero-area Sagnac, and the scatterplate interferometer.|$|E
5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> to generate a hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E
25|$|Holographic PIV (HPIV) {{encompasses}} {{a variety of}} experimental techniques which use the interference of coherent light scattered by a particle and a <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> to encode information of the amplitude and phase of the scattered light incident on a sensor plane. This encoded information, known as a hologram, can then be used to reconstruct the original intensity field by illuminating the hologram with the original <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> via optical methods or digital approximations. The intensity field is interrogated using 3-D cross-correlation techniques to yield a velocity field.|$|E
40|$|DE 10317828 B UPAB: 20041001 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} illuminating a modulator (9) with incoherent {{or short}} coherence light with differently coded components, forming separate beams from the components and coupling into a first interferometer unit (18) to form measurement (21, 22) and <b>reference</b> <b>beams.</b> The measurement beams are separately scanned over the object (1).

40|$|By {{using two}} orthogonally {{polarized}} <b>reference</b> <b>beams,</b> holograms can be recorded through stressed {{windows and the}} reconstructed virtual image will show no stress pattern. As shown analytically, the stress-pattern-free hologram is recordable for any polarization state of the object illumination. Hence, the more efficient nondepolarizing diffuser {{can be used in}} performing holography through stressed windows if two <b>reference</b> <b>beams</b> are used.

25|$|Crystal interferometry, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} X-ray interferometry, {{is the oldest}} but also the most complex method used for experimental realization. It consists of three beam splitters in Laue geometry aligned parallel to each other. (See figure to the right) The incident beam, which usually is collimated and filtered by a monochromator (Bragg crystal) before, is split at the first crystal (S) by Laue diffraction into two coherent beams, a <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> which remains undisturbed and a beam passing through the sample. The second crystal (T) acts as a transmission mirror and causes the beams to converge one towards another. The two beams meet at {{the plane of the}} third crystal (A), which is sometimes called, the analyzer crystal, and create an interference pattern the form of which depends on the optical path difference between the two beams caused by the sample. This interference pattern is detected with an X-ray detector behind the analyzer crystal.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} issues degrade the quality of HPIV results. The first class of issues {{involves}} the reconstruction itself. In holography, the object wave of a particle is typically assumed to be spherical; however, due to Mie scattering theory, this wave is a complex shape which can distort the reconstructed particle. Another issue {{is the presence of}} substantial speckle noise which lowers the overall signal-to-noise ratio of particle images. This effect is of greater concern for in-line holographic systems because the <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> is propagated through the volume along with the scattered object beam. Noise can also be introduced through impurities in the scattering medium, such as temperature variations and window blemishes. Because holography requires coherent imaging, these effects are much more severe than traditional imaging conditions. The combination of these factors increases the complexity of the correlation process. In particular, the speckle noise in an HPIV recording often prevents traditional image-based correlation methods from being used. Instead, single particle identification and correlation are implemented, which set limits on particle number density. A more comprehensive outline of these error sources is given in Meng et al.|$|E
500|$|A {{double path}} {{interferometer}} {{is one in}} which the <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> and sample beam travel along divergent paths. [...] Examples include the Michelson interferometer, the Twyman-Green interferometer, and the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. After being perturbed by interaction with the sample under test, the sample beam is recombined with the <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> to create an interference pattern which can then be interpreted.|$|E

50|$|A photorefractive {{material}} is illuminated by coherent beams of light. (In holography, {{these would be}} the signal and <b>reference</b> <b>beams).</b> Interference between the beams results in a pattern of dark and light fringes throughout the crystal.|$|R
30|$|However, in some cases, these {{traditional}} arrangements cannot be applied. Either the size and/or {{the position of}} the target object does not permit the proper interference of the target and <b>reference</b> <b>beams,</b> or the light emission of the targets themselves is the relevant feature that is to be detected and reconstructed. In these cases, Self-referenced Holographic Setups (SHS) can be applied. In these setups, the target and <b>reference</b> <b>beams</b> are the differently modulated lights of the same emitted (or reflected) light of the measured object. The requirement of proper interference is that the optical path difference of the two beams has to be smaller than the coherence length of the light.|$|R
500|$|A {{method of}} {{establishing}} precise geodetic baselines, invented by Yrjö Väisälä, exploited the low coherence length of white light. Initially, white light was split in two, with the <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> [...] "folded", bouncing back-and-forth six times between a mirror pair spaced precisely 1 m apart. Only if the test path was precisely 6 times the reference path would fringes be seen. Repeated applications {{of this procedure}} allowed precise measurement of distances up to 864 meters. Baselines thus established were used to calibrate geodetic distance measurement equipment, leading to a metrologically traceable scale for geodetic networks measured by these instruments. (This method has been superseded by GPS.) ...|$|E
500|$|The Mach–Zehnder {{interferometer}} is a {{more versatile}} instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted {{so that they are}} localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited coherence length, on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. [...] As illustrated in Fig.6, a compensating cell would be placed {{in the path of the}} <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.|$|E
2500|$|To {{retrieve}} the phase shift {{out of the}} interference patterns; a technique called phase-stepping or fringe scanning is used: a phase shifter (with {{the shape of a}} wedge) is introduced in the <b>reference</b> <b>beam.</b> The phase shifter creates straight interference fringes with regular intervals; so called carrier fringes. When the sample is placed in the other beam, the carrier fringes are displaced. The phase shift caused by the sample corresponds to the displacement of the carrier fringes. Several interference patterns are recorded for different shifts of the <b>reference</b> <b>beam</b> and by analyzing them the phase information modulo 2 can be extracted. This ambiguity of the phase is called the phase wrapping effect and can be removed by so-called [...] "phase unwrapping techniques". These techniques can be used when the signal-to-noise ratio of the image is sufficiently high and phase variation is not too abrupt.|$|E
