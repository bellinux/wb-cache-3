40|$|A {{survey of}} {{community}} attitudes to income contingent loans {{was conducted in}} May 2008. The predominant focus of the survey was to ascertain the level of support, or otherwise, for the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) and for the (hypothetical) application of income contingent loans (ICL) to various other policy areas, including drought relief, child care, research and development, and elite athletes. Public debate over the potential application of income contingent loans {{to a number of}} these areas has increased in recent times. The survey results indicate strong community support for HECS, an ICL for Research and Development, and repayment of government assistance to elite athletes. By contrast, there is little support for introducing such a scheme for child care, and especially so from those who have received government assistance for child care. Opinion on <b>repayable</b> <b>assistance</b> for farm businesses for drought relief is evenly balanced for and against. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of a severe {{economic}} crisis and austerity, new ideas were put forward to reform cohesion policy to enhance its effectiveness and the return on investment. Among them, financial engineering instruments, such as JESSICA, expected to offer a means to ‘do more with less’ in this difficult budgetary context. In the case of such instruments, EU funds are not offered as grants co-financing investment projects, but rather are used to provide <b>repayable</b> <b>assistance</b> to projects, a form of support. Such revolving funds approach is in stark contrast with the grant-based assistance typically offered as part of EU cohesion policy and was expected to increase the sustainability and effectiveness of interventions. But does it fulfil those expectations? This paper examines JESSICA through the conceptual lens of policy instruments literature. It verifies whether JESSICA is actually fit for its purpose of supporting sustainable urban development. It also gauges the impacts of instrument on the behaviour of the actors involved in its implementation at the sub-national level. The findings indicate that JESSICA is a flawed and overly complex instrument that instead of doing ‘more with less’ only allows for achieving ‘less with less’. However, it still exerts a positive influence on the sub-national authorities involved by promoting cross-sectoral interactions and facilitating learning. It also promotes a change in the approach to EU cohesion policy and public investment more generally, putting more emphasis on economic viability of investment.

40|$|The {{lack of a}} {{comprehensive}} approach to the accounting reflection of repayable financial aid {{makes it impossible to}} establish an information base for the evaluation of its attraction and use. Therefore, to ensure completeness of operations related to the involvement of financial assistance is only possible through the use of scientifically based methods of accounting and scientific researches in the field of accounting should be directed at ensuring stable financial condition of the enterprise, improving management decision-making to attract and use financial aid and prevent violations of the payment discipline. Based analysis approach to mapping returnable financial assistance has shown that the accounting staff has no single method for such transactions. In order to eliminate this disadvantage we offer to display <b>repayable</b> financial <b>assistance</b> {{as a part of the}} loan capital through the use of 609 "Swivel financial assistance" account to the opening of the analytical account of 609. 1 "Swivel financial assistance in the national currency", and 609. 2 "Swivel financial assistance in foreign currency" and the account of 505 "Long-term financial assistance in the national currency" and 506 "Long-term financial assistance in foreign currency". ...|$|R
