50|$|The most ancestral records {{claim the}} town was first {{populated}} by Gauls, but later occupied by the Romans. The area {{appears to have been}} depopulated {{after the fall of the}} Roman Empire. The flooded plain remained uncultivated until under the rule of the Exarchate of Ravenna, when lands again were drained. The Byzantines also built a defensive line in the territory against the Lombards, but c. 727, under King Liutprand, the Lombards overran the Castrum Persiceta. In the 728 Liutprand created the duchy of Persiceto. It is likely that the village formed as the traditional Borgo Rotondo (<b>Round</b> <b>Village)</b> under this new rule. With the fall of the Lombard Kingdom in 774 the early-medieval district of Persiceto (later San Giovanni in Persiceto), that stretched up to stream Samoggia, fell under the rule of the County of Modena, then the Abbey of Nonantola exercised its power on the territory, and since the 9th century it was handed over to the County of Bologna. Likely that around the half of that century the parish church of San Giovanni was built by the Bishops of Bologna.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The aims of {{the study}} are to analyze the {{features}} of a socially self-contained society; to analyze the features of an environmentally sustainable society; and to generate a discussion on an indigenous approach towards the sustainable design of communities, particularly through {{the study of the}} <b>round</b> <b>village</b> for its unique form and performance in terms of sustainable construction. Design/methodology/approach - Researchers from an international group undertook a field study of a number of specimen round and square shape Hakka villages in December 2004. They discussed their preliminary findings with local academics regarding significant attributes for sustainable design principles, and summarized lessons by means of spatial and construction studies that inform contemporary urban designers' knowledge and practice of sustainability through indigenous architecture. Findings - Through reinterpretation of Feng-shui theory, various observations made were easily and naturally correlated to basic laws of sustainability. The biggest message that comes from Fujian round architecture is that a genuine practitioner of environmental and social sustainability relies on a simplicity of approach - a respect for nature. Research limitations/implications - The study is confined primarily to observations by a team of architects and engineers. Practical implications - Field study of vernacular architecture provides useful information and first-hand data for researchers on rammed earth structures. Originality/value - The study of rammed earth structures in remote areas of China, in both coastal and earthquake active zones, offers fresh insight into the integrity and ingenuity of early settlers in sustainable construction. The research provides preliminary findings regarding environmental and construction practice in age-old Hakka round houses. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Four midden sites {{located in}} close {{proximity}} on the southern shore of the Great Salt Pond of Block Island, Rhode Island were excavated in 1986. These sites represent a temporal sequence extending from the early Middle Woodland (ca. 200 B. C. -A. D. 500) to the Contact Period (A. D. 1700). Excellent shell and bone preservation in these sites provide {{a unique opportunity to}} study patterns of subsistence change and to relate these to changes in settlement patterns and sociopolitical complexity of prehistoric-historic Amerindian cultures of southern New England. ^ The purpose of this analysis is (1) to determine the availability of faunal resources and the nature of habitats exploited; (2) to determine the significance of shellfish gathering, fishing, and maritime and terrestrial hunting in the total seasonal subsistence round; and (3) to ascertain the degree of culture change and continuity of Block Island Amerindians over the last 1700 years. ^ Faunal assemblages of the Mott 2 ̆ 7 s Midden (RI 1407), Trims Pond (RI 124), Island Cemetery (RI 120), and Fort Island (RI 118) sites were analyzed for seasonality of occupation, environmental catchment utilization, animal exploitation patterns, and site type, size and activities. ^ Results suggest a pattern of cultural continuity through the Woodland Period followed by a change in the use of faunal resources at early historic times. The Middle to Late Woodland sites are base camps occupied from winter to early spring, whose occupants concentrated on inshore, littoral animal species, especially sea mammals and migratory birds. The Contact Period Fort Island Site is the only year <b>round</b> <b>village</b> occupation and the only site yielding evidence of the use of maize. In addition, animal exploitation patterns shifted to a greater use of marine fishing and inland freshwater resources. ^ Culture changes on Block Island occurred late in prehistory and in response to the advent of horticulture as a resource base. Horticultural activities would favor a shift toward sedentary settlement on the island and the increased span of occupation would lead to different animal procurement patterns. During early historic times, the increased production of wampum as a means of exchange with European traders may have accentuated the processes leading to larger and more sedentary populations on Block Island. ...|$|E
