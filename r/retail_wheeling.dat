40|$|Abstract: Power system {{deregulation}} {{along with}} <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling</b> was proposed in legislation {{for the future}} power system operation. <b>Retail</b> <b>wheeling</b> implies customers have more choices. One important option is the power supplier providing cheaper power. In this paper we introduce new concepts of generation sets and load sets to model the behavior of power supply and load distribution in the new <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling</b> market. Formation of optimal power flow (OPF) problem, in which the public interests are maximized, is demonstrated [...] IEEE- 14 bus system is used as an example...|$|E
40|$|Retail {{competition}} in electricity markets {{is expected to}} lead to more efficient electricity supply, lower electricity prices, more innovation by suppliers and {{a greater variety of}} electric power service packages. However, only a handful of states have currently {{gone so far as to}} pass legislation and/or make regulatory decisions to establish <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling.</b> This paper analyzes a variety of factors that may influence the rate at which legislators and regulators move towards establishing retail competition. In general, we find that where one interest group dominates others in the struggle for influence over the decision makers, the net effect seems to push a state forward more quickly when <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling</b> is expected to yield large efficiency gains. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, Maine's {{electric}} utilities have begun to face the forces of competition. Maine is experiencing {{the effects of a}} national trend, a shift from a traditional and regulated system to a more innovative and competitive one. The following four articles offer differing perspectives on this complex and controversial issue. In the first of this series, Gordon Weil, active in Maine and elsewhere in promoting increased competition in the electric industry, explains the forces for competition. Mr. Weil traces the history of the electric power market from its beginnings as a monopoly, to its present status where all of the forces promoting competition nationally are at play in Maine. The latter three articles are taken from the authors ' presentations at a December 1994 conference entitled <b>Retail</b> <b>Wheeling,</b> sponsored by the Margaret Chase Smith Center for Public Policy's Project for the Study of Regulation and the Environment. William C. Perkins analyzes a number of potential costs and risks of full-scale <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling.</b> Armond Cohen explores the environmental impacts that are at stake in restructuring and offers some possible solutions. Finally, James F. Mitchell describes some of the political and financial limits to restructuring and provides suggestions for how to proceed in creating full and fair competition.

40|$|The {{hypermarket}} appeared {{first in}} France {{at the beginning}} of the sixties as a synthesis of the main features of modern retailing. But in France, the decline of this retail format seems to have begun and Spain could follow quickly. In the same time, the German hard-discounters continue their invasion. According to the retail life cycle theory, this paper displays curves to demonstrate the evolution of this retail concept in France, Spain and Italy and tries to evoke some managerial and strategic issues. The <b>retail</b> <b>wheel</b> seems to go on turning...|$|R
40|$|By {{analysing}} the US {{department store}} between c. 1910 - 1965, this article deepens {{our understanding of}} the nature of the transition to phases of ‘maturity’ and ‘decline’ that are fundamental to models of <b>retail</b> change (<b>retail</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>retail</b> life-cycle). By employing a close reading of key marketing and management writing of the period, it finds that “lockin” to an organisational structure associated with a single downtown store posed significant obstacles to suburban branched expansion. Only partial organisational centralisation occurred with the formation of holding companies in the 1920 s, which contrasted with chains of general-merchandise and some department store retailers that were efficiently structured and better able to exploit suburban growth. When major department store companies finally embraced branched expansion they were forced to significantly revise their operational structures...|$|R
40|$|Academic {{research}} in retail logistics frequently {{emphasizes the importance}} of the logistics customer service for large retailers wishing to develop a sustainable competitive advantage. This research paper questions the validity of this reasoning, implying an evolution toward an indispensable logistical excellence. It seems that the new retail formats favouring a strategy of cost leadership, require as a priority the lowest possible logistical costs, rather than high customer service. It is only when these new retail formats propose sophisticated marketing services that customer service becomes essential, even if this means sacrificing logistical costs. But another retail format will then appear in the retailing sector, again favouring a strategy of cost leadership (and of low logistical costs). Therefore, the evolution of retail logistics is iterative, with constant returns to the components of logistical performance thought to be critical by large retailers. The concept of a "wheel of retail logistics", in reference to McNair's (1957) <b>wheel</b> of <b>retailing</b> model, is suggested to explain this phenomenon, with an application to the French context. Cost leadership strategy, Customer service, France, <b>Retail</b> logistics, <b>Wheel</b> of <b>retailing</b> model...|$|R
40|$|In May 1995, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) {{released}} two {{proposals for}} restructuring the state`s electric power industry. The two proposals follow {{more than a}} year of testimony and public comment after the CPUC issued the ``Blue Book`` (CPUC 1994 a) on April 20, 1994, which called for <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling</b> to be phased in to all customers over 5 years. The majority proposal, supported by three of the four CPUC commissioners (one seat was vacant when the proposals were released), calls for creating a central pool, or ``poolco``; setting electric prices to reflect true costs of service, or ``real-time pricing``; and allowing parties to negotiate ``contracts for differences`` between the pool price and the contract price. The minority proposal, sponsored by Commissioner Jesse Knight, calls for <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling,</b> or ``direct access,`` and for utilities to divest or spin off their generating assets. This paper presents a summary of the major provisions of the two CPUC proposals and the possible implications and issues associated with each. It is aimed at researchers who may be aware that various efforts to restructure the electric power industry are under way and want to known more about California`s proposals, as well as those who want to known the implications of certain restructuring proposals for renewable energy technologies. Presented at the end of the paper is a summary of alternative proposals promoted by various stakeholder in response to the two CPUC proposals...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the German government's {{proposal}} to Iiberalize the domestic electricity supply industry. The government bill aims to establish a <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling</b> model in the electricity transmission and distribution System. The Opposition against this model mainly comes from the publicly owned local Utilities. They instead propose to establish local ?Single buyer models, which basically amounts to establish local monopolies acting as local monopolists vis-à-vis consumers and as local monopsonists vis-à-vis independent power producers. The paper critically analyzes these and other proposals of the local Utilities. Furthermore, some significant defects of the government bill are identified, and the likely environmental consequences of the liberalization are considered. ...|$|E
40|$|Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) {{is making}} fast inroads into the {{electric}} utility industry, primarily {{triggered by the}} possibilities of instituting <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling</b> in the present deregulated environment. Meters have to be read more often and faster and new businesses open to provide meter reading and billing services to the various electric distribution companies. To make it possible, a communication system is required that links every electric energy metering device to several metering data collecting computers in a two way fashion. The metering data have to be gathered at regular intervals, dated and time stamped. This will allow the billing service company {{to determine how much}} to bill the energy user and to apportio...|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} {{industry in}} the United States is undergoing fundamental changes; it is transitioning from regulated monopolies to competitive markets offering customer choice. In this process, the states {{have been in the}} forefront of considering the changes in the industry structure and regulation. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) spearheaded a project on electric restructuring in the United States. This is the final report prepared under the project. The purpose of the report is to describe and compare the overall restructuring processes that took place in five states through June 30, 1996. The five states are California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Wisconsin. These are the first major states to consider restructuring or <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{electricity}} industry {{throughout the}} world, {{which has long}} been dominated by vertically integrated utilities, has experienced major changes. Deregulation, unbundling, wholesale and <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling,</b> and real-time pricing were abstract concepts a few years ago. Today market forces drive the price of electricity and reduce the net cost through increased competition. As power markets continue to evolve, {{there is a growing}} need for advanced modeling approaches. Accordingly, this article looks at using software agents to help manage the complexity of electricity markets, particularly retail markets. The article focuses on bilateral trading and describes some important features of an agent-based system for bilateral contracting.

40|$|Faced with {{deregulation}} {{and increasingly}} aggressive competition, utilities {{are looking for}} new products and services to increase revenues, improve customer loyalty and retention, and establish barriers to market erosion. With open access now a reality, and <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling</b> just around the corner, business expansion via new products and services is now the central goal for most utilities in the United States. It may seem surprising that solar thermal energy as applied to heating domestic hot water - an idea that {{has been around for}} a long time - offers what utilities and their residential customers want most in a new product/service. This document not only explains how and why, it shows how to get into the business and succeed on a commercial scale...|$|E

This article addresses the challenge of maximizing the profit (or return) of power producers through the optimization of their share of customers. Power producers have fixed production marginal costs and decide the quantity of energy to sell in both day-ahead markets and a set of target clients, by negotiating bilateral contracts involving a three-rate tariff. Producers sell energy by considering the prices of a reference week and five different types of clients with specific load profiles. They analyze several tariffs and determine the best share of customers, i. e., the share that maximizes profit. © 2014 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|A shock jolted the {{electric}} power industry in April 1994, when the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) announced {{its intention to}} restructure the industry. The proposal, {{commonly referred to as}} <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling,</b> is based on the principle that market deregulation and competition will bring down the cost of electricity for all classes of customers. It would effectively break up the monopoly status of the regulated utilities and allow customers to purchase electricity directly from competing suppliers. According to the original CPUC proposal, cost alone would be the basis for determining which generating resources would be used. The proposal was modified in response to public inputs, and issued as a decision at the end of 1995. The final proposal recognized the importance of renewables, and included provisions for a minimum renewables purchase requirement (MRPR). A Renewables Working Group convened to develop detailed proposals for implementing the CPUC`s renewables program. Numerous proposals, which represented the range of possible programs {{that can be used to}} support renewables within the context of a restructured electric utility industry, were received...|$|E
40|$|New technologies, low {{natural gas}} prices, and {{federal and state}} utility {{regulations}} are restructuring the electricity industry. Yesterday's vertically integrated utility with a retail monopoly franchise may be a very different organization in a few years. Conferences, regulatory-commission hearings, and other industry fora are dominated by debates over the extent and form of utility deintegration, wholesale competition, and <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling.</b> A key obstacle to restructuring the electricity industry is stranded commitments. Past investments, power-purchase contracts, and public-policy-driven programs that made sense {{in an era of}} cost-of-service regulation may not be cost-effective in a competitive power market. Regulators, utilities, and other parties face tough decisions concerning the mitigation and allocation of these stranded commitments. We developed and applied a simple method to calculate the amount of stranded commitments facing U. S. investor-owned electric utilities. The results obtained with this method depend strongly on a few key assumptions: (1) the fraction of utility sales that is at risk with respect to competition, (2) the market price of electric generation, and (3) the number of years during which the utility would lose money because of differences between its embedded cost of production and the market price...|$|E
40|$|With {{the coming}} {{changes in the}} {{electrical}} industry, there is a broad {{need to understand the}} impacts of restructuring on customers, existing utilities, and other stakeholders. Retail wheeling; performance-based regulation; unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution; and the impact of stranded commitments are all key issues in the discussions of the future of the industry. To quantify these issues, financial and production cost models are required. The authors have created a smaller and faster finance and operations model call the Oak Ridge Financial Model (ORFIN) to help analyze the ramifications of the issues identified above. It combines detailed pricing and financial analysis with an economic dispatch model over a multi-year period. Several types of ratemaking are modeled, as well as the wholesale market and <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling.</b> Multiple plants and purchased power contracts are modeled for economic dispatch, and separate financial accounts are kept for each. Transmission, distribution, and other functions are also broken out. Regulatory assets such as deferred tax credits and demand-side management (DSM) programs are also included in the income statement and balance sheet. This report describes some of the key features of the model. Examples of the financial reports are shown, with a description of their formulation. Some of the ways these results can be used in analyzing various issues are provided...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{experimental}} and game-theoretic analyses of deregulated electricity markets suggest that communities having four or less effective suppliers, {{either because of}} transmission constraints or load characteristics, or retail customers facing suppliers or marketing agents having more than {{seventy percent of the}} region’s market, are likely to experience prices well above competitive levels. While state regulatory bodies may be able to forestall the onset of <b>retail</b> <b>wheeling</b> and non-regulated retail energy pricing until a single supplier does not dominate initial market shares, it is more difficult to mute the exercise of market power by generators serving electrically isolated load pockets. And in both instances, if the accrual of some excess profits by initial, non-regulated suppliers are not tolerated, then little incentive will have been provided for competitors to enter the market and for more efficient technologies to evolve. Estimates are provided in this analysis of the circumstances for and the extent and duration of the exercise of market power. When combined with the present absence of incentives to build transmission lines that would reduce bottlenecks and the existing utilities ’ insistence upon full recovery of stranded costs through line charges and access fees, the powerful incentives to develop distributed generation are highlighted...|$|E
