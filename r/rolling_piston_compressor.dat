The swing compressor, also known as a rotary piston pump, is a rotary compressor technology that is akin to the well know <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor.</b> The swing compressor differs from the <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> in that the vane, which divides the suction and compression chambers {{is an integral part of}} the piston.

40|$|The rotary {{compressor}} with rolling piston {{is a widely}} used compressor with less clearance volume, while it is minimized from normal scale to meso or micro scale, the input and exit ports dimension is limited by port requirement and lead to a certain clearance volume, therefore, keeping or improving its volume efficiency is an important issue. Although <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> {{is a kind of}} compact structure compressor, the existence of the clearance volume is inevitable in a compressor, the more the clearance volume, the lower the volumetric efficiency of compressor. The overflow is a method to improve the volumetric efficiency of a compressor which had been discussed in wankel compressor, in the overflowing process the clearance space with high pressure is connected directly with the space with lower pressure, mostly that is in the moment, one of the chambers in the {{rotary compressor}} {{is at the end of}} the exhaust process, and another chamber is at the sucking stage or the initial compression process. The gas pressure in the clearance volume is visibly higher than that in the compression chamber. The high-pressure gas in the clearance volume flows into the compression cylinder via a certain way; this flow considerably increases the pressure in the compression cylinder and decreases the pressure in the clearance volume. Thus, the intake and exhaust times means to be extended, and the volumetric efficiency and the cooling capacity of the compressor can be substantially enhanced. In this paper, we introduce the effect of input and exit dimensions on the volume efficiency of <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor,</b> and the overflow design on a <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> that fully uses the high-pressure gas in the clearance volume, and discuss its effect on the performance of a compressor by theoretical analyses.

40|$|Frequently, the {{dynamics}} of a compressor’s mechanism can be simplified and better understood by analyzing compressor’s equivalent linkage. Although the equivalent linkage of a reciprocating piston compressor is well known, the equivalent linkages {{of other types of}} compressors are not. For example, it is not well understood that the equivalent linkage of a <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> is also the same slider-crank mechanism as the one of a reciprocating piston compressor. The difference between reciprocating piston compressor and the <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> is that it is the connecting rod that compresses gas in the cylindrical chamber.

40|$|Rolling pistons {{are widely}} used as {{compressors}} in air conditioning systems due to their small size, low cost, and high performance. Reed valves, a special type of check valve driven by hydraulic forces, are commonly used with many types of compressors to restrict the flow to one direction. Reed valves are typically made of {{a thin layer of}} metal or plastic materials. The valve will bend in response to fluid pressure forces to open up the flow channel at the proper moment within the compression cycle. There are many things that could affect the performance and efficiency of a compressing system. Among them, the interaction between the compressor and the control valves {{is one of the most}} important factors. Due to the fully coupled dynamic nature of the problem, analysis of compressor/valve interaction is difficult. CFD simulation of combined compressor and valve systems can provide valuable insights regarding not only the performance of the compressor and valve themselves, but also the critical dynamic interaction between the compressor and the valve. In this paper, a full 3 D transient CFD model for a <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> with reed valve is described in detail. In the proposed model, a moving/deforming mesh algorithm is developed for the fluid pockets of the rolling piston. The bending reed valve is modeled as a rotational structure with moving/deforming mesh for the affected fluid volume. The motion of the valve is solved using a one dimensional rotational ordinary differential equation. Based on bending cantilever beam theory, important parameters of the rotational dynamics, such as torsion constant, are carefully derived to accurately model the behavior of the bending reed valve. The meshing and re-meshing algorithms for the fluid volume of rolling piston and the rotational valve are implemented in the CFD solver PumpLinx. The test simulation of a real compressor and valve system demonstrates that the algorithms and the implementations are robust, fast, and user friendly, and can be readily applied to industrial <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a compressor changes during its lifetime, depending on various parameters such as operating conditions, type of the compressor, working fluid and type of the oil being used. Most performance degradation of the compressor is due to wear on the moving mechanical parts inside the compression vessel. Wear develops on the contact point(s) or area(s) between the moving and fixed mechanical parts inside the compressor {{when there is a}} lack of lubrication. In a <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> rotary <b>compressor,</b> the most vulnerable regions are the vane and roller contact area, and the shaft and journal bearing area. As the amount of wear increases, leakage through the clearances inside the compression compartment increases as well. An increase in the amount of leakage degrades the volumetric efficiency and the overall {{performance of}} the compressor. The objectives of this study are to predict the life span of <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> rotary-type <b>compressors</b> through the measurement of wear on the roller under accelerated test conditions, and predict the effect of wear on the degradation of compressor performance.

40|$|With the aim {{of energy}} saving of room air conditioners, we are {{addressing}} higher efficiency of the rotary compressor that is used most in the world. We focused on a new rotary compressor equipped with a mechanism to restrict the rolling motion of the piston, and performed the dynamics analysis. The new rotary compressor has a small pillar {{at the tip of}} the vane and constitutes a turning pair of vane and piston, and it limits the rolling motion of the piston. By means of limiting the piston rotation, the heat transfer to the suction process from the compression chamber will be suppressed, and we can expect higher compression efficiency. Before examining the compression efficiency, we performed the dynamics analysis of this new rotary compressor and examined the forces and dynamic behavior of the components, and the mechanical efficiency of the compressor. Then we have following results. (1) We can clarify the contact point between the vane tip and piston in the turning pair by considering the equilibrium of forces and moments acting on the vane. (2) By reducing the diameter of the pillar at the vane tip, the vane tip friction loss is reduced, and the mechanical efficiency is improved.

The hermetically sealed <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> runs on a 24 V DC power supply.

40|$|Because of {{the many}} air-conditioning, refrigeration, and heating {{applications}} that utilize vapor compression equipment, the vapor compression cycle {{has been the focus}} of significant research. The combination of rising energy costs and increasing environmental awareness motivates the development of more efficient cycle components, including higher performance compressors, heat exchangers, and expansion devices for recovering work. However, modifications to the basic vapor compression cycle also show potential for significantly improving cooling cycle performance through increased cooling capacity and COP. ^ The current study investigates the performance improvements that can be achieved through the use of intercooling and economizing. A basic cycle model that uses a compressor with a fixed isentropic efficiency is developed in EES to study these configurations. The model first considers two-stage compression with intercooling between the stages, which does not improve the cooling capacity but provides an increase in COP as a result of decreased compressor work. ^ The basic cycle model considers two different approaches for economizing with two-stage compression. The first approach uses a flash tank to supply saturated vapor to the compressor between the stages. Drawing off the saturated vapor in the flash tank to mix with the first-stage compressor discharge gas not only cools the compression gas, reducing the compression work, but also results in an increased cooling capacity. Therefore, flash tank economization provides a significantly greater improvement in COP compared to intercooling under the same operating conditions. ^ The second approach to economizing uses an intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) to supply two-phase or vaporized refrigerant to the compressor at the intermediate pressure. The IHX achieves results identical to those for flash tank economization if the IHX has an effectiveness of 100 %, but the performance of the system with IHX economizing degrades significantly as the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases. ^ Therefore, the cycle with flash tank economization is selected for further study. The basic cycle model with two-stage compression and flash tank economization is modified to consider an increasing number of injection points and a flash tank that can supply two-phase refrigerant. The decrease in the enthalpy of the injected refrigerant and the increased number of injection ports moves the compression process closer to the liquid-vapor dome and therefore decreases the compression work. The number of injection points is then increased to approach the limiting case of continuous injection, which minimizes the compressor power consumption by maintaining a saturated vapor state in the compressor. ^ To improve the accuracy of these cycle model predictions, two comprehensive compressor models are developed. A thermodynamic model of a two-stage <b>rolling</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> is developed with consideration for leakage and heat transfer in the compressor. The compressor model is validated by experimental testing of a prototype two-stage rolling piston, and is then used to study the effect of intercooling on the compressor performance. ^ While the two-stage rolling-piston compressor operates with two separate compression chambers in series, the benefits of staging can also be realized by injecting economized refrigerant through ports in a single-stage rotary compressor. Therefore, a model of a novel rotary spool compressor with refrigerant injection is developed to study the effect of multiple injection ports on compressor and cycle performance. The model without injection is validated through experimental testing of a prototype spool compressor and provides a valuable tool for improving the prototype compressor design. ^ The model is then used to predict the compressor performance with a single injection port while varying the port diameter, port location and injection pressure. For an R- 22 cycle operating with an evaporating temperature of – 7. 2 °C, a suction temperature of 7. 6 °C and a condensing temperature of 48. 8 °C, the model predicts that a single injection port will increase the COP of the basic vapor compression cycle by up to 12 %. Incorporating a second injection port increases the COP of the cycle by 16 % over the baseline value without injection. ...|$|E
