40|$|Background: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} including {{low back}} pain have major individual and socioeconomic consequences as it often leads to disability and sick leave. Knowledge about predictors of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after long lasting {{low back pain}} is important from a health promotion perspective. The main focus within this field of research has been on predictors for work disability, and these do often differ from predictors of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Therefore, {{it is important to}} identify key predictors for <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Objective: <b>To</b> investigate whether high expectancies of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and high levels of overall job satisfaction can predict <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after 12 months among individuals with long lasting low back pain, and examine if there are any gender differences. Method: Secondary data analyses from a recently performed multicenter randomized controlled trial in a cohort of 569 workers on sick leave for 2 - 10 months due to low back pain. Results: Regardless of gender, high expectancies were significant in predicting <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at 12 months, while high levels of job satisfaction were not significant. Men with high expectancies had higher odds of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> compared <b>to</b> women. Men and women reported similar levels of expectancies and overall job satisfaction Conclusions: Among individuals with long lasting low back pain those with high expectancies of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> are more likely <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> than those with low expectancies. Screening expectancies and paying extra attention to individuals with low expectancies may contribute to solutions <b>to</b> increase <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Key words: The Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress, the Biopsychosocial Model of Pain, long lasting low back pain, expectancies of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> job satisfaction, <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} including {{low back}} pain have major individual and socioeconomic consequences as it often leads to disability and long-term sick leave and exclusion from working life. Predictors of disability and <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> often differ, and the dominant knowledge is on predictors for prolonged sick leave and disability. Therefore {{it is also important}} to identify key predictors for <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> The aim of the study was to assess if overall job satisfaction and expectancies of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> predicts actual <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after 12 months, among employees with long lasting {{low back pain}}, and to assess if there were gender differences in the predictors. Methods Data from the Cognitive interventions and nutritional supplements trial (CINS Trial) was used. Predictors for <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> were examined in 574 employees that had been on sick leave 2 – 10 months for low back pain, before entering the trial. Data were analysed with multiple logistic regression models stratified by gender, and adjusted for potential confounders. Results Regardless of gender high expectancies were a strong and significant predictor of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at 12 months, while high levels of job satisfaction were not a significant predictor. There were no differences in the levels of expectancies or overall job satisfaction between men and women. However, men had in general higher odds of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> compared with women. Conclusions Among individuals with long lasting low back pain high expectancies of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> were strongly associated with successful <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> We do not know what factors influence individual expectancies of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Screening expectancies and giving individuals with low expectancies interventions with a goal to change expectancies of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> such as CBT or self-management interventions, may contribute <b>to</b> increase actual <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is provided}} of {{research into the}} <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> of cancer survivors, examining both the rate of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and factors impacting this return. A series of literature searches was conducted on MEDLINE and PSYCLIT databases for the years 1985 - 1999. Studies had {{to focus on the}} patient's perspective and had to include either the percentage of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or factors associated with <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Case studies and studies of cancer as an occupational disease were excluded. The search identified 14 studies. The mean rate of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> was 62 % (range 30 - 93 %). The following factors were negatively associated with <b>return</b> <b>to</b> work: a non-supportive work environment, manual labour, and having head and neck cancer. Sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> For increasing age, associations were mixed. The increased survival rate of cancer patients warrants attention to the problems survivors may encounter upon their <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> More systematic research is needed to establish more clearly the relative importance of factors associated with <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> of cancer survivors, which, in turn, would contribute to an increase in the labour-participation of cancer survivors.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide an overview of the prognostic factors for <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and employment of cancer survivors. Cohort studies were selected if the population consisted of cancer patients between 18 and 65 years of age, with <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> employment or equivalent concepts as main outcome measure, studying at least one prognostic factor. The methodological quality of the included studies and level of evidence for each prognostic factor were assessed. Twenty-eight cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Heavy work and chemotherapy were negatively associated with <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Less invasive surgery was positively associated with <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Breast cancer survivors had the greatest chance of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Old age, low education and low income were negatively associated with employment. Moderate evidence was found for extensive disease being negatively associated with both <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and employment, and for female gender being negatively associated with <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> The review shows that in cancer survivors, a limited number of prognostic factors of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and employment can be identified. Physicians primarily engaged in the process of vocational rehabilitation of cancer survivors should be aware of the potential role these factors exert. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: <b>Returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> is {{a process}} that is {{intertwined}} with the social aspects of one’s life, which can influence the way in which that person manages their <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and also determines the support available to them. This study aimed to explore cancer patients’ perceptions of the role of their social context in relation <b>to</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> following treatment. Methods: Twenty-three patients who had received a diagnosis of either urological, breast, gynaecological, or bowel cancer participated in semi-structured interviews examining general perceptions of cancer, work values and perceptions of the potential impact of their cancer diagnosis and treatment on work. Interviews were analysed using the iterative process of Framework Analysis. Results: Two superordinate themes emerged as influential in the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> process: Social support as a facilitator of <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> (e. g. co-workers’ support and support outside of the workplace) and Social comparison as an appraisal of readiness <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> (e. g. comparisons with other cancer patients, colleagues, and employees in other organisations or professions). Conclusions: Two functions of the social context of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after cancer were apparent in the participants’ narrative: the importance of social support as a facilitator of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and the utilisation of social comparison information in order to appraise one’s readiness <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> The role of social context in <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> has largely been absent from the research literature to date.

40|$|Introduction Earlier {{diagnosis}} and better treatment {{have increased the}} survival rates of cancer patients. This warrants research on <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> of cancer survivors. What is the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> rate following early-stage breast cancer? What {{is the effect of}} the type of treatment and cancer-related symptoms on <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work?</b> Methods Our occupational health department registers sickness absence of about 50, 000 employees. In the period 2001 - 2005 we counted 154 cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer of which 72 were eligible for analysis. In these women, <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> was followed for 24 months after {{diagnosis and}} linked to the type of treatment and cancer-related symptoms. Results The mean duration of absence with early-stage breast cancer was 11. 4 +/- 5. 5 months; 35 % of patients were absent longer than one year and 4 patients did not <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> within two years after diagnosis. The duration of absence depended on the type of treatment and was significantly longer in patients who underwent chemotherapy (hazard rate [HR] = 0. 31; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 12 - 0. 81) or multimodal treatment (HR = 0. 24; 95 % CI = 0. 10 - 0. 54). Women started working about 4 months after the end of therapy irrespective of the type of treatment. At that moment, reaching above shoulder level was impaired in 11 patients (15 %) which significantly delayed partial <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> (HR = 0. 48; 95 % CI = 0. 23 - 0. 98) but not full <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> (HR = 0. 63; 95 % CI = 0. 31 - 1. 26).

40|$|SummaryThe {{goals of}} this study were to {{establish}} the occupational outcome after surgery in patients with a rotator cuff tear from a work-related injury (WRI) or occupational disease (OD) and determine which factors and conditions affected <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Hypothesis: <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> was possible for this type of patient. This questionnaire-based study comprised 262 shoulders in 254 patients with a WRI/OD who had surgery performed on their shoulder between 2000 and 2005. The average age was 50. 5 ± 6. 4 years. The following variables were analysed: employment status (private sector, self-employed, government employee), type of work (non-manual, manual, heavy manual labour), nature of tendon injury and surgical technique (open, mini-open and arthroscopy). <b>Return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> occurred in 59. 5 % of the cases. Factors that prevented <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> (40. 4 % of the cases) included retirement (14. 1 %), an unrelated medical condition (10. 3 %), and the outcome of the operated shoulder (16. 0 %). Age had an impact on <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> (P< 5 × 10 − 4). The type of work and nature of tendon injury did not affect <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> but did affect time away from work. Employment status and surgical technique had an effect on <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> but not on time away from work. Age was a decisive factor for <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Retirement seemed <b>to</b> be the most common choice starting at 55 years of age. Arthroscopy seemed to have reduced the impact of the WRI on the results, particularly on the time away from work. A preoperative evaluation of the patient's probability of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> should be done based on occupational and injury features. There may be a longer delay in <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for certain profiles of work (manual labour) and tendon injury.
