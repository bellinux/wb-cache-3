25|$|Lamotrigine is {{approved}} in the US for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly antimanics, lamotrigine {{is most effective}} for preventing the recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The drug seems ineffective {{in the treatment of}} current rapid-cycling, acute mania, or acute depression in bipolar disorder; however, it is effective at prevention of or delaying of manic, depressive, or <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> episodes. According to studies in 2007, lamotrigine may treat bipolar depression without triggering mania, hypomania, mixed states, or rapid-cycling.|$|E
25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling.</b> Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the symptom is severe; and scores of 6 suggest the symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|E
500|$|A parting line, sprue, gate marks, and {{ejector pin}} marks are usually {{present on the}} final part. [...] None of these {{features}} are typically desired, but are unavoidable {{due to the nature}} of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and ejector pin marks result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.|$|E

50|$|At face value, {{the affective}} {{lability}} of BPD and the <b>rapid</b> mood <b>cycling</b> of bipolar disorders can seem very similar.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a 50 nm high solution-filled cavity bounded by two parallel electrodes in which electrochemically active molecules undergo <b>rapid</b> redox <b>cycling</b> {{can be used}} to determine very fast electron-transfer kinetics. We illustrate this capability by showing that the heterogeneous rate constant of Fc(MeOH) (2) sensitively depends on the type and concentration of the supporting electrolyte. These solid-state devices are mechanically robust and stable over time and therefore have the potential to become a widespread and versatile tool for electrochemical measurements...|$|R
2500|$|The WASH-U {{version of}} the K-SADS was written by Barbara Geller and colleagues in 1996. It is a {{modified}} {{version of the}} 1986 K-SADS. This version is like many other versions of the K-SADS in that it is semi-structured, administered by clinicians to both parent and child separately, and assesses present episodes. However, this version specifically expands the mania section in order to be more applicable to pre-pubertal mania. In particular, it queries presence/absence of <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling.</b> [...] It also includes a section on multiple other DSM-IV diagnoses, and examines both present and lifetime symptoms as well as symptom onset and offset items. These modifications made this specific version particularly useful for phenomenology studies.|$|E
2500|$|To prevent {{excessively}} <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> of {{the equipment}} when the temperature is near the set point, a thermostat can include some hysteresis. Instead of changing from [...] "on" [...] to [...] "off" [...] and vice versa instantly at the set temperature, a thermostat with hysteresis will not switch until the temperature has changed a little past the set temperature point. For example, a refrigerator set to 2°C might not start the cooling compressor until its food compartment's temperature reaches 3°C, and will keep it running until the temperature has been lowered to 1 °C. This {{reduces the risk of}} equipment wear from too frequent switching, although it introduces a target system temperature oscillation of a certain magnitude.|$|E
2500|$|These design {{features}} facilitate <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> and fire {{compared to other}} bolt-action designs like the Mauser. The Lee bolt-action and 10-round magazine capacity enabled a well-trained rifleman to perform the [...] "mad minute" [...] firing 20 to 30 aimed rounds in 60 seconds, making the Lee–Enfield the fastest military bolt-action rifle of the day. The current world record for aimed bolt-action fire was set in 1914 by a musketry instructor in the British Army—Sergeant Instructor Snoxall—who placed 38 rounds into a [...] target at [...] in one minute. Some straight-pull bolt-action rifles were thought faster, but lacked the simplicity, reliability, and generous magazine capacity of the Lee–Enfield. Several First World War accounts tell of British troops repelling German attackers who subsequently {{reported that they had}} encountered machine guns, when in fact it was simply a group of well-trained riflemen armed with SMLE Mk III rifles.|$|E

5000|$|Ponds, lakes, {{and other}} small bodies of water are ideal for {{studying}} alternative stable states because they are relatively self-contained (Holling 1973). There has been great interest in state shifts in shallow temperate lakes between clear-water and turbid-water states. Nutrient loading can shift clear lakes to turbid systems by causing phytoplankton blooms (Scheffer 1997). Feedbacks maintaining the turbid state include shading out benthic macrophytes, which otherwise stabilize sediments and reduce <b>rapid</b> nutrient <b>cycling.</b> Hysteresis may occur if reductions in nutrient input do not return the clear-water state.|$|R
50|$|An {{intermodal}} {{journey planner}} supports intermodal journeys i.e. using {{more than one}} modes of transport, such as <b>cycling,</b> <b>rapid</b> transit, bus, ferry, etc. Many route planners support door-to-door planning while others only work between stops on the transport network, such as stations, airports or bus stops.|$|R
2500|$|Five months later, Brown, Stone, and Rathbone {{published}} a case report titled, [...] "Primidone and <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> affective disorders" [...] describing a 62-year-old {{woman who had}} rapid-cycling bipolar disorder starting in 1978. Lithium treatment was started two years later, but it only eliminated the manic swings, leaving her depressions unaffected. Between 1980 and 1989, the patient had six to ten episodes a year, each lasting between eleven and twenty-four days that left her with little energy, made tasks seem more arduous than they actually were, a smaller appetite, a tendency to sleep too much, anxious, and weepy. No antidepressant eliminated all her symptoms. At the age of fifty-eight, she was started on 125mg/day of primidone for hand tremor. Her depression, which was resistant to all the antidepressants she tried, gradually remitted during primidone therapy; the expected depressive episode lasted three days instead of 13-17. Eight weeks later, she had an episode lasting twenty-eight days. Her last two episodes were nineteen weeks apart, lasting twenty-five and twenty-seven days, respectively. It was during the final episode, {{in the middle of}} 1990, that her dose of primidone was stabilized at 500mg/day. She had been free of depression {{for two and a half}} years before the case report was written up.|$|E
5000|$|Antidepressants cause several risks {{when given}} to bipolar patients. They are {{ineffective}} in treating acute bipolar depression, preventing relapse, {{and can cause}} <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling.</b> Studies have been shown that antidepressants have no benefit versus a placebo or other treatment. Antidepressants {{can also lead to}} a higher rate of non-lethal suicidal behavior. Relapse can also be related to treatment with antidepressants. This is less likely to occur if a mood stabilizer is combined with an antidepressant, rather than an antidepressant being used alone. Evidence from previous studies shows that <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> is linked to use of antidepressants. <b>Rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> is defined as the presence of four or more mood episodes within a year's time. Evidence suggests that <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> and mixed symptoms have become more common since antidepressant medication has come into widespread use. There is a need for caution when treating bipolar patients with antidepressant medication due to the risks that they pose.|$|E

50|$|Most {{people who}} meet {{criteria}} for bipolar disorder experience {{a number of}} episodes, on average 0.4 to 0.7 per year, lasting three to six months. <b>Rapid</b> <b>cycling,</b> however, is a course specifier that may be applied {{to any of the}} above subtypes. It is defined as having four or more mood disturbance episodes within a one-year span and is found in a significant proportion of individuals with bipolar disorder. These episodes are separated from each other by a remission (partial or full) for at least two months or a switch in mood polarity (i.e., from a depressive episode to a manic episode or vice versa). The definition of <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> most frequently cited in the literature (including the DSM) is that of Dunner and Fieve: at least four major depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes are required to have occurred during a 12-month period. Ultra-rapid (days) and ultra-ultra rapid or ultradian (within a day) cycling have also been described. The literature examining the pharmacological treatment of <b>rapid</b> <b>cycling</b> is sparse and there is no clear consensus with respect to its optimal pharmacological management.|$|E
