5000|$|The {{first known}} use of polar area {{diagrams}} was by André-Michel Guerry, {{which he called}} courbes circulaires, in an 1829 paper showing seasonal and daily variation in wind direction over the year and births and deaths by hour of the day. Léon Lalanne later used a polar diagram to show the frequency of wind directions around compass points in 1843. The wind rose is still used by meteorologists. Nightingale published her <b>rose</b> <b>diagram</b> in 1858. The name [...] "coxcomb" [...] is sometimes used erroneously: this was the name Nightingale {{used to refer to}} a book containing the diagrams rather than the diagrams themselves.|$|E

Uncertainties were lower than a few degrees for 100 to 10, 800 Hz, and up to 10 ° for 1 to 100 Hz. The <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> are {{rendered}} in discrete frequencies; this is because there are insufficient data at 530 Hz to 3.6 kHz and 40 to 79 Hz (460 Hz to 3.6 kHz, 16.2 to 116 Hz, and 1 to 6.9 Hz for the Chishinshan area). According to Caldwell et al. ([2004]), the dominant direction of the main axes of the phase tensor ellipses reflects the direction of either a regional strike or a conductivity discontinuity. They note that the obtained direction has a 90 ° ambiguity. The dominant directions of the main axes were estimated primarily from their modes in each area. The <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> at several to several hundred hertz show {{that there are two}} rough types of dominant directions: NW-SE (or NE-SW) in the Chishinshan area and N-S (or E-W) at the Da-you-keng area, with the Matsao area having an intermediate direction.|$|R
40|$|Four {{circular}} mare basins {{were selected}} for ridge orientation analysis: Crisium, Imbrium, Serenitatis and Tranquillitatis. In each basin a central area was identified in which ridges were neither concentric with basin edges nor seemed to be extensions of significant highland structural trends. Ridge orientations in these central areas and in the remaining marginal areas were measured separately and <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> plotted for each. <b>Rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> of ridge orientations in the four circular mare basins show a narrow dispersion with a statistical average nearly north. Trends of basin margin ridges have a high deviation and are polymodal with maxima in the northwest, north and northeast directions.

5000|$|Indeed, Nightingale is {{described}} as [...] "a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics", and is credited with developing a form of the pie chart {{now known as the}} polar area diagram, or occasionally the Nightingale <b>rose</b> <b>diagram,</b> equivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of patient mortality in the military field hospital she managed. Nightingale called a compilation of such diagrams a [...] "coxcomb", but later that term would frequently be used for the individual diagrams. She made extensive use of coxcombs to present reports on the nature and magnitude of the conditions of medical care in the Crimean War to Members of Parliament and civil servants who would have been unlikely to read or understand traditional statistical reports. In 1859, Nightingale was elected the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society. She later became an honorary member of the American Statistical Association.|$|E

All the physical linear features were traced manually from the hill-shaded map. After the preparation of lineament map, line density command was used to prepare lineament concentration map of the Pravara basin.

40|$|Interaction between {{particles}} in so-called granular media such as soil and sand {{plays an important}} role in the context of geomechanical phenomena and numerous industrial applications. A two-scale homogenization approach based on a micro and a macroscale level is briefly introduced in this paper. The behavior of the granular matter at the microscale level is captured by a discrete element method, allowing the simulation of breaking and forming of contacts between the single grains. The problem at the macroscale level is discretized by the finite element method. A computation of granular material in such a way gives a deeper insight into the context of discontinuous materials and at the same time reduces the computational costs. However, the description and the understanding of the phenomena in granular materials are not yet satisfactory. A sophisticated problem-specific visualization technique would significantly help to illustrate failure phenomena at the microscopic level. As main contribution, we present a novel 2 D approach for the visualization of simulation data, based on the above outlined homogenization technique. Our visualization tool supports visualization at the microscale level, as well as at the macroscale level. The tool shows both aspects closely arranged in the form of multiple coordinated views to give users the possibility to analyze the particle behavior effectively. A novel type of interactive <b>rose</b> <b>diagram</b> was developed to represent the dynamic contact networks at the microscale level in a condensed and efficient way.

40|$|Although karstic {{weathering}} (sensu lato) is a {{major concern}} for the exploitation of limestone quarries, the importance, spatial extension, and intensity of this natural phenomenon are rarely investigated {{because of the lack of}} applicable technique to assess these variables other than subsurface geophysical exploration methods. Here, we propose to use the intrinsic property of ghost-rock weathering, tectonic control, to predict the degree and type of weathering of the reserve of two contiguous limestone quarries in the Tournai area (western Belgium). First, we revised the macrotectonic setting of these quarries, creating five tectonic entities. Then, we built an extensive fracture database (1357 ‘events’), recording fracture direction, dip, width, height, mineralization, and weathering. Then, we calculated a “Sterile Index” that is a simple function of the relative occurrence and mean width of karstified fractures. The <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> of fracture orientations are contrasted between tectonic entities and so are the intensity and the dominant type of weathering: tectonic entities with widely dispersed fracture directions are significantly more weathered than entities with narrowly dispersed <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Preliminary tests indicate fracture orientation and weathering are consistent within the tectonic entities, allowing extrapolation to quarries reserves. Ultimately, this technique can be used to predict the rock waste volume of the quarries reserves (when combined with geophysical exploration methods) and manage the development of the quarries accordingly...|$|R

40|$|MARD 1. 0 is a {{computer}} program for generating smoothed <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> by using a moving average, which is designed for use across {{the wide range of}} disciplines encompassed within the Earth Sciences. Available in MATLAB®, Microsoft® Excel and GNU Octave formats, the program is fully compatible with both Microsoft® Windows and Macintosh operating systems. Each version has been implemented in a user-friendly way that requires no prior experience in programming with the software. MARD conducts a moving average smoothing, a form of signal processing low-pass filter, upon the raw circular data according to a set of pre-defined conditions selected by the user. This form of signal processing filter smoothes the angular dataset, emphasising significant circular trends whilst reducing background noise. Customisable parameters include whether the data is uni- or bi-directional, the angular range (or aperture) over which the data is averaged, and whether an unweighted or weighted moving average is to be applied. In addition to the uni- and bi-directional options, the MATLAB® and Octave versions also possess a function for plotting 2 -dimensional dips/pitches in a single, lower, hemisphere. The <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> from each version are exportable as one of a selection of common graphical formats. Frequently employed statistical measures that determine the vector mean, mean resultant (or length), circular standard deviation and circular variance are also included.

The Φ averages at KIN and KZY parallel to {{the direction of the}} maximum horizontal compressional stress (N 139 °E) in the study area (Yukutake et al., 2007). The <b>rose</b> <b>diagram</b> at KOM in Fig. 1 has two peaks. One of the two peaks is at 135 °, parallel to the direction of maximum horizontal compressional stress. This parallelism indicates that cracks generated by the tectonic stress field prevailed outside the focal area of the swarm. Honda and Tanada (2006) also reported several peaks of the Φ direction at KOM from analysis for the period 2002 and 2005, similar to the present result. It is believed that the sparse distribution of Φ reflects the universal crack distribution just below KOM.|$|E

It is shown that the numbers of movable and key blocks in the location of downriver right side wall and vault are larger than those in other location owing to numerous discontinuous faces, and the faults of F 34 and F 33 play a main role in the stability of movable and key blocks.

Dominant strike variations are depicted as <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> in Fig.  2. Geo-electric strike orientation of N 85 °E found in the NAF region coincides well with the geological strike. Overall, orientations demonstrate that the structural complexity increases while moving toward south. The data that show most oblique orientations are the ones {{in the vicinity of the}} Çankırı Basin and Kızılırmak Fault Zone with N 75 °E.

First, we find that vertical portions of conduits visually correlate to fractures, and these fractures tend to be the dominant control of conduit directionality. Length-weighted <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> of passage directions reveal a NW-SE and NE-SW pattern of conduit directions statistically similar to results found in remote sensing studies of photolinears.

Its NE–SW direction is the main structural feature revealed as confirmed by the <b>rose</b> <b>diagram.</b> In addition, important faults like Foumban (Central Africa) and SW Cameroon shear zones or the contact between Pan-African Fold Belt and Congo craton provide the reliability of this methodological approach. A correspondence is found between gravity anomalies and geological formations. This work corroborates once more {{the vulnerability of the}} CVL zone. The distribution of faults and maar lakes shows that special attention should be paid in this sector to prevent natural disasters such as gas emissions of “asleep” maars. The earth gravity model EGM 2008 resulting of the combination of terrestrial and altimetry-derived gravity data is therefore advantageous for subsurface investigations in volcanic mountainous areas as the CVL where terrestrial gravity surveys cannot easily reach.|$|E
40|$|A geometrically {{anisotropic}} spatial {{process can}} be viewed as being a linear transformation of an isotropic spatial process. Customary semivariogram estimation techniques often involve ad hoc selection of the linear transformation to reduce the region to isotropy and then fitting a valid parametric semivariogram to the data under the transformed coordinates. We propose a Bayesian methodology which simultaneously estimates the linear transformation and the other semivariogram parameters. In addition, the Bayesian paradigm allows full inference for any characteristic of the geometrically anisotropic model rather than merely providing a point estimate. Our work is motivated by a data set of scallop catches in the Atlantic Ocean in 1990 and also in 1993.

They also revised the N-S transect that displays the frequency of ENE-striking fractures, and constructed a new N-S transect that shows the frequency of E-striking fractures. This transect compliments the earlier transect they constructed for fracture frequency of ENE-striking fractures. Significantly, the fracture frequency transect for E-W fractures shows a spike in fracture frequency in the region of the E-striking Firtree anticline that is observed on seismic reflection sections. The ENE fracture set does not exhibit an unusually high fracture frequency in this area. In contrast, the fracture frequency of the ENE-striking set is anomalously high in the region of the Trenton/Black River grabens. They have nearly completed reducing the data they collected from a NNW-SSE transect {{on the west side of}} Cayuga Lake and they have constructed modified <b>rose</b> <b>diagrams</b> for most sites. Structure contour maps and isopach maps have been revised based on additional well log analyses. Except for the Glodes Corners Field, the well spacing generally remains insufficient to identify faults or their precise locations. However, relatively sharp elevational changes east of Keuka Lake support the contention that faults occur along the east side of Keuka Lake. Similarly, a single well east of Seneca Lake shows that the Trenton there is low compared to distant wells, based on an assumed regional slope. This same area is where one of the Trenton grabens occurs. They have completed the interpretation of the reprocessed data that Quest licensed and had reprocessed. Several grabens observed in the Trenton and Black River reflectors are consistent with surface structure, soil gas, and aeromagnetic anomalies. In this report they display all four interpreted seismic lines. These data indicate that integration of aeromagnetic and topographic lineaments, surface structure, soil gas with seismic and well logs allows them to extrapolate Trenton-Black River trends away from confirmatory seismic lines...|$|R
