5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, <b>ropinirole,</b> piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} (e.g. pramipexole and <b>ropinirole)</b> {{resulted in}} some improvement in {{a minority of}} people, but numerous side effects, including the onset of impulse control disorders like compulsive gambling and shopping, have led to concern about this approach.|$|E
25|$|Different {{medications}} are {{tried in}} an effort to find a combination that is effective for a specific person. Not all people will respond well to the same medications. Medications that have had positive results in some include: diphenhydramine, benzatropine and atropine. anti-Parkinsons agents (such as <b>ropinirole</b> and bromocriptine), and muscle relaxants (such as diazepam).|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} in {{the brain}} have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors. Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms {{with the aim of}} delaying motor complications. When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, <b>ropinirole,</b> piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine, and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|Medication {{is often}} not {{necessary}} in children as symptoms usually alleviate spontaneously as the child ages. However, because the disorder may affect wakeful behavior, many adults who continue to suffer from RMD may seek treatment. Benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants have been considered as therapeutic options in managing the disorder. Infantile and adolescent RMD respond well to low doses of clonazepam. Prescription medications such as <b>ropinirole</b> or pramipexole given to restless legs syndrome patients do not show any clinical improvement in many patients with RMD.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{is merely}} {{symptomatic}} and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions. In early detected cases of oral overdose, induction of emesis, gastric lavage, {{and the use}} of activated charcoal can all be tried. Epinephrine is avoided for treatment of hypotension and shock, because its action might be reversed. In the case of a severe overdose, antidotes such as bromocryptine or <b>ropinirole</b> may be used to treat the extrapyramidal effects caused by haloperidol, acting as dopamine receptor agonists. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures.|$|E
25|$|The {{dopamine}} neurotransmitter mediates synaptic transmission by binding to five specific GPCRs. These five receptor proteins {{are separated}} into two classes due {{to whether the}} response elicits an excitatory or inhibitory response on the post-synaptic cell. There are many types of drugs, legal and illegal, that effect dopamine and its interactions in the brain. With Parkinson's disease, a disease that decreases the amount of dopamine in the brain, the dopamine precursor Levodopa {{is given to the}} patient {{due to the fact that}} dopamine cannot cross the blood–brain barrier and L-dopa can. Some dopamine agonists are also given to Parkinson's patients that have a disorder known as restless leg syndrome or RLS. Some examples of these are <b>ropinirole</b> and pramipexole.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{neurological}} disorder characterized by a degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra {{and a loss of}} dopamine in the putamen. It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa (L-Dopa) or dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or <b>ropinirole)</b> to patients. Dopamine replacement therapy is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more complex. Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, attention, and most importantly the reward system. In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, addictive drugs stimulate dopamine release. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the role of dopamine in the reward system and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS. Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS. One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a habituation to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This habituation is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the reward system gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases drug intake there is a loss of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum which acts in addition to an impairment in goal-direction mental functions to produce an enhancement of sensitization to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine overdose.|$|E

50|$|Some doctors {{express the}} view that the {{incidence}} of restless leg syndrome is exaggerated by manufacturers of drugs used to treat it. Others believe it is an underrecognized and undertreated disorder. Further, GlaxoSmithKline ran advertisements that, while not promoting off-license use of their drug (<b>ropinirole)</b> for treatment of RLS, did link to the Ekbom Support Group website. That website contained statements advocating the use of <b>ropinirole</b> to treat RLS. The ABPI ruled against GSK in this case.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ropinirole</b> (INN; {{trade names}} Requip, Repreve, Ronirol, Adartrel) is a {{dopamine}} agonist of the non-ergoline class of medications. It is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Cipla, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical. It {{is used in}} the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome (RLS). <b>Ropinirole</b> is one of three medications approved by the FDA to treat RLS, the other two being pramipexole (Mirapex) and gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant). The discovery of the drug's utility in RLS has been used as an example of successful drug repurposing.|$|E
50|$|Several unusual {{adverse effects}} of {{pramipexole}} (and related D3-preferring dopamine agonist medications such as <b>ropinirole)</b> may include compulsive gambling, punding, hypersexuality, and overeating, even in patients without any prior history of these behaviours.|$|E

50|$|In November 2012, GlaxoSmithKline {{was ordered}} by a Rennes appeals court to pay Frenchman Didier Jambart 197,000 euros ($255,824); Jambart had taken <b>ropinirole</b> from 2003 to 2010 and {{exhibited}} risky hypersexual behavior and gambled excessively until stopping the Parkinson's treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ropinirole</b> is {{prescribed}} for mainly Parkinson's disease, RLS and extrapyramidal symptoms. It can {{also reduce the}} side effects caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Parkinsonism syndrome as well as sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction caused by either SSRIs or antipsychotics.|$|E
50|$|Some medical drugs act as {{dopamine}} agonists and {{can treat}} hypodopaminergic (low dopamine) conditions; they are typically used for treating Parkinson's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (in {{the form of}} stimulants) and certain pituitary tumors (prolactinoma), and may be useful for restless legs syndrome (RLS). Both <b>ropinirole</b> and pramipexole are FDA-approved {{for the treatment of}} RLS. There is also an ongoing clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the dopamine agonist <b>ropinirole</b> in reversing the symptoms of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Additionally, a systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that prophylactic treatment with cabergoline reduces the incidence, but not the severity, of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), without compromising pregnancy outcomes, in females undergoing stimulated cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF).|$|E
50|$|<b>Ropinirole</b> {{acts as a}} D2, D3, and D4 {{dopamine}} {{receptor agonist}} with highest affinity for D2. It is weakly active at the 5-HT2, and α2 receptors and {{is said to have}} virtually no affinity for the 5-HT1, GABA, mAChRs, α1, and β-adrenoreceptors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ropinirole</b> is metabolized {{primarily}} by cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 to form two metabolites; SK&F-104557 and SK&F-89124, {{both of which}} are renally excreted, and at doses higher than clinical, is also metabolized by CYP3A4. At doses greater than 24 mg, CYP2D6 may be inhibited, although this has only been tested in vitro.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ropinirole</b> in the Requip form is {{available}} in various preparations, ranging from a 0.25 mg tablet to a 5 mg tablet. The primary reason is dose titration. This implies that the person taking Requip has to closely interact and communicate with the primary care physician with regard to how much should actually {{be taken by the}} patient.|$|E
50|$|Other {{medications}} {{aimed at}} reducing or eliminating the leg jerks or the arousals can be prescribed. Non-ergot derived dopaminergic drugs (pramipexole and <b>ropinirole)</b> are preferred. Other dopaminergic agents such as co-careldopa, co-beneldopa, pergolide, or lisuride may also be used. These drugs decrease or eliminate both the leg jerks and the arousals. These medications are also successful {{for the treatment of}} restless legs syndrome.|$|E
50|$|For Parkinson's disease, {{the maximum}} {{recommended}} dose is 24 mg per day, taken in three separate doses spread throughout the day. The maximum dose recommendations of <b>ropinirole</b> for subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) should be reduced by 25% compared with those recommended for subjects with normal renal function. A 25% dose reduction represents a more straightforward dosage regimen in terms of available tablet strength, compared with a 30% dose reduction.|$|E
50|$|Microsleeps {{sometimes}} are {{a side effect}} of various drugs, particularly in reference to dopamine-stimulating drugs in Parkinson's Disease. Particularly, somnolence is a recognized adverse effect of dopamine agonists, pramipexole and <b>ropinirole.</b> These drugs are known to cause sudden-onset sleep spells in roughly 50% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) while they were driving. Therefore, clinical interventions pertaining to microsleeps may also encompass reducing excessive sleepiness as {{a side effect of}} drug administration.|$|E
