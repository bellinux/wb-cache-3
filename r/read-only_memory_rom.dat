25|$|For instance, {{instead of}} a {{hardware}} multiplier, a calculator might implement floating point mathematics with code in <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>ROM),</b> and compute trigonometric functions with the CORDIC algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication. Bit serial logic designs are more common in calculators whereas bit parallel designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes chip complexity, but takes many more clock cycles. This distinction blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, more so the Z80, MC68000, and ARM architectures, and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market.|$|E
25|$|A cross {{assembler}} (see also cross compiler) is an assembler that is {{run on a}} computer or operating system (the host system) of a different type from the system on which the resulting code is to run (the target system). Cross-assembling facilitates the development of programs for systems {{that do not have}} the resources to support software development, such as an embedded system. In such a case, the resulting object code must be transferred to the target system, either via <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>ROM,</b> EPROM, etc.) or a data link using an exact bit-by-bit copy of the object code or a text-based representation of that code, such as Motorola S-record or Intel HEX.|$|E

Examples of non-volatile <b>memory</b> include <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (see <b>ROM),</b> flash <b>memory,</b> most types of magnetic computer storage devices (e.g. hard disk drives, floppy disks and magnetic tape), optical discs, and early computer storage {{methods such as}} paper tape and punched cards.|$|R
25|$|The first desktop {{programmable}} calculators {{were produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>ROM,</b> for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E
25|$|Intel Corporation saw {{the massive}} {{potential}} of the invention and introduced the first commercial NOR type flash chip in 1988. NOR-based flash has long erase and write times, but provides full address and data buses, allowing random access to any memory location. This makes it a suitable replacement for older <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>ROM)</b> chips, which are used to store program code that rarely needs to be updated, such as a computer's BIOS or the firmware of set-top boxes. Its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on-chip flash memory, to a more typical 10,000 or 100,000 erase cycles, up to 1,000,000 erase cycles. NOR-based flash was the basis of early flash-based removable media; CompactFlash was originally based on it, though later cards moved to less expensive NANDflash.|$|E

Unfortunately Existing designs are restricted to a low accuracy and a small sample number. The Fourier transform is widely used in industrial applications {{as well as in}} scientific research. The most common use is to transform a function of time into a frequency function. In this paper, we present the efficient implementation of a pipeline FFT. Our design adopts a single-path delay feedback style as the proposed hardware architecture.

40|$|Abstract—Crosstalk between bitlines induces read {{failure and}} limits the {{coverage}} of applicable code-patterns for high-speed contact/via-programming <b>read-only</b> <b>memories</b> (<b>ROMs)</b> in SoC. Owing to the variation in bitline loading across code-patterns, the amount of coupled noise on an accessed bitline is code-pattern-de-pendent. This crosstalk effect worsens, with larger coupling capacitance and smaller intrinsic loading, as the technology node shrinks. This study proposes dynamic virtual guardian (DVG) techniques for contact/via-programming ROM macros and com-pilers to eliminate the crosstalk-induced read failure and increase the code-patterns coverage. Compared with conventional ROMs, DVG techniques achieve higher speed, lower power consumption and better design for manufacturing (DFM) capability with full code-patterns coverage. Experiments on fabricated designs, a conventional ROM and two 256 Kb DVG ROMs, using 0. 18 m 1 P 5 M CMOS technology have demonstrated that DVG tech-niques achieve 100 % code-pattern coverage under a small sensing margin.

500|$|Robinett {{kept the}} Gray Dot a secret {{for over a}} year, and did not mention it to anyone at Atari prior to his departure. He was unsure {{of whether or not}} it would be {{discovered}} by other Atari personnel prior to publishing; the dot was not mentioned in the game's manual, as the manual's author was unaware of the dot's existence. [...] After the game was released, Adam Clayton, a fifteen-year-old from Salt Lake City, discovered the Dot and sent a letter to Atari explaining how to retrieve it. Robinett had already quit the company by this point, so Atari tasked designers with finding the responsible code. The one who found it said that if he were to fix it, he would change the message in the game to say [...] "Fixed by Brad Stewart". Further, the cost of creating a new <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>ROM)</b> mask, or memory chip, was around $10,000 US {{at the time of the}} game's release, making this change a costly endeavor. Steve Wright, the director of software development of the Atari Consumer Division, argued for retaining the message, believing it gave players additional incentive to find it and play their games more, and suggested these were like Easter eggs for players to find. Atari eventually decided to leave the Dot in-game, and dubbed such hidden features Easter eggs, saying they would be adding more such secrets to later games. Wright made it an official policy at Atari that all future games should include Easter eggs, often limited to being the initials of the game developer.|$|E
2500|$|At its founding, Intel was {{distinguished}} by {{its ability to}} make semiconductors. Its first product, in 1969, was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit static random-access memory (SRAM), which was nearly {{twice as fast as}} earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan. [...] In the same year, Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>ROM)</b> and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) silicon gate SRAM chip, the 256-bit 1101. [...] Intel's business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products, still dominated by various memory devices.|$|E
2500|$|The C64 uses an 8-bit MOS Technology 6510 microprocessor. This {{is a close}} {{derivative}} of the 6502 with an added 6-bit internal I/O port that in the C64 is used for two purposes: to bank-switch the machine's <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>ROM)</b> {{in and out of}} the processor's address space, and to operate the datasette tape recorder. The C64 has [...] of RAM, of which 1024× ½ bytes are color RAM for text mode and [...] are available to built-in Commodore BASIC 2.0 on startup. There is [...] of ROM, made up of the BASIC interpreter, the kernel, and the character ROM. As the processor could only address [...] at a time, the ROM was mapped into memory and only [...] of RAM (plus 4KB between ROMs) were available at startup. Most [...] "breadbox" [...] Commodore 64s used 4164 DRAM, with eight chips to total up 64k of system RAM. Late breadbox models and all C64Cs used 41464 DRAM (64kx4) chips which stored 32KB per chip, so only two were required. Since 4164 DRAMs are 64kx1, eight chips are needed to make an entire byte and the computer will not function without all of them present. Thus the first chip contains Bit 0 for the entire memory space, the second chip contains Bit 1, and so forth. This also makes detecting faulty RAM easy as a bad chip will display random characters on the screen and the character displayed can be used to determine the faulty RAM.|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} magnetic susceptibility, optical reflectivity and electrical conductivity of [Fe(HB(pz) 3) 2] (pz = pyrazolyl) revealed irreversible changes in the material during the low-spin to high-spin transition when the ‘‘as-prepared’’ sample was heated above B 400 K for the first time. During this first heating sequence, the initially fine powder sample became coarse, and its crystal structure changed from tetragonal to monoclinic. Single-crystals of the monoclinic form suitable for X-ray analysis could be isolated after the first thermal cycle, and their structure was resolved in the P 21 /n (Z = 4) space group. Successive cooling and heating cycles {{did not lead to}} further modification of the crystal structure, and the {{temperature dependence}} of the physical properties remained invariable. Remarkably, the electrical conductivity of the sample measured at 293 K dropped from 6. 1 108 to 2. 1 1011 S m 1 following the first thermal cycle—suggesting possible applications of this material in <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> devices (<b>ROM)</b> ...|$|R

The contents of most of these devices can be copied to computer files, in a process called [...] "dumping". The resulting files are often generically called ROM images or ROMs regardless {{of the kind of}} storage they came from. A game usually consists of multiple ROM and PAL images; these are collectively stored inside a single ZIP file, constituting a ROM set. In addition to the [...] "parent" [...] ROM set (usually chosen as the most recent [...] "World" [...] version of the game), games may have [...] "clone" [...] ROM sets with different program code, different language text intended for different markets etc. For example, Street Fighter II Turbo is considered a variant of Street Fighter II Champion Edition.
