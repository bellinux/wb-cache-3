40|$|Abstract-Polishing is {{the process}} of {{creating}} a smooth and shiny surface by rubbing it or using a chemical action, leaving a surface with a significant spectacular reflection. When an unpolished surface is magnified thousands of times, it usually looks like mountains and valleys. By repeated abrasion, those "mountains " are worn down until they are flat or just small "hills. " The process of polishing with abrasives starts with coarse ones and graduates to fine ones. The surface of a metallographic specimen is prepared by various methods of grinding, polishing, and etching. After preparation, it is often analyzed using optical or electron microscopy. The process of polishing is divided into <b>rough</b> <b>polishing</b> and fine polishing. The wet grinding machine is used for <b>rough</b> <b>polishing</b> in which we use different grade emery papers.

40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} in {{this paper}} the influence of surface finish on the ageing kinetics of biomedical grade zirconia. The critical influence of polishing has been systematically investigated by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The stress state around polishing scratches gives rise to preferential transformation in the zone of the induced scratches and consequently to accelerated ageing. The influence of residual stresses is analyzed semi-quantitatively by preparing samples with various surface finish, thus with various stress states. <b>Rough</b> <b>polishing</b> produces a compressive surface stress layer beneficial for the ageing resistance, while smooth polishing produces preferential transformation nucleation around scratches. When a thermal treatment of 2 h at 1200 °C is applied to relax the residual stresses, all the surfaces states exhibit the same sensitivity to ageing. These results demonstrate that roughness alone cannot be used for ensuring a long-term stability. The variation of ageing sensitivity is indeed related indirectly to the surface roughness via the induced surface stress state. The current ISO standards {{are not able to}} take these effects into account.

40|$|Hard turning (HT) is a {{material}} removal process employing {{a combination of}} a single point cutting tool and high speeds to machine hard ferrous alloys which exhibit hardness values over 45 HRC. In this paper, a surface defect machining (SDM) method for HT is proposed which harnesses the combined advantages of porosity machining and pulsed laser pre-treatment processing. From previous experimental work, this was shown to provide better controllability of the process and improved quality of the machined surface. While the experiments showed promising results, a comprehensive understanding of this new technique could only be achieved through a rigorous, in depth theoretical analysis. Therefore, an assessment of the SDM technique was carried out using both finite element method (FEM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. FEM modelling was used to compare the conventional HT of AISI 4340 steel (52 HRC) using an AlO insert with the proposed SDM method. The simulations showed very good agreement with the previously published experimental results. Compared to conventional HT, SDM provided favourable machining outcomes, such as reduced shear plane angle, reduced average cutting forces, improved surface roughness, lower residual stresses on the machined surface, reduced tool-chip interface contact length and increased chip flow velocity. Furthermore, a scientific explanation of the improved surface finish was revealed using a state-of-the-art MD simulation model which suggested that during SDM, a combination of both the cutting action and <b>rough</b> <b>polishing</b> action help improve the machined surface finish...|$|E
40|$|Hard turning is {{emerging}} as a key technology to substitute conventional grinding processes, mainly on account of lower equipment cost, short setup time, and a reduced number of process steps. This is, however, being impeded {{by a number of}} challenges required to be resolved, including attainable surface roughness, surface deteriorations, surface residual stresses and metallurgical transformations on the machined steel surface (white layer). In this thesis, a novel approach named Surface Defect Machining (SDM) is proposed as a viable solution to resolve a large number of these issues and to improve surface finish and surface integrity. SDM is defined as a process of machining, where a workpiece is first subjected to surface defects creation at a depth less than the uncut chip thickness; either through mechanical and/or thermal means; then followed by a normal machining operation so as to reduce the cutting resistance. A comprehensive understanding of SDM is established theoretically using finite element method (FEM). Also, an experimental study has been carried out for extensive understanding of the new technique. A good agreement between theoretical and experimental investigations has been achieved. The results show very interesting salient features of SDM, providing favourable machining outcomes. These include: reduced shear plane angle, reduced machining forces, lower residual stresses on the machined surface, reduced tool-chip interface contact length and increased chip flow velocity, as well as reductions in overall temperature in the cutting zone and changing the mechanism of chip morphology from jagged to discontinuous. However, the most prominent outcome is the improved attainable surface roughness. Furthermore, SDM shows the ability to exceed the critical feed rate and achieve an optical surface finish upto 30 nm. A scientific explanation of the improved surface roughness suggests that during SDM, a combination of both the cutting action and the <b>rough</b> <b>polishing</b> action help to improve the machined surface. Based on these findings, it is anticipated that a component machined using the SDM method should exhibit improved quality of the machined surface, which is expected to provide tremendous commercial advantages in the time to come...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Under {{physiological}} loads, debonded cemented femoral stems {{have been}} shown to move within their cement mantle and generate a fluid pump that may facilitate peri-prosthetic osteolysis by pressurizing fluid and circulating wear debris. The long-term physiological loading of <b>rough</b> and <b>polished</b> tapered stems in vitro has shown differences in performance, with greater interface pressures generated by the rough stems. In this study we investigated the individual effects of stem surface finish, degree of mantle wear, and mode of loading on the stem pump mechanism. METHOD: <b>Rough</b> and <b>polished</b> stems were loaded under different regimes in artificially worn cement mantles that permitted either 2 or 5 degrees of rotational stem movement, and the interface pressures were compared. RESULTS: The pressures generated by the <b>rough</b> and <b>polished</b> stems were similar in either type of mantle. The pattern of pressure generation in the 2 -degree mantles was similar to the pressures generated by rough stems after long-term loading, but the high posterior wall pressures fell and the tip pressures increased in the 5 -degree mantles. The torsional loads were principal drivers of pressure generation in all areas of the interface other than the implant tip, where axial loading predominated.

40|$|Today, zirconia-based restorations {{have become}} popular in dentistry. Thanks to their superb {{biocompatibility}} and favourable mechanical properties, yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (Y-TZP) ceramics are used {{not only as}} an alternative for conventional porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations, but also as implant abutments or even implants. The overall objectives of this work were (1) to assess the low-temperature degradation behavior and the mechanical properties of dental zirconia, (2) to characterize the zirconia-veneering ceramic interface, and (3) to improve the bonding receptiveness of zirconia. The {{first part of this}} doctoral dissertation focused on the low-temperature degradation (LTD) and mechanical properties of dental zirconia. Our aim was to assess the influence of the sintering conditions (paper 1) and the influence of different surface treatments (papers 2 & 3) on the LTD behavior and mechanical properties of zirconia. We have found that the kind of sintering conditions affect the ZrO 2 -grain size and -phase composition. In general, an increased sintering temperature and prolonged sintering time resulted in a higher sensitivity of Y-TZP zirconia to LTD. Moreover, a significant decrease in Vickers hardness and only a moderate increase in fracture toughness resulted from an increase in sintering temperature and time. The best sintering condition, we found to combine excellent mechanical properties with a satisfactory LTD resistance, was sintering at 1450 &# 176;C for 1 h. The LTD behavior of the surface-treated zirconia depended on the kind of zirconia grade. We have assessed four different surface treatments (as sintered (untreated), <b>rough</b> <b>polishing,</b> Al 2 O 3 sandblasting, and tribochemical silica sandblasting) on three kinds of zirconia grades (Y-TZP zirconia, Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia, and Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia). For Y-TZP zirconia, the three surface treatments induced a ferroelastic domain switch and produced residual compressive stress at the surface. Both effects improved the aging resistance of Y-TZP zirconia. The surface treatments did not affect the aging resistance of Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia. Although the as sintered (untreated) Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia showed a quite strong aging resistance, this zirconia grade slightly degraded after surface treatment. In particular the c-ZrO 2 phase contributed to the aging resistance of the Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia. As the surface treatment reduced the amount of the c-ZrO 2, the Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia became more sensitive to LTD. Surface treatment also affected the mechanical properties of zirconia. We have investigated the influence of surface treatment on the four-point bending strength of a Y-TZP and a Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia grade. Grinding, Al 2 O 3 sandblasting and tribochemical silica sandblasting induced residual compressive stress at the zirconia surface. This increased the bending strength of the two zirconia grades. On the other hand, grinding made the bending strength less consistent. Surface grinding Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia with or without additional Al 2 O 3 or tribochemical silica sandblasting resulted in a deeper compressive stress zone than when Y-TZP zirconia was exposed to the same surface treatment. This on its turn resulted in an more consistent bending strength and concomitantly improved the consistency of the zirconias mechanical properties in general. Thermal treatment after grinding however eliminated the residual compressive stress layer, and significantly decreased the bending strength. In the second part of this thesis, we morphologically and chemically characterized the interface between the veneering ceramic and zirconia at a high resolution (paper 4), this because the chipping of the veneering ceramic from the zirconia framework is today still a major clinical concern. Some indication of chemical interaction between the veneering ceramic and zirconia was found by EDS analysis. Micro-Raman analysis revealed a partially t-ZrO 2 to m-ZrO 2 phase transformation immediately beneath the zirconia-veneering ceramic interface and the presence of residual tensile stresses within this transformed zirconia zone. Although the zirconia-veneering ceramic interface was found to be tight, no indications suggesting chemical interaction between both substrates were detected. The veneering procedure introduced tensile stress and phase transformation in the zirconia area immediately underneath the interface. This may explain in part the chipping clinically observed rather frequently. The third part of this thesis focused on the bonding effectiveness to dental zirconia. We systematically analyzed the literature to disclose general trends in bonding effectiveness to zirconia (paper 5) and we measured the micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) of different bonding/luting protocols to zirconia (papers 6, 7 & 8). Furthermore, we investigated the influence of light irradiation delivered by two light-curing units through zirconia restorations on the degree of monomer conversion of composite cements (paper 9). The systematic review revealed that a combination of mechanical and chemical pre-treatment is essential to obtain durable bonding to zirconia. Interestingly, the cement choice was not revealed as determining factor after aging as long as composite cement was employed. Regarding the test protocol, a tensile test appeared more discriminative, in particular when it was combined with water-storage aging. The µTBS test demonstrated that combined mechanical/chemical pre-treatment, using tribochemical silica sandblasting followed by a combined 10 -MDP/silane ceramic primer resulted in the most durable bond to zirconia. Although Al 2 O 3 sandblasting is the mechanical pre-treatment mostly applied, it resulted in a less durable bond as compared to when the zirconia surface is tribochemical silica sandblasted. In case of a chemical pre-treatment with a primer containing the functional monomer 10 -MDP, the purity of the latter functional monomer may affect the bond durability of the composite cement to zirconia. We have finally also measured the degree of conversion of composite cements cured through zirconia. Although zirconia reduced the light energy delivered by light-curing units, composite cements under Y-TZP zirconia-based restorations could be light-cured. The amount of light transmitted through Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia was however too low to be measured. Such opaque/ dark zirconia should definitely be luted using a dual-cure composite cement with an effective self-cure potential. status: publishe...|$|E

The purpose of the work herein was to evaluate the variables of the blue fired aluminum oxide heat treatment process. This heat treatment process improves the physical properties of the brown fused aluminum oxide and results in a blue coloring, which uniquely identifies it within the abrasives industry. The work herein includes information beginning with the electro-fusion process of bauxite (the manufacturing of the brown fused aluminum oxide) to the Blue Fired process. It also compares the fracture resistance index between these materials. This index is the inverse of the friability. Besides the content of titanium and iron oxides, process variables such as time, temperature and atmospheric conditions are important to monitor {{in order to reach}} standard requirements. Experimental evidence measuring these parameters is presented in the article herein. The blue coloring of this aluminum oxide is explained by the optical phenomena of electron transition, and not by the formation of aluminum titanate, as some technical literature has stated. Furthermore, it was proved that the coloring of blue fired material should not be used exclusively as an indicator of the optimal abrasive characteristics of this class of aluminum oxide...|$|R

The control of dishing {{is important for}} advanced damascene metal interconnect technologies. However, the modeling of dishing is still in an initial phase.

Therefore, a numerical model of the contact area of the pad and wafer, and the number of contacts and the size distribution of the contact areas as function of polish parameters and pad properties, was developed. The number of contacts appeared directly proportional to the applied pressure. In addition, the contact size distribution was strongly dependent on pad morphology. It was weakly dependent on the applied pressure and the Young's modulus of the pad. Thereafter the dishing phenomenon was modeled using these results. For an arbitrary linewidth, the metal was removed by two groups of pad asperities, one group with contact size smaller than the linewidth (group S) and one with contact size larger than the metal linewidth (group B). By considering the material removal rate of these two groups of asperities separately and using a modified form of Preston's law, a model was developed that describes the dishing during (over) polishing for an arbitrary metal line.
