40|$|Abstract. During {{welding process}} to make joints, {{residual}} stress is inevitably produced and weld metal should be used. These influence the static and dynamic behavior of steel structures with welded joints, such as steel piles. In steel structures, dynamic mechanical behavior is different to static mechanical behavior. Therefore, to accurately predict {{the behavior of}} steel piles with <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint under static-dynamic loading, the research on influence of <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint on the static and dynamic behavior of steel piles is necessary. For that purpose, a rate-dependent plasticity model was used, considering strain rate hardening and temperature rise. In this paper, the distribution of welding residual stress in <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint was computed by using three-dimensional heat conduction analysis and three-dimensional thermal elastic-plastic analysis. The behavior of steel piles with <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint under axial static and dynamic loading was investigated by using three-dimensional elastic-plastic finite element analysis, which employed a rate-dependent plasticity model and included residual stress and mechanical properties of <b>weld</b> metal in <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint. The rate-dependent plasticity model used in this paper is proposed by the authors based on the static-dynamic loading tests. Numerical analysis results of steel piles with <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint were compared to those without <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint. In comparison, the characteristics of static and dynamic behavior of steel piles with <b>a</b> <b>welded</b> joint were investigated...|$|R

A product is affected by quality of <b>welding.</b> <b>A</b> set of evaluation methods for welding operators is pro-posed in this paper, based on a theoretical analysis, to assure the quality of product. A new index using a cat-egorical quantity expression to evaluate the welding performance is proposed. The mathematical relationship of welding performance, number of bad welds and the maximum tolerable number of bad welds are derived. Then, the best estimators and the deviations of this in-dex are statistically inferred. Finally, a procedure and criteria are proposed to evaluate the performance of <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> operator. This evaluation method can be used in decision-making for the selection of <b>a</b> <b>welding</b> operator.
