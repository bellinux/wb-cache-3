5|$|In 2007, the United States Mint began {{releasing}} {{a set of}} half-ounce $10 gold coins under the First Spouse Program with engravings of portraits of the First Ladies on the obverse. When a President served without a spouse, a gold coin is issued that bears an obverse image emblematic of Liberty as depicted on a circulating coin of that era and a <b>reverse</b> <b>image</b> emblematic of themes of that President's life. This {{is true for the}} coins for Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and James Buchanan's First Ladies, but not the coin for Chester A. Arthur's First Lady, which will instead depict suffragette Alice Paul.|$|E

The quadrigatus, produced in large quantity starting around 235 BC, was named after the <b>reverse</b> <b>image</b> of Victory driving a quadriga and was produced for about 2 decades, becoming more and more debased (to as little as 30% silver) during the second Punic war.|$|E

2500|$|The {{vision of}} Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal {{appeared}} to Saint Catherine Labouré in 1830 in the convent of Rue du Bac, Paris. She reported that {{one night in}} the chapel, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to her and asked that a medallion be made to a design that she dictated. The lady added that, [...] "All who wear this medal will receive great graces." [...] After spending two years examining her claims, her priest eventually took the information to his archbishop. The medal eventually produced came {{to be referred to}} as the Miraculous Medal. The front of the medal displays a picture of the virgin as she appeared to Catherine Labouré. The design on the reverse includes the letter M and a cross. Pope John Paul II used a slight variation of the <b>reverse</b> <b>image</b> as his coat of arms, the Marian Cross. This is a plain cross with an M underneath the right-hand bar, to signify the Blessed Virgin standing {{at the foot of the}} Cross while Jesus was being crucified.|$|E

5000|$|A flipped <b>image</b> or <b>reversed</b> <b>image,</b> {{the more}} formal term, is a static or moving image that is {{generated}} by a mirror-reversal of an original across a horizontal axis (a flopped image is mirrored across the vertical axis). [...] Many printmaking techniques produce images where the printed copy is <b>reversed</b> from the <b>image</b> made on the printing plate, so in a print copying another image, or a real scene or object, unless the artist deliberately creates the plate as a mirror-image of his subject, the finished print will be {{a mirror image of}} it. Many print makers developed the skill of <b>reversing</b> <b>images</b> when making printing plates, but many prints, especially early ones, have <b>images</b> that are <b>reversed.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>image</b> {{search is}} a {{content-based}} image retrieval (CBIR) query technique that involves providing the CBIR {{system with a}} sample image that it will then base its search upon; in terms of information retrieval, the sample image is what formulates a search query. In particular, <b>reverse</b> <b>image</b> search {{is characterized by a}} lack of search terms. This effectively removes the need for a user to guess at keywords or terms {{that may or may not}} return a correct result. <b>Reverse</b> <b>image</b> search also allows users to discover content that is related to a specific sample image, [...] popularity of an image, and discover manipulated versions and derivative works.|$|E
