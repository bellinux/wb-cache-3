40|$|<b>Resumes</b> are an {{extraordinarily}} {{important part of}} the job search process. Successful job candidates take the time to figure out the best way to market their skills and experience on paper. If you are submitting <b>resumes</b> but not getting called for interviews, perhaps your <b>resume</b> needs a makeover. PURPOSE The purpose of the <b>resume</b> is to demonstrate your value to potential employers outside academia so they will invite you to interview. The <b>resume</b> is a marketing piece, not a history piece. Your <b>resume</b> should focus on the skills and experiences you have that are related to the job description and company mission because many employers electronically scan <b>resumes</b> for skill words used in the job description and eliminate <b>resumes</b> lacking those words. Tailor your <b>resume</b> for each job description or type of position because employers know and dislike when candidates send a generic version of their <b>resume</b> to dozens of job postings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{enterprises}} and multinational companies receive thousands of <b>resumes</b> {{from the job}} seekers during this Internet era. Currently available filtering techniques and search services provide the recruiters to filter thousands of <b>resumes</b> to few hundred potential ones. It is difficult to identify the potential <b>resumes</b> by examining each <b>resume,</b> since these filtered <b>resumes</b> are similar to each other. We are investigating the {{issues related to the}} development of approaches to improve the performance of <b>resume</b> selection process. We have extended the concept of special features and also proposed an approach to identify <b>resumes</b> with special skills. In the literature, the concepts of special features have been applied to improve the process of candidate selection in E-commerce environment. As <b>resumes</b> contain unformatted text or semi-formatted text, extending the concept of special features for the development of approach to process <b>resumes</b> is a complex task. Only skills related formation of the <b>resumes</b> is obtained by considering this system approach. The experimental results of the real world set of <b>resumes</b> show that the proposed approach has the potential to improve the process of <b>resume</b> selection. An effective way of an approach for extraction of information from the <b>resumes</b> is achieved by the system. It supports routing and management of <b>resumes</b> automatically. The framework of an IE gives the extraction process of <b>resumes</b> along with the required information regarding the algorithms related with this extraction. The overall objective of the study is to provide the required information about the skills and experience to human resource system. This system provides the <b>resumes</b> to be extracted in a structured format for the semantic web approach...|$|R
50|$|Another {{consideration}} for electronic <b>résumé</b> documents {{is that they}} are parsed with natural language processors. <b>Resume</b> parsers may correctly interpret some parts of the content of the <b>résumé</b> but not other parts.

An online survey method of data collection was used during which participants constructed a <b>resume</b> and filled out various measures pertaining to individual difference and <b>resume</b> misrepresentation. The results of this study provide an initial understanding of the existing categories of <b>resume</b> misrepresentations and the extent to which participants misrepresent.

40|$|A <b>resume</b> is a brief, concise {{document}} that presents, and effectively sells, your most relevant and positive credentials for employment, admission to graduate school, consideration for a scholarship or fellowship, or other professional purpose.

Preparation One-page <b>resumes</b> are preferred for most entry-level positions. Two-page <b>resumes</b> are acceptable if the information on both pages demonstrates the skills and/or experience relevant to your profession. <b>Resumes</b> should highlight skills and accomplishments that meet employer qualifications, excluding irrelevant information and experiences. Well-designed <b>resumes</b> will be visually appealing and free from any spelling, typographical, punctuation, or grammatical errors. All <b>resumes</b> should be written concisely in an organized format that presents the most important information first.
