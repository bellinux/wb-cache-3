40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 181 - 188. xiv, 188 l illus., tablesOne way {{in which}} the {{tropical}} world can surpass the temperate regions in food and fiber production is to employ a system of continuous cropping. In tropical Asia for example large areas of paddy land remain idle during the dry season owing to a lack of water and inability of the farmers to obtain adequate soil tilth. When the water resources of these areas are fully developed soil tilth will become a limiting factor for implementing a system continuous cropping. In Southeast Asia alone 27 to 54 million hectares of additional land area can be planted to crops if the problem of water and soil tilth can be solved. This dissertation concerns itself with the problem of <b>regenerating</b> <b>soil</b> structure in paddy soils so that crops other than rice can be grown on these lands. It focuses its attention on the problem of obtaining adequate tilth so that non-paddy crops might be grown as a second, third or even fourth crop on an annual basis. In this study paddy soils are viewed as rheological bodies which behave viscously in the puddled and saturated state, plastically in the moist state and elastically in its driest state. Since this dissertation concerns itself with the physics of drained paddy soils the Hookian or elastic model finds the widest application. Procedures for obtaining elastic constants from sound velocity measurements are described. Physical models are employed to describe shrinking, strengthening and ultimate cracking in drying paddy soils. An attempt is made to explain how and why soil material breaks down into aggregates. Stress-strain relations in drying paddy soils are discussed and the resultant rupture at critical stresses is described by several failure criteria.

50|$|Monoculture is a {{style of}} {{agriculture}} where only one type of crop is harvested in a field season after season. This depletes nutrients from the soil because each type of plant has {{a specific set of}} nutrients that it need to grow or can replace back into the soil. With a lack of plant diversity, only certain nutrients will be absorbed, leaving none of those in the soil, and only certain others will be returned into the land, leaving large gaps in the richness required to maintain a healthy level of production. Permaculture and holistic management are two different methods that focus on increasing biomass and returning nutrient richness and diversity to the soil. The more biomass that is present in an ongoing cycle, the more carbon that can be sequestered into the soil and that can be converted into oxygen by plant matter. To accomplish these goals, permaculture encourages the idea of planting more than one crop on a piece of land at a time. Any combination of plants that are chosen to grow together in a permaculture garden or farm would help the other plants be more healthy and grow as well. In permaculture design, each individual aspect of a farm would help other aspects attain the necessary nutrients and conditions to be as plentiful as possible. This helps to <b>regenerate</b> <b>soil</b> health because the diversity of the crops and even livestock used would help maintain a balance of all necessary nutrients, including carbon. Holistic management focuses mainly onn increasing biomass through the carefully planned grazing of livestock. The idea behind holistic management is that grazing livestock can actually help improve the growing conditions for more biomass through means such as naturally fertilizing the land and tilling with hooves.|$|R

40|$|Soil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} natural resource for life on Earth and provides important ecosystem services, such as food production, carbon sequestration, water regulation and contaminant attenuation. Soil quality, defined as the soil’s ability to provide these services, is drastically reduced in many locations and regions worldwide due to human activities. This loss in soil quality ultimately leads to soil degradation, erosion and desertification, imposing a severe and increasing risk for the growing human population. It is therefore essential that we are aware of the importance of protecting soil, and at the same time understand processes that build up and <b>regenerate</b> <b>soil.</b> The key objective of the present study was to obtain a better understanding of soil food web structure and functioning, and how these develop in stages along the soil life cycle. Using field surveys, I investigated the soil food web structure and functioning in different sites along the soil life cycle, including soils developing in glacial chronosequences, productive soils under different land use and management, and soils under risk of degradation. The soil food web was expected to build up in biomass and structure, be highest in the intermediate soils, and decrease in soils at or nearby degradation. This was indeed the case when comparing developing soils in the chronosequences, and comparing productive soils with degrading soils. But also land use type turned out to be very important for the structure of the soil food web. Biological measures such as biomass, activity and diversity of soil organisms, especially that of soil microarthropods, were found to be indicative for soil quality in all sites. I also investigated the possible role of soil organisms in the soil ecosystem functioning, in terms of soil structure formation and C and N mineralisation. Although soil organisms are known to have an important role on soil structure formation, no clear indications of such a role were found for that function in the studied sites. However, soil microbial biomass and activity, and the biomass of other trophic groups, did play a crucial role in soil ecosystem process rates, especially the C and N mineralisation rates. In conclusion, I have found that soil food webs assemble in a directive manner: organism biomass and activity increase with soil productivity. In productive soils, land use type and land management are the main drivers affecting soil food web structure and functioning, although this effect is limited to the topsoil. Under harsh conditions, soil organisms reach a relatively low biomass and are sensitive to aspects of intensive agricultural land use...|$|R

Under these conditions, vegetation cover in areas having degraded soils may be better sustained if the soil is amended with an external source of organic matter. The addition of organic materials to soils also increases inﬁltration rates and reduces erosion rates; these factors contribute to an available water increment and a successful and sustainable land management. The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of various organic amendments on the aggregate stability of soils in afforested plots. An experimental paired-plot layout was established in southern of Spain (homogeneous slope gradient: 7. 5 %; aspect: N 170). Five amendments were applied in an experimental set of plots: straw mulching; mulch with chipped branches of Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis L.); TerraCotten hydroabsobent polymers; sewage sludge; sheep manure and control. Plots were afforested following the same spatial pattern, and amendments were mixed with the soil at the rate 10 Mg ha- 1. The vegetation was planted in a grid pattern with 0. 5 m between plants in each plot. During the afforestation process the soil was tilled to 25 cm depth from the surface. Soil from the afforested plots was sampled in: i) 6 months post-afforestation; ii) 12 months post-afforestation; iii) 18 months post-afforestation; and iv) 24 months post-afforestation. The sampling strategy for each plot involved collection of 4 disturbed soil samples taken from the surface (0 – 10 cm depth). The stability of aggregates was measured by wet-sieving. Regarding to soil aggregate stability, the percentage of stable aggregates has increased slightly in all the treatments in relation to control. Speciﬁcally, the differences were recorded in the fraction of macroaggregates (≥ 0. 250 mm). The largest increases have been associated with straw mulch, pinus mulch and sludge. Similar results have been registered for the soil organic carbon content. Independent of the soil management, after six months, no signiﬁcant differences in microaggregates were found regarding to the control plots. These results showed an increase in the stability of the macroaggregates when soil is amended with sludge, pinus mulch and straw much. This fact has been due to an increase in the number cementing agents due to: (i) the application of pinus, straw and sludge had resulted in the release of carbohydrates to the soil; and thus (ii) it has favored the development of a protective vegetation cover, which has increased the number of roots in the soil and the organic contribution to it.

This paper reports the vertical extent of metal and PAH contamination in the soil of seven source-control devices in operation for more than 10 years, assessed via a two-step sampling strategy to optimize the representativeness of the contamination profiles. Metal distribution was typically characterized by a significant surface buildup, followed by a decrease in concentrations with increasing depth, usually coming close to the background values. PAH were more heterogeneously distributed with depth, but their accumulation was globally restricted to the upper 10 - 40 cm. This indicates an interesting potential for pollution interception by the upper horizons of soil, but does not necessarily prevent from downward fluxes, even while measuring low surface contents, as deeper strata may have lesser retention capacities.

The seedlings were divided into three groups according to their regeneration substrates: moderately decayed dead wood (DWm); severely decayed dead wood (DWs) and soil (S). The results showed that there were significant differences in leaf mass per area (LMA), photosynthetic capacity, non-structural carbohydrate composition (NSC), leaf phosphorus (P) concentration, carbon isotope composition (delta C- 13) and ultrastructural morphology, not only between the seedlings <b>regenerated</b> in <b>soil</b> and on dead wood, but also between the seedlings regenerated on dead wood of different decaying stages.

In Mediterranean areas, after a forestry proposal, it is highly common to register a signiﬁcant number of losses for the saplings that have been introduced due to the lack of rainfall. When no vegetation is established, organic amendments can be used to rapidly protect the soil surface against the erosive forces of rain and runoff. In this study we investigated the hydrological effects of ﬁve soil treatments in relation to the temporal vari- ability of the available water for plants. Five amendments were applied in an experimental set of plots: straw mulching; mulch with chipped branches of Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis L.); TerraCotten hydroabsobent polymers; sewage sludge; sheep manure and control. Plots were afforested following the same spatial pattern, and amendments were mixed with the soil at the rate 10 Mg ha- 1. In control plots, during June, July, August and September, soils were registered below the wilting point, and therefore, in the area of water unusable by plants. These months were coinciding with the summer mediter- ranean drought. This fact justiﬁes the high mortality found on plants after the seeding plan. Similarly, soils have never exceeded the ﬁeld capacity value measured for control plots. Conversely, in the straw and pinus mulch, soils were above the wilting point during a longer time than in control plots. Thus, the soil moisture only has stayed below the 4. 2 pF suction in July, July and August. Regarding the amount of water available was also higher, especially in the months of December, January and February. However, the ﬁeld capacity value measured has not showed any differences regarding the control. For these treatments, the survival sapling rates measured were the highest. Sludge, manure and polymers showed a moisture retention capacity slightly more limited than straw and pinus mulch. Likewise, it has been found that the area of usable water by plants was also lower, especially during the months of January and February. This situation is especially sharpened in plots amended with manure. In this treatment, the upper part of the soil proﬁle was below the wilting point for six months a year (from April to August). For this treatment, the survival sapling rates measured were the lowest. In conclusion, from a land management standpoint, the pinus and straw mulch treatments have been shown as effective methods reducing water stress for plants. In this research, mulching has been proved as a signiﬁcant method to reduce the mortality sapling rates during the mediterranean summer drought. Universidad de Málaga.

We studied an 800, 000 -ha section of a threatened ecoregion in southeastern Australia. Conventional management in the region involves continuous livestock grazing with few rest periods and regular fertilizer application.

Under conventional management, across the region, millions of hectares of land currently supporting {{tens of millions of}} trees will be treeless within decades from now. This would have severe negative ramifications for biodiversity and key ecosystem services, including water infiltration and shade provision for livestock.

In addition, trees were more likely to <b>regenerate</b> where <b>soil</b> nutrient levels were low.

In Manto- Danchame micro-watershed, the land was naturally rock in lower watershed, but has now extended by an additional 50 meters uphill in past about 40  years. The land was owned by private called ‘keberite’c during Imperial government but since Dergue government it has been communal land and the forest has been removed creating gully and land dissection consequences. In line with these observations, other studies also reported that land ownership has influence on soil conservation and its management (Gebremedhin and Swinton 2003; Bewket 2006). Land ownership and tenure influence motivation of land owner on watershed management (Rosenberg and Margerum 2008; Teshome et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Kilinochchi is {{the largest}} agrarian region found in Sri Lanka. It {{is an area that}} has been greatly {{affected}} by three decades of civil war, which led to the mass disruption of lives and livelihoods within this region. It is estimated that over 300 000 individuals were displaced during the years of war, and returning only now to their places of origin. Inadequate land policies along with the lack of transparency relating to land administration have made inhabitants within the Kilinochchi district apprehensive about their land ownership, and the security of their livelihoods. Farming is the dominant form of livelihood within Kilinochchi. Farmers in this region primarily cultivated paddy fields using extensive amounts of mineral fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. Usage of agrochemicals deviates from their traditional forms of cultivation prior to the onset of conflict between the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan army. This extensive use of agrochemicals within the region coupled with severe droughts has contributed to the loss of nutrient resources in the soil, and has diminished food security within the region. Sustainable land-use systems such as agroforestry can help to decrease farmer dependency on agrochemicals for bountiful harvests, improve soil fertility and soil water retention, and also increase food security within rural communities found in the district. This study conducted a baseline survey to determine soil physical and chemical properties in order to implement agroforestry systems in Kilinochchi’s dry zone climate. Implementation of the recommended agroforestry model is an attempt to enhance livelihoods and food security for resource-poor farmers and their families living in the region. The results indicated that the soils within the research site were low in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, organic matter, and have near neutral to alkaline soils, and slightly compacted soils, which signify low levels of fertility. The vegetation survey indicated only 17 tree species existed on the research site. The low number of tree species at the research site is evidence of the massive deforestation events that occurred during three decades of civil war. In addition, a qualitative study was conducted with farmers living on land surrounding the research site in the villages of Kanakambikaikulam, Thiruvaiyaar, Bharathipuram, and Malaiyaalapuram. The interviews revealed a wide variety of factors and constraints that affected land management practices and strained farmers’ livelihoods, all of which impacted food security in Kilinochchi. These constraints included limited or no access to agricultural inputs (seeds and capital), lack of land tenure, water scarcity and poor soil fertility, inability to hire laborers due to monetary limitations, inaccessible markets, and external exports competing with local markets. There is presently no available information on the potential of agroforestry practices to ensure long-term food security within the region of Kilinochchi. There is also very little knowledge about integrating the rich traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of the farmers with agroforestry practices. The collected data aims to fill these gaps in knowledge. Essentially, the results from the baseline soil survey will be used to design a model agroforestry system as a recommendation to help <b>regenerate</b> <b>soil</b> fertility, and help farmers create sustainable agro-ecosystem management plans. The model agroforestry system will be designed to increase crop yield without compromising the integrity of the agricultural fields for long-term food security and livelihoods in Kilinochchi, Sri Lanka...|$|R
