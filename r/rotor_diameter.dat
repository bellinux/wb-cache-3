40|$|Large wind {{turbines}} can generate both broad band and impulsive noises. These noises {{can be controlled}} by proper choice of rotor design parameters such as rotor location {{with respect to the}} supporting tower, tower geometry and tip speed. A method was developed to calculate the impulsive noise generated when the wind turbine blade experiences air forces that are periodic functions of the rotational frequency.

40|$|Journal articleThe {{economic}} viability of tidal turbines {{will require the}} deployment of multiple devices in array formations in a manner analogous to wind farms. This research investigates {{the effects of the}} configuration of a tidal turbine array, specifically the turbine spacing and capacity, on the hydro-environmental impacts of the array. The hydrodynamic regime of the Shannon Estuary, a highly energetic estuary on the west coast of Ireland, was simulated using a depth integrated 2 D hydro-environmental model. The numerical model was modified to incorporate the mechanics of energy extraction using linear momentum actuator disc theory and the impacts of a multiple device array were simulated. Three different array configurations were examined with turbine spacings of 0. 5, 2 and 5 <b>rotor</b> <b>diameters.</b> The model results demonstrate that flows are attenuated inside the array and accelerated around the array. Water levels are also affected with a reduction in tidal range within, and upstream of, the array and a delay in high and low tides upstream of the array.
