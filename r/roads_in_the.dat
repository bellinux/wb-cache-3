5|$|Like {{several other}} roads that cross the Pennines, Snake Pass has a poor {{accident}} record compared with <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK generally, although more favourable {{compared with other}} <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. It is regularly closed in winter because of snow, and has seen several longer-term closures owing to subsidence following heavy rain. The road remains a popular route for tourists and motorcycles, however, and sections {{have been used for}} semi-professional cycling races such as the Tour of Britain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Twomile Run {{watershed}} include Two Mile Run Road. There {{are between}} 15 and 20 stream crossings in the stream's watershed.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with several}} other <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Highlands, the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe has been {{installed}} with permanent gates that are closed {{in the event of}} severe weather. These gates are now fitted with fibre-optic illuminated signs. The road has been identified as one of several trunk <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Highlands that suffers from problems with deer-vehicle collisions. In 1996, Transport Scotland set up a number of vehicle activated warning signs alerting drivers attention to nearby deer. Four of these signs are on the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe.|$|E

5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a road crossing the Pennines, Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits. Like many <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North of England passing through similar terrain, Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom {{but it is not}} as dangerous as other roads bisecting hilly terrain in this part of England. It was not among the top 10 in a list of the most dangerous roads published in July 2010, despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages, travel by sea was an {{important}} transport corridor. Richard Tylman (or Tillman), mayor in 1581, expanded the port at Faversham, building two wharfs. He became {{a key figure in}} exporting corn, wheat and malt to London from the town.|$|E

5|$|In the aftermath, {{air rescue}} {{operations}} were conducted, but {{the destruction of}} <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area hindered convoys carrying aid. Planes also made supply drops, but rescue operations were hindered by broken roads and rails. Survivors were vaccinated against typhoid and tetanus. Part of Manzanillo was placed under quarantine.|$|E

The main roads in western Juniata County are U.S. Route 22/U.S. Route 322, Pennsylvania Route 74, Pennsylvania Route 850, and Pennsylvania Route 333.

5|$|There are {{no state}} roads and {{virtually}} no township <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed of Hammersley Fork. However, there are dirt roads and gravel roads, and several stream crossings in the watershed.

Industrial activities such as logging were common in the watershed in the early 20th century, but there is currently virtually no such activity there. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream throughout its entire length. Most of the creek has a substantial riparian buffer.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} 17people, {{initially}} considered missing, rode {{out the storm}} on the offshore Mackerel Island. Onshore, officials closed a portion of Highway 1 {{as well as other}} <b>roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Ahead of the storm, hundreds of residents in older structures and mobile homes, as well as an aborigine village near Onslow, were ordered to evacuate to safer locations. Five iron mines were closed during the storm's passage, forcing the 1,500workers to return home. The disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000tonnes of lost production. About 800,000barrels of lost oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms. Oil fields reopened by 14April.|$|E
5|$|As {{the revolutionary}} {{disturbances}} in, and friction between, Haiti and the Dominican Republic continued apace, De Soto {{returned to the}} West Indies in June, arriving at Port-au-Prince on the 19th. The steamer also patrolled in the Gulf of Mexico, {{with an eye on}} the unsettled conditions in Mexico, where a guerrilla war raged against the French occupation of the country. De Soto remained in the region {{through the rest of the}} year before returning to Hampton <b>Roads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 1867.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, {{the section}} of highway south of Kalamazoo was named part of the Colgrove Highway.

Colgrove was also the Barry County prosecutor and a state senator in the late 19th century. No maps documents the name, although the original law remains in records. The Michigan Legislature proposed a bill in 2000 that would have repealed the 1921 statute naming the Colgrove Highway, but the bill ultimately faded, sparing the name.|$|E
