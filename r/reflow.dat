Sn-Ag and Sn solder joints were {{formed by the}} <b>reflowed</b> double bumping process, and Sn/In/Sn bump joints were fabricated by the non-reflowed double bump bonding process. The height-to-size ratios of 0. 78 and 0. 65 were obtained for the <b>reflowed</b> double bumping and the non-reflowed bumping, respectively. Average contact resistance of the <b>reflowed</b> Sn-Ag and Sn solder joints was about 13 mΩ which was much lower than 24 ~ 33 mΩ of the non-reflowed Sn/In/Sn bump joints. The <b>reflowed</b> solder double bumping method is more suitable for flip-chip process of RF-SOP than the non-reflowed double bump bonding...|$|R

25|$|Tin is {{the usual}} main {{structural}} metal of the alloy. It has good strength and wetting. On its own it is prone to tin pest, tin cry, and growth of tin whiskers.

25|$|Virtual {{profiles}} {{are created}} automatically, for both <b>reflow</b> or wave solder machines. An initial recipe setup {{is required for}} modeling purposes, but once completed, profiling can be made virtual. As the system is automatic, profiles can be generated periodically or continuously for each and every assembly. SPC charts along with CpK {{can be used as}} an aid when collecting a mountain of process-related data. Automated profiling systems continuously monitor the process and create profiles for each assembly. As barcoding becomes more common with both <b>reflow</b> and wave processes, the two technologies can be combined for profiling traceability, allowing each generated profile to be searchable by barcode. This is useful when an assembly is questioned at some time in the future. As a profile is created for each assembly, a quick search using the PCB’s barcode can pull up the profile in question and provide evidence that the component was processed in spec. Additionally, tighter process control can be achieved when combining automated profiling with barcoding, such as confirming that the correct process has been input by the operator before launching a production run.|$|E
40|$|The {{shear stress}} induced by {{soldering}} for the interconnection of silicon solar cells {{can lead to}} increased micro cracks and decrease manufacturing yields for thinner cells. Concerns remain in transitioning to copper (Cu) metallisation to reduce silver consumption regarding the reliability of using soldered interconnection to Cu-plated cells. This thesis investigates the electrochemical deposition of eutectic tin (Sn) - bismuth (Bi) alloy and describes three applications of the plated alloy for the interconnection of silicon solar cells. In the first application, it is shown that by controlling the plating current density, eutectic Sn-Bi alloy can be deposited from an electrolyte containing both Sn and Bi ions on Cu interconnection tabs {{as a substitute for}} Sn-lead solder. <b>Reflowing</b> the alloy after plating can improve the bonding strength with an average force of 1. 26 N/mm being measured in a pull test of two bonded Cu tabs where the plated Sn-Bi was <b>reflowed</b> on a hotplate at 200 C and then bonded at 180 C with quenching in ethylene glycol for fast cooling. The second application involves the deposition of eutectic Sn-Bi alloy on n-type and p-type Cu contacts of laser-doped selective-emitter cells using light-induced and field-induced plating, respectively. The importance of uniformly <b>reflowing</b> the alloy after plating is demonstrated, with cells having plated Sn-Bi alloy and interconnected using Smart Wire Connection Technology (with Sn-silver coated wires) experiencing a power loss of 10 % after 140 thermal cycles if the alloy was <b>reflowed</b> before lamination and 51 % if the alloy was not <b>reflowed.</b> In the third application, the use of plated Sn-Bi is proposed to provide bonding for a backsheet metallisation scheme in which an inkjet-patterned seed layer was plated with Cu and eutectic Sn-Bi alloy to enable bonding to cells. The tapered height of plated Cu is advantageous in reducing the Cu usage for back contact cells. This thesis demonstrates the future potential of plated Sn-Bi alloy to enable cost-effective interconnection of silicon solar cells in a range of different ways. It also highlights the importance of developing methods to accurately characterise the plated alloy composition and uniformly <b>reflowing</b> the alloy before bonding...|$|R

(All non-solid electrolytic capacitors needs a recovery time of some hours after soldering before measuring the leakage current. Non-solid chip capacitors need a recovery time after <b>reflow</b> soldering of about 24 hours.) Leakage current is reduced by applying operational voltage by self-healing processes.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports an {{improved}} method for fabricating CMUT array using nickel electroplating over <b>reflowed</b> photoresist. Previously, a CMUT array using nickel on glass process {{which is used}} Doppler velocity sensor is reported [1]. The reported device use TI/Cu as sacrificial layer and nickel electroplating to form the membrane. In the newly reported CMUT, we use nickel electroplating over <b>reflowed</b> photoresist to form the membrane, and the cavity is formed by removing the <b>reflowed</b> photoresist sacrificial layer with acetone via the pre-formed released hole through the nickel membrane. The new device fabricated showed the advantage of having the membrane in a convex shape in terms of higher sensitivity [2]. A convex membrane can reduce the gap distance on the membrane edge to increase the effective capacitance. As a result, comparing the particular device reported with nickel on glass process which operates at 180 kHz for low frequency application, the preliminary experimental result of the newly reported device shows a resonant frequency at around 7. 7 MHz by using an impedance analyzer.

25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the transient heat of <b>reflow</b> soldering induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in Surface Mounted Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|E
