40|$|Encapsulation is a nonspecific, {{cellular}} response {{through which}} insects {{defend themselves against}} multicellular pathogens. During this immune reaction, haemocytes recognize an object as foreign and cause other haemocytes to aggregate and form a capsule around the object, often consisting of melanized cells. The process of melanisation is accompanied by the formation of potentially toxic reactive oxygen species, which can kill not only pathogens but also host cells. In this study we tested whether the encapsulation response is costly in mealworm beetles Tenebrio molitor. We found a negative relationship between the duration of implantation via a nylon monofilament and <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> We also found a negative relationship between the strength of immune response and <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> suggesting that cellular immunity is costly in T. molitor, {{and that there is}} a trade-off between immune response and <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> However, this relationship disappeared at 31 - 32 hours of implantation at 25 ± 2 ℃. As the disappearance of a relationship between duration of implantation and lifespan coincided with the highest values of encapsulation response, we concluded that the beetles stopped investment in the production of melanotic cells, as the implant, a synthetic parasite, was fully isolated from the host’s tissues [Current Zoology 59 (3) : 340 – 346, 2013]...|$|E
40|$|Without {{doubt the}} need to give a founded {{estimation}} of the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> is needed. In the NEN 8700 and 8701 and the guideline of Rijkswaterstaat (RBK) a way to determine the structural reliability is given. The corresponding estimate of the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> is based on but not equal to the suggested reference period of the loads. These can vary from 1 to 50 years. The main objective is to calculate the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> The {{idea is that the}} reliability index decreases and the failure probability increases in time. Deteriorating materials and changing loads are the main reason for this. To find the reliability index full probabilistic models are a possibility. For these calculations a lot of parameter input is required and the calculations are often difficult, time consuming or need specialised software. As an alternative the Eurocode and also SBRCUR 186 give partial safety factors to make reliability-calculations without the need of actual probabilistic computations. As a start the quay wall is assessed by simplified hand calculations to find the most critical failure mechanisms and other aspects, such as input parameters. Information that {{can be found in the}} archive of the municipality of Dordrecht is used as first input. The second step is to find a more detailed way to model the structural reaction of the loads. It is chosen to use Plaxis. A strutting wall and the large amount of piles in combination with a small retaining screen make it necessary to use a 3 D model. The computation time is extensive and therefore a 2 D model was made. This model is calibrated on the 3 D model by means of the critical aspects in the construction, which were found in the hand calculations. With the 2 D model it is possible to make a large amount of computations to estimate the sensitivity on certain scenarios within a limited time span. The fact that there are many unknowns makes this useful and even inevitable. The reliability indices follow from a given set of partial safety factors for which the construction passes all unity checks. By analysing the fault tree the reliability index is found in more detail. Each failure mechanism is investigated separately to calculate the overall reliability index without making any probabilistic computations. By extrapolating the indices from the time of construction via the present condition to the crossing with the required reliability the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> is found. At the time of computing there were no inspection results available. The information that was used resulted in an unsafe structure. By improving the soil retaining screen and a complete inspection the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> could be 40 years and 33 years for the unfavourable scenarios. The scenarios are based on soil mechanical reactions on an overly dredged port basin, an extreme ground water level and pile geometry. Some main remarks are placed with this method: *The consequence class is assumed to be 1. *The extrapolation of the reliability indices is assumed to be linear. *The Eurocode is used to assess the strength and some of the old building materials that are not used anymore (smooth reinforcement steel) are not treated in detail in the codes. *It is assumed that the partial safety factors in SBRCUR 186 are calculated in a similar way as CUR 211 and CUR 166, on which it was based. This is the way how the importance of the different failure mechanisms, as parts of the total (6. 25), is determined. *The use of different guidelines that were not meant to be used together in this manner makes that the error of the method is estimated to be 50 %. The partial safety factors have an error of 0. 05 to 0. 10 in 1, resulting in an error of the reliability index of approximately 10 %. Due to the extrapolation the error increases to 50 % and even 100 % taking into account modelling errors. This is shown by a grey band in the graph. As a direct result the main recommendations are given to be: *The retaining screen has to be improved and the relieving floor has to be inspected or the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> is 0 and the quay should be replaced. *Redo the calculations using inspection results and make detailed calculation after inspections. *In a few years the quay wall should be assessed again to find a new reliability index. A third point on the line to extrapolate should give more insight to the distribution. Alternatively one could predict the material properties to predict a future reliability index. Challenges with the reference period could arise. *The Eurocode, or a part in the specialised NEN 8700 series should give calculation rules for common old building materials. *SBRCUR 186 should give the fault tree and parts of the total reliability index for each of the failure mechanisms to make calculations for all the given main types of quay walls possible. As a result the background of the given partial safety factors, which are sometimes counterintuitive, is also known in more detail. *An experienced engineer could be able to fit the uncertainties into scenarios. The large errors and scenarios give a wide range of the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> A detailed inspection to the general outline, state and the material properties of the structure should be done beforehand. *More quay walls should be assessed to validate the usefulness of the presented method.

40|$|Military spending, fatalities, and the {{destruction}} of capital, all of which are immediately felt and are often large, are the most overt costs of war. They are also relatively short-lived. The costs of war borne by combatants and their caretakers, which includes families, communities, and the modern welfare state, tend instead to be lifelong. In this paper I show that a significant component of the public costs associated with U. S. wars are long-lived. One third to one half of the total present value of historical war costs have been absorbed by benefits distributed over the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> of veterans and their dependents. The half-life of these benefits has averaged more than 30 years following the end of hostilities.

In many societies encouraging building owners to involve in an EER programs with high investment cost is not so convenient, especially for rental buildings even this can be impossible. Also one of big challenges to reach to the goals of Horizon 2020 of EU is to provide appropriate financing options to EER of existing buildings. Moreover, as stated by Energy Efficient Directive (EED) of EU "the rate of building renovation needs to be increased, as the existing building stock represents the single biggest potential sector for energy savings", using low investment cost measures could reduce necessity to extra financing sources for such renovations and can be encouraging for buildings owners and tenants. At the first glimpse the main disadvantage for low investment renovations is the less amount of energy saving that can be provided for buildings. But by narrow focus on the subject, {{it can be found}} that although the amount of energy saving for this kind of renovations in case of a building is lower than cost optimal level and advanced renovations level, they can be applied to huge amount of buildings conveniently, hence, provide societies with huge amount of energy saving in less possible time.

40|$|UnrestrictedLife span is {{currently}} the best measure of aging rate in Drosophila (and other organisms), however death as an assay endpoint is problematic for two reasons: (i) {{it takes a long}} time to measure and makes for slow experiments, and (ii) death of the animal precludes a number of interesting assays and experiments. One goal of the aging field has been to identify aging "biomarkers", i. e. an easily measured indicator of aging that could be used instead of life span. Reliable biomarkers have the potential to greatly increase the pace and scope of aging research in Drosophila and other organisms, and would have medical implications in humans. We have identified transgenic reporter constructs that appear promising as aging biomarkers. Innate immune response gene promoters linked to GFP were assayed longitudinally in individual aging flies and found to be partially predictive for <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Heat shock protein genes also appear to be promising as biomarkers of aging. Both hsp 70 and hsp 22 are induced during aging in tissue- and temporal-specific patterns. hsp 22 and hsp 70 promoters linked to GFP were assayed under different conditions including normal aging, heat stress and pure oxygen atmosphere. Both hsp-GFP reporters were partially predictive of <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> under normal aging and stress conditions. The hsp-GFP reporters were also tested in a real-time video tracking system which allowed us to quantify GFP expression and fly activity simultaneously. hsp 70 and hsp 22 gene reporters were induced during fly aging in circadian patterns (24 hr and 18 hr periods, respectively), and spiked several hours prior to death of the animal. In conclusion, both immune peptide-GFP and hsp-GFP reporters are promising biomarkers of aging.

Bacteremia onset occurs several days after inoculation by a synchronous wave of bacterial invasion into mature erythrocytes. Intracellular bacteria replicate until reaching a stagnant number, which is sustained for the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of the infected erythrocyte. The initial wave of erythrocyte infection is followed by reinfection waves occurring at intervals of several days. Our findings unravel a unique bacterial persistence strategy adapted to a nonhemolytic intracellular colonization of erythrocytes that preserves the pathogen for efficient transmission by blood-sucking arthropods.

40|$|International audienceSir 2 is a conserved deacetylase that modulates <b>life</b> <b>span</b> in yeast, worms, {{and flies}} and stress {{response}} in mammals. In yeast, Sir 2 {{is required for}} maintaining replicative <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> and increasing Sir 2 dosage can delay replicative aging. We address the role of Sir 2 in regulating chronological <b>life</b> <b>span</b> in yeast. Lack of Sir 2 along with calorie restriction and/or mutations in the yeast AKT homolog, Sch 9, or Ras pathways causes a dramatic chronological life-span extension. Inactivation of Sir 2 causes uptake and catabolism of ethanol and upregulation of many stress-resistance and sporulation genes. These changes while suffi- cient to extend chronological <b>life</b> <b>span</b> in wild-type yeast require severe calorie restriction or additional mutations to extend <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of sir 2 D mutants. Our results demonstrate that effects of SIR 2 on chrono- logical <b>life</b> <b>span</b> are opposite to replicatve <b>life</b> <b>span</b> and suggest that the relevant activities of Sir 2 -like deacetylases may also be complex in higher eu- karyotes...|$|R

40|$|Already today, a {{huge number}} of bridges are in an ailing {{condition}} due to their increasing age and due to an increased traffic volume, especially of heavy transport vehicles. To assess their load bearing capacity and subsequently predict their <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> every bridge needs to be analysed by con-dition assessment. The consequences of unreliable condition assessment should not be underestimated, as most bridge constructions constitute cost intensive and indispensable infrastructures. Thus, modern condition assessment methods, easy and obvious in their application, are needed in order to reduce future investigations. To offer an easy handling alternative to evaluate the condition of bridges, the Deformation Area Dif-ference Method has been developed. Hereby, the accruing deformation of bridges under a static load will be analysed with the help of modern measurement equipment. Therefore, the resulting defor-mation curves like the deflection, the inclination angle and the curvature curves, will be analysed in one diagram together with the results out of initial measurements or theoretically calculated defor-mation curves. The DAD-Method is then applied on the surface difference area between those two curves for the deflection, the inclination and the curvature. It will be demonstrated that a localisation of damage is possible, independent from the degree of damage. In this study, the applicability of the DAD-Method including the comparison of innovative measure-ment techniques using a laboratory specimen is investigated. For further explanation of the back-ground of the DAD-Method, the results from a FE-calculation are presented...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Presentation date: 1975 - 01 - 29 This {{research}} {{was conducted on the}} life history of the blue chub, Gila (Gila) coerulea (Girard), inhabiting Paulina Lake, Oregon, and the tui chub, Gila (Siphateles) bicolor (Girard), East Lake, Oregon. The results are applied to the fisheries management of these lakes. Both species are endemic to the Klamath River System. Blue chub eggs had an incubation period of 7 to 9 days at 58. 1 °F to 69. 3 °F. Blue chub larvae first appeared in shallow water within spawning areas, remained there until August and then dispersed into all shallow areas of the lake. The juveniles remained dependent on the shallow water until maturity as age III fish. Spawning occurred from early July to mid-August in less than one meter of water and never in direct sunlight. Spawning took place directly adjacent to the shoreline in areas of clean gravel or large rock. The body weightfecundity relationship (R 2 = 0. 935) provides the most useful means of predicting fecundity. The oldest, and largest, blue chub was an age X female (234 mm). Growth rate was greatest in juveniles, decreasing markedly at maturity and gradually diminishing further throughout the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> The least squares regression of length on weight for 895 blue chub (R 2 = 0. 96) was, Log body weight 7 = -L 7129 + 3. 1069 (-Log 25. 4 + Log body length in mm). The blue chub diet consisted mainly of diptera larvae, cladocerans, gastropods, and amphipods, of which diptera larvae, cladocerans, and amphipods were the most preferred food items of Paulina Lake rainbow trout. Blue chub were vitually free of parasites. The osprey and a large dragonfly nymph were the only observed predators on the blue chub, but other possible predators were the rainbow trout, mink and marten. Tui chub eggs incubated in 7 to 8 days at 5 8. 3 oF to 71. 5 °F. Tui chub larvae first appeared within heavily vegetated areas within East Lake, areas which were the most probable spawning sites. They remained there until dispersal in August. Juveniles remained dependent on the vegetation and shallow beach areas until maturing as either age II or age III fish. Spawning most probably occurred in the heavily vegetated areas during mid-June to late July, with deposition of the adhesive eggs on to the vegetation. The ovary weight-fecundity relationship (R 2 = 0. 87 8) provides the most useful means of predicting fecundity. The oldest tui chub was an age IX fema,le (226 mm), The longest (FL) was an age VIII female (249 mm). Growth rate was greatest in juveniles, decreasing significantly at maturity and gradually diminishing further throughout the <b>remaining</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> The least squares regression of length on weight for 940 tui chub (R 2 = 0. 97) was, Log body weight = - 1. 0518 + 2. 8807 (-Log 25. 4 + Log body length in mm). The tui chub diet consisted mainly of amphipods, diptera larvae, gastropods and cladocerans, of which amphipods, diptera larvae and cladocerans were the most preferred food items of East Lake rainbow trout and brook trout.

40|$|Physiological hypoxia {{extends the}} replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of human cells in culture. Here, {{we report that}} hypoxic {{extension}} of replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> is associated {{with an increase in}} mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in primary human lung fibroblasts. The generation of mitochondrial ROS is necessary for hypoxic activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). The hypoxic extension of replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> is ablated by a dominant negative HIF. HIF is sufficient to induce telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA and telomerase activity and to extend replicative <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Furthermore, the down-regulation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein by RNA interference increases HIF activity and extends replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> under normoxia.

This study uses the com-parative method to test evolutionary predictions {{about the origin of}} the response to DR, using data from 10 species of rotifers. Most species, but not all, responded to DR by increasing mean <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> maximum <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> reproductive <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> mortality rate doubling time, and initial mortality rate. Interspecific comparisons did not show the predicted correlations between the strength of the response to DR and either reproductive <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> age of first reproduction, or to-tal reproduction. There was support for the idea that the response to chronic DR is associated with changes in reproductive allocation during short-term periods of starvation: species that re-duced reproduction when starved increased their <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> under DR, whereas species that continued to reproduce when starved decreased their <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> under DR.

40|$|Abstract Background Sexual {{differentiation}} {{often has}} significant effects on <b>life</b> <b>span</b> and aging phenotypes. For example, {{males and females}} of several species have different <b>life</b> <b>spans,</b> and genetic and environmental manipulations that affect <b>life</b> <b>span</b> often have different magnitude of effect in males versus females. Moreover, {{the presence of a}} differentiated germ-line has been shown to affect <b>life</b> <b>span</b> in several species, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Methods Experiments were conducted to determine how alterations in sexual differentiation gene activity might affect the <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila females heterozygous for the tudor[1] mutation produce normal offspring, while their homozygous sisters produce offspring that lack a germ line. To identify additional sexual differentiation genes that might affect <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> the conditional transgenic system Geneswitch was employed, whereby feeding adult flies or developing larvae the drug RU 486 causes the over-expression of selected UAS-transgenes. Results In this study germ-line ablation caused by the maternal tudor[1] mutation was examined in a long-lived genetic background, and was found to increase <b>life</b> <b>span</b> in males but not in females, consistent with previous reports. Fitting the data to a Gompertz-Makeham model indicated that the maternal tudor[1] mutation increases the <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of male progeny by decreasing age-independent mortality. The Geneswitch system was used to screen through several UAS-type and EP-type P element mutations in genes that regulate sexual differentiation, to determine if additional sex-specific effects on <b>life</b> <b>span</b> would be obtained. Conditional over-expression of transformer female isoform (traF) during development produced male adults with inhibited sexual differentiation, however this caused no significant change in <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Over-expression of doublesex female isoform (dsxF) during development was lethal to males, and produced a limited number of female escapers, whereas over-expression of dsxF specifically in adults greatly reduced both male and female <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Similarly, over-expression of fruitless male isoform A (fru-MA) during development was lethal to both males and females, whereas over-expression of fru-MA in adults greatly reduced both male and female <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Conclusion Manipulation of sexual differentiation gene expression specifically in the adult, after morphological sexual differentiation is complete, was still able to affect <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> In addition, by manipulating gene expression during development, it was possible to significantly alter morphological sexual differentiation without a significant effect on adult <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> The data demonstrate that manipulation of sexual differentiation pathway genes either during development or in adults can affect adult <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> </p...|$|R
