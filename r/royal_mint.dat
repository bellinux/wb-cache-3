5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed {{less than a quarter of}} the same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.|$|E
5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint,</b> Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. However, Newton proved equal to the task.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, {{officials}} at the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> planned for new coins, to bear {{the image of her}} son and successor, Edward VII. New coin designs had been introduced in the 1890s, and Mint officials believed the British people wanted as few changes to the coinage as possible. Thus, it was decided not to alter the reverses of the three bronze coins (the penny, halfpenny and farthing), as a new portrait of the Queen had been introduced in 1895. At that time, the Engraver of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint,</b> George William de Saulles, had modified Leonard Charles Wyon's depiction of Britannia on the reverse of the bronze coins—the lighthouse and sailing ship that had flanked her were removed. De Saulles was tasked with creating a depiction of Edward for the King's new coinage. The Mint continued to strike coins depicting Victoria, dated 1901, until the King's coinage was ready in May 1902.|$|E

5|$|In 1841, a new Master of the Mint, William Ewart Gladstone was appointed. Gladstone thought {{highly of}} Pistrucci and corresponded {{with him in}} Italian, but was unwilling to grant him any new {{commissions}} while the Waterloo Medal remained outstanding. By 1844, the continued expense of Pistrucci was a concern to the Audit Office. Gladstone restored cuts in Pistrucci's pay {{that had been made}} for failure to train an apprentice, and offered him a bonus of £400 to complete the medal. Pistrucci was to work solely on the one project. He vacated his home at the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint,</b> moving to Old Windsor, where he set up a workshop to attempt the medal's completion. Although Pistrucci worked constantly on the medal during some periods, he was slowed by a fall in his cottage, which incapacitated him for much of 1846. On 1 January 1849, Pistrucci submitted the matrices of the medal to the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint,</b> and was paid £1,500.|$|E
5|$|Sets of 1d (one penny) to 4d silver coins {{are known}} {{from the time of}} Charles II onwards. However, as there is no record of any {{denomination}} higher than 1d (then struck for circulation in silver) being used in the Maundy gift before 1731, sets from before then are most likely ordinary circulation strikes. At that time, coins used for the Maundy money distribution were indistinguishable from those struck for circulation. It was not until 1752 that coins not struck for circulation were used for the Maundy distribution. At times when little silver was being struck by the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint,</b> the coins distributed might bear a previous year's date. To evade statutory prohibitions on the striking of silver coin during the Napoleonic Wars, all Maundy pieces issued from 1800 to 1815 bear the date 1800, though most were struck later. When the date was finally changed in 1816, after the prohibition ended, the size of the coins was slightly reduced, as the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> increased the amount struck from one troy pound of sterling silver from 62 to 66 shillings of silver coin. The last year in which no Maundy coins were struck was 1821.|$|E
5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E

50|$|On July 8, 1976, <b>Royal</b> Canadian <b>Mint</b> president, Yvon Gariepy {{announced}} that an annual award would be bestowed to the Canadian deemed to have contributed {{the most to}} numismatic education in Canada. The award was {{in the form of}} a sterling silver medal, and would be known as the <b>Royal</b> Canadian <b>Mint</b> Award. It measures 45 mm in diameter and depicts a view of the <b>Royal</b> Canadian <b>Mint</b> building on 320 Sussex Drive in Ottawa. The name of the recipient and the year are engraved on the reverse.

5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{following}} the accession of George V, the florin regained the shields and sceptres design {{it had in}} the late Victorian Era, and kept that motif until 1937, when the national emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme for the remainder of its run, though a new design was used from 1953, {{following the}} accession of Elizabeth II. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> began striking the ten pence piece. The old two shilling piece remained in circulation until the ten pence piece was made smaller, and earlier coins, including the florin, were demonetised.|$|E
5|$|One 1954 penny is known, struck for die-testing {{purposes}} at the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint,</b> {{and intended}} for melting, but recovered from circulation. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the price of metal ensured that every bronze coin was struck at a loss; the Mint hoped for a reduction in size, and the demonetisation of the farthing at the end of 1960 helped clear the way for such a scheme. It was not until 1961 that there was a need for more pennies to be minted, and production continued each year in very large numbers until the final pre-decimal pennies for circulation, dated 1967, were coined.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Pistrucci and William Wyon {{continued into the}} late 1840s, and sometimes featured in the press, contributing to the feeling that all was not well at the Mint. A Royal Commission on reform of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> was appointed in 1848. Pistrucci submitted a report, in which he settled some old scores. The reforms abolished the positions of chief engraver (Wyon died in 1851) and chief medallist, with Pistrucci appointed a modeller and engraver to the Mint, to receive a salary in addition to payment for any work done.|$|E

5|$|Newton {{moved to}} London {{to take up}} the post of warden of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> in 1696, a {{position}} that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat treading on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower (and securing the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his life. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising his power to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.|$|E

5|$|Sir Joseph {{commissioned}} Pistrucci {{to craft}} a cameo of King George III. As the King was ill with porphyria, Pistrucci modelled the likeness from Marchant's three-shilling bank token, and cut it in red jasper for a fee of 50 guineas. Banks showed the cameo to William Wellesley-Pole, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington and the Master of the Mint, who was greatly impressed {{by the quality of}} what he saw. At this time, the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> was preparing to issue new gold and silver coins as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816, and in June of that year, Pole decided to hire Pistrucci to make models in stone for the new coinage that could be converted into steel dies by the Mint's engravers.|$|E
5|$|English {{heraldry}} flourished as {{a working}} art up to around the 17th century, when it assumed a mainly ceremonial role. The Royal Arms of England continued to embody information relating to English history. Although the Acts of Union 1707 placed England within the Kingdom of Great Britain, prompting new, British Royal Arms, the Royal Arms of England are still used occasionally in an official capacity, and has continued to endure {{as one of the}} national symbols of England, and has a variety of active uses. For instance, the coats of arms of both The Football Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board have a design featuring three lions passant, based on the historic Royal Arms of England. In 1997 (and again in 2002), the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> issued a British one pound (£1) coin featuring three lions passant to represent England. To celebrate St George's Day, in 2001, Royal Mail issued first– and second-class postage stamps with the Royal Crest of England (a crowned lion), and the Royal Arms of England (three lions passant) respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had yet to find favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means. The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar, because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|E

5|$|In 1962 Gibb & Partners {{was one of}} two firms chosen (with Coyne et Bellier) by the South African {{government}} to build two dams on the Orange River. The first to be constructed was the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam which was officially opened in March 1972. The second, the P.K. Le Roux Dam, was finished in 1977. Following the success of this project Paton was retained to build a third, smaller dam, the Spioenkop Dam, which was finished in 1972. Paton was also involved with the tunnelling and underground powerhouse for the Drakensberg Pumped Storage Scheme. Paton was retained by the World Bank once more in 1967 to supervise the construction of the Tarbela Dam in Pakistan, which was completed in 1976. He also worked on the modernisation of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> which involved the move from its 600-year home at Tower Hill to Llantrisant in Wales in time for decimalisation in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The Tower of London {{has played}} a {{prominent}} role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint,</b> a public record office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of England. From the early 14thcentury until the reign of CharlesII, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower {{is in charge of the}} castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the castle was the prison of the Princes in the Tower. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} sejm of 1632 eventually {{concluded in}} the election of Władysław; he had no serious other contenders. The decision on {{who would be the}} Commonwealth's next king was reached on 8 November, but as the pacta conventa were not yet ready, the official announcement was delayed until 13 November. In the pacta conventa, Władysław pledged himself to fund a military school and equipment; {{to find a way to}} fund a naval fleet; to maintain current alliances; not to raise armies, give offices or military ranks to foreigners, negotiate peace treaties or declare war without the Sejm's approval; not to take a wife without the Senate's approval; to convince his brothers to take an oath to the Commonwealth; and to transfer the profits from the <b>Royal</b> <b>Mint</b> to the Royal Treasury rather than to a private treasury. When the election result had been announced by the Crown Grand Marshal, Łukasz Opaliński, the nobility (szlachta), who had taken part {{in the election}}, began festivities in honor of the new king, which lasted three hours. Władysław was crowned in the Wawel Cathedral, in Kraków on 6 February in the following year.|$|E
