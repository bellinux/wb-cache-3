Witnesses in Dharamshala, India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.|$|E

For instance, {{in one of their}} most important rituals, the women praise the men, the men thank the women, the young express appreciation for the old, and the old recognize the contributions of the young.

25|$|The {{origins of}} {{spinning}} fibre to make string or yarn are lost in time, but archaeological {{evidence in the}} form of representation of string skirts has been dated to the Upper Paleolithic era, some 20,000 years ago. In the most primitive type of spinning, tufts of animal hair or plant fibre are rolled down the thigh with the hand, and additional tufts are added as needed until the desired length of spun fibre is achieved. Later, the fibre is fastened to a stone which is twirled round until the yarn is sufficiently twisted, whereupon it is wound upon the stone and the process <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over.|$|E

500|$|In {{what was}} a {{departure}} from convention, the Western Chalukyan figure sculptures of gods and goddesses bore stiff forms and were <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over in the many temples. This was {{in contrast to the}} naturalistic and informal poses employed in the earlier temples in the region. [...] Barring occasional exaggerations in pose, each principal deity had its own pose depending on the incarnation or form depicted. Consistent with figure sculpture in other parts of India, these figures were fluent rather than defined in their musculature, and the drapery was reduced to a few visible lines on the body of the image.|$|E

500|$|Recent {{works have}} {{generally}} accepted {{the image of}} Theramenes as a moderate, committed to the ideal of a hoplite-based broad oligarchy. Donald Kagan has said of him that [...] "...his entire career reveals {{him to be a}} patriot and a true moderate, sincerely committed to a constitution granting power to the hoplite class, whether {{in the form of a}} limited democracy or a broadly based oligarchy", while John Fine has noted that [...] "like many a person following a middle course, he was hated by both political extremes." [...] The constitution of the 5,000 is recognized as his political masterpiece; his attempt to bring about a similar shift towards moderatism in 404 led directly to his death. That death, meanwhile, has become famous for its drama, and the story of Theramenes' final moments has been <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over throughout classical historiography. [...] "Because he met his death defying a tyrant," [...] John Fine notes, [...] "it is easy to idealize Theramenes." [...] In the millennia since his death, Theramenes has been both idealized and reviled; his brief seven-year career in the spotlight, touching as it did on all the major points of controversy in the last years of the Peloponnesian War, has been subject to myriad different interpretations. From the polemical contemporary works which describe his career have emerged the outlines of a complex figure, charting a dangerous course through the chaos of the late 5th-century Athenian political scene; although historians from ancient times to the present have offered far more specific portraits, of one form or another, it may be that nothing more than that outline will ever be known with certainty.|$|E

During the Old Hittite Kingdom period prior to 1400 BC, the king of the Hittites was not viewed by the Hittite citizenry as a [...] "living god", like the Pharaohs of Egypt, but rather as a first among equals. Only in the later period of the Hittite Empire, from 1400 BC until 1200 BC, did the kingship of the Hittites become more centralized and powerful.

2500|$|The bulk of identifications using CODIS rely {{on short}} tandem repeats (STRs) that are {{scattered}} throughout the human genome and on statistics {{that are used to}} calculate the rarity of that specific profile in the population. STRs are a type of copy-number variation and comprise a sequence of nucleotide base pairs that is <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again. At each location tested during DNA analysis, also known as a locus (plural loci), a person has two sets of repeats, one from the father and one from the mother. [...] Each set is measured and the number of repeat copies is recorded. If both strands, inherited from the parents, contain the same number of repeats at that locus the person is said to be homozygous at that locus. If the repeat numbers differ they are said to be heterozygous. Every possible difference at a locus is an allele. This repeat determination is performed across a number of loci and the repeat values is the DNA profile that is uploaded to CODIS. As of January 1, 2017, requirements for upload to national level for known offender profiles is 20 loci.|$|E

Figo commented, [...] "I was worried that some madman might lose his head." [...] This time, Figo had decided that he would take corners, as well as throw-ins, and midway through the second half Madrid won a corner. Amid a shower of flying objects, it took Figo two minutes to take it. Another corner followed on the other side, and as Figo walked across, he slowed to pick up the missiles and as he prepared to take the corner he moved away some of the debris, while giving an ironic thumbs-up and smiling. Every time he began his run-up to take the corner, another missile would land which was <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over, until the referee Luis Medina Cantalejo suspended the game for almost 20 minutes.

It was a low building with a low roof, supported by heavy irregular arches, that as we looked in seemed scarcely high enough for a tall man to stand under. What we saw there was too frightful for more than a hasty glance. An immense number of bodies had been partially burnt there and the charred and blackened remains seemed to fill it half way up to the low dark arches and make them lower and darker still, were lying in a state of putrefaction too frightful to look upon. I had never imagined anything so horrible. We all turned away sick and faint, and staggered out of the fearful pest house glad to get into the street again. We walked about the place and saw the same thing <b>repeated</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over a hundred times.
