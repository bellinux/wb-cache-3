40|$|Abstract. The <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> in {{cold rolling}} could {{decrease}} {{the accuracy of}} ring parts. Because many factors could cause <b>residual</b> <b>stress,</b> it’s difficult to calculate it theoretically. At present, a measurement method was generally used to study the <b>residual</b> <b>stress.</b> For example, X ray {{could be used to}} measure <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> in rings. Through the measurement of <b>residual</b> <b>stress,</b> it could not only obtain the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> level after ring rolling, but also validate the finite element model to predict the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> distribution. However, because the ring surface was circle, it needs to cut a plane for X ray measure, and it increases measurement inaccuracy. This method only could be suited for qualitative analysis of <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> in cold ring rolling, and it is not suitable for quantitative analysis of <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> distribution...|$|R
40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>stress</b> is {{the stress}} that remains stored within a {{structure}} {{as a result}} of its manufacturing history. Often called a locked in stress, it remains when there is no applied load, influences the applied load and changes the structure's expected response to stress. An example of this is that a tensile <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> will add to an applied tensile load, increasing the maximum tensile stress. Conversely when a compressive load is applied, a tensile <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> reduces the maximum compressive <b>stress.</b> <b>Residual</b> <b>stress</b> develops in a part during all stages of manufacturing through the action of plastic deformation and thermal inhomogeneities. The final <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> within a structure can be a combination of the <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> created through these stages. Processes that produce significant <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> in steels include quenching and tempering, rolling, bending and welding. Due to the highly localised thermal input at the weld point, welding produces the largest short range variation in <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> field. In the immediate region of a weld, the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> is dominated by the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> from the welding processes: tensile stress in the weld region, becoming compressive further from the weld. Prior <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> fields can influence the expansion and contraction and thus the final welded <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profile. Because <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> acts on a scale that interacts with applied stresses, it becomes important to know what <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> is present within a component in order to know the final load acting on the structure. In many situations it is not possible to determine the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> within a component directly and an approximation, or best practice, <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profile must be used. This can be simple, for example considering the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> produced by bending, but the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profile produced in welding is a great deal more complex, depending on weld thickness, geometry, restraint, heat input and is difficult to accurately predict. It is important to have a highly accurate prediction of the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> when carrying out processes such as an Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) since this will determine the integrity of a welded joint in its environment. An ECA uses a combination of the applied <b>stress</b> and the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profiles in order to determine the likelihood of growth of a flaw at a particular point in the structure. The <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profiles used to make these assessments are conservative and in the case of steel T -butt welds are based on a very narrow range of heat inputs and welding processes. The typical <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profile is assumed to be highly tensile which means that an ECA on any flaws in the weld region will indicate potential failure of the welded joint and repair is necessary. One of the factors that may affect the conservatism of these <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profiles is the lack of consideration of the overall interaction of the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> fields prior to welding. This work experimentally measures the <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> fields in thick steel plate before and after welding, in both restrained and unrestrained plate, and uses this to consider whether the <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> are a result of welding or pre-welding processes and examines how these influence the final <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> field. The work allows a new consideration of what <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> fields around highly restrained, thick section welds are: creating a basis for pre-existing <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> fields to be considered in conjunction with the welding <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> in ECAs.

Fabrication processes such as welding and machining generate <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> {{that are difficult to}} predict. <b>Residual</b> <b>stresses</b> affect the integrity of structures through promoting failures due to brittle fracture, fatigue, stress corrosion cracking, and wear. In this work, the weight function theory of fracture mechanics is used to measure <b>residual</b> <b>stresses.</b> The weight function theory is an important development in computational fracture mechanics.

For investigations of welding <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profile, the effects of geometric variables, i. e. the thickness and the radius of the nozzle {{and the length of}} the safe end, on welding <b>residual</b> <b>stresses,</b> are systematically considered and elastic-plastic thermo-mechanical finite element analyses are conducted. Through-wall welding <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profiles for dissimilar metal nozzle butt welds are proposed, which take a modified form of existing welding <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> profiles developed for austenitic pipe butt weld in R 6 code...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measured and}} predicted <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> from {{two sets of}} shrinkfitted assemblies, each manufactured using an aluminium alloy and a cast iron. <b>Residual</b> <b>stresses</b> were measured {{using a combination of}} deep-hole drilling (DHD) and incremental centre hole drilling (ICHD) techniques. The ICHD method provided near surface <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> measurements to depths up to about 1 mm. The DHD method measured through thickness <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> along radial lines through the outer sleeve and into the shaft. Results are shown for the two assemblies and reveal <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> that are different from both simple analysis and finite element studies. For example, prior machining introduced near surface compressive <b>residual</b> <b>stresses,</b> that is then expected to be counteracted by the near surface tensile shrink-fit <b>residual</b> <b>stresses.</b> However, measurements reveal {{that this is not the}} case. 1...|$|R

The external load and crack-tip geometry constraint in the model are controlled by a remote boundary condition, which {{is a function of}} K and T-stress. A crack opening <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> field, similar to a longitudinal <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> field in butt welded plates, is introduced into the model using an initial strain field. For calculating the modified, path independent, J-integral in the specimens with <b>residual</b> <b>stresses,</b> a post processor for finite element results was developed by computer programming. To carry out a systematic investigation into the effect of <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> on crack behavior, the constraint parameters, Q and R, for different combinations of <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> and external loads, were calculated, and the interaction between <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> and external loads for different models was studied. It has been shown that the crack driving forces and the crack-tip stress field were significantly influenced by <b>residual</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|R
