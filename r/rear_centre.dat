A map {{light at the end of}} a flexible arm extended from the right side of the desk, the left carried a vanity mirror, also on a flex stem. The back of the front seats popped open. The one on the passenger's side served as a snack table or provided a flat surface for playing games. The compartment behind the driver concealed a miniature liquor cabinet, complete with four sterling silver tumbles and two decanters—all decorated with red and green enamel stripes.|$|E

40|$|Bark {{stripping}} {{damage is}} a serious problem in some forest hunting grounds in Serbia. This study aimed at assessing the incidence and intensity of bark stripping by red deer in the fenced <b>rearing</b> <b>centre</b> “Lomnička Reka“ (Mt. Veliki Jastrebac, central Serbia). The data were collected by detailed surveying of the entire <b>rearing</b> <b>centre</b> over spring and autumn 2008, 2009 and 2010. Our results show that, in spring and summer, it is exclusively broadleaf tree species that are bark stripped by red deer, mainly beech (86. 3 % or 536 trees) and hornbeam (10. 1 % or 63 trees). The incidence and intensity of bark stripping were the highest in the diameter class of 20 - 39. 9 cm. Damaged trees were identified {{in all parts of the}} <b>rearing</b> <b>centre,</b> at all aspects and at different slopes. Beech bark was stripped over the period May-August, with the focus in June or July...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{describe}} the postnatal growth performance (period from birth to weaning) in Brown hare (Lepus europaeus) leverets in a <b>rearing</b> <b>centre</b> of Southern Italy. Three morpho- metric variables (body weight, hind foot length and ear length) were measured weekly from birth to wean- ing (at 21 days) in 78 leverets. Data were analysed by proc GLM (SAS) considering the effect of sex and birth period (1. January-February, 2. March-April, and 3. May-June). Birth period influenced significantly live weight at 14 14 th day of life, lower inperiod 2 thanin 3 (553 vs. 607 g;P period 2 than in 3 (553 vs. 607 g;P (553 vs. 607 g; P≤ 0. 05) and hind foot length at birth, shorter in period 1 compared to the period 2 and 3 (4. 4 vs. 4. 7 and 4. 8 cm; P≤ 0. 05), and at weaning, shorter in period 1 than in 3 (8. 6 vs. 9. 6 cm; P≤ 0. 05).

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{study and}} assessment of the damage by big game in forest hunting grounds in Serbia was infrequent, although the damage was evident. The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify the rates and types of damage by red deer and wild boar at three localities: (1) fenced part of the hunting ground 'Crni Lug' (Srem), (2) fenced part of the hunting ground 'Podunavsko Lovište Plavna' (Southwestern Bačka), and (3) fenced <b>rearing</b> <b>centre</b> 'Lomnička Reka' (Mt. Veliki Jastrebac). The damage was not recorded on locality (1). The damage on locality (2) (new polar plantations) and locality (3) (beech forests) was caused by red deer. The main causes of the damage were excessive density and disturbed population structure (sex and age), nonharmonised forest and hunting management, shortage of natural food, especially of pasture areas...|$|R
