40|$|I {{also argue}} that the {{structure}} {{and the content of}} Records of Practical Government was much influenced by Qiu Jun's (1421 - 1495) Daxue yanyi bu (Supplement to the Extension of the Great Learning), which initiated the tradition of systematic statecraft writing in the Ming. However, because Lu and Qiu lived in different eras and had different social backgrounds and official status, they addressed same issues at different levels in their books. The Daxue yanyi bu was written as a reference for the emperors and officials and as a blueprint for political reform to be initiated by the court. What it deals with are national administrative structures and large social issues. The Records of Practical Government only deals with practical matters from the viewpoint of local officials. Providing guidance to provincial officials at different ranks, {{it was meant to be}} a guide to local governance. I further argue that an immediate reason for Lu's desire to improve local governance was the impact of Zhang Juzheng's political reforms. When Lu became an official, he was involved in the decade-long reforms initiated by Zhang. Zhang was Lu's spiritual guide, although while Zhang's reforms involved officials at different levels, Lu's only concerned local and provincial administrative officials. In later times, Lu Kun's statecraft thought spread mainly through publication of his books. His ideas on government were well recognized in the Qing dynasty. He was canonized in the Confucian temple in 1826 and considered an accomplished thinker and scholar of practical learning. Lu Kun was a famous Confucian scholar-official of the late Ming Dynasty. As a magistrate of Xiangyuan and Datong counties of Shanxi province and as a Vice Minister of Justice, he was highly praised by people he governed and by fellow officials of his times because of his uprightness and able administration. This dissertation focuses on the characteristics of Lu Kun's (1536 - 1618) statecraft thought by analyzing his important work. Records of Practical Government (Shizheng lu), and his understanding of the relationship between the Wanli emperor (reigned 1563 - 1620) and his officials. The Records of Practical Government, compiled after Lu retired, is a corpus of official documents Lu wrote and announced when he was an official in Shanxi. These documents reflect his administrative experience and the local custom of places he governed. They also reveal Lu's understanding of local affairs, his emphasis on the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> and his design for the strengthening of that. Lu, however, was unable to realize much what he proposed in the Records of Practical Government. His regulations were too detailed and complicated, and his language somewhat harsh, that they were difficult to be observed. The research also shows Lu's personal understanding and handling of the relationship between the Wanli emperor and his officials, which likewise reveals Lu's statecraft thought. Lu was prudent enough to be able to maintain good terms with Wanli for a smooth discharge of his official responsibility. But when Lu was forced to resign in disillusion during the contention for the confirmation of an heir-apparent, he turned to support officials who left office as a protest to the emperor. 解揚. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2007. 參考文獻(p. 391 - 448).

40|$|Ancient Confucianism {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as the cornerstone {{in the tradition of}} Chinese intelligentsia. However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the question of how Confucianism interprets and understands the issue of “serving in the government”. It is without doubt that ancient Confucianism has a clear interest in politics and political participation, but their standpoint concerning serving in the government is ambiguous and further research is therefore needed. One the one hand, Confucianism emphasizes “keeping working towards a goal the realization of which he knows to be helpless” (i. e., the willingness to serve in the government even when the Way falls into disuse). On the other hand, Confucianism also stresses “keeping out of sight when the Way does not prevail” (i. e., the unwillingness to join the government). This shows the complexity and tensions of the Confucian attitude towards the issue of serving in the government. Therefore, this thesis aims to investigate the topic of political participation in ancient Confucian philosophy, and attempts to enrich the discussion of this issue in the literature. Excluding the foreword and the summary, this thesis is divided into seven parts. The first part analyzes the historical background of how “serving in the government” becomes a prominent concept in ancient Confucianism. The second part discusses the Confucian motivations and reasons concerning serving in the government. The third part points out the Confucian thoughts about the qualifications and requirements <b>of</b> being <b>an</b> <b>official.</b> The fourth part analyzes the principles and opportunities of serving in the government from the Confucian perspective. The fifth part deals with the Confucian ideas <b>of</b> duties and <b>responsibilities</b> <b>of</b> being <b>an</b> <b>official.</b> The sixth part analyzes the principles and opportunities of leaving the government. The seventh part discusses various ways of political participation other than taking office which Confucianism has advocated...|$|R
