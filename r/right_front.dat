5|$|Tornadoes {{are most}} common in spring and least common in winter, but tornadoes can occur any time of year that {{favorable}} conditions occur. Spring and fall experience peaks of activity as those are the seasons when stronger winds, wind shear, and atmospheric instability are present. Tornadoes are focused in the <b>right</b> <b>front</b> quadrant of landfalling tropical cyclones, which tend {{to occur in the}} late summer and autumn. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices, which persist until landfall.|$|E

5|$|Wurz locked his brakes {{going into}} turn 15, {{causing him to}} beach his car in the gravel trap and retired on lap 36. Button became the first driver to pit twice on lap 39. Coulthard {{replicated}} his manoeuvre into turn five on Michael Schumacher on lap 40, with the later pushed {{to the side of}} the track by Coulthard who took the lead. Michael Schumacher's <b>right</b> <b>front</b> wheel made slight contact with Coulthard's left front tyre in the process. Michael Schumacher then immediately withstood Häkkinen's attempts to overtake him. Frentzen and de la Rosa became the next two drivers to make pit stops on the same lap. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen made pit stops for the second time on lap 43 and both emerged in third and fourth respectively. Barrichello's pit stop on the 44th lap saw him drop to fifth after his team had issues with fitting his <b>right</b> <b>front</b> tyre. Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops over the next two laps. At the completition of lap 48, with the frontrunners completing their pit stops, the order was Coulthard, Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Villeneuve, Trulli, Ralf Schumacher, Frentzen, Button, Fisichella, Salo, Diniz, Heidfeld, Irvine, Alesi and Gené.|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on plant matter and animals both {{on land and}} in water. It eats prey such as beetles, millipedes, and slugs. Also, wood turtles consume {{specific}} fungi (Amanita muscaria and Leccinum arcolatum), mosses, grasses, various insects, and also carrion. On occasion, {{it can be seen}} stomping the ground with alternating hits of the left and <b>right</b> <b>front</b> feet. This behavior is thought to imitate the sound of falling rain, sometimes causing earthworms to rise to the surface where they quickly become easy prey. When hunting, the wood turtle pokes its head into such areas as dead and decaying logs, the bottoms of bushes, and in other vegetation. In the water, it exhibits similar behavior, searching algae beds and cavities along the sides of the stream or river.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} into Wheldon's death were released on December 15, 2011. In a report prepared by crash investigators, it was found that Wheldon's death was caused by an impact with the catch fencing around the circuit. Brian Barnhart further rejected claims that the banking had also contributed to the accident, stating that it created two ideal racing lines, and that these lines made the location of cars more predictable for other drivers; {{at the time of the}} accident, all 34 cars had been behaving as expected. The report also revealed that the <b>right</b> <b>front</b> pull rod of the suspension assembly penetrated Wheldon's survival cell, though it did not cause him any injury. The report recommended further investigation of this phenomenon, as it was the first recorded incident of its kind in nine years of the use of the IR03 and later IR05 model chassis, which was being retired at the end of the race. The pull-rod suspension chassis is not being utilised in the DW12.|$|E

5|$|In the Safari Rally, a {{rotor arm}} in Mouton's Quattro failed and caused the turbo {{to break down}} as well. She retired after falling victim to the team's ranking order; as the repairs were {{expected}} to take too long, Gumpert ordered championship leader Blomqvist's Quattro to be fixed by using Mouton's sister car as spares. Her debut in the new Sport Quattro at the Acropolis Rally ended with engine overheating problems. In the 1000 Lakes, Mouton placed ninth after the short first day. She later crashed and continued without a windscreen, but the damage to her Quattro could not be repaired in service. Mouton retired and left Finland pointless for the fourth year in a row. In late October, she signed a contract extension with Audi. At the RAC Rally, a slight mistake led to a puncture and Mouton dropped from third to fifth. She went on to narrowly lose the final podium spot to Toyota's Per Eklund. Mouton's results placed her 12th in the drivers' world championship, a point behind Röhrl. Outside the WRC, Mouton debuted in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the United States, driving an Audi Sport Quattro together with her usual co-driver Fabrizia Pons. After her main opponent Martin Schanche got hampered by a flat <b>right</b> <b>front</b> tyre she won the open rally category (now known as unlimited) in a record time and placed second overall, leaving behind several specialised V8 single-seaters that had normally dominated the race.|$|E
