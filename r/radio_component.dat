5000|$|The {{germanium}} diodes {{that became}} widely available {{after the war}} proved to be as sensitive as galena and did not require any adjustment, so germanium diodes replaced cat's-whisker detectors in the few crystal radios still being made, largely {{putting an end to}} the manufacture of this antique <b>radio</b> <b>component.</b> Although cat's-whisker detectors are obsolete, modern point-contact silicon detectors are still commercially produced.

50|$|Geoffrey misdirects the craft's {{wireless}} operator {{just long}} enough to send a message about the LZ36's location to British intelligence. The wireless operator returns and, upon hearing the reply and realizing what Geoffrey had done, engages him in a fight. Geoffrey manages to knock him out, and throws him out an open window, telling the captain the wireless operator had fallen while scraping ice off the airship, as many craft personnel had been ordered to do. The explanation is believed, but Geoffrey does not have a chance to send any more information because Erika comes on the scene and removes an important <b>radio</b> <b>component.</b> The airship proceeds to Balcoven Castle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{railroad}} industry, {{like the}} process {{industry and the}} power utility industry, has always demanded that the return on investment for large capital investments associated with infrastructure improvements be fully realized before the asset is decommissioned and replaced. This paradigm will be applied to PTC as well. It {{is highly unlikely that}} there will be any major upgrades to initial PTC deployments within even the first 10 years. The calculation for return on investment is not a simple one and some railroads may determine, for instance after five years, that an upgrade of certain components of PTC may be justified. An example could be the <b>radio</b> <b>component</b> of PTC. If an open standard creates a less expensive radio product that is backwards compatible to existing systems and that perhaps improves PTC system performance and also includes improvements that save on operational costs, then a railroad would be prudent to consider a plan for replacing their PTC radios.|$|E
50|$|Throughout North America (and in {{many other}} regions) the {{recommended}} path for mobiles or portable stations is now WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1. Fixed Stations (homes, etc.) should not normally use a path routing if they don't need to be digipeated outside of their local area, otherwise a path of WIDE2-2 or less should be used as requirements dictate. This path reflects the routing of packets via the <b>radio</b> <b>component</b> of APRS, and fixed stations should carefully consider their choice of path routing. Any path selection for stations {{that do not require}} it contributes to congestion of the APRS frequency and may hinder other stations' reporting. Aircraft and balloon APRS stations should avoid beaconing with any path at altitude since digipeating may not be necessary due to their antenna height and likelihood of reaching multiple wide-ranging digipeaters and IGates. Mobile stations in congested areas or more populated areas may consider using only 1 hop (WIDE1-1), as there are usually enough Internet gateways nearby that no path routing is needed. One solution to the path selection is proportional pathing if the user's equipment is capable.|$|E

40|$|Few high-redshift, radio-loud quasars {{are known}} to date. The {{extremely}} luminous, radio-bright quasar, SDSS J 013127. 34 - 032100. 1 was recently discovered at a redshift of $z= 5. 18 $. We observed the source with high resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) at 1. 7 GHz with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and found a single compact <b>radio</b> <b>component.</b> We estimated a lower limit to the brightness temperature of the detected <b>radio</b> <b>component,</b> T_B~ 10 ^{ 11 } K. Additionaly, when compared to archival radio data, the source showed significant flux density variation. These two findings are indicative of the blazar nature of the source.

40|$|Abstract. We present radio, optical, {{near-infrared}} and spectroscopic {{observations of}} the source B 0827 + 525. We consider this source as the best candidate from the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) for a ‘dark-lens ’ system or binary radioloud quasar. The system consists of two radio components with somewhat different spectral indices, separated by 2. 815 arcsec. VLBA observations show that each component has substructure {{on a scale of}} a few mas. A deep K–band exposure with the W. M. Keck–II Telescope reveals emission near both radio components. The K–band emission of the weaker <b>radio</b> <b>component</b> appears extended, whereas the emission from the brighter <b>radio</b> <b>component</b> is consistent with a point source. Hubble Space Telescope F 160 W–band observations with the NICMOS instrument confirms this. A redshift of 2. 064 is found for the brighter component, using the LRIS instrument on the W. M. Keck–I...|$|E

40|$|We have {{conducted}} sensitive (1 sigma< 30 uJy) 1. 4 GHz radio observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array {{of a field}} largely coincident with infrared observations of the Spitzer Wide-Area Extragalactic Survey. The field is centred on the European Large Area ISO Survey S 1 region and has a total area of 3. 9 deg. We describe the observations and calibration, source extraction, and cross-matching to infrared sources. Two catalogues are presented; one of the <b>radio</b> <b>components</b> found in the image and one of radio sources with counterparts in the infrared and extracted from the literature. 1366 <b>radio</b> <b>components</b> were grouped into 1276 sources, 1183 of which were matched to infrared sources. We discover 31 radio sources with no infrared counterpart at all, adding to the class of Infrared-Faint Radio Sources.
