The right bar has bigger oil damper section, with regulated <b>rebound</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>damping.</b> According to the manufacturer, this asymmetric design provides a reduction of the friction inside the fork, significant mass loss and more friendly response of suspension. The KTRC system uses manipulation of the ignition timing on all 3 traction control modes, while mode 3 (rain mode) also uses a separate throttle controlled by the on-board electronics, to allow faster reaction for wheel over-spin on slippery surfaces. Traction control and power modes can be adjusted or turned off whenever the throttle is closed, even while riding the bike. The bike is sold without a steering damper, as Kawasaki reports that people complained about the OEM steering dampers in the previous model, {{so they decided to}} not include one into the new bike.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, a {{passenger}} car suspension must has high performance criteria with light weight, low cost, and low energy consumption. Pilot controlled proportional valve is designed and analyzed to get small pressure change rate after blow-off, {{and to get}} a fast response of the damper, a reverse damping mechanism is adapted. The reverse continuous variable damper is designed as a HS-SH damper which offers good body control with reduced transferred input force from the tire, compared with any other type of suspension system. The damper structure is designed, so that <b>rebound</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>damping</b> forces can be tuned independently, of which the variable valve is placed externally. The rate of pressure change with respect to the flow rate after blow-off becomes smooth when the fixed orifice size increases, which means that the blow-off slope is controllable using the fixed orifice size. Damping forces are measured with the change of the solenoid current at the different piston velocities to confirm the maximum hysteresis of 20 N, linearity, and variance of damping force. The damping force variance is wide and continuous, and is controlled by the spool opening, of which scheme is usually adapted in proportional valves. The reverse continuous variable damper developed in this study is expected to be utilized in the semi-active suspension systems in passenger cars after its performance and simplicity of the design is confirmed through a real car test.

The RC8 R's WP suspension includes a 43 mm inverted fork at the front end, with a titanium-aluminum-nitride low-stiction coating on its sliders. A high-end shock supports the bike's rear, and its piston rod is also finished with the titanium-aluminum-nitride coating.

5000|$|The {{suspension}} calibration was all-new for 1982, to {{make the}} big GPz an even better handler both on the track and on the street.

40|$|Abstract: The sound {{pressure}} level in a one-dimensional piston-pipe enclosure is controlled using the Active <b>Compression</b> <b>Damping</b> (ACD) treatment. The ACD treatment, which is bonded directly to the driving piston, uses the compression and expansion deformations of visco-elastic material sandwiched between the electro-magnet and a permanent magnet to dissipate the acoustic energy inside a piston-pipe system. ACD treatment is an active/passive hybrid controller. When the active part fails due to a malfunction of any element in the control circuits, the passive part still operates and gives acceptable control efforts. The behavior {{of the system is}} evaluated by monitoring the {{sound pressure}} level at the closed end of the pipe with single tone, two-tone and broad band noise excitations. Proportional and Derivative feedback con-trol are used to activate the electromagnetic actuator. The results obtained indicate significant attenuation of the acoustic energy inside the pipe...|$|R

[...] The DRC system is mainly mechanical, and uses a pump to provide additional pressure to individual dampers (shock absorbers) during cornering, acceleration or braking; to counteract rolling and pitching. [...] The system can adjust the stiffness at each individual damper constantly; to maintain both a comfortable ride on straight roads, and high level of poise and grip when cornering hard, accelerating, or braking. [...] The DRC's main advantage is that it operates {{without the need for}} complicated electronics, as required in similar systems from Mercedes-Benz and other competitors. Its main drawback is that the DRC dampers have been known to fail (leaking fluid from the cross-linked circuits), which can affect the handling and ride quality of the vehicle; some owners have reported needing multiple replacements of faulty DRC units and many drivers have opted to replace the system with simpler and more reliable aftermarket coilover suspension.|$|R
