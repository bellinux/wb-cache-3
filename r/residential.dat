5|$|A {{high-density}} <b>residential</b> district {{built on}} a coastal knoll, Lam Tin hosts <b>residential</b> housing estates, transport infrastructure, mass-transit facilities, shopping centres, recreational areas and many other buildings and structures. It is home to 130,000 residents, making up a fifth of Kwun Tong District's population.|$|E
5|$|Acknowledgment of {{the wrongs}} {{done by the}} <b>residential</b> school system began in the 1980s. In 1986, at its 31st General Council, the United Church of Canada responded to the request of Indigenous peoples that it {{apologize}} to them for its part in colonization and in 1998 apologized expressly for the role it played in the <b>residential</b> school system.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s, Žirmūnai {{attracted}} the attention of urban planners; it became the first city district in the Lithuanian SSR to be constructed applying urban planning concepts established in the USSR at that time. Designed in 1962, the district consisted of three microdistricts - <b>residential</b> and industrial sections centred around public facilities and had been the largest <b>residential</b> area in the city.|$|E

The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly <b>residential</b> and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. Centrally the land is mixed between <b>residential</b> properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square.

5|$|<b>Residential</b> land {{makes up}} more than 50,000 acres, or one fifth, of Juniata County's area. The bulk of <b>residential</b> land is single-family dwellings, but {{seasonal}} homes and mobile homes also make up significant portions of it. The county's <b>residential</b> land is concentrated along in its boroughs, but occurs along roads and in villages throughout the county. Multi-family <b>residential</b> land is comparatively rare. Less than 1% of the county's land (430 acres) is used for manufacturing purposes. Only approximately 370 acres are used for transportation and utilities. Roughly 300 acres are used for transportation and communication and 70 acres are used for other utilities. Businesses make up 0.21% of the county's land, or 525 acres. 490 acres are devoted to retail businesses, while 35 acres are devoted to wholesale businesses. Services occupy 0.67% of the county's area.|$|E

5|$|The Near South Side {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic of Chicago's communities. It has {{undergone}} a metamorphosis from a Native American homeland to a blue collar settlement, to an elite socialite <b>residential</b> district, to a center for vice, to a slum, to a public housing and warehouse district, and finally to the home of a newly gentrified <b>residential</b> district.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Residential</b> Zone {{specifically}} accommodated {{athletes and}} team officials, with 1,168 apartments in 34 <b>residential</b> towers. Each apartment had {{two to five}} bedrooms, giving 4,008 bedrooms in total; each bedroom accommodated two residents which differed from the traditional practice of providing athletes with a bedroom each. The entire zone itself was divided into four zones, styled after four unique folk art styles found in India as identified by a colour and an image: warli (red), gond (blue), madhubani (green) and sanjhi (purple). Nine Resident Centres, each serving hundreds of residents, were spaced across the <b>residential</b> towers, and they provided key services and facilities as well as entertainment. The <b>Residential</b> Zone also housed offices and services centres for the Commonwealth Games Associations, a polyclinic, religious services and casual dining facilities.|$|E
5|$|The area east of Michigan Avenue {{and north}} of the Chicago River had a split {{personality}} {{for much of the}} 20th century - the northern portion upscale <b>residential,</b> retail, and university uses and the area near the Chicago River and Navy Pier dedicated to shipping and factories. At the end of the 1960s, however, <b>residential</b> complexes such as Lake Point Tower(1965) and McClurg Court Center (1971) began to appear among the warehouses {{and by the end of}} the century, <b>residential</b> and retail dominated the entire area. The neighborhood now has a reputation as part of an upscale <b>residential</b> strip that balances the more industrial western portion of the Near North Side.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{broke the}} record for the world's highest residence above ground level, held since 1969 by the nearby John Hancock Center. Because the Trump Tower has both hotel condominiums and <b>residential</b> condominiums, it does not contest the record held by the 88-story 432 Park Avenue in New York City, which, at , is the tallest <b>residential</b> building in the world.|$|E
5|$|The deluge flooded 95,000automobiles and 73,000houses {{throughout}} Harris County. Tropical Storm Allison destroyed 2,744homes, leaving 30,000homeless with <b>residential</b> damages totaling to $1.76billion (2001USD, $2.05billion 2007USD). <b>Residential</b> neighborhoods {{inside and}} {{to the north of}} Interstate 610 were hardest hit. Additionally, five of the six bayou systems in downtown Houston were severely flooded. Four of them broke 100-year high-water records, causing excessive surface run-off.|$|E
5|$|The large {{population}} in Antananarivo {{and the high}} density of its <b>residential</b> zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation and access to clean drinking water. Processing and disposal of industrial and <b>residential</b> waste is inadequate. Waste water is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle exhausts, <b>residential</b> coal-burning stoves and other sources is worsening. While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain inadequate and are not distributed according to population density, worsening access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city. Antananarivo {{is one of the}} two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, Coquitlam and {{the rest}} of the Lower Mainland {{experienced}} substantial population growth that continues today. The opening of Lougheed Highway in 1953 made the city more accessible and set the stage for <b>residential</b> growth. In 1971, Coquitlam and Fraser Mills were amalgamated, which gave the city a larger industrial base. The mill closed in 2001, and is now rezoned into a <b>residential</b> area.|$|E

The neighborhood had earlier experienced booms following World War I and World War II.|$|E
