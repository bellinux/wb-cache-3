50|$|Resin grouted rebar is used {{in areas}} which require more support than a point anchor bolt can give. The rebar used is of similar size as a point anchor bolt but {{does not have an}} {{expansion}} shell. Once the hole for the rebar is drilled, cartridges of polyester resin are installed in the hole. The rebar bolt is installed after the resin and spun by the installation drill. This opens the <b>resin</b> <b>cartridge</b> and mixes it. Once the resin hardens the drill spinning tightens the rebar bolt holding the rock together. Resin grouted rebar is considered a permanent ground support with a lifespan of 20-30 years.|$|E

40|$|Full-column {{anchored}} resin bolts {{were first}} used in underground mines in 1972. These bolts appear to improve support in many roof bolt applications, {{as indicated by}} the use of about 30 million resin bolts in 1980. In the mid- 1970 's, Bureau of Mines in-vestigators began looking for a substitute for resin because of its short supply and rapidly increasing price. The investigators selected accelerated gypsum plaster (CaSO. 271 / 2 H 20), which becomes gypsum (CaSO. 27 2 H 20) when mixed with water. Gypsum makes an effective alternate grout material because it hardens quickly, is readily available, and is inexpensive in comparison with other cementitious materials. The Bureau received a patent (U. s. patent 4, 096, 944) for a system combining water capsules (wax-encapsulated water) with plaster into <b>cartridges</b> resembling <b>resin</b> <b>cartridges.</b> This report presents the results of tests conducted by the Bureau on the plaster, the water capsules, and their combined use in cartridges. The tests were designed to determine how the gypsum-plaster water capsule bolting system performs and what happens in the hole while the bolt is being inserted through the cartridge.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Effective strata control, utilising fully {{encapsulated}} {{roof bolts}} {{is dependent on}} the installed quality of the reinforcement elements. One mechanism by which roof bolts may become less than fully efficient is by glove fingering (gloving) and un-mixing of the resin. Following a routine installed bolt quality audit and some small roof failures containing gloved bolts, a work programme was initiated {{to determine the extent of}} the gloving and un-mixing problem and to develop an understanding of mechanisms involved. Results have shown that gloving and un-mixing is a systematic and widespread pheno mena, occurring across the range of resin and/or bolt manufacturers, and in a variety of roof types. Gloving was found in bolts installed using either hand held pneumatic or continuous miner mounted hydraulic bolting rigs, under run of mine (ROM) condition s by operators, and under controlled manufactures “best practice ” conditions. The mechanisms involved have been confirmed as being the development of a pressure front as the bolt encounters the <b>resin</b> <b>cartridge</b> and is spun up the hole, which in turn, leads to over-pressurisation and radial expansion of the <b>resin</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The result is an increase in the diameter of the plastic cartridge.

30|$|Until now, {{there are}} only some {{inconsistent}} preliminary data to investigate the effects of hemofiltration (a modality of EBP) on ARDS animal models [8, 9]. Also, {{it has been shown}} that hemoadsorption (HA), another modality of EBP, can improve oxygenation in septic patients [10, 11]. However, evidences of HA’s effects on ARDS patients animal models are scarce. We hypothesize that HA can improve oxygenation, reduce the permeability of alveolar-capillary barrier and alleviate pulmonary edema/damage by blunting the circulating/alveolar cytokines in the process of ARDS. To test this hypothesis, we established an endotoxin-induced ARDS porcine model to explore HA’s therapeutic effect by using a HA 330 <b>resin</b> <b>cartridge</b> (a new weapon against cytokine storm).|$|E
40|$|A {{dedicated}} proteomic approach {{based on}} nano-Liquid Chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in ion trap is {{proposed for the}} analysis of proteins trapped in sorbent <b>resin</b> <b>cartridges</b> used to remove inflammatory mediators from blood by coupled plasma filtration adsorption (CPFA). The final purpose of the proposed proteomic approach was to obtain a reference map of plasma proteins trapped in CPFA sorbents used for the extracorporeal blood purification of healthy pigs, with the potential impact to design new bio-filters able to control the inflammatory imbalance under pathological conditions, such as severe sepsis. The five main steps of the proteomics analysis, (i) protein extraction from <b>resin</b> <b>cartridges,</b> (ii) two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) for protein separation and profiling, (iii) in-gel proteolytic digestion, (iv) tandem mass analysis of peptides resulting from enzymatic cleavage and (v) bioinformatics, for protein identification and post-processing validation of MS/MS data sets, have been carefully evaluated. Prior to electrophoresis, the efficiency of different extraction solutions and procedures to recovery plasma proteins trapped into the sorbents were tested. Then, a rapid one-step procedure for protein extraction was optimized. Protein bands corresponding to the main plasma proteins, namely porcine serum albumin, serotransferrin and immunoglobulins, were identified. In addition, the presence of haptoglobin, hemopexin, α- 1 acid glycoprotein and fetuin-A, that are known as acute-phase reaction proteins, was observed, suggesting that CPFA resins led to a non-specifically protein depletion from plasma, rather than targeting specific molecules...|$|R

This study shows that the HFR-Supra cartridge retains total p-cresol and IL- 6 in the ultrafiltrate and lowers plasma total p cresol but not IL- 6 levels. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01865773...|$|E
30|$|Thereafter, we {{conducted}} subsequent studies {{to explore the}} “therapeutic,” rather than “prophylactic” effect of hemoadsorption (HA) on the well-established (or far-developed, rather than “immature”) ARDS model. HA was performed with the HA 330 neutral microporous <b>resin</b> <b>cartridge</b> specially designed for the absorption of medium-sized inflammatory cytokines. First, we found that HA treatment increased PaO 2 /FiO 2 gradually (Fig.  3). Several previous studies in septic patients attributed this beneficial effect to the improved hemodynamics [10, 25]. However, a previous experimental study showed that zero-balanced high-volume continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) could improve arterial oxygenation without systemic or pulmonary hemodynamics improvement [9]. We also found that animals treated with or without HA 330 -based hemadsorption {{did not differ in}} their levels of MAP, SVRI, MPAP and PVRI (Table  4). Considering that HA therapy elicited a trend in reducing lung water and the permeability of alveolar-capillary membrane barrier (Fig.  3 e–i), we assume that oxygenation improvement should be partly due to the reduction of alveolar fluid leakage after clearing the peak concentration of alveolar cytokines, corresponding with the “peak concentration hypothesis” for EBP modality [26]. Lung local cytokines removal {{may be the result of}} passive spillover or active transport [26]. Notably, a recent clinical study showed that the circulating and BALF levels of IL- 17 A were significantly increased in ARDS patients and predicted an increased influx of alveolar neutrophils, alveolar permeability and organ dysfunction [27]. Thus, reduced BALF level of IL- 17 A in HA treatment group may be one of the reasons for fewer lung inflammatory cells and decreased acute lung injury. Taken together, by direct/indirect removal of a variety of pathogenic proinflammatory mediators that over-expressed in plasma and lung, HA timely blunted the “cytokine storm” in the process of ARDS and restored immunologic balance at a much lower set-point. These findings were in line with a recent small clinical study on septic-induced ARDS patients [28].|$|E
50|$|The {{anchorage}} device may {{be connected}} to the ground by chemical means, mechanical expansion or concreting. In the first case, polyester <b>resin</b> <b>cartridges</b> are placed in a perforation to fill the ring space around the end part of the bolt. The main advantage of this type of anchorage lies in its simplicity and in the speed of installation. The main disadvantage is in its limited strength. In the second case, the anchorage is composed of steel wedges driven into the sides of the hole. The advantage of this type of anchorage lies in the speed of installation and {{in the fact that the}} tensioning can be achieved immediately. The main disadvantage with this type of anchorage is that it can only be used with hard rock, and the maximum traction force is limited. In the third case, the anchorage is achieved by concreting the whole metal bar. This is the most-used method since the materials are cheap and installation is simple. Injected concrete mixes can be used in many different rocks and grounds, and the concrete sheath protects the bar from corrosion. The concrete mixture is generally made up of water and cement in the ratio W/C = 0.40-0.45, producing a sufficiently fluid mixture to allow pumping into the hole, while at the same time, providing high mechanical strength when set.|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of radium isotopes in natural waters {{is important for}} oceanographic studies and for public health reasons. Ra- 226 (1620 year half-life) {{is one of the}} most toxic of the long-lived alpha emitters present in the environment due to its long life and its tendency to concentrate in bones, which increases the internal radiation dose of individuals. The analysis of radium- 226 and radium- 228 in natural waters can be tedious and time-consuming. Different sample preparation methods are often required to prepare Ra- 226 and Ra- 228 for separate analyses. A rapid method has been developed at the Savannah River Environmental Laboratory that effectively separates both Ra- 226 and Ra- 228 (via Ac- 228) for assay. This method uses MnO{sub 2 } Resin from Eichrom Technologies (Darien, IL, USA) to preconcentrate Ra- 226 and Ra- 228 rapidly from water samples, along with Ba- 133 tracer. DGA Resin{reg_sign} (Eichrom) and Ln-Resin{reg_sign} (Eichrom) are employed in tandem to prepare Ra- 226 for assay by alpha spectrometry and to determine Ra- 228 via the {{measurement of}} Ac- 228 by gas proportional counting. After preconcentration, the manganese dioxide is dissolved from the resin and passed through stacked Ln-Resin-DGA <b>Resin</b> <b>cartridges</b> that remove uranium and thorium interferences and retain Ac- 228 on DGA Resin. The eluate that passed through this column is evaporated, redissolved in a lower acidity and passed through Ln-Resin again to further remove interferences before performing a barium sulfate microprecipitation. The Ac- 228 is stripped from the resin, collected using cerium fluoride microprecipitation and counted by gas proportional counting. By using vacuum box cartridge technology with rapid flow rates, sample preparation time is minimized...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of {{ion exchange technique}} with of IC-H Hypersep cartridge (Metrohm, Switzerland), sulfonated cation-exchange resins KU- 2 - 8 (Russia) and Purolite C 100 (UK) has been shown for ion separation of Mn (II), Fe(III), Cu(II) and Ni(II) ions from arsenite and arsenate ions. The conditions for ion-exchange removal of interfering cations in water when determining different arsenic(III, V) by stripping voltammetry have been optimized. The KU- 2 - 8 cation-exchange <b>resin</b> based <b>cartridge</b> {{was found to be}} appropriate for use in the proposed sample preparation for water. The developed technique of analysis has been applied for the separated determination of inorganic arsenic forms in waters of different origin by anodic stripping voltammetry.
