Under optimized conditions the extraction yield was 33. 199 ± 0. 24 mg/g, which substantially improved, compared with heating reflux extraction (HRE) and ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE), while extraction time was only 9 min. The eluents were rich in 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 ′-azobis (2 -methyl-propionamidine) dihydrochloride radical scavenging potential (IC 50 of DPPH: 53. 44 ± 0. 01 μg/mL, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) : 3785. 83 ± 52 μmol/g) than the extracts obtained by HRE and UAE.

The study was performed at three levels: (1) pure bacterial cultures, using three Campylobacter strains; (2) artificially contaminated samples from three chicken meat matrixes (total n= 30), whereby samples were spiked using two contamination levels; ca. 10 (3) cfuCampylobacter/g, and ca. 10 (4) cfuCampylobacter/g; and (3) pilot testing in naturally contaminated chicken meat samples (n= 20). Results from pure culture experiment revealed that enumeration of Campylobacter colonies on Karmali and CFA media was more convenient in comparison with mCCDA using spread and spiral plating techniques. Based on artificially contaminated samples testing, values of repeatability (r) were comparable between the three media, and estimated as 0. 15 log(10) cfu/g for mCCDA, 0. 14 log(10) cfu/g for Karmali, and 0. 18 log(10) cfu/g for CFA. As well, reproducibility performance of the three plating media was comparable. General R values {{which can be used}} when testing chicken meat samples are; 0. 28 log(10), 0. 32 log(10), and 0. 25 log(10) for plating on mCCDA, Karmali agar, and CFA, respectively. Measurement uncertainty associated with mCCDA, Karmali agar, and CFA using spread plating, for combination of all meat matrixes, were +/- 0. 24 log(10) cfu/g, +/- 0. 28 log(10) cfu/g, and +/- 0. 22 log(10) cfu/g, respectively. Higher uncertainty was associated with Karmali agar for Campylobacter enumeration in artificially inoculated minced meat (+/- 0. 48 log(10) cfu/g). The general performance of CFA medium was comparable with mCCDA performance at the level of artificially contaminated samples. However, when tested at naturally contaminated samples, non-Campylobacter colonies gave similar deep red colour as that given by the typical Campylobacter growth on CFA. Such colonies were not easily distinguishable by naked eye. In general, the overall reproducibility, repeatability, and measurement uncertainty estimated by our study indicate that there are no major problems with the precision of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10272 - 2 : 2006 protocol for Campylobacter enumeration using mCCDA medium...|$|E

For both E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae one of two methods was standardized for all laboratories (called standard method or SM), the other method was chosen by the participating laboratory (called OWN method). The highest counts were obtained using the E. coli standard method. Sixteen of the 25 laboratories found higher counts using the SM than with their OWN method. The group of laboratories using a resuscitation step for the E. coli-OWN method found significantly more colonies than the group which did not.

The reliability and comparability of data at European level is often limited, because analytical methods for emerging pollutants are often not fully validated, not harmonized or not suitable for all relevant matrices. This paper describes a collaborative interlaboratory exercise for the analysis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) residues in freshwater and wastewater, held in the framework of the EU project "Network of reference laboratories for monitoring of emerging environmental pollutants" (NORMAN). The NSAID compounds selected in this study were ketoprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac. Thirteen laboratories distributed along nine European Countries (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland) took part in this exercise, 126 samples were analyzed and a total number of 473 values in duplicate were collected. Samples selected in this study include environmental water (river water and waste water) and artificial water (fortified environmental and distilled water) with different ranges of complexity. Two analytical methods were proposed by the organiser; one is based on the use of solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and the second one is based on SPE followed by gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), however, in the first round some different approaches were also admitted. The main goals of this interlaboratory comparison were to evaluate the available analytical schemes for NSAID analysis in natural waters, to evaluate the repeatability (<b>r)</b> and <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>R)</b> between participating laboratories, and to evaluate the influence of the analytical method and sample matrices on the results.

Traces were found in 56 % of samples, while in 14 % of samples OTA was not detectable. Traces were also found in 4 % red organically grown samples. The most contaminated samples were three samples of red grapes, two from Central Greece (2. 69 ng OTA. g - 1 and 1. 41 ng OTA. g - 1), both-table and wine-making grapes.

The biosensor exhibits a detection limit of 10 mu mol L- 1, linearity up to 8 x 10 (- 4) mol L- 1, a sensitivity of 13. 4 mu A cm(- 2) mmol(- 1) L- 1, a good <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>R.</b> S. D. 2. 1 %, n = 6) and a stability of about 1 week when stored dry at 4 degrees C. Finally, the proposed biosensor was applied for the determination of glucose in different samples of sweet wine and validated with a commercial spectrophotometric enzymatic kit. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|BackgroundThe Death Receptor 6 (DR 6) {{protein is}} {{elevated}} in the serum {{of ovarian cancer}} patients. We tested DR 6 serum protein levels as a diagnostic/predictive biomarker in several epithelial tumors and sarcomas. MethodsDR 6 gene expression profiles were screened in publically available arrays of solid tumors. A quantitative immunofluorescent western blot analysis was developed to test the serum of healthy controls and patients with sarcoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, bladder, liver, and pancreatic carcinomas. Change in DR 6 serum levels was used to assay the ability of DR 6 to predict the response to therapy of sarcoma patients. ResultsDR 6 mRNA is highly expressed in all tumor types assayed. Western blot analysis of serum DR 6 protein demonstrated high <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>r</b> 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 60 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 600. 97). Compared to healthy donor controls, DR 6 serum levels were not elevated in patients with uterine carcinosarcoma, bladder, liver, or pancreatic cancers. Serum DR 6 protein levels from adult sarcoma patients were significantly elevated (p< 0. 001). This was most evident for patients with synovial sarcoma. Change in serum DR 6 levels during therapy correlated with clinical benefit from therapy (sensitivity 75...|$|R
40|$|Biliary {{excretion}} scintigraphy with a cholagogic {{test meal}} {{may be used}} to assess patients with suspected disorders of gall bladder motility. The interpretation of results is frustrated, however, by the lack of information about the range of normal responses in a form suitable for comparative analysis. We present the results of 41 gall bladder emptying studies on 32 normal healthy subjects (14 men, 18 women) 30 minutes after intravenous injection of 74 MBq 99 Tcm-EHIDA. Gall bladder emptying was provoked by the ingestion of 300 ml milk. Gamma camera scintigraphy was used to plot gall bladder activity against time. Gall bladder emptying occurred within 10 minutes in all men and 12 / 18 women (p = 0. 02). Gall bladder ejection fractions were significantly greater in women (p less than 0. 05). Duplicate studies in nine subjects showed good <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>r</b> = 0. 959). A plot of mean and (m + 2 SD) values of gall bladder activity against time has been derived. The data provide an estimate of normal gall bladder emptying response, which {{may be used to}} aid interpretation of clinical studies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an automated system for potentiometric determination of free and total cyanide which employs a homogeneous membrane tubular ion-selective electrode. After the electrode is assembled, it {{is connected to}} a system composed of 3 three-way solenoid valves, sample line, carrier line, acid stream, and gas diffusion chamber. A Turbo Pascal® computer program, developed specifically for this task, automatically performs all the steps involved in data acquisition and processing. The proposed analytical procedure offers operational simplicity, since detection is performed by a tubular electrode, whose assembly is fast and easy. The system has shown <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>r.</b> s. d. < 0. 5 %, n= 6) and high speed (30 readings/hour); it is efficient for determination of free and total cyanide in waste waters of starch processing plants. The detection limit was 1. 2 x 10 - 5 and 1. 5 x 10 - 5 mol L- 1, for determination of free and total cyanide, respectively. The linear response range was between 1. 2 x 10 - 5 and 1. 0 x 10 - 2 mol L- 1 for free cyanide and between 1. 5 x 10 - 5 and 1. 0 x 10 - 2 for total cyanide...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and reproducibility of black blood T 2 ∗ {{to the conventional}} bright blood sequence {{in the assessment of}} myocardial iron concentration. Materials and methods: We performed both conventional bright blood and black blood MRI T 2 ∗ sequences in 50 thalassemia major patients, the results were statistically analyzed to assess the correlation of techniques, study reproducibility and interobserver agreement. Results: Cardiac T 2 ∗ values ranged from 2. 39 to 47. 9  ms using bright blood sequence and 2. 07 to 46. 81 using the black blood sequence. There was positive significant correlation of both sequences in all patients. However the black blood technique was superior to bright blood technique as regards the study <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>R</b> 2 ∗ 1. 9  ±  versus 2. 4  ±  14. 7 p <  0. 001) in addition to the better inter-observer agreement of black blood technique compared to the bright blood technique (3. 2  ±  1. 2 versus 8. 3  ±  2. 4 p <  0. 001). Conclusions: Black blood T 2 ∗ technique provides clearly defined septal borders, avoids bright blood signal contamination of the myocardium, has superior study reproducibility and inter-observer agreement which favors this technique in the assessment of iron myocardial concentration...|$|R
40|$|Non-uniformity {{of steps}} within a flight {{is a major}} risk factor for falls. Guidelines and {{requirements}} for uniformity of step risers and tread depths assume the measurement system provides precise dimensional values. The state-of-the-art measurement system {{is a relatively new}} method, known as the nosing-to-nosing method. It involves measuring the distance between the noses of adjacent steps and the angle formed with the horizontal. From these measurements, the effective riser height and tread depth are calculated. This study was undertaken for the purpose of evaluating the measurement system to determine how much of total measurement variability comes from the step variations versus that due to repeatability and <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>R</b> 2 ̆ 6 R) associated with the measurers. Using an experimental design quality control professionals call a measurement system experiment, two measurers measured all steps in six randomly selected flights, and repeated the process on a subsequent day. After marking each step in a flight in three lateral places (left, center, and right), the measurers took their measurement. This process yielded 774 values of riser height and 672 values of tread depth. Results of applying the Gage R 2 ̆ 6 R ANOVA procedure in Minitab software indicated that the R 2 ̆ 6 R contribution to riser height variability was 1. 42...|$|R
