5|$|That year, <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> soured. Although Israel had {{previously}} supplied Uganda with arms, in 1972 Amin expelled Israeli military advisers {{and turned to}} Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and the Soviet Union for support. Amin became {{an outspoken critic of}} Israel. In return, Gaddafi gave financial aid to Amin. In the 1974 French-produced documentary film , Amin discussed his plans for war against Israel, using paratroops, bombers, and suicide squadrons.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Hezbollah {{decided to}} {{participate}} in elections, and Ali Khamenei, supreme leader of Iran, endorsed it. Former Hezbollah secretary general, Subhi al-Tufayli, contested this decision, {{which led to a}} schism in Hezbollah. Hezbollah won all twelve seats which were on its electoral list. At the end of that year, Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians. Hezbollah regards cultural, political, and religious freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified, although it does not extend these values to groups who have <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel.</b>|$|E

5|$|To {{enter the}} whole wheat bread market, the bakery {{imported}} its own wheat-cleaning machine from Hungary; the machine {{actually had to}} be smuggled out since Hungary did not have diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> at the time. However, health-food consumers were wary of the first whole-wheat loaves because they were white, not brown. Working with the Health Food Association, Angel's {{came up with the}} solution of adding all-natural molasses to the bread to give it a brown color.|$|E
5|$|Through French {{pressure}} on Libya and {{the mediation of}} Nigerien President Hamani Diori, the two countries resumed diplomatic relations on 17 April 1972. Shortly after, Tombalbaye broke diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> and {{is said to have}} secretly agreed on 28 November to cede the Aouzou Strip to Libya. In exchange, Gaddafi pledged 40 million pounds to the Chadian President and the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship in December 1972. Gaddafi withdrew official support to the FROLINAT and forced its leader Abba Siddick to move his headquarters from Tripoli to Algiers. Good relations were confirmed in the following years, with Gaddafi visiting the Chadian capital N'Djamena in March 1974; in the same month a joint bank was created to provide Chad with investment funds.|$|E
5|$|In September 1973, he {{returned}} to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be at the conference. At the conference he publicly broke off <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel,</b> citing its government's {{close relationship with the}} U.S. and its treatment of Palestinians during the Israel–Palestine conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally. As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to defend Syrian territory from Israeli incursions. Leaving Algiers, Castro visited Iraq and North Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Intent on {{propagating}} Islam, in 1973 Gaddafi {{founded the}} Islamic Call Society, which had opened 132 centres across Africa within a decade. In 1973 he converted Gabonese President Omar Bongo, an action which he repeated {{three years later}} with Jean-Bédel Bokassa, president of the Central African Republic. Between 1973 and 1979, Libya provided $500 million in aid to African countries, namely to Zaire and Uganda, and founded joint-venture companies throughout the country to aid trade and development. Gaddafi was also keen on reducing Israeli influence within Africa, using financial incentives to successfully convince eight African states to break off diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> in 1973. A strong relationship was also established between Gaddafi's Libya and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Pakistani government, with the two countries exchanging nuclear research and military assistance; this relationship ended after Bhutto was deposed by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977.|$|E

5000|$|Alarmed by Israel's uncompromising attitude, the President sent on 28 May 1949 {{a note to}} Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, expressing that he was {{not very}} pleased with the [...] "excessive Israeli claims to further {{territory}} within Palestine" [...] and its [...] "rejection of the basic principles of the Resolution set forth by the GA on 11 December 1948". The US position was that Israel should offer territorial compensation for any territory it had acquired outside the boundaries set forth in the UN resolution of 29 November 1947. The US warned that the Israeli attitude thus far at Lausanne [...] "must inevitably lead to a rupture in those conversations" ... "and that a rupture arising out of the rigid attitude of the Government of Israel would place a heavy responsibility upon that Government and people". The US warned for a revision of its <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the past, North Korea ran several {{military}} and civil assistance programmes {{to some of}} Africa's more radical states, including Guinea, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Mali and Tanzania. In return, North Korea was able to gain diplomatic recognition and other leverage; they were successful in ensuring South Korea was unable to join the Non-Aligned Movement. In Egypt's case the relationship was especially close; North Korean pilots flew Egyptian fighters in the 1973 Yom Kippur War and Egypt exported to North Korea scud missiles.

25|$|Since the {{establishment}} of full diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> in 1992, India has improved its relation with the Jewish state. India is regarded as Israel's strongest ally in Asia, and Israel is India's second-largest arms supplier. Since India achieved its independence in 1947, it has supported Palestinian self-determination. India recognised Palestine's statehood following Palestine's declaration on 18 November 1988 and Indo-Palestinian relations were first established in 1974. This has not adversely affected India's improved <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel.</b>|$|E

Since then relations between Croatia and Israel have been excellent. Croatia has an embassy in Tel Aviv and 4 honorary consulates (in Ashdod, Caesarea, Jerusalem and Kfar Shmaryahu). Israel has an embassy in Zagreb. In addition, Croatia does not recognize the State of Palestine.|$|E

40|$|Following the June 1967 War in the Middle East, the Polish {{communist}} regime launched an anti-Zionists campaign targeting the country’s Jews. In {{accordance with the}} Soviet position on the war, the Polish government severed <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> <b>Israel</b> and attacked Poland’s Jews, accusing them of supporting Israel against the official stance. The campaign intensified after student demonstrations in March 1968. As a result, thousands of Jews immigrated to Israel. This paper {{tells the story of}} the Israeli view on the anti-Zionist campaign and the new Polish-Jewish immigrants, or Olim, the Hebrew term. Relying on the Israeli press, the paper aims to reconstruct how mainstream Israel saw Polish Jewish relations and conceived of Polish Jews outraged the Israelis. It shows that Polish Jews, recently expelled from the country they considered home, received little sympathy in Israeli newspapers. The Hebrew press presented them as wayward sons of Israel, as men and women who had chosen the wrong path and betrayed their people. According to this narrative, Polish Jews should have foreseen that antisemitism would raise its head again in Poland. In some ways, the Israeli discourse mirrored the Polish one – in both cases Jews could not escape their natural-born identity and had only one homeland, the state of Israel...|$|R
50|$|While not {{inherently}} {{opposed to}} Israel, Indonesia places a higher value on avoiding trouble with radical Islamist elements at home {{than it does}} on establishing <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> far-away <b>Israel.</b> The precedent was established by President Sukarno, who brushed aside early Israeli approaches and eventually adopted a strong pro-Arab policy {{as part of his}} anti-colonialist worldview. The notable incident was the expulsion of Israel and the Republic of China (Taiwan) from the 1962 Asian Games held in Jakarta. Because of the pressure from Arab countries and the People's Republic of China, the Indonesian government refused to issue visas for the Israeli and Taiwanese delegations, thus refused the entry of delegations from Israel.|$|R
