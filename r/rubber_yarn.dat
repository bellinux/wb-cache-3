40|$|The logitudinal wave {{velocity}} along the natural <b>rubber</b> <b>yarn</b> {{was measured by}} the elastic pulse wave method under several extension ratios. Then the following results were obtained: 1. The longitudinal {{wave velocity}} along the natural <b>rubber</b> <b>yarn</b> increased monotonously with the increasing linear extension ratios r. 2. For r> 3. 5, the wave velocity was observed simultaneously the two wave velocities. 3. The low wave velocity increased slowly from 50 m/sec for r= 1. 5 to 400 m/sec for r= 7 and resembled to the inverse Langevien function for r/rmox, where rmox was the maximum value of the linear extension ratio. 4. The high wave velocity increased rapidly 350 m/sec for r= 3. 5 to 2000 m/sec for r= 7. 5. For r> 5, the X-ray diffraction photography shown that the natural <b>rubber</b> <b>yarn</b> was crystallized by the stretch...|$|E
25|$|Rubber {{produced}} as a fiber, sometimes called 'elastic', had significant {{value to the}} textile industry because of its excellent elongation and recovery properties. For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either an extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers cut into strips from extruded film. Because of its low dye acceptance, feel and appearance, the rubber fiber was either covered by yarn of another fiber or directly woven with other yarns into the fabric. <b>Rubber</b> <b>yarns</b> were used in foundation garments.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} the solid wastes of anthropogenic origin {{obtained from the}} stomach contents of juvenile green turtles, Chelonia mydas, on the eastern Rio de Janeiro state coast, southeastern Brazil (22 º 50 ’S – 23 º 00 ’S). Between June 2009 and May 2010, the stomach contents of 49 specimens stranded on beaches were analyzed. Solid wastes were recorded in 29 stomach contents (59. 2 %) {{and more than one}} category of wastes was found out in 22 samples. Plastic bags, categorized as flexible plastic materials, achieved the greatest occurrence frequency (96. 5 %). Perhaps, these wastes came from the disposal of garbage bags, raffia bags, commercial shop bags and various packaging. Wastes related to manufacture of fishing equipment were also often reported, such as nylon <b>yarns,</b> <b>rubber,</b> ropes, Styrofoam, and fishhooks. The region is an area of regular occurrence of C. mydas and the relatively large intake of solid wastes deposited in the environment poses a risk to the conservation of this species...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{mechanical}} model {{was introduced to}} analyze the hair wrapping via a contact surface in the yarn formation zone. Worsted and ramie/cotton rovings were then used to produce yarns on an experimental ring frame with and without a delivery rubber roller to validate the theoretical analysis. Yarn properties, including hairiness, unevenness, and tensile properties were tested and {{the results indicated that}} the delivery roller could stop fibers from escaping from the twisting process in the spinning triangle and wrap most of them onto the stem of the yarn. In particular for worsted spinning, yarn unevenness CV, as well as tensile properties, was improved significantly due to an improved arrangement of the worsted strand when using the front delivery <b>rubber</b> roller. However, <b>yarn</b> evenness and tensile properties deteriorated for ramie/cotton yarn spun with a delivery rubber roller. This was mainly because of the high modulus of the ramie/cotton blend strand, as upstream twists were blocked and a weak spinning zone was formed to incur an unexpected drawing. ...|$|R
