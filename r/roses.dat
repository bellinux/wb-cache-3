5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub <b>roses,</b> climbing <b>roses,</b> and old garden <b>roses</b> with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea <b>roses.</b> Old cottage garden <b>roses</b> include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba <b>roses,</b> which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E

Most of these disorders are characterized by stunting or dwarfing of plants accompanied by a partial wilt and dieback of shoots. Proliferation and epinasty often occurred. Apart from detected viruses (TSV. SLRSV) parts of degeneration syndrome have been transmitted by grafting other have failed to achieve any transmission of the causal agent. It seems likely that <b>rose</b> degeneration disorders in spite of symptom similarities are due to a complex of interacting factors including probably viruses...|$|R
