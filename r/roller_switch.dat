5000|$|Friedrich Natalis (1864-1935), who {{had been}} working for the Schuckert-Werke (later Siemens-Schuckertwerke) since 1897, had already {{developed}} the cam-switching principle in Germany before 1900. In 1895, however, Johann Sigmund Schuckert founder of the electrical engineering company Schuckert & Co supplied cam switches with cam rollers and spring-loaded individual switches (DRP 88586). Thus the term cam switch has been used for such and similar devices over the years. Schuckert also supplied the [...] "carbon control switch" [...] designed by Natalis since 1901 with copper-carbon switching devices with spark-blowers (common spark blowers for direct current or single-spark blowers for direct and alternating current). The main current cam switch retained some significance, even when the rifle control pushed it where it was more economical. In miniature machine construction, the cam switch probably did not appear until the early 1930s. In 1931 the American company General Electric GE released their switch SBl, a 20A auxiliary current control switch, basically a miniaturized image of the large main current control switches. The devices had simple interruption and silver crossover, in some cases they were equipped with a snap mechanism. in Europe around 1940, the first cam switch from Ghielmetti, Solothurn / Switzerland, began to replace conventional roller switches. Switches could also be supplied as auxiliary current control switches with corresponding circuits. They were marketed under the trade name Ghielmetti-Clavier. In September 1948, Kraus & Naimer(of Vienna) produced C15(15 A), the first company-owned cam switch. In 1949, the company also presented the world's first cam-designed cam switch. At the beginning of 1950, Kraus & Naimer cam switches C30 (30A) were followed with the same design. The Kraus & Naimer cam switches C16 to C200, which came into the market in the spring of 1951, had a decisive influence on the advancement of the cam switch and the introduction of the <b>roller</b> <b>switch</b> in electrical engineering. They had a double interruption and a motor switching capacity appropriate to the rated current. The large number of possible combinations and the extensive additional equipment as characteristic features were responsible for the later development of cam switches as an industrial standard. Kraus & Naimer developed the world's smallest cam switch (model CA4N), which is in the market since 1994.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone of}} the company was laid in Vienna in 1907 in the Wattgasse 53 in the 16th district Ottakring. The company initially produced knife switches, the forerunners of today's disconnectors, which are counted from construction to the simplest and the first electrical switches {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. The other main products in the first four decades of the company's existence were lever and <b>roller</b> <b>switches.</b> At the end of the 1920s the new plastic material bakelite was used in switch construction. Kraus & Naimer is the patent owner of numerous innovations in switchgear technology. For the first time, the company introduced a cam switch in the modular design (model C15) to the market in 1948, whereby customer-specific switches can be manufactured. The method of mass production of individual products is generally known in the industry also under the term mass customization.|$|R

5000|$|In June 1971, on the S/370-145 (one {{of which}} had to be [...] "smuggled" [...] into Cambridge Scientific Center to prevent anybody noticing the arrival of an S/370 at that hotbed of virtual memory {{development}} [...] - [...] since this would have signaled that the S/370 was about to receive address relocation technology). (Varian 1997:p29) The S/370-145 had an associative memory used by the microcode for the DOS compatibility feature from its first shipments in June 1971; the same hardware was used by the microcode for DAT. Although IBM famously chose to exclude virtual memory from the S/370 announcement, that decision was being reconsidered during the completion of the 145 engineering, partly because of virtual memory experience at CSC and elsewhere. The 145 microcode architecture simplified the addition of virtual memory, allowing this capability to be present in early 145s without the extensive hardware modifications needed in other models. However, IBM did not document the 145's virtual memory capability, nor annotate the relevant bits in the control registers and PSW that were displayed on the operator control panel when selected using the <b>roller</b> <b>switches.</b> The Reference and Change bits of the Storage-protection Keys, however, were labeled on the rollers, a dead giveaway to anyone who had worked with the earlier 360/67. Existing S/370-145 customers were happy to learn {{that they did not have}} to purchase a hardware upgrade in order to run DOS/VS or OS/VS1 (or OS/VS2 Release 1 [...] - [...] which was possible, but not common because of the limited amount of main storage available on the S/370-145).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{study and}} {{application}} of the coordination controller in Web Inspection System (WIS) involves the field of industrial inspection and machine vision technology. The online WIS consists of roller equipment, coordination controller, switch controller, a number of cameras, image management system and management server. Coordination controller based on FPGA design and the LVDS interface, CAN bus interface, is connected through the line with <b>roller</b> equipment, <b>switch</b> controller {{and a number of}} camera management server. The CCD camera is connected through the line with image processing systems, and the image processing system connected with management server. Coordinated controller uses a modular design to coordinate control system operation, reduce the CPU load and improve the efficiency of paper defect detection. It is also highly integrated, and able to reduce cabling and costs, so as to raise the efficiency of the controller development, reduce staff workload and improve the working environment...|$|R
