50|$|The {{track of}} PSMT was {{constructed}} by firm named Marsland and Price, who were based in Bombay. The track was 18 pound per yard (9 kg/m) <b>rail</b> <b>clipped</b> to iron sleepers 10 in by 8 in by ½ in (250×200×50 mm).|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} [...] "pre-gauged" [...] track {{available in}} the 1940s had steel <b>rails</b> <b>clipped</b> to a fiber tie base. This was called flexible track {{as it could be}} [...] "flexed" [...] around any curve in a continuous fashion. The sections were sold as three-foot lengths, and the rail ends were connected with a sheet metal track connector that was soldered {{to the base of the}} rail.|$|R

50|$|Trackwork {{supplies}} for phase 4 {{of the new}} line, after small quantities of South African rail, sleepers and fittings had been used up, were obtained from EU member state Poland. The entire order, signed on 1 August 2005, for 1,300 tons of rail, was delivered during 2005 and some was sent direct to WHR Ltd for use between Pen-y-Mount and Traeth Mawr Loop. The sleeper order comprised just over 21,000 steel sleepers and 84,000 elastic <b>rail</b> <b>clips</b> similar to the type manufactured by Pandrol. This was enough to complete the railway - though timber sleepers fitted with steel baseplates are used at stations and in various other places. These were all delivered in 2005.|$|R
25|$|By 2003, {{two-thirds of}} the city's {{streetcar}} tracks were in poor condition as the older track was poorly built using unwelded rail attached to untreated wooden ties lying on loose gravel. The result was street trackage falling apart quickly requiring digging up everything after 10–15 years. Thus, the TTC started to rebuild tracks using a different technique. With the new technique, concrete is poured over compacted gravel, and the ties are placed in another bed of concrete, which is topped by more concrete to embed <b>rail</b> <b>clips</b> and rubber-encased <b>rails.</b> The resulting rail is more stable and quieter with less vibration. The new tracks are expected to last 25 years after which only the top concrete layer needs to be removed in order to replace worn rails.|$|R
50|$|The newer Pandrol fastclip {{is applied}} {{at right angles}} to the <b>rail.</b> Because the <b>clip</b> is captive, it has to be {{installed}} at the time of manufacture of the concrete sleeper.|$|R
50|$|When {{it became}} {{possible}} to preserve wooden sleepers with mercuric chloride (a process called Kyanising) and creosote, they gave a much quieter ride than stone blocks {{and it was}} possible to fasten the <b>rails</b> directly using <b>clips</b> or <b>rail</b> spikes. Their use spread worldwide and acquired Vignoles' name.|$|R
2500|$|The rebuilt Overbrook {{line was}} {{essentially}} {{an entirely new}} line built along the original line's right of way. [...] As had been done with the Beechview line prior, the rebuilt line was completely double-tracked with continuously welded <b>rail,</b> pandrol <b>clip</b> fixation, upgraded catenary and signaling, and other improvements. [...] The line as rebuilt featured eight high-level platform ADA accessible stations and, unlike the Beechview line, did not retain any street-level stops. The Overbrook line reopened in June, 2004. [...] Coinciding with the opening, Port Authority purchased 28 additional light rail cars to support the line and increase overall system capacity. [...] At this time, the 55 existing cars were completely rehabilitated as well. Ironically there is no station in the Overbrook neighborhood since the rail line is built into a hillside where construction of an ADA accessible station would involve considerable complexity.|$|R
5000|$|Solid-state {{amplifiers}} incorporating transistors and/or op amps {{can be made}} {{to produce}} hard clipping. When symmetrical, this adds additional high-amplitude odd harmonics, creating a [...] "dirty" [...] or [...] "gritty" [...] tone. When asymmetrical, it produces both even and odd harmonics. Electronically, this is usually achieved by either amplifying the signal to a point where it is clipped by the DC voltage limitation of the power supply <b>rail,</b> or by <b>clipping</b> the signal with diodes. Many solid-state distortion devices attempt to emulate the sound of overdriven vacuum valves using additional solid-state circuitry. Some amplifiers (notably the Marshall JCM 900) utilize hybrid designs that employ both valve and solid-state components.|$|R
2500|$|If not restrained, rails would {{lengthen}} in {{hot weather}} and shrink in cold weather. To provide this restraint, the rail is prevented from moving {{in relation to the}} sleeper by use of clips or anchors. Attention needs to be paid to compacting the ballast effectively, including under, between, and at the ends of the sleepers, to prevent the sleepers from moving. Anchors are more common for wooden sleepers, whereas most concrete or steel sleepers are fastened to the <b>rail</b> by special <b>clips</b> that resist longitudinal movement of the rail. There is no theoretical limit to how long a welded rail can be. However, if longitudinal and lateral restraint are insufficient, the track could become distorted {{in hot weather}} and cause a derailment. Distortion due to heat expansion is known in North America as sun kink, and elsewhere as buckling. In extreme hot weather special inspections are required to monitor sections of track known to be problematic. In North American practice extreme temperature conditions will trigger slow orders to allow for crews to react to buckling or [...] "sun kinks" [...] if encountered.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{components}} of concrete track (rail and rail fastening system) in railway bridge deck ends are damaged and deteriorated by track-bridge interaction forces such as uplift forces and compression forces owing to their structural flexural characteristics (bridge end rotation). This {{had led to}} demand for alternatives to improve structural safety and serviceability. In this study, the authors aim to develop a transition track to enhance the long term workability and durability of concrete track components in railway bridge deck ends and thereby improve the performance of concrete track. A time-history anal-ysis and a three-dimensional finite element method analysis were performed to consider the train speed {{and the effect of}} multiple train loads and the results were compared with the performance requirements and German standard for transition track. Furthermore, two specimens, a normal concrete track and a transition track, were fabricated to evaluate the effects of application of the developed transition track, and static tests were conducted. From the results, the track-bridge interaction force acting on the track components (rail displacement, <b>rail</b> stress, and <b>clip</b> stress) of the railway bridge deck end were sig...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, we have {{developed}} computer vision methods for measurement of rail gauge, and reliable identification and localization of structural defects in railroad tracks. The rail gauge is {{the distance between the}} innermost sides of the two parallel steel rails. We {{have developed}} two methods for evaluation of rail gauge. These methods were designed for different hardware setups: the first method works with two pairs of unaligned video cameras while the second method works with depth maps generated by paired laser range scanners. We have also developed a method for detection of rail defects such as damaged or missed <b>rail</b> fasteners, tie <b>clips,</b> and bolts, based on correlation and MACH filters. Lastly, to make our algorithms perform in real-time, {{we have developed}} the GPU based library for parallel computation of the above algorithms. Rail gauge is the most important measurement for track maintenance, because deviations in gauge indicate where potential defects may exist. We have developed a vision-based method for rail gauge estimation from a pair of industrial laser range scanners. In this approach, we start with building a 3 D panorama of the rail out of a stack of input scans. After the panorama is built...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of several bridge deck fastening systems is being evaluated on the steel bridge at the Facility for Accelerated Service Testing (FAST) at the Transportation Technology Center, Pueblo, Colorado. Fastening systems tested to date include several variations using hook bolts, {{as well as}} spring clips. Results to date indicate that minor, inexpensive installation details can lead to significant increases in time required between maintenance. Details {{such as the use}} of double nuts and threaded fastener adhesive has proven to be particularly effective. At FAST, more than 500 million gross tons (MGT) of traffic passed over the bridge before tightening was required after this retrofit was applied. Other hardware details, {{such as the use of}} locking clips, can also increase time between maintenance; particularly in high-impact areas near <b>rail</b> joints. Locking <b>clips</b> have proven to extend maintenance cycles at FAST. But, some other hardware variations offered little or no benefit under the heavy axle load (HAL) traffic at FAST. Results for eight different deck fastener combinations are presented in this paper. Advantages and drawbacks, as well as failure modes, are noted based on the test experience at FAST. The bridge deck at FAST is a Conrail open-deck design with dapped oak ties. The deck has carried over 1, 200 MGT of 315, 000 -pound HAL traffic since installation in lat...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{official}} version of the thesis and therefore some confidential information has been removed. The aim of this thesis was to conduct a thorough investigation of truck drivers’ needs and desires regarding sun protection and blackout equipment in the cab and thereafter to develop a concept for a new system that met the customers’ and Volvo Truck’s requirements. The current system was evaluated through interviews with 21 truck drivers. The inquiry showed that to suit drivers of different heights the system needs greater adjustment abilities. Other problems included difficulty to reach parts {{of the system and}} gaps where light entered. Many drivers also wished for a bug net in the roof hatch. A benchmark showed that all competitors except for Scania provide different blind systems, although they are often optional in their biggest models. Only Renault’s biggest truck, the Magnum uses the blinds for both sun protection and blackout. In the other models curtains are used for blackout. The new system consists of blinds in the windshield, side window and roof hatch and is supplemented with a pair of curtains to black out the side window. The motorized windshield blind allows manual pull down and its guide rails are hidden and integrated with the A-pillars so that no gaps appear. The blind can be lowered {{all the way down to}} the dashboard thus working as both sun protection and blackout. To avoid the blind being lowered to far a safety button has to be pushed at the same time as the blind control button when activating the blackout position. For the side window the blind is used only for sun protection. On the driver side a manual blind is used but a motorized roller blind is provided as an option. On the passenger side it is possible to choose whether to have sun protection or not. If this is desired the sun protection consists of a motorized roller blind. The blinds are placed in a window cover and visible guide rails are placed on the outside of the cover. To allow the guide rails to follow the inclined shape of the side window a spring system is attached to blind’s hem bar. The roof hatch system consists of two blinds. The upper one is a bug net. It is manually operated and can be either rolled up on the roller tube or drawn out completely. Beneath the bug net is an opaque blind which is manually handled and can be placed in four positions, covering one fourth, one half, three fourths or the entire roof hatch. A motorized roller blind is provided as an option. To complete the system curtains are used to black out the side windows. They are attached to the curtain <b>rails</b> by “click-in” <b>clips.</b> Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
