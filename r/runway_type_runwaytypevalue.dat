40|$|This thesis evaluates a {{particular}} ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) system {{in order to}} determine its capabilities and limitations in locating defects in concrete structures; specifically tunnel linings, bridge decks, and pavements. The device, a phased-array ultrasonic tomography (UST) system that utilizes shear waves, is a significant advancement in NDT systems. Consequently, there is a need in structural engineering to verify new technologies by assessing their flaw-detecting capabilities in a variety of structural applications. The UST technique does not currently have a testing methodology that is field-ready. In order to develop a methodology, the system was evaluated based on its ability to detect simulated defects, then taken to the field to evaluate natural structural defects on public tunnels, pavements, and airport <b>runways.</b> <b>Types</b> of concrete defects the system is used to detect and localize include air- and water-filled voids, vertical cracks, horizontal delaminations, and abnormalities such as clay lumps. The device is also used to determine reinforcement depth and spacing as well as concrete thickness measurements. This research concludes that the UST system is exceptional at locating horizontal delaminations ranging from 0. 05 - 2. 0 mm (0. 002 - 0. 079 in.), and is able to differentiate between fully debonded and partially-bonded areas. Vertical cracks could only be detected once they begin to form parallel to the testing surface; however, omission of surface details was found to be a strong indicator of crack presence. Backwall surfaces up to a depth of 762 mm (30 in.) were successfully and accurately determined. Air- and water-filled voids as well as reinforcement details such as layout and depth were also successfully determined and located. With the exception of some medium-sized clay lumps (with a diameter of approximately 102 mm, or 4 in.) surrounding reinforcement, all clay lumps tested were also highly successful...|$|R

Vibration measurements were made {{on the floor and}} on the seat of the cabin on 21 cranes. Vibration levels were correlated with the characteristics of the cranes. The study showed that vibration accelerations increased with the span of the crane and were very dependent upon the state of the <b>runway.</b> The <b>type</b> of speed regulation and the position of the cabin also play a significant role. The suspension systems of the cabin and the seat are clearly inadequate to give significant reduction of the vibration.

40|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of the {{national}} airspace system, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees surveying programs with the goal of geolocating vertical features that penetrate 3 D Obstruction Identification Surfaces (OIS) around airfields. These OIS are defined mathematically and are based on the layout of the <b>runways,</b> the <b>types</b> of electronic navigation equipment used for each runway, and other factors. Under a series of interagency agreements, the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is tasked with supplying obstruction survey data to the FAA. Airport obstruction surveys have traditionally been conducted using a combination of photogrammetry and conventional field survey techniques. In this study, we investigate the use of airborne laser scanning technology for this application. Specifically, we examine the effects of varying the forward look angle, laser footprint, flying height, flying speed, scan angle, scan frequency, transmitted power, and receiver sensitivity, as these parameters relate to the detection and measurement of vertical obstructions. We present results of test flights over the Gainesville Regional Airport (GNV) using fourteen different configurations of an Optech ALTM 2050. The results are compared to field-surveyed obstruction data obtained by NGS. Our analysis shows that certain configurations of the airborne laser scanning system notably improve the detection of obstructions. In this study, the best results were obtained using a 20 ° forward tilt angle and a 0. 2 milliradian beam divergence from a flying height of 750 m. With this configuration, all obstructions were detected and the vertical accuracy (RMSE) was 0. 88 m when compared to the field-surveyed obstructions...|$|R
40|$|The Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) arrival flows are an {{important}} component of overall NAS efficiency and airline costs of operation. The efficiency of TRACON arrival flows {{is a function of the}} relative position of the final waypoint on the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) to the <b>runway</b> threshold, the <b>type</b> of approach (ILS, RNP, VFR), and the arrival vertical and longitudinal profile. A previous research established the presence of 16 unique arrival flows for the main runways (31 C, 4 R, 22 L and 13 C) at Midway International Airport (MDW), using 43 days of National Offload Program (NOP) radar track data. This paper uses an aerodynamic fuel burn model to estimate the fuel burn for these flows. The results of the analysis indicate that, during Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), the RNP approach to 13 C uses an average of 14 % less fuel than the ILS approach on to 13 C. For narrow body aircrafts, this is equivalent to on an average a savings of $ 47 per flight per approach (at $ 3 a gallon). During Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) the least average fuel burn arrival flow for VFR approach procedures is to runways 4 R or 31 C (174. 9 kg) followed by 13 C (+ 11 %), and 22 L (+ 19 %).

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{disturbances}} in heavy traffic during daytime, road works are carried out to an increasing extent during off-peak hours at night. The demands {{on the design of}} the work zone traffic control differ, however, considerably between daylight and darkness in order to achieve visual conditions that are acceptable for the road users. In order for the driver to be able to pass in a safe way the design of the work zone traffic control should not be possible to misunderstand. One requirement is that the visual conditions are good. The latter means that the strength of the total glare from opposing traffic, warning lights, work vehicles and work zone illumination must be limited. During night time the pavements are often wet or damp, particularly during winter time, which increases the reflexion in the pavement. The reflexion can conceal the road markings, alter the colour of the signs and markings, contribute to the glare and increase the complexity of the visual information to the driver. The risk is that the driver then misunderstands/misjudges the information and drives into the work zone. Within NORDFOU it has been decided to carry out a large co-Nordic project to investigate how to best avoid problems with glare and provide a good visual guidance at work zones where work is carried out during night time. The objective of the whole project is to improve the safety both for the road users passing the work zone in the dark and for people working within the work zone, and in particular road works during night time on major roads. Previously, primarily during the year 2005 fore preliminary studies have been carried out within the project concerning yellow running lights, work zone illumination, methods for measuring glare as well as reflexion on various types of pavements. In this report two pilot studies are described, both dealing with stationary road works on " 2 + 1 "- roadways, which were carried out during spring and autumn 2006, respectively. The first pilot study was carried out on an airfield outside Copenhagen, Denmark, where a work zone was built up on a <b>runway.</b> Two <b>types</b> of work zone illumination and a number of different variants of running lights (brightness, frequency, sequence, etc.) were tested. All assessments were made by a panel of experts consisting {{of the members of the}} project team, who were standing on a fixed distance from the work zone. Pilot study 2 was carried out on a real 2 + 1 road outside Linköping, Sweden, where a stationary work zone was established on the single lane part of the road. The pilot study included driving tests where the test subjects (drivers) were people older than 50 years. In this way a more realistic situation was obtained where the assessments were done when the test subjects drove past the work zone. The test subjects had to answer a questionnaire, and the speed of their vehicles as well as the speed of the ordinary traffic passing the work zone was registered...|$|R
40|$|M. A. (Geography) The {{development}} of a new airport usually brings with it the problem of aircraft noise pollution for land users located within about 15 km of the airport boundaries. Excessive aircraft noise levels can cause health problems for residents and workers, and be responsible for a decrease in residential property values in the noise impacted areas. This dissertation reviews the problems associated with aircraft noise, examines the predicted noise impact of aircraft operations at the proposed airport at La Mercy in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, and concludes with recommendations for future land use around the airport. A number of relatively small urban settlements (Tongaat, Verulam, Waterloo, La Mercy, Umdloti Beach) are located around the La Mercy airport site. Almost all of the land not used for urban sett~ements is used for cultivation of sugar cane - very little land remains undeveloped. The agricultural land will probably eventually be converted to urban use, given the close proximity to Tongaat, Verulam and Durban. As such, comprehensive land use planning may still be done in order to avoid {{development of}} land for uses which will not be compatible with the anticipated aircraft noise levels. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA of the United States) computerised Integrated Noise Model (INM), designed to model aircraft noise impact was used to derive contours representing aircraft noise exposure around the airport. Taking factors such as airport elevation, mean temperature, <b>runway</b> usage, aircraft <b>type,</b> and flight routes into account, a set of contours unique to the airport at La Mercy were produced. By overlaying the noise contours on land use maps, land uses which would be incompatible with aircraft noise, should the airport be constructed were identified. Recommendations were then iii made on future developments in those non noise compatible areas. Much of Tongaat would be exposed to a moderate noise impact, whilst small portions receive a substantial impact. The whole settlement of Waterloo, and the southern portion of Verulam would be exposed to a severe noise impact. The central and northern portions of Verulam would receive substantial and moderate impacts respectively. Mount Edgecombe and Duffs Road would be exposed to a substantial impact, whilst the northern suburbs of Durban including Westville would encounter a moderate impact. An examination was then made of the general principles for land development - physical requirements of commercial, industrial and residential land use, and locational requirements of these land users in relation to one another. Thereafter, undeveloped land (undeveloped from an urban point of view ie. land used for sugar cane cultivation) was identified, and broad recommendations made for developing that land for urban use, taking general land use development principles into accoun...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} CryoSat Calibration and Validation Experiment (CryoVEx) {{this work}} {{is related to the}} {{calibration}} and validation of ESA's AirborneSAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter System (ASIRAS). ASIRAS was designed to simulate the CryoSat SAR Interferometric Radar Altimeter (SIRAL) for reasons of pre-launch and simultaneous accuracy and backscatter studies by using a similar instrument. The purpose of the ASIRAS calibration and data validation is to provide confidence in estimates of the uncertainty of the ASIRAS data products such as surface elevation and phase difference. Error estimates of the ASIRAS surface elevation in different snow zones were assessed using simultaneously acquired reference surfaceheights from an airborne laser scanner (reference digital elevation model). The phase difference and coherence tests were performed using data acquired over corner reflectors. The data were collected over the main validation sites in Greenland (EGIG line), Austfonna (Svalbard) and Devon Ice Cap (Canadian Arctic) during five CryoVEx sea- and land icecampaigns in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Prior to the validation of the ASIRAS data, a calibration and dating concept was designed and implemented. The latter was necessary in order to align all instruments (GPS, INS, laser scanner and ASIRAS) exactly to one reference time(GPS-UTC). Several dating and instrument uncertainties (e. g. systematic errors in the laser scanner raw data and ASIRAS time shifts) could be solved and corrected. In order to derive the surface elevation, processing software for the determination of laser squinting angles, the geocoding of the laser heights, the interferometric processing, and the retracking of the ASIRAS echoes was developed. The accuracy of the ASIRAS surface elevation was examined along selected 2 km to 3 km long profiles for four different surface <b>types</b> (<b>runway,</b> dry snow and percolation zone of Greenland, and accumulation zone of Austfonna) byusing five different retracker algorithms. An overall rms accuracy of 0. 05 m was found, however with a varying offset to the reference DEM reaching from 0. 0 m for the runway to 1. 50 m for the dry snow zone. The findings are related to roughness and backscatter variations along the chosen profiles. In general, higher accuracy could be found in regions of lower radar wavelength related surface roughness. The large offset in the dry snow zone is most likely not caused by surface roughness but related to volume scattering within the snowpack. Furthermore, inhelm_grl_ 2007 the feasibility was demonstrated to derive the winter snow accumulation in the percolation zone of Greenland based on ASIRAS data. In the high altitude mode, ASIRAS allows the determination of across track surface slopes by means of interferometric processing. The analysis showed a difference of - 0. 43 /- 0. 81 m to the reference DEM with high rms values related to low coherence and unwrapping errors. Additional measurements, possibly at higher flight levels, are needed to investigate the overall low coherence. In summary, this comprehensive study proves the concept of ASIRAS as the core instrument for the Cryosat satellite validation. In addition, ASIRAS on its own may contribute significantly to a fundamental understanding of microwave signatures over land and sea ice. In this context, a forward model which simulates the ASIRAS response over different layered and non layered media will help to better understand and exploit the presented findings...|$|R
