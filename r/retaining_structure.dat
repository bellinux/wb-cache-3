We propose in this paper the construction of an information base that serves not only to calculate conventional <b>retaining</b> <b>structures,</b> but can also help in the selection of the optimal type of structure, best suited to the economic and environmental situation of a project. For this purpose, we begin firstly by a general patterning of <b>retaining</b> <b>structures,</b> and then, we conduct a systematic analysis of the <b>retaining</b> <b>structures</b> built in its environment, to detect any kind of existing interaction and interrelation.

40|$|The {{realistic}} {{estimation of}} seismic earth pressure is very {{crucial for the}} design of <b>retaining</b> <b>structures</b> in seismic-prone areas. Several researchers have developed analytical and numerical methods for the estimation of seismic earth pressure. Some experimental studies are also reported to clearly present the seismic behaviour of <b>retaining</b> <b>structures.</b> Pseudo-static and pseudo-dynamic methods are the ones which are popularly used for the calculation of seismic earth pressure. Pseudo-dynamic method is a modification of the conventional pseudo-static method by eliminating most of the limitations. Recently, the researchers have shown that the new dynamic method considering Rayleigh wave, which {{plays a major role in}} the calculation of seismic earth pressures to maintain compatible dynamic stress boundary conditions, is better than pseudo-dynamic method as validated through the available dynamic centrifuge test results.

The lengths of the on/off-ramps on the Barket Market side vary. In addition, four single span bridges have been connected to ramps to facilitate making U-turns. On the Barket Market side, with three of the four bridges, double U-turns are facilitated. The bridges are on spread footing with precast prestressed concrete girders.

40|$|Key {{aspects of}} the analysis, design and {{construction}} of the <b>retaining</b> <b>structure</b> for a central circular shaft inside the Olympic Stadium of Athens are described. As part of the opening ceremony of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, the shaft {{was used as an}} invisible underground entrance into the stadium, playing {{a key role in the}} ceremony. Given the significant depth and the large diameter of the shaft (both about 25 m), excavating and retaining under extreme time constraints and with presumed high water table constituted a challenge. It was accomplished with recourse to the observational method. The <b>retaining</b> <b>structure</b> comprised 1. 2 m diameter contiguous piles capped with a ring beam. The initial design used a form of top-down construction of the final 0. 75 m thick permanent concrete lining. Delays in starting the excavation necessitated that a depth of 17. 5 m be reached before any permanent lining could be constructed. The paper presents the design of the <b>retaining</b> <b>structure,</b> the developed finite element analysis, and the theoretical predictions during the various excavation stages. A detailed monitoring programme was implemented and utilised in the spirit of the observational method.

40|$|Abstract. Mechanical and {{deformation}} {{characteristics of}} pile-anchor <b>retaining</b> <b>structure</b> was analyzed by using numerical simulation method. The rationality of numerical model was also verified through comparing measured data in field test and numerical results. On {{the basis of}} this numerical model, Mechanical and deformation characteristics of pile-anchor <b>retaining</b> <b>structure</b> under three different construction procedures were analyzed individually. The results show that: the maximum horizontal displacement of pile is controlled effectively by applying anchoring force, and the global horizontal displacement of pile increases as well. Forced state of pile is changed from being bended on one side to being bended on both sides, and maximum moment value decreases heavily. Therefore, anchor cable reinforcement should be arranged at the head of construction procedure of pile-anchor <b>retaining</b> <b>structure.</b> The later anchoring force be applied, the closer inflection point nears the pile top.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the external stability of a waterfront reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> <b>structure.</b> Such structures, in addition to being subjected to normal hydrostatic pressures, are also subjected to earthquake, which gives rise to additional seismic inertia forces and hydrodynamic pressure. Simple pseudo-static approaches are adopted to calculate the seismic inertia forces on the waterfront <b>retaining</b> <b>structure,</b> and a conventional approach is used to estimate the hydrodynamic pressure. The failure wedge is considered to be confined by a planar rupture surface. The results are presented for direct sliding and overturning failure modes of the <b>retaining</b> <b>structure</b> (including results for sloped and vertical walls). By considering all combinations of forces, generalised expressions are developed for the length of geosynthetic reinforcement needed to counter these two modes of failure. The expressions are fairly simple, and can be used directly by practising engineers for the design of waterfront reinforced soil structures. The required geosynthetic length in the direct sliding mode increases from 0. 56 H to 5. 02 H when the horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient is increased from 0 to 0. 3. It has also been found that, of the two modes of failure, the direct sliding mode is critical. In addition, the requirement for geosynthetic reinforcement for a slope angle of 60 degrees to the horizontal is greater than that needed for a vertical wall (i. e. with a slope angle of 90 degrees). A parametric study is also presented. In addition to the horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient, the downstream water height, pore pressure ratio and soil friction angle all {{have a significant effect on}} the sliding and overturning stability of the waterfront <b>retaining</b> <b>structure.</b> Comparison of the present methodology with a previously existing methodology, but for the dry case, shows a close match...|$|E
