40|$|International audienceLearning {{analytics}} (LA) {{is often}} {{considered as a}} means to improve learning and learning environments by measuring student behaviour, analysing the tracked data and acting upon the results. The use of LA tools implies <b>recording</b> and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> student <b>activities</b> conducted on software platforms. This paper proposes a flexible, contextual and intuitive way to provide the teacher with full control over student activity tracking in online learning environments. We call this approach AngeLA, inspired by an angel guarding over LA privacy. AngeLA mimics in a virtual space the privacy control mechanism that works well in a physical room: if a person is present in a room, she is able to observe all activities happening in the room. AngeLA serves two main purposes: (1) it increases the awareness of teachers about the activity tracking and (2) provides an intuitive way to manage the activity tracking permissions. This approach can be applied to various learning environments and social media platforms. We have implemented AngeLA in Graasp, a social platform that fosters collaborative activities...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: For most {{countries}} in tropical and sub-tropical regions, coffee {{is the most}} valuable export commodity. It is {{a major source of}} revenue and foreign exchange for governments and their people. In the western world, coffee {{is one of the most}} consumed beverages, and the second most traded commodity after crude oil. However, its market is far from being perfectly competitive. There is generally over-supply of green coffee on the world market, and producers are greatly exposed to numerous risks. Besides producers and consumers, there are intermediary agents who play a determining role in the pricing mechanism. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, I will analyze the reasons for this market imperfection, the role of the intermediary agents, and the challenges facing producers and potential new market actors. Second, this paper will attempt to suggest a series of simultaneous actions that would foster the technology transfer and outsourcing <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> <b>activities</b> as sustainable solutions to correct this market’s imperfections...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> <b>activities</b> {{aimed at}} higher efficiencies and economical production were presented. Present {{focus is on}} low-cost process technology for higher-efficiency cells of up to 18 % or higher. Process development concerns center {{on the use of}} less than optimum silicon sheet, the control of production yields, and making uniformly efficient large-area cells. High-efficiency cell factors that require process development are bulk material perfection, very shallow junction formation, front-surface passivation, and finely detailed metallization. Better bulk properties of the silicon sheet and the keeping of those qualities throughout large areas during cell processing are required so that minority carrier lifetimes are maintained and cell performance is not degraded by high doping levels. When very shallow junctions are formed, the process must be sensitive to metallizatin punch-through, series resisitance in the cell, and control of dopant leaching during surface passivation. There is a need to determine the sensitivity to processing by mathematical modeling and experimental activities...|$|R

40|$|Distributed {{multimedia}} {{applications are}} sensitive to the Quality of Services (QoS) provided by their computing and communication environment. For example, scheduling <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> <b>activities</b> or network queueing delays may cause excessive jitter in a speech stream, rendering it difficult to understand. It is thus important to establish effective technologies to ensure delivery of QoS required by distributed multimedia applications. This proposal presents a new language for the development of distributed multimedia applications: Quality Assurance Language (QuAL). QuAL abstractions allow the specification of QoS constraints expected from the underlying computing and communication environment. QuAL specifications are compiled into run time components that monitor the actual QoS delivered. Upon QoS violations, application provided exception handlers are signaled to act upon the faulty events. Language level abstractions of QoS shelter programs from the heterogeneity of underlying infrastructures. This simplifies the development and maintenance of multimedia applications and promotes their portability and reuse. QuAL generates Management Information Bases (MIBs) that contain QoS statistics per application. Such MIBs may be used to integrate application level QoS management into standard network management frameworks...|$|R

In this context different generations of biorefinery complexes are evolving rapidly and highlight the numerous possibilities for the organization <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> <b>activities,</b> from supply to final markets. The evolution of these biorefineries has followed two main business models, the port biorefinery, based on the import of raw materials, and the territorial biorefinery, based on strong relationships with local (or regional) supply bases.

We develop the idea of a link between the biorefinery and its territory through several relevant theoretical approaches and demonstrate that the definition of ‘territorial biorefinery’ does not achieve, from these theoretical backgrounds, a consensus. More importantly, we emphasise that the theoretical assumptions underlying the different definitions used should be made explicit in order to facilitate the manner in which practioners study, develop and set up businesses of this kind. </p...|$|R
