Several years before the <b>Reading</b> <b>Circle</b> method became generally disseminated throughout the country—as early as 1879– {{a small group of}} earnest students gathered daily under the tutelage of Sullivan for the enthusiastic acquirement of knowledge. This was really the nucleus of the circle theory in Chicago. The two Reading Circles of the Sacred Heart Institution conducted by Sullivan were probably the most exhaustive in scope and most diversified in plan of entertainment of any of the literary classes of the city. They were organized in October, 1894, the Venerable Mother Barat Circle, named for the woman who established the order in Paris, and the other, the Mother Duchesne Circle, named for the first Superior of the American foundation.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, {{there was}} a major debate in the SPD about the tactics it would choose after the lifting of the Anti-Socialist Laws. A radical oppositional wing known as Die Jungen (The Young Ones) developed. While the party leaders viewed the {{parliament}} as a means of social change, Die Jungen thought it could at best be used to spread the socialist message. They were unwilling to wait for the collapse of capitalist society, as predicted by Marxism, rather they wanted to start a revolution as soon as possible. Although this wing was strongest in Berlin, Magdeburg, and Dresden, it also had a few adherents in Mainz, among them Rudolf Rocker. In May 1890, he started a <b>reading</b> <b>circle,</b> named Freiheit (Freedom), to study theoretical topics more intensively. After Rocker criticized Jöst and refused to retract his statements, he was expelled from the party. The same would happen to the rest of Die Jungen in October 1891. Nonetheless, he remained active and even gained influence in the socialist labor movement in Mainz. Although he had already encountered anarchist ideas {{as a result of his}} contacts to Die Jungen in Berlin, his conversion to anarchism did not take place until the International Socialist Congress in Brussels in August 1891. He was heavily disappointed by the discussions at the congress, as it, especially the German delegates, refused to explicitly denounce militarism. He was rather impressed by the Dutch socialist and later anarchist Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, who attacked Liebknecht for his lack of militancy. Rocker got to know Karl Höfer, a German active in smuggling anarchist literature from Belgium to Germany. Höfer gave him Bakunin's God and the State and Kropotkin's Anarchist Morality, two of the most influential anarchist works, as well as the newspaper Autonomie.|$|E
