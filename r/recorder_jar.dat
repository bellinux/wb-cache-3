The presence of gentamicin residues in milk after the recommended withdrawal period was also evaluated. Antimicrobial residues were analyzed by Delvotest® SP NT {{over a period of}} 12 days beginning after 24 hours the last gentamicin application. Some of Staphylococcus spp. isolates were biofilm producers (19. 05 %). Staphylococcus spp. showed high levels of resistance to neomycin (16. 95 %), penicillin G (10. 17 %), and ampicillin (10. 17 %). Multidrug resistance to all antibiotics tested was observed in 1. 69 % of the Staphylococcus spp. isolates. Among 1440 mammary quarter milk samples 24. 95 % presented gentamicin residues after the withdrawal period. Gentamicin residues were also detected in 3. 8 % of samples from calibrated glass <b>recorder</b> <b>jar</b> (n= 383) 4. 1 days after treatment. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics may lead to the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains as well as increasing the risk of presence of residues of these drugs in milk. These problems affect the milk quality and may become a public health problem...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} modern milking systems {{is the result}} of {{extensive}} field experience and trial and error. As milking systems become more complex, particularly in automated milking parlors, there is increasing need for engineering information for design and troubleshooting. There are several piping systems in a modern milking machine which must be sized to perform milking and CIP cleaning functions properly. The various piping systems must carry milk, air, or both while maintaining the proper vacuum levels to perform the milking function. The flow paths of milk and air for typical pipeline and recorder milking systems are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The piping systems which may be found in milking machines and their functions are: In pipeline systems- those systems without <b>recorder</b> (weigh) <b>jars</b> Milklines transport milk and air from the milking unit to the receiver in pipeline systems. Milklines supply milking vacuum to the claw. Steady air flow unobstructed by undersized lines or slugs of milk will produce a reasonably stable milking vacuum supply throughout the milkline system. In recorder systems- those systems with <b>recorder</b> (weigh) <b>jar...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, {{the band}} {{released}} an extended play entitled ...And a Time to Dance, which was well received by critics but only sold about 50,000 copies. [...] However, {{the sales of}} the EP earned the group enough money to purchase a Dodge van, enabling the band to tour throughout the United States for the first time. [...] The group began composing How Will the Wolf Survive? {{at the home of}} Pérez's brother-in-law, a time in which several songs, including [...] "A Matter of Time", were written. Pérez explained, [...] "We'd sit down with a guitar, a tape <b>recorder</b> and a <b>jar</b> of Taster's Choice, and we were coffee achievers all afternoon." ...|$|R
