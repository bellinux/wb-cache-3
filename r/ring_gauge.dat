50|$|There {{are three}} main types of ring gauges: go, no go, and master or setting <b>ring</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Go <b>ring</b> <b>gauges</b> {{provide a}} {{precision}} tool for production comparative gauging {{based on a}} fixed limit. Go gauges consist of a fixed limit gauge with a gauging limit based on the plus or minus tolerances of the inspected part. A go <b>ring</b> <b>gauge's</b> dimensions {{are based on the}} maximum OD tolerance of the round bar or part being gauged. A go plug gauge's dimensions are based on the minimum ID tolerance of the hole or part being gauged. The go plug (ID) gauge should be specified to a plus gaugemakers' tolerance from the minimum part tolerance. The go <b>ring</b> (OD) <b>gauge</b> should be specified to a minus gaugemakers' tolerance from the maximum part tolerance.|$|R
50|$|No-go or not-go gauges {{provide a}} {{precision}} tool for production comparative gauging {{based on a}} fixed limit. No-go gauges consist of a fixed limit gauge with a gauging limit based on the minimum or maximum tolerances of the inspected part. A no-go <b>ring</b> <b>gauge's</b> dimensions {{are based on the}} minimum OD tolerance of the round bar or part being gauged. The no go <b>ring</b> (OD) <b>gauge</b> should be specified to a plus gaugemakers' tolerance from the minimum part tolerance.|$|R

50|$|The {{size of a}} cigar is {{measured}} by two dimensions: its <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> (its diameter in sixty-fourths of an inch) and its length (in inches). In Cuba, next to Havana, there is a display of the world's longest rolled cigars.|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} {{setup for}} non-tactile high-precision measurements of roundness and cylindricity of <b>ring</b> <b>gauges</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. The aim is to overcome classical problems of tactile and radial roundness measurements such as the error influences of the used rotary table and the work piece alignment and thus to increase the accuracy and reduce the measurement time. To achieve those aims a double interferometer concept was chosen and combined with a measurement system for the work piece alignment, a high precision rotary table and an automated four-axes adjustment unit. The main alignment errors of the work pieces (e. g. <b>ring</b> <b>gauges)</b> such as eccentricity and tilting are either suppressed or directly detected and consequently reduced by the automated four-axes adjustment unit. Due to the non-tactile measurement concept and the contactless energy supply of the four-axes adjustment unit, the radial run of the rotary table is not affected.

5000|$|The {{smaller end}} cap (the [...] "top" [...] of the bottle) has a {{diameter}} that {{varies with the}} fuse rating: higher ratings have wider end caps.

50|$|The bust which {{swept the}} {{industry}} continued {{for a period}} of two years, a shakedown which resulted in the death of many fledgling companies. Many of the manufacturers who survived the downturn of the industry, generally basing their production in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, or Honduras, were able to reestablish themselves through the marketing of new and innovative shapes and sizes. Traditional <b>ring</b> <b>gauges</b> were de-emphasized in favor of thicker and longer products, a trend which has continued into the cigar market of the 21st century.|$|R
5000|$|A gauge cutter {{is a tool}} with a round, {{open-ended}} bottom {{which is}} milled to an accurate size. Large openings above {{the bottom of the}} tool allow for fluid bypass while running in the hole.Most often a <b>gauge</b> <b>ring</b> will be the first tool ran on a slickline operation. A <b>gauge</b> <b>ring</b> that is just undersized will allow the operator to ensure clear tubing down to the deepest projected working depth; for example 2 7/8" [...] tubing containing 2.313" [...] profiles would call for a <b>gauge</b> <b>ring</b> between 2.25" [...] - 2.30". A <b>gauge</b> <b>ring</b> {{can also be used to}} remove light paraffin that may have built up in the tubing. Often a variety of different sized gauges and/or scratchers will be run to remove parafin little by little.Gauge cutter can be used for drift runs also.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of quality}} control was {{a sketch of}} the desired item. If the sketch did not match the item, it was rejected, in a simple Go/no go procedure. However, manufacturers soon found it was difficult and costly to make parts be exactly like their depiction; hence around 1840 tolerance limits were introduced, wherein a design would function if its parts were measured to be within the limits. Quality was thus precisely defined using devices such as plug <b>gauges</b> and <b>ring</b> <b>gauges.</b> However, this {{did not address the}} problem of defective items; recycling or disposing of the waste adds to the cost of production, as does trying to reduce the defect rate. Various methods have been proposed to prioritize quality control issues and determine whether to leave them unaddressed or use quality assurance techniques to improve and stabilize production.|$|R

40|$|As it is {{necessary}} to supply uncertainty with measurement [1], fast, task-specific estimation of uncertainty is needed. A concept, already successfully implemented in roughness measurement [4, 5], is now adapted to be used for roundness measurements. The concept is implemented in software. As a result, uncertainty budgets for four different specimens, three <b>ring</b> <b>gauges</b> and a spherical standard, are given as examples of the presented concept. The results of these measurements show that noise and spindle errors are specimen dependent. Calculation of uncertainty Hybrid method A classical on-line uncertainty budget is set up, but elements of this budget, such as spindle errors and noise effects, are estimated using Monte-Carlo techniques [3]. The uncertainty budget is given for a single measurement; for calibration of a roundness standard, averaging reversal techniques are used for which the uncertainty is much smaller. The method means that for each influencing factor virtual measurements ar...|$|R

40|$|Multi-stage cascade impactors (CIs) are the {{preferred}} measurement technique for characterizing the aerodynamic {{particle size distribution}} of an inhalable aerosol. Stage mensuration is the recommended pharmacopeial method for monitoring CI “fitness for purpose” within a GxP environment. The Impactor Sub-Team of the European Pharmaceutical Aerosol Group has undertaken an inter-laboratory study to assess both the precision and accuracy {{of a range of}} makes and models of instruments currently used for optical inspection of impactor stages. Measurement of two Andersen 8 -stage ‘non-viable’ cascade impactor “reference” stages that were representative of jet sizes for this instrument type (stages 2 and 7) confirmed that all instruments evaluated were capable of reproducible jet measurement, with the overall capability being within the current pharmacopeial stage specifications for both stages. In the assessment of absolute accuracy, small, but consistent differences (ca. 0. 6 % of the certified value) observed between ‘dots’ and ‘spots’ of a calibrated chromium-plated reticule were observed, most likely the result of treatment of partially lit pixels along the circumference of this calibration standard. Measurements of three certified <b>ring</b> <b>gauges,</b> the smallest having a nominal diameter of 1. 0  mm, were consistent with the observation where treatment of partially illuminated pixels at the periphery of the projected image can result in undersizing. However, the bias was less than 1 % of the certified diameter. The optical inspection instruments evaluated are fully capable of confirming cascade impactor suitability in accordance with pharmacopeial practice...|$|R
