40|$|The {{influence}} of atmospheric exchange conditions on near surface PM 10 concentrations is analysed for four {{cities in the}} South-West-Germany in the period 2001 to 2005.

MG degradation by ZVI and ZVI/US treatment followed the first-order kinetic equation.

In this study we characterized a family of poly(N iso propylacrylamide co-hydroxymethylacrylamide) copolymers Although poly(N isopropylacrylamide) shows very high thermal stability (up to 360 C) introduction of hydroxy side chains leads to a significant reduction in stability and new degradation processes become apparent. Thermogravimetric analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT IA) indicate that the first degradation process involves a chemical dehydration step (110 - 240 degrees C) supported by the nonreversing heat flow response in modulated temperature differential scanning calonmetry. Water loss scales with the fraction of hydroxy monomer in the copolymer.

Aspergillus species form one of the best studied fungal genera in this field, and several species are used for the production of commercial enzyme cocktails.

Methods: The effects of <b>radation</b> time, turbidity, pH and temperature were invistigated in this study. Ultraviolet lamp used in this study was a 11 W lamp and intensity of this lamp was 24 µw / cm 2.

Despite the completion of numerous experimental studies on RAR, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. In this study, we aimed to have a comprehensive investigation on the RAR induced in the AG 01522 human fibroblasts first exposed to 5 cGy (priming dose) and then followed by 2 Gy (challenge dose) of X-ray through comparisons to those cells that had only received a single 2 Gy dose. We studied how the priming dose affected the expression of gene transcripts, and to identify transcripts or pathways that {{were associated with the}} reduced chromosomal damages (in {{terms of the number of}} micronuclei) after application of the challenging dose. Through the mRNA and microRNA microarray analyses, the transcriptome alteration in AG 01522 cells was examined, and the significantly altered genes were identified for different irradiation procedures using bioinformatics approaches. We observed that a low-dose X-ray exposure produced an alert, triggering and altering cellular responses to defend against subsequent high dose-induced damages, and accelerating the cell repair process. Moreover, the p 53 signaling pathway was found to play critial roles in regulating DNA damage responses at the early stage after application of the challenging dose, particularly in the RAR group. Furthermore, microRNA analyses also revealed that cell communication and intercellular signaling transduction played important roles after low-dose irradiation.

40|$|We show that, in {{contrast}} to known results in the massive case, a minimally gauged massless Rarita-Schwinger field yields consistent classical and quantum theories, with a generalized fermionic gauge invariance. To simplify the algebra, we study a two-component left chiral reduction of the massless theory. We formulate the classical theory in both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian form for a general non-Abelian gauging, and analyze the constraints and the Rarita-Schwinger gauge invariance of the action. An explicit wave front calculation for Abelian gauge fields shows that wave-like modes do not propagate with superluminal velocities. The quantized case is studied in gauge covariant radiation gauge and Ψ_ 0 = 0 gauge for the Rarita-Schwinger field, by both functional integral and Dirac bracket methods. In Ψ_ 0 = 0 gauge, the constraints have the form needed to apply the Faddeev-Popov method for deriving a functional integral. The Dirac bracket approach in Ψ_ 0 = 0 gauge yields consistent Hamilton equations of motion, and in covariant radiation gauge leads to anticommutation relations with the correct positivity properties. We discuss relativistic covariance of the anticommutation relations, and of Rarita-Schwinger scattering from an Abelian potential. We note that fermionic gauge transformations are a canonical transformation, but further details of the transformation between different fermionic gauges are left as an open problem.

This study characterised four engineered nanomaterials (capped and uncapped silver nanoparticles (cAgNP and uAgNP), titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO,NP) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)) and measured their toxicity to bacterial pure cultures and aquatic microbial communities, with focus on two key processes (i. e. hydrocarbon-degradation and ammonia oxidation). Whilst the TiO,NP and MWCNT were non-toxic up to 50 mg both the cAgNP and uAgNP demonstrated bacterial toxicity between 5 - 50 mg with differential toxic responses obseNed by a range of different bacterial species tested. In general, a greater toxic response was elicited by the smaller cAgNP compared to the larger uAgNP. Freshwater and marine microbial communities demonstrated some resilience to AgNP in terms of cell viability, enzyme activity and hydrocarbon biodegradation rates. Furthermore, microbial nitrification potential in estuarine sediments demonstrated recovery following an initial decline in response to 50 mg L· 1 cAgNP. Aquatic microbial community compositions were in general, sensitive to uAgNP and cAgNP between 0. 5 to 50 mg. Since the nanoparticle concentrations tested herein are greater than current predicted environmental concentrations, it is suggested that microbial-mediated processes such as hydrocarbon-deg <b>radation</b> and ammonia oxidation are unlikely to be impacted by exposure to AgNP at present.

The production of nuclear filters with defined porous radii in the µm-level is achievable with special etching procedures of SSNTD. despite a wide application of SSNTD the morphology of the latent tracks in SSNTDis the little investigated up to now. - One of the useful methods for non-destructive characterization of the morphology of these latent and etched ion tracks is the small angle neutron scattering (SANS). The investigations on SSNTD with SANS experiments were realized on the MURN facility of the pulsed reactor IBR- 2 at the JINR, Dubna. The experimental results shall demonstrate the possibilities of this method for studying the morphology of latent tracks. A stack of PETP foils (the thickness of a single foil is of about 10 µm, total thickness of the stack is of about 0. 8 mm) are used for the measurements. At sample positron the cross section for the neturon beam is of about 1. 5 cm(exp 2). the PETP samples irradiated by Kr- 84 ions (energy 2. 50 meV per nucleus) were investigated. The radii of gyration R(ind g) calculated from the slope of the scattering curve are of about 7 nm for latent ion tracks and move within a range of about 7 nm to 20 nm for etched tracks. The R(ind g) values are increasing with the etching time. The Guinier-plots of the etched samples show regions with different slopes, that is two R(ind g) values. The R(ind g) values measured by SANS were compared with the R(inde) values measrued by a conductometric method...|$|E
40|$|Summary: We {{present the}} {{angiographic}} and MR imaging {{course of a}} 62 -year-old man with a right parietal high-flow arteriovenous malformation (AVM), which was diagnosed because of seizures. A spontaneous, complete, and asymp-tomatic occlusion of the AVM was confirmed by a second angiography 3 months later. The possible mechanisms leading to the occlusion are discussed, and {{a brief review of}} the literature is given. Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are a rare cause of neurologic symptoms. The incidence is es-timated at about 0. 02 – 0. 05 % of the population (1). The AVM can be localized in any part of the cen-tral nervous system. Many different systems of classification have been proposed (2). Apart from seizures and focal neurologic defi-cits, bleeding is the most frequent complication of AVM. The risk of hemorrhage depends on locali-zation and previous bleeding and is estimated to be about 2 – 4 % per year (3, 4) with a 30 % risk of death. Therapeutic options comprise surgery for su-perficially located AVMs, <b>radation</b> therapy, and en-dovascular procedures, but all of these treatment options have an inherent risk of complications. Unfortunately, a spontaneous occlusion—com-plete or incomplete—seems to occur in only 1 – 3 % of all patients with a cerebral AVM (5). In 70 % of such cases, the cerebral AVM occludes after symp-tomatic intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (5 – 7). Several possible pathologic mechanisms are still being discussed (5), with thrombosis of the ni-dus of the AVM (8 – 10) as the most important factor. We describe the angiographic and MR imaging follow-up examinations of a man with a right pa-rietal, high-flow AVM. A spontaneous, complete, and asymptomatic occlusion of the AVM was re-vealed by a second angiography...|$|E
40|$|Most AAAs {{contain an}} intraluminal {{thrombus}} (ILT) and {{the volume of}} the ILT correlates with aneurysm size. The thrombus-covered wall is a common site for rupture after bleeding into the ILT. The hypothesis for this thesis was generated when Kazi et al discovered differences in AAA wall between ILT covered and ILT free aortic wall. From computed tomography images of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms containing an eccentric intraluminal thrombus, the aortic wall appeared to be partially in direct contact with the blood flow on one side, while the opposite aortic wall was covered by the ILT. In that study they concluded that the aorta portion situated under the ILT is thinner, with fragmented elastin fibers, apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and generally is more degraded compared to the AAA wall, which is not under the ILT. This characteristic difference was postulated to be due to mere presence of the ILT. In this thesis we investigated the role of the ILT in AAA by concentrating on the content of the ILT in terms of proteases and their activities and inhibitors. We have collected ILT and AAA wall from 57 patients (14 women, 43 men) obtained dur- ing elective surgery and examined them by proteomic methods. We have found that MMP 1 - 2 - 9, and 13 and elastase and inhibitors, a- 1 anti-trypsin, TIMP- 1 and PAI- 1 are present in the various layers of the ILT, but mostly active in the layer adja- cent to blood flow. We also found significant amounts of MMP 9 in complex with N-GAL in AAA tissue. Activity of MMP 9 is preserved upon binding to N-GAL. Further, unpublished data show that membrane bound proteases are present and carried by microvesicles and are active in the ILT, particularly in the acellular layer of the ILT adjacent to the aortic wall. In summary, ILT contains various active proteases. These proteases may contribute to deg- <b>radation</b> of the vessel wall and concomitantly lead to AAA rupture...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Plant biomass is {{the major}} {{substrate}} {{for the production of}} biofuels and biochemicals, as well as food, textiles and other products. It is also the major carbon source for many fungi and enzymes of these fungi are essen‑ tial for the depolymerization of plant polysaccharides in industrial processes. This is a highly complex process that involves a large number of extracellular enzymes as well as non‑hydrolytic proteins, whose production in fungi is controlled by a set of transcriptional regulators. Aspergillus species form one of the best studied fungal genera in this field, and several species are used for the production of commercial enzyme cocktails. Results: It is often assumed that related fungi use similar enzymatic approaches to degrade plant polysaccharides. In this study we have compared the genomic content and the enzymes produced by eight Aspergilli for the deg‑ <b>radation</b> of plant biomass. All tested Aspergilli have a similar genomic potential to degrade plant biomass, with the exception of A. clavatus that has a strongly reduced pectinolytic ability. Despite this similar genomic potential their approaches to degrade plant biomass differ markedly in the overall activities as well as the specific enzymes they employ. While many of the genes have orthologs in (nearly) all tested species, only very few of the corresponding enzymes are produced by all species during growth on wheat bran or sugar beet pulp. In addition, significant differ‑ ences were observed between the enzyme sets produced on these feedstocks, largely correlating with their polysac‑ charide composition. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that Aspergillus species and possibly also other related fungi employ sig‑ nificantly different approaches to degrade plant biomass. This makes sense from an ecological perspective where mixed populations of fungi together degrade plant biomass. The results {{of this study indicate that}} combining the approaches from different species could result in improved enzyme mixtures for industrial applications, in particular saccharification of plant biomass for biofuel production. Such an approach may result in a much better improvemen...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{analytical and}} {{finite element analysis}} (FEA) results of the thermo mechanical non linear response of an axi symmetric circular sandwich plates with a compliant foam core. The study investigates the load thermal interaction response of a sandwich panel where {{the properties of the}} core are temperature dependent and degrade as the temperatures are raised. It presents briefly the governing equations for a sandwich plate based on the principles of the high order sandwich panel theory (HSAPT) which incorporates the effects of the vertical flexibility of the core material as well as the effects of tem perature independent/dependent mechanical properties of the foam core. The effects of the thermal deg <b>radation</b> of core material on the thermo mechanical non linear response of a simply supported circular sandwich plate are studied through the analytical and FE models. The difficulties involved in non linear geometrical FE modeling of sandwich panels with a compliant ‘‘soft” core with temperature dependent mechanical properties are discussed. The HSAPT model predictions are compared very well with FE result. An important conclusion of the study is that the interaction between mechanical loads, tempera ture induced deformations, and degradation of the mechanical properties due to elevated temperatures, may seriously affect the structural integrity of foam cored sandwich plates.
