A fundamental geometrical analysis has then been carried out on the major cutting edges of the modified drills according to the national and international standards. It has been shown that this new drill design results in {{a significant increase in the}} normal rake angle at lips as well as point relieving at the chisel edge region. Geometrical models for the various drill point features have been established which uniquely define the drill point features of the modified drill design. A comprehensive experimental investigation has been carried out to study the drilling performance of the modified drills, when drilling a high tensile steel, ASSAB 4340, with TiN coated high speed steel drills over a wide range of drilling conditions. Comparing to the drilling performance with conventional twist drills under the corresponding conditions, it has been found that the modified drills can reduce the thrust force by as much as 46. 9 % with the average of 23. 8 %; the reduction of drilling torque is also significant at an average of 13. 2 % and the maximum of 24. 9 %. Similarly, the new drill design shows great superiorities over the conventional drills in terms of drill-life. In the drill-life tests, a few conventional drills were broken, but all plane <b>rake</b> <b>faced</b> drills performed very well. In order to estimate the cutting performance in process planning on a mathematical and quantitative basis when drilling with the modified drills, predictive cutting force models have been developed based on the unified-generalized mechanics of cutting approach.

The wear mechanisms of carbide cutting tools were investigated in machining Inconel 718, titanium alloy Ti– 6 Al– 4 V extra-low interstitial, and aluminum metal matrix composite (AlSi/AlN MMC) at their high cutting speed regime.

The turning parameters studied were, cutting speed of 120 m/min., feed rate of 0. 15 mm/rev- 0. 4 mm/rev, and depth of cut of 0. 6 mm- 1. 0 mm. The {{results show that the}} tool life was significantly controlled by the type of air coolant used, whereas the cutting force and surface roughness were not influenced by these coolants.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{suggestions}} are current concerning the <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> action of cutting lubricants; that they reduce the shear stress between chip and tool uniformly {{over the whole}} chip-tool contact area; that they reduce the con-tact length between chip and tool; and that they induce conditions on the <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> of the tool in which the interfacial shear stress between chip and tool decreases rapidly with distance from {{the cutting edge of}} the tool. The present work describes experiments on the dry and lubricated orthogonal machining of high permeability iron which have enabled it to be decided which of these theories is correct. The workpiece flow pattern in lubricated machining has been recorded with sufficient accuracy to enable the slip-line field for the flow to be calculated. The shear-stress distribution along the plastic part of the chip-tool contact length has been deduced from the angles at which the slip lines meet the <b>rake</b> <b>face.</b> It has been found that even when the workpiece was flooded with carbon tetrachloride, sticking friction occurred between the chip and tool near the cutting edge of the tool, although good lubrication occurred in the region where the chip left the tool. It has therefore been concluded that the lubricant acted to induce a steep interfacial shear-stress gradient along the chip-tool contact length. The cause of the shear-stress gradient along the <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> in lubricated cutting is discussed in terms of the vary-ing conformity between the chip and tool along the chip-tool contact length. Near the cutting edge of the tool, gross plastic deformation of the workpiece caused the chip to flow into intimate contact with the <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> of the tool, denying lubricant a path along the <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> to the cutting edge. A theory of the mechanics of orthogonal cutting is presented which explains how the shear-stress gradient along the chip-tool contact length causes the characteristic features of lubricated machining, namely the forma-tion of thin and, in particular, tightly curled chips with a small area of contact with the tool <b>rake</b> <b>face...</b>|$|E

In this paper, an extensive experimental study has been conducted to better understand the dynamic, tribological, and thermal characteristics of high speed milling of CFRPs, in the range of 10, 000 to 40, 000 rpm (200 to 800 m/min, for 6. 35 mm end-mill). The material used was a quasi-isotropic laminate comprising 35 plies of woven graphite epoxy. The tool wear was investigated on the flank and the <b>rake</b> <b>faces.</b> The machined slots were characterized in terms of straightness errors, dimensional errors, surface roughness, and delamination. The tool over-hang controls the tool dynamics, in this high speed range, and significantly affect various quality attributes of the produced holes; roughness, dimensional errors, and straightness. Similar trends were observed for the forces and the temperatures, whereby there is a given speed at which they reach a minimum and then they start to increase for higher speeds. The machining force and temperature trends with varying speeds and feeds are controlled by the chip load, the specific cutting pressures, and the effect of the frictional forces. The increased tool wear was found to directly affect the cutting forces and consequently lead to high delamination and surface roughness. The milled surface quality was mainly controlled by the feed rate. Limited surface delamination was observed due to the low axial forces associated with the routing process. Copyright 9 2012 by ASME.
