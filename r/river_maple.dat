These names include (but are not limited to) ash-, cut-, or three-leaf (or -leaved) maple; ash maple; sugar ash; Negundo maple; and <b>river</b> <b>maple.</b> [...] In Canada it {{is commonly known as}} Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple.

5000|$|The Little Sioux River is a {{river in}} the United States. It rises in southwestern Minnesota near the Iowa border, and {{continues}} to flow southwest for 258 mi across northwest Iowa into the Missouri River at Little Sioux. The Little Sioux River was known as Eaneah-waudepon or [...] "Stone River" [...] to the Sioux Indians. Its tributaries include the Ocheyedan <b>River,</b> <b>Maple</b> River and the West Fork of the Little Sioux River. The Little Sioux River is integral to the Nepper Watershed Project, a major Iowa flood control and soil conservation program that was introduced in 1947.|$|E
50|$|The Little <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> is a 16.5 mi {{tributary}} of the <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> in {{the central part of}} the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. It rises in Victor Township, Clinton County at the outlet of Cedar Lake. It flows through Sleepy Hollow State Park which surrounds Lake Ovid. Lake Ovid was created by damming the Little <b>Maple</b> <b>River.</b> The Little <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> joins the <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> in Ovid Township, Clinton County.|$|R

A dam on <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> marsh holds water in the marsh as flow in <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> drops following spring run-off.

50|$|All {{the hard}} work proved to be {{successful}} and in 1973 Coulter and Pocomo helped organize the Fraser Valley Rugby Union. The Fraser Valley Rugby Union launched with thirteen clubs, which included no less than five from the U.S. A few fledgling clubs such as Port Coquitlam, Pitt <b>River,</b> <b>Maple</b> Ridge and the U.S. sides have come and gone, only to occasionally resurface. Pocomo continued to grow {{as one of the}} pillars of the Fraser Valley and by 1983 they would field four senior men’s teams. The Club has won numerous league championships as well as various members were given the Vic Coulter Service Award, for their contribution to rugby in the Fraser Valley.|$|E
50|$|As the glacial ice receded {{from what}} is the central Lower Peninsula of Michigan around 11,000 years ago, the Maple River and lower Grand River served as a {{drainage}} channel for the meltwater. The channel ran east to west, emptying into proglacial Lake Chicago, the ancestor of Lake Michigan. Today the Grand River rises in Somerset Township in Hillsdale County and Liberty Township in Jackson County, and flows through Jackson, Ingham, Eaton, Clinton, Ionia, Kent, and Ottawa counties before emptying into Lake Michigan. Its watershed drains an area of 5572 sq mi, including 18 counties and 158 townships. Tributaries of the river include (beginning near river source and travelling downstream): Portage River, Red Cedar River, Looking Glass <b>River,</b> <b>Maple</b> River, Bellamy Creek, Flat River, Thornapple River, Rogue River, Coldbrook Creek, Plaster Creek, Bass River, and Crockery Creek. The Grand River carries an average 3,800 ft³/s (108 m³/s). It has several dams along its length but is a trout and salmon stream for much of its length. It is estimated that 22% of the pesticide usage in the Lake Michigan watershed occurs in the Grand River drainage, which accounts for only 13% of the lake's total watershed. Much of the basin is flat, and it contains many swamps and lakes.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources, Fisheries, Biology, 2007 Elevated {{turbidity}} {{and suspended}} sediment loads {{have been documented}} to negatively effect salmonids and their habitats. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the effect of elevated turbidity levels on the physiology and behavior of salmonids. However, the effects of turbidity on fish in a natural setting are largely uncertain. The goal {{of this study was}} to extend the understanding of turbidity effects to natural settings in coastal northern California where impacts to salmonids may occur both as a result of impaired visual capability and reduced prey availability. I compared foraging success and growth of rainbow trout/steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in reaches immediately above and below a sediment point source in each of two tributaries of the Mad <b>River</b> (<b>Maple</b> and Ca??on creeks) during small storm events in 2004 - 2005 and 2005 - 2006. Movements of tagged individuals within and between reaches of Maple Creek were monitored using paired fixed antennas at the upper and lower ends of each reach. Increases in turbidity above background levels did not appear to have substantial negative effects on the feeding success or growth of salmonids. Fish actively fed during small storm events, as evidenced by stomach fullness values. Feeding was predominantly from the benthos, on oligochaetes and salmonid eggs, rather than from the drift. Growth of tagged individuals showed no apparent relationship with median reactive distance, and varied widely among sampling dates. Fish moved considerably during storm events, most often in an upstream direction. Retention of tagged individuals within a sampling reach was low.

40|$|A {{new group}} name, the Yellow Spring Group, is {{designated}} for those formations herein {{removed from the}} Kinderhook Series and assigned as the uppermost unit in the Upper Devonian Series. The formations comprising the Yellow Spring Group are, in descending order, the English <b>River</b> Formation, the <b>Maple</b> Mill Shale, the Aplington Formation and the Sheffield Formation. In spite of the gradational English <b>River</b> - <b>Maple</b> Mill contact in southeastern Iowa, and the local absence of English <b>River</b> and <b>Maple</b> Mill in northcentral Iowa, these formations have significant lithologic features in common that justify their recognition as a rock-stratigraphic unit with group status.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the potential for}} restoration of the <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> in western Michigan (Muskegon and Newaygo Counties). The <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> is an abandoned anabranch channel of the Muskegon River. Historically the Muskegon split to form Maple Island but in the late 19 th century flow was diverted down the northern channel of the Muskegon and the southern branch became {{what is now the}} <b>Maple</b> <b>River.</b> In the field I mapped the existing and underlying historic channel bottom size and shape. Then using HEC-RAS I developed a one-dimensional hydraulic model of the <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> channel for both present and past condition. The model outputs were used to explore channel bankfull conveyance capacity and flooding thresholds. In addition I performed Weighted Useable Area (WUA) analysis to estimate potential increases in hydraulic habitat that restored connectivity with the Muskegon River might bring. Fishes in the <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> were found to be less plentiful in diversity and evenness when compared to the Muskegon River. With the removal of nearly a meter of soft sediment the restored channel model provided more conveyance capacity than the existing channel model and contributed to an increase in hydraulic capacity for some of the life stages of the species of interest in this study. Hydraulic weighted useable area was predicted to increase for the eggs of chinook salmon, adult walleye, and both juvenile and adult steelhead under the restored channel model conditions. There is much more research necessary to weigh all the options for a restoration of the <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> but there is evidence that hydraulic habitat may be improved for some fishes with the removal of the accumulated sediment throughout the <b>Maple</b> <b>River</b> channel...|$|R

40|$|Rivers, Lakes, & WetlandsThe hyporheic zone is an {{important}} ectone that provides nutrients for algae and shelter for macroinvertebrates. Dams may affect groundwater exchange downstream.

Ten habitat transects were mapped in each site, where we looked predominately at substrate cover, embeddedness, groundwater seeps, and Chara hummocks. We mapped groundwater seeps in each site. Results suggest significant differences in average cobble cover and embeddedness downstream. Seeps mapping did not reveal a significantly negative correlation with distance from the dam. Chara may indicate sources of groundwater inputs in the river channel. This study provides important pre-dam removal data, which may prove useful in assessing changes following the dam removal...|$|R
