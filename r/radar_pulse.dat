5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s, {{germanium}} {{was thought to}} be a poorly conducting metal. Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an electronic semiconductor were recognized. During World War II, small amounts of germanium were used in some special electronic devices, mostly diodes. The first major use was the point-contact Schottky diodes for <b>radar</b> <b>pulse</b> detection during the War. The first silicon-germanium alloys were obtained in 1955. Before 1945, only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year, {{but by the end of}} the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached 40 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the transponder responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original <b>radar</b> <b>pulse</b> would not be reflected {{so there was no}} need to lengthen the signal as in the case of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E

A total of 45 F-4As were built and none saw combat and most {{ended up as}} test or training aircraft. The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 <b>radar</b> (<b>pulse</b> only), a Texas Instruments AAA-4 Infra-red search and track pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900lbf (48.5kN) dry and 16,950lbf (75.4kN) afterburner (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and VF-121 Pacemakers receiving the first examples at NAS Miramar.|$|E

25|$|Distance {{may also}} be {{measured}} {{as a function of}} time. The radar mile is the amount of time it takes for a <b>radar</b> <b>pulse</b> to travel one nautical mile, reflect off a target, and return to the radar antenna. Since a nautical mile is defined as 1,852m, then dividing this distance by the speed of light (299,792,458m/s), and then multiplying the result by 2 yields a result of 12.36μs in duration.|$|E
25|$|Lucero was {{designed}} so its transmission would be triggered {{more rapidly than}} the radar's magnetron. This allowed it to send its signal and begin receiving the reply during {{the time when the}} main <b>radar</b> <b>pulse</b> was in-flight. This meant that the line segments began at a point indicating closer range than the aircraft sending the response, and ended after it. The radar operator could thus tell which aircraft was sending the IFF responses by looking for blips roughly centred along the line segments.|$|E

2500|$|Warning: {{the world}} {{line of a}} pulse of light moving in a fiber optic cable would not in general be a null geodesic, and light {{in the very early}} {{universe}} (the radiation-dominated epoch) was not freely propagating. [...] The world line of a <b>radar</b> <b>pulse</b> sent from Earth past the Sun to Venus would however be modeled as a null geodesic arc. [...] Note also that in dimensions other than four, the relationship between null geodesics and [...] "light" [...] no longer holds: If [...] "light" [...] is defined as the solution to the Laplacian wave equation, then the propagator has both null and time-like components in odd space-time dimensions, and is no longer a pure Dirac delta function in even space-time dimensions greater than four.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, a ring-riding {{observer}} {{can determine}} his {{distance to the}} central observer by sending a <b>radar</b> <b>pulse,</b> at event A toward the central observer, which strikes his world line at event C′ {{and returns to the}} ring-riding observer at event A″.

[...] It is not hard to see that he obtains for this distance [...] (in the cylindrical chart) or [...] (in the Born chart), a result which is somewhat smaller than the one obtained by the central observer.

Thus, while radar distance has a simple operational significance, it is not even symmetric.|$|E

30|$|However, {{nearly all}} of the {{existing}} pulse modulation classification algorithms are realized based on some known emitter databases and are suitable only for a certain group of IMOPs [12]. For example, an atomic decomposition method employing chirplet dictionary was proposed in [13], and it can realize the automatic detection and classification of <b>radar</b> <b>pulses</b> with LFM, PSK, and FSK modulations. An supervised classification system achieving overall correct classification rate of 98  % at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 6  dB based on multilayer perception networks was proposed in [14] and eight classes of radar signals are classified. Algorithms based on some time-frequency distributions such as the ambiguity function (AF) [15], Zhao Altas and Marks (ZAM) representations [16], the Rihacek distribution and the Hough transform [17], were also applied to extract modulation features for five kinds of <b>radar</b> <b>pulses.</b> These existing algorithms work effectively when the radar IMOPs are in the list of their databases, but fail when they are faced with some complicated or unknown modulated pulses.|$|R
40|$|Wide-swath SAR {{coverage}} {{is provided by}} RADARSAT using a multiple-beam scanning strategy called ScanSAR. Each beam covers a different range, and is allocated a fixed {{period of time in}} which to transmit and receive <b>radar</b> <b>pulses.</b> During SAR processing, the data from each beam must be “stitched ” together to form a complete image of the scanned area. This data must be radiometrically calibrated to compensate for antenna beam patterns. However, incorrect measurements of the satellite roll angle cause errors in radiometric calibration, and can lead to visible artifacts in the image (e. g. banding). A new ScanSAR data acquisition technique is proposed that improves roll angle estimation through the use of <b>radar</b> <b>pulses,</b> transmitted by one beam and received by another.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} measuring the velocity of a hard target using <b>radar</b> <b>pulses</b> reflected from the target flying through the radar beam. The method has two stages. First, the Doppler shifts of the echo pulses are calculated at a high accuracy with an algorithm which largely improves the accuracy given by the Fourier transform. The algorithm also calculates the standard deviations of the Doppler frequencies with Monte Carlo simulation. The second step is to fit the results from a sequence of <b>radar</b> <b>pulses</b> to a velocity model allowing linear variation of the second time derivative of target range. The achieved accuracies are demonstrated using radio pulses reflected by a satellite passing through the beam of the EISCAT UHF radar working at 930 -MHz frequency. At high SNR levels, the standard deviations of the frequency from a single pulse reach typically down to 0. 2 Hz. The best standard deviations of velocity fit are below 5 mm s − 1 while those of the second time derivative of range are below 1 cm s − 2...|$|R
