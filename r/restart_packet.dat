Visualizing the network behavior in mobile streaming {{as well as}} modeling the correlation between Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) is expected to improve user {{satisfaction of}} services on the Internet. Given that network and human factors are the elements that affect the final output of the measurements, {{it is important to}} take the Packet Delay Variation (PDV) into consideration. In this paper we observe the PDV during a series of real-life experiments on a 3 rd Generation (3 G) network while streaming videos. User Rating (UR) values from user input are recorded accordingly. With this aim, we implemented a QoE assessment tool that measures network metrics in kernel space, while simultaneously logging user ratings with regards to the perception of an ongoing real- time video on an Android phone. The primary goal is to identify a clear trend, so that we can assess the satisfaction of a user by deriving the QoE from measurable QoS metrics. We find that PDV degrades user perception. Observations show that, during the experiments, sudden breaks and <b>restarts</b> in the <b>packet</b> flow exist, which we call on-off flushing throughout this paper. Even though the use of Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) assists in finding a model that shows the relationship between PDV and UR, on-off flushing is a major threat affecting this relationship. The results show that correlations with different quality can be reached with various modifications of the proposed matching model...|$|R
