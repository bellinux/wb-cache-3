5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, <b>reducing,</b> <b>atmosphere</b> to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E

25|$|They operate {{very well}} in {{oxidizing}} atmospheres. If, however, a mostly <b>reducing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> (such as hydrogen {{with a small amount}} of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as green rot, due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Miller–Urey experiment, {{scientific}} consensus was that the early Earth had a <b>reducing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> with compounds relatively rich in hydrogen and poor in oxygen (e.g., CH4 and NH3 as opposed to CO2 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)). However, current scientific consensus describes the primitive atmosphere as either weakly reducing or neutral (see also Oxygen Catastrophe). Such an atmosphere would diminish both the amount and variety of amino acids that could be produced, although studies that include iron and carbonate minerals (thought present in early oceans) in the experimental conditions have again produced a diverse array of amino acids. Other scientific research has focused on two other potential reducing environments: outer space and deep-sea thermal vents.|$|E

[...] A characteristic northern type of [...] "horseshoe-shaped" [...] or mantou kiln was used, named after the Chinese bun it resembles in shape; {{one of a group}} excavated at Yaozhou was unusually well-preserved, allowing accurate plans to be made.

2500|$|The glaze colours vary {{across a}} wide {{spectrum}} of greyish to blueish greens, with some yellowish browns as well.

Longquan celadon was fired in long dragon kilns, brick tunnels rising up a slope, with a series of chambers, and the best results came from the pots in the uppermost stages, which heated up more slowly and evenly. Saggars were always used, and the longer kilns, with up to twelve chambers, {{might have been able to}} fire as many as 25,000 pieces at a time. The firing temperature was probably between 1,180°C and 1,280°C, with the range over 1,250°C giving the best green or blue colours.

2500|$|Scientists {{start the}} search for fossil {{evidence}} of plants with indirect evidence for their presence, the evidence of photosynthesis in the geological record. [...] The evidence for photosynthesis in the rock record is varied, but primary evidence comes from around 3000 Ma, in rock records and fossil evidence of cyanobacteria, photosynthesizing prokaryotic organisms. [...] Cyanobacteria use water as a reducing agent, producing atmospheric oxygen as a byproduct, and they thereby profoundly changed the early <b>reducing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of the earth to one in which modern aerobic organisms eventually evolved. [...] This oxygen liberated by cyanobacteria then oxidized dissolved iron in the oceans, the iron precipitated {{out of the sea}} water, and fell to the ocean floor to form sedimentary layers of oxidized iron called Banded Iron Formations (BIFs). [...] These BIFs are part of the geological record of evidence for the evolutionary history of plants by identifying when photosynthesis originated. [...] This also provides deep time constraints upon when enough oxygen could have been available in the atmosphere to produce the ultraviolet blocking stratospheric ozone layer. [...] The oxygen concentration in the ancient atmosphere subsequently rose, acting as a poison for anaerobic organisms, and resulting in a highly oxidizing atmosphere, and opening up niches on land for occupation by aerobic organisms.|$|E
