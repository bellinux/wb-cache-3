25|$|Raymond's son, David Belle, {{was born}} in 1973. He experimented with {{gymnastics}} and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> a means to develop skills that {{would be useful to}} him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.|$|E

As they put up a futile effort to fight back, the crowd starts cheering for Joe and Silvia, which gives them the power to transform and ultimately defeat Jet Black. Captain Blue is restored to normal and reveals that Jet was his best friend and cinematographer, but had found the Black Film one day and became entranced by its power {{and that of the}} Rainbow Oscars.

Then {{she and her friends}} travel back to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. When they all storm into the Wizard's room, they {{discover}} it is merely a Hollywood effects stage and that the Wizard (Jeffrey Tambor) is just an ordinary man, pretending. He asked for the witch's eye so that she could not see him for who he really was. Even so, he still proceeds to grant their wishes. Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets Glinda the Good Witch of the South (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks her heels together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City. She does so, saying [...] "take me home to Aunt Em".|$|E
500|$|Of Smith's {{performance}} as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: [...] "For most drama series {{the presence of}} a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you can do better than that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Ross, the US Middle East envoy {{and a key}} {{negotiator}} at the summit, summarized his {{perspectives in}} his book The Missing Peace. During a lecture in Australia, Ross suggested {{that the reason for}} the failure was Arafat's unwillingness to sign a final deal with Israel that would close the door on any of the Palestinians' maximum demands, particularly the right of return. Ross claimed that what Arafat <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a one-state solution. Not independent, adjacent Israeli and Palestinian states, but a single Arab state encompassing all of Historic Palestine". Ross also quoted Saudi Prince Bandar as saying while negotiations were taking place: [...] "If Arafat does not accept what is available now, it won't be a tragedy; it will be a crime." ...|$|E

2500|$|Four demos for {{the album}} were {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990; [...] "Enter Sandman", [...] "The Unforgiven", [...] "Nothing Else Matters" [...] and [...] "Wherever I May Roam." [...] The lead single [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] {{was the first}} song to be written and the last to receive lyrics. On October 4, 1990, a demo of [...] "Sad but True" [...] was recorded. In October 1990, Metallica began recording at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, to record the album, and also at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia for about a week. On June 2, 1991, a demo of [...] "Holier Than Thou" [...] was recorded. Hetfield stated about the recording: [...] "What we <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> a live feel. In the past, Lars and I constructed the rhythm parts without Kirk and Jason. This time I wanted to try playing as a band unit in the studio. It lightens things up and you get more of a vibe." ...|$|E
2500|$|After other interventions, for {{and against}} the OdG, Mussolini spoke again, and told the {{participants}} {{to reflect on their}} decision, since the approval of Grandi's OdG would imply the end of Fascism. He also cautioned against the illusion that the Anglo-Americans would be content with that, whereas what they <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> the end of Italy, which under his rule had become too strong. For him, he said, this was not about his own person: at sixty, he could have ended that “beautiful adventure” that his life had been so far. But he was sure that the war could be won: in fact, he had a [...] "key" [...] to accomplish that, but he could not disclose it. He was not willing to let his throat be cut by the King. If, on the other hand, the King would re-confirm his trust in him, the consequences for the supporters of Grandi’s OdG would be dire. At the end of his speech many of the gerarchi were visibly shaken. Grandi, jumping again from his chair, screamed that the Duce with his last words was blackmailing all of them; but, he added, if one must choose between fidelity to him and loyalty to the homeland, the choice was clear. At this point Mussolini gave the word to Scorza, who caught everyone by surprise by presenting his own OdG. This envisaged the nomination of the three war and interior ministers, all under Mussolini, and the concentration of {{power in the hands of}} the Fascist Party.|$|E

6000|$|That Tengga {{was much}} more ready to {{negotiate}} than to fight, the old adventurer had not the slightest doubt. How Lingard would deal with him was not a concern of Jorgenson's.

I'm not much of a ladies' man, but on this particular morning {{it seemed to me that}} what I <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> some charming girl to buzz up and ask me to save her from assassins or something.

60|$|Of course, {{we never}} saw him any more, and, of course, all he <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> a shilling.

They represent themselves as sent by the proprietor. The proper course to pursue is to offer your name and address, and leave the owner, if he really {{has anything to do with}} the matter, to summon you, and prove what damage you have done to his land by sitting down on a bit of it.

6000|$|He saw {{a mysterious}} iniquity in a {{dangerous}} relation to himself and began to lose his head. What he <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> to have his existence left intact, for his own cherishing and pride. It was a moral aspiration, but in his alarm the native grossness of his nature came clattering out like a devil out of a trap. He would blow the gaff, split, give away the whole show, he would back up honest people, kiss the book, say what he thought, let all the world know [...] . and when he paused to draw breath, all around him was silent and still. Before the impetus of that respectable passion his words were scattered like chaff driven by a gale and rushed headlong into {{the night of the}} Shallows. And in the great obscurity, imperturbable, it heard him say he [...] "washed his hands of everything." ...|$|E

There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled {{steamboat}} I was leaning against, while he talked fluently about 'the necessity for every man to get on.' 'And when one comes out here, you conceive, {{it is not to}} gaze at the moon.' Mr. Kurtz was a 'universal genius,' but even a genius would find it easier to work with 'adequate tools--intelligent men.' He did not make bricks--why, there was a physical impossibility in the way--as I was well aware; and if he did secretarial work for the manager, it was because 'no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors.' Did I see it? I saw it. What more did I want? What I <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> rivets, by heaven! Rivets. To get on with the work--to stop the hole. Rivets I wanted. There were cases of them down at the coast--cases--piled up--burst--split! You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death. You could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down--and there wasn't one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week the messenger, a lone negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast. And several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods,--ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.|$|E

60|$|She {{spoke as}} if she had had a great battle with her fellow-workers and had routed them utterly. It {{was not the first time}} he had heard her talk as if such a life as hers could only be a {{fighting}} life and of her frank measure of the fine uses of a faculty for making a row. She rejoiced she possessed this faculty, for she knew what to do with it; and though there might be a certain swagger in taking such a stand in advance when one had done the infinitely little she had yet done, she nevertheless trusted to the future to show how right she should have been in believing a pack of idiots would never hold out against her and would know they couldn't afford to. Her assumption of course was that she fought for the light and the right, for the good way and the thorough, for doing a thing properly if one did it at all. What she had <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> the theatre closed for a night and the dress-rehearsal, put on for a few people, given instead of Yolande. That she had not got, but she would have it the next time. She spoke as if her triumphs behind the scenes as well as before would go by leaps and bounds, and he could perfectly see, for the time, that she would drive her coadjutors in front of her like sheep. Her tone was the sort of thing that would have struck one as preposterous if one hadn't believed in her; but if one did so believe it only seemed thrown in with the other gifts. How was she going to act that night and what could be said for such a hateful way of doing things? She thrust on poor Peter questions he was all unable to answer; she abounded in superlatives and tremendously strong objections. He had a sharper vision than usual of the queer fate, for a peaceable man, of being involved in a life of so violent a rhythm: one might as well be hooked to a Catharine-wheel and whiz round in flame and smoke.|$|E
6000|$|Milly clearly felt {{these things}} too, but they {{affected}} her companion at moments--that was quite the way Mrs. Stringham would have expressed it--as the princess {{in a conventional}} tragedy might have affected the confidant if a personal emotion had ever been permitted to the latter. That a princess could only be a princess was a truth with which, essentially, a confidant, however responsive, had to live. Mrs. Stringham was {{a woman of the}} world, but Milly Theale was a princess, the only one she had yet had to deal with, and this in its way, too, made all the difference. It was a perfectly definite doom for the wearer--it was for every one else a perfectly palpable quality. It might have been, possibly, with its involved loneliness and other mysteries, the weight under which she fancied her companion's admirable head occasionally, and ever so submissively, bowed. Milly had quite assented at luncheon to their staying over, and had left her to look at rooms, settle questions, arrange about their keeping on their carriage and horses; cares that had now moreover fallen to Mrs. Stringham {{as a matter of course}} and that yet for some reason, on this occasion particularly, brought home to her--all agreeably, richly, almost grandly--what it was to live with the great. Her young friend had, in a sublime degree, a sense closed to the general question of difficulty, which she got rid of, furthermore, not in the least as one had seen many charming persons do, by merely passing it on to others. She kept it completely at a distance: it never entered the circle; the most plaintive confidant couldn't have dragged it in; and to tread the path of a confidant was accordingly to live exempt. Service was in other words so easy to render that the whole thing was like court life without the hardships. It came back of course to the question of money, and our observant lady had by this time repeatedly reflected that if one were talking of the [...] "difference," [...] it was just this, this incomparably and nothing else, that when all was said and done most made it. A less vulgarly, a less obviously purchasing or parading person she couldn't have imagined; but it was, all the same, the truth of truths that the girl couldn't get away from her wealth. She might leave her conscientious companion as freely alone with it as possible and never ask a question, scarce even tolerate a reference; but it was in the fine folds of the helplessly expensive little black frock that she drew over the grass as she now strolled vaguely off; it was in the curious and splendid coils of hair, [...] "done" [...] with no eye whatever to the mode du jour, that peeped from under the corresponding indifference of her hat, the merely personal tradition that suggested a sort of noble inelegance; it lurked between the leaves of the uncut but antiquated Tauchnitz volume of which, before going out, she had mechanically possessed herself. She couldn't dress it away, nor walk it away, nor read it away, nor think it away; she could neither smile it away in any dreamy absence nor blow it away in any softened sigh. She couldn't have lost it if she had tried--that was what it was to be really rich. It had to be the thing you were. When at the end of an hour she had not returned to the house Mrs. Stringham, though the bright afternoon was yet young, took, with precautions, the same direction, went to join her in case of her caring for a walk. But the purpose of joining her was in truth less distinct than that of a due regard for a possibly preferred detachment: so that, once more, the good lady proceeded with a quietness that made her slightly [...] "underhand" [...] even in her own eyes. She couldn't help that, however, and she didn't care, sure as she was that what she <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> not to overstep, but to stop in time. It was to be able to stop in time that she went softly, but she had on this occasion further to go than ever yet, for she followed in vain, and at last with some anxiety, the footpath she believed Milly to have taken. It wound up a hillside and into the higher Alpine meadows in which, all these last days, they had so often wanted, as they passed above or below, to stray; and then it obscured itself in a wood, but always going up, up, and with a small cluster of brown old high-perched chalets evidently for its goal. Mrs. Stringham reached in due course the chalets, and there received from a bewildered old woman, a very fearful person to behold, an indication that sufficiently guided her. The young lady had been seen not long before passing further on, over a crest and to a place where the way would drop again, as our unappeased inquirer found it, in fact, a quarter of an hour later, markedly and almost alarmingly to do. It led somewhere, yet apparently quite into space, for the great side of the mountain appeared, from where she pulled up, to fall away altogether, though probably but to some issue below and out of sight. Her uncertainty moreover was brief, for she next became aware of the presence on a fragment of rock, twenty yards off, of the Tauchnitz volume that the girl had brought out, and that therefore pointed to her shortly previous passage. She had rid herself of the book, which was an encumbrance, and meant of course to pick it up on her return; but as she hadn't yet picked it up what on earth had become of her? Mrs. Stringham, I hasten to add, was within a few moments to see; but it was quite an accident that she had not, before they were over, betrayed by her deeper agitation the fact of her own nearness.|$|E
