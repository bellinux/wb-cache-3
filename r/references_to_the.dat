50|$|Bastiaanse et al. (subm.), {{formulated}} the PAst DIscourse LInking Hypothesis (PADILIH) {{with the}} aim of testing three predictions: (1) selective impairment of grammatical morphology is used for <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past, while <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present and future are relatively spared (2) this impairment is language-independent; (3) this impairment will occur in both production and comprehension. In order to do so, their research puts into practice the Test for Assessing Reference of Time (TART; Bastiaanse et al., unpub.) in Chinese, English and Turkish agrammatic speakers. The results demonstrate that both English and Turkish agrammatic speakers show the hypothesized selective deficit for <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past, despite the great typological difference between the languages. The Chinese agrammatic speakers are poor in producing <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past as well by producing grammatical morphology, but <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present and future are also severely affected. The results on the subtest for comprehension are strikingly similar for <b>the</b> three languages: <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past is impaired. These results confirm <b>the</b> PADILIH: <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past is discourse linked and, therefore, grammatical morphology used for <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past is impaired in agrammatic aphasia, whether this is done through tense and / or aspect markers.|$|R
