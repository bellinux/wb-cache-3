Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (<b>risk</b> <b>ratio</b> 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases {{who are in the}} process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the <b>risk</b> <b>ratio</b> in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E

40|$|Interaction {{measured}} on the additive scale {{has been argued}} to be better correlated with biologic interaction than when {{measured on}} the multiplicative scale. Measures of interaction on the additive scale have been developed using <b>risk</b> <b>ratios.</b> However, in studies that use odds ratios as the sole measure of effect, the calculation of these measures of additive interaction is usually performed by directly substituting odds <b>ratios</b> for <b>risk</b> <b>ratios.</b> Yet assessing additive interaction based on replacing <b>risk</b> <b>ratios</b> by odds ratios in formulas that were derived using the former may be erroneous. In this paper, we evaluate {{the extent to which}} three measures of additive interaction – the interaction contrast ratio (ICR), the attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and the synergy index (S), estimated using odds <b>ratios</b> versus using <b>risk</b> <b>ratios</b> differ as the incidence of the outcome of interest increases in the source population and/or as the magnitude of interaction increases. Our analysis shows that {{the difference between the two}} depends on the measure of interaction used, the type of interaction present, and the baseline incidence of the outcome. Substituting odds <b>ratios</b> for <b>risk</b> <b>ratios,</b> when calculating measures of additive interaction, may result in misleading conclusions.

40|$|In {{observational}} {{studies for}} {{the interaction between}} exposures on dichotomous outcome of a population, one usually uses one parameter of a regression model to describe the interaction, leading to one measure of the interaction.

40|$|Background Comorbidity {{research}} in psychiatric epidemiology mostly uses measures of association like odds or <b>risk</b> <b>ratios</b> to express how strongly disorders are linked. In contrast, chronic disease epidemiologists increasingly use measures of clustering, like multimorbidity (cluster) coefficients, to study comorbidity. This article compares measures of association and clustering. Methods Narrative review, algebraical examples, a secondary analysis {{of an existing}} dataset and a pooled analysis of published data. Results Odds and <b>risk</b> <b>ratios,</b> but the former more than the latter, confound clustering with coincidental comorbidity. Multimorbidity coefficients provide a pure estimate of clustering which is {{the proportion of the}} association between disorders that is of etiological interest. Odds and <b>risk</b> <b>ratios</b> can express comorbidity between no more than two disorders, whilst clustering coefficients, although computationally laboursome, can capture multimorbidity of any number of disorders. Cluster coefficients depend less on the prevalence of illness in study groups than measures of association. Conclusion Odds and <b>risk</b> <b>ratios</b> are well suited for comorbidity research which focuses on which sets of disorders or syndromes tend to occur in combination and the implications of this for, for instance, nosological classification, a traditional interest of psychiatric epidemiology. However, the cluster coefficient is to be preferred if the interest is more aetiological, addressing for example why certain individuals are prone to multiple health problems...|$|R

Given their widespread use, {{it is important that}} evaluators and decision-makers understand how scores on these tools relate to recidivism risk. Relative risk is one useful metric for communicating an offender's risk of reoffending. Methods. In the current study, <b>risk</b> <b>ratios</b> were computed for Static- 2002 R scores using 3 Canadian samples (N = 1, 452 sex offenders). Results. Each increase in Static- 2002 R score was associated with a stable and consistent increase in relative risk (as measured by an odds ratio or hazard ratio of approximately 1. 4) and this increase was stable across time. Hazard ratios from Cox regression were used to calculate <b>risk</b> <b>ratios</b> that can be reported for Static- 2002 R. Conclusion.
