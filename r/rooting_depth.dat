The deepest roots are generally found in deserts and temperate coniferous forests; the shallowest in tundra, boreal forest and temperate grasslands. The deepest observed living root, at least 60 metres below the ground surface, was observed during the excavation of an open-pit mine in Arizona, USA. Some roots can grow as deep as the tree is high.

The crops were grown after incorporation of green manure either in the preceding Autumn or Spring. Beetroot reached a final <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> of 1. 55 – 1. 8 m. For sweet corn, the final <b>root</b> <b>depths</b> were 0. 6 and 0. 9 m, and, for celeriac, 0. 45 and 0. 6 m in the two years, respectively. The simple measure of average <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> reflected the depth to which soil mineral N was depleted over the season by each of the three vegetables. Autumn incorporation of green manure resulted in higher mineral N contents in the soil layers below 0. 5 m compared to a Spring incorporation. For beetroot, this resulted in 0. 5 m-deeper <b>root</b> <b>depths</b> and higher <b>root</b> intensity below 0. 5 m at harvest.

This study was conducted to evaluate the trend of corn root development during the growing season in different irrigation methods with two water qualities, and distribution of roots in soil profile. The experiment was a split plot design with three main treatments (subsurface drip(SSD), surface drip(SD) and furrow irrigation(FI)) and two sub main treatments (municipal effluent and fresh water) in two consecutive years conducted in Korbal plain, Fars province. Root monitoring was carried out with the observation of soil profile <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> measurement. Samples were taken during the growing season 16 times, each with a 7 day interval. Measurement of root weight in different soil layers was carried out using monoliths of soil washed with water pressure using 50 mesh sieves. Although the longest roots were observed in plots irrigated with SSD and the shortest in FI, the final root length was not significantly affected by irrigation methods and water qualities. In this research, a model showing the trend of root length average growth was developed and tested in the experiment conditions. The average final main <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> for all treatments was 77 cm. Irrigation volume using <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> monitoring could be reduced compared to linear model, Borg & Grimes and CROPWAT model for <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> estimation.

However, water quality did not show a significant effect on dry root weight. The most root concentration in SSD was measured in depth of 20 - 40 cm, while in SD and FI the most concentration was in surface layer (0 - 20 cm). In the SSD, the roots were distributed more evenly compared with SD and FI methods. The concentration of roots in all treatments below 65 cm was not significant...|$|R

An abundant calcium supply is common to most white spruce locations in New York state (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Chlorosis was observed in young white spruce in heavily limed nursery soils at about pH 8.3 (Stone, cited by Nienstaedt 1957).

In a third competition experiment between Plantago lanceolata L. and Anthoxanthum odoratum L. it was tested whether this observed phenomenon was indeed caused by the differences between the <b>rooting</b> <b>depths</b> of these species.

Biome averages of the calculated <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> distribution compare well to observations. The optimised rooting depths increase global annual net primary production and evaporation by more than 15 %, with local increases of up to 100 % in some tropical regions compared to a standard <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> of one meter. The decreased river discharge due to the enhanced evaporation complies better with observations.
