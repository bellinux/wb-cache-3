40|$|In post-conflict societies, {{security}} {{is provided by}} {{a broad range of}} actors including the state as well as various non-state formations. The paper identifies three types of post-conflict societies and analyses dynamics of the security market in cases where international troops have intervened. A comparison of seven countries shows that intervention forces were able to establish themselves as market leaders when a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) program was successfully conducted in the immediate post-conflict period. Such a program should be embedded in an inclusive peace agreement that is backed up by a credible and <b>robust</b> <b>troop</b> commitment from the international community. Post-conflict societies, security market, oligopoly of violence, international intervention, disarmament...|$|R

He {{was not a}} part of the Prussian aristocracy that dominated the German high command, and as such was looked upon somewhat suspiciously by the Wehrmacht's traditional power structure. Rommel felt a commander should be physically more <b>robust</b> than the <b>troops</b> he led, and should always show them an example. He expected his subordinate commanders to do the same.|$|R
40|$|Abstract For troop and {{military}} installation protection, modern computer vision methods must be harnessed to enable {{a comprehensive approach}} to con-textual awareness. In this chapter we present a collection of intelligent video technologies currently under development at the General Electric Global Research Center, which {{can be applied to}} this challenging prob-lem. These technologies include: aerial analysis for object detection and tracking, site-wide tracking from networks of fixed video cameras, person detection from moving platforms, biometrics at a distance and facial analysis for the purposes of inferring intent. We hypothesize that a <b>robust</b> approach to <b>troop</b> protection will require the synthesis of all of these technologies into a comprehensive system of systems...|$|R
