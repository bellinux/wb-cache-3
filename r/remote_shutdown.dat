40|$|As the {{internet}} grows in popularity and therefore also in size {{more and more}} transmission takes place mainly because the technology is more readily available and applications have become more user friendly allowing entry to less sophisticated user over a broad spectrum. Most data transfer are mainly text based not secure and vulnerable to various forms of security risks. So the model that uses SSH for securing channel like intranet/internet which provides client authentication encryption and decryption with high degree of security by transferring the data in an encrypted format, up on this model enhances the efficiency of data transmission by encrypting or decrypting the data with AES in Counter Mode. AES is a symmetric key encryption standard. Moreover the permutation controlled by data can be performed at high speed in generic cpu. This scheme also expands the key space without costing more to run. And also finally through the combination of secure shell (ssh) and AES (Counter Mode) not only enhances the security of communication channel. It also provides various applications like remote user creation, remote user deletion, remote command execution, <b>remote</b> system <b>shutdown,</b> <b>remote</b> file transfer applications in a highly secure manner...|$|R
50|$|A {{complete}} {{remote management}} system allows <b>remote</b> reboot, <b>shutdown,</b> powering on; hardware sensor monitoring (fan speed, power voltages, chassis intrusion, etc.); broadcasting of video output to remote terminals and receiving of input from remote keyboard and mouse (KVM over IP). It also can access local media like a DVD drive, or disk images, from the remote machine. If necessary, this {{allows one to}} perform remote installation of the operating system. Remote management {{can be used to}} adjust BIOS settings that may not be accessible after the operating system has already booted. Settings of hardware RAID or RAM clocking can also be adjusted as the management card needs no hard drives or main memory to operate.|$|R
50|$|The {{operators}} {{working in}} the unit {{at the time of}} the incident were unable to reach manual shut-off valves that would have isolated the damaged section from a fuel source. A remotely operated shut-off valve was located between the damaged section and the storage tanks but not between the damaged section and the distillation column. In addition, the pumps were controlled from a local control station that was also inaccessible. The pumps were eventually shut down from the central control building but there was not a <b>remote</b> <b>shutdown</b> control for the pumps in the central control room. Isolating the damaged section via a remotely operated valve upstream of the pumps could have ended the incident prior to ignition of the vapor cloud and would have definitely reduced the severity of the situation.|$|E
50|$|The CSN sends {{its three}} major carriers, Griffin, Ifrit and Leviathan to Aster to {{intercept}} and bring Dragon home, commanded by Commodore Parks, Commodore Hawke, and Captain Meyers respectively. The {{start of the}} operation is disastrous, with Dragon's operators luring the allied forces into {{a false sense of}} security by complying with a <b>remote</b> <b>shutdown</b> request and then eliminating all the approaching vessels. It then turns its main cannon on UNF Grendel, destroying it with a single shot. With the allied forces completely outmatched by the enemy starfighter pilots, who many begin to believe are not being piloted by Imperials, Parks orders an immediate retreat. Before they can do so, however, they are attacked by enemy reinforcements and Griffin is left dead in the water. With the original pilots dead and with no means to launch fighters, the White Knights are left to pilot the ATAFs and use them to drive back the enemy forces. Dodds once again begins to question the power of the starfighter, feeling that something is not right about it.|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are {{provided}} with a control room from which actions {{can be taken to}} operate the unit safely under normal conditions and to maintain it in a safe condition under accident conditions. In addition, equipment outside the control room is provided with a design capability for prompt hot shutdown of the reactor, including necessary instrumentation and controls to maintain the unit in a safe condition during hot shutdown, and with a potential capability for subsequent cold shutdown. The HFEB has primary responsibility for reviewing the design of the control room and <b>remote</b> <b>shutdown</b> capability to confirm that their designs facilitate the ability of nuclear power plant operators to prevent accidents or cope with accidents if they occur. Other branches review applicants ' evaluations of the susceptibility of systems, structures and components important to safety, to malfunctions and failures. The HFEB reviews the design of the control room and <b>remote</b> <b>shutdown</b> capa-bility to assure that the interfaces between the systems, structures and components, and the plant personnel expected to operate them have been designed and provided in conformance with good human factors engineering practice. The objectives of the review are to confirm that...|$|E

40|$|An {{advanced}} state-of-the-art steam turbine-generator {{developed to}} serve as the power conversion subsystem for the Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories' Solar Total-Energy Project (STEP) is described. The turbine-generator, which is designed to provide 400 -kW of net electrical power, represents the largest turbine-generator built specifically for commercial solar-powered cogeneration. The controls for the turbine-generator incorporate a multiple, partial-arc entry to provide efficient off-design performance, as well as an extraction control scheme to permit extraction flow regulation while maintaining 110 -spsig pressure. Normal turbine operation is achieved while synchronized to a local utility and in a stand-alone mode. In both cases, the turbine-generator features automatic load control as well as <b>remote</b> start-up and <b>shutdown</b> capability. Tests totaling 200 hours were conducted to confirm the integrity of the turbine's mechanical structure and control function. Performance tests resulted in a measured inlet throttle flow of 8, 450 pounds per hour, which was near design conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{a public}} service {{announcement}} on March 17, 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) jointly with the Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, released a warning over the increasing vulnerability of motor vehicles to <b>remote</b> exploits. Engine <b>shutdown,</b> disable brakes and door locks are few examples of the possible vehicle cyber security attacks. Modern cars grow into a new target for cyberattacks as they become increasingly connected. While driving on the road, sharks (i. e., hackers) only need to be within communication range of your vehicle to attack it. However, in some cases, they can hack into it while they are miles away. In this article, we aim to illuminate the latest vehicle cyber security threats including malware attacks, On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) vulnerabilities, and auto mobile apps threats. We illustrate the In-Vehicle network architecture and demonstrate the latest defending mechanisms {{that are designed to}} mitigate such threats...|$|R
2500|$|Data is {{vulnerable}} to technological hazards such as computer viruses, certain levels of energy discharges, ship malfunctions (when connected to the Enterprise main computer for experiments), and <b>shutdowns</b> whether through <b>remote</b> control <b>shutdown</b> devices or through use of his [...] "off switch", located on his lower back near where a human kidney would be. Besides Data, very few members of the Enterprise crew are aware of this switch's existence for reasons of security, including Captain Picard, Commander Riker and Chief Engineer LaForge. Dr. Crusher, who is bound by her Hippocratic Oath forbidding her from divulging this to anyone without Data's express permission, was {{the first member of}} the crew to be made aware of its existence in the first season episode [...] "". Data has also been [...] "possessed" [...] through technological means such as: Ira Graves's transfer of consciousness into his neural net; Dr. Soong's [...] "calling" [...] him; and an alien library that placed several different personalities into him. Data cannot swim unless aided by his built in flotation device, yet he can perform tasks underwater without the need to surface. Data is also impervious to sensory tactile emotion such as pain or pleasure. In [...] the Borg Queen grafted artificial skin to his forearm. Data was then able to feel pain when a Borg drone slashed at his arm, and pleasure when the Borg Queen blew on the skin's hair follicles. Despite being mechanical in nature, Data is treated as an equal member of the Enterprise crew in every regard. Being a mechanical construct, technicians such as Chief Engineer LaForge prove to be more appropriate to treat his mechanical or cognitive function failures than the ship's doctor. His positronic brain becomes deactivated, repaired, and reactivated by Geordi on several occasions.|$|R
