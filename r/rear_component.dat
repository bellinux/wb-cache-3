50|$|At the {{location}} of the former synagogue, a plaque was mounted towards Synagogengasse and Grimmenturm; the former Synagogue served as a storeroom, now a bookstore, and was never re-used as a synagogue.

Only a small remnant of the late medieval room ornaments are preserved, namely the wall painting fragments from the 14th century in the form of leaf tendrils in red and black color.

40|$|Workflow is {{a process}} of calling/invoking a number of APIs/methods in certain {{sequence}} to achieve a goal/task. For this workflow to be tested testers have to manually write the java class containing the main method to test the workflow, this java class is usually called as test java class/sample code or test driver class. This activity of writing Java Test class requires the tester to be fluent in rogramming skills. We propose a novel framework, which addresses these important issues. This new framework approaches the workflow testing in different way, by which it auto generate the Java Test class, thus does not demand any programming skills from the tester. Given the simplicity and auto- generation capability of the framework, this can be used by novice tester for workflow testing. Framework contains three components, the front, mapping and <b>rear</b> <b>component.</b> Front component is a user interface for giving in the inputs/sequence of methods from different class to form the workflow.

40|$|In 2008, we sampled {{migrating}} juvenile Pacific salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. tagged with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags using {{a surface}} pair trawl {{in the upper}} Columbia River estuary (rkm 61 - 83). The cod-end of the trawl was replaced with a cylindrical PIT-tag detection antenna with an 86 -cm-diameter fish-passage opening and two detection coils connected in series. The pair trawl was 105 m long with a 91. 5 -m opening between the wings and a sample depth of 4. 9 m. Also during 2008, we finalized {{the development of a}} prototype 'matrix' antenna, which was larger than previous antennas by a considerable magnitude. The matrix antenna consisted of 6 coils: a 3 -coil front component and a 3 -coil <b>rear</b> <b>component,</b> which were separated by 1. 5 -m of net mesh. The fish-passage opening was 2. 5 m wide by 3. 0 m tall and was attached to a standard-size pair trawl net. Intermittent sampling with a single crew began on 7 March and targeted yearling Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and steelhead O. mykiss. Daily sampling using two crews began on 30 April and continued through 14 June; during this period we detected 2. 7 % of all juvenile salmonids previously detected at Bonneville Dam [...] a measure of sample efficiency. Sampling with a single crew continued through 20 August and targeted subyearling Chinook salmon. We detected 7, 397 yearling Chinook salmon, 2, 735 subyearling Chinook salmon, 291 coho salmon O. kisutch, 5, 950 steelhead, and 122 sockeye salmon O. nerka in the upper estuary. We deployed the matrix antenna system and the older, cylindrical antenna system (86 -cm-diameter fish-passage opening) simultaneously in mid-May 2008 to test matrix detection efficiency. The cylindrical antenna system had been used successfully in 2007 and early 2008. Because distribution of migrating salmonids in the estuary changes rapidly, we felt that a tandem sampling effort between the two systems {{was the only way to}} truly evaluate comparative detection efficiency. We deployed both systems within 1 km of each other during a period of high fish densities on 13, 14, and 15 May. Detections of the matrix system surpassed those of the cylindrical system by 53 % in 14 h of simultaneous sampling (total detections 716 and 339, respectively). We believe that the higher detection rate observed with the matrix system was due to fewer smolts escaping the trawl entrance and to more smolts readily passing through the larger fish-passage opening. After tandem sampling, we continued exclusive use of the matrix system for the remainder of the 2008 juvenile migration season. Mean survival rates from Lower Granite to Bonneville Dam for yearling Chinook salmon and steelhead were 42 % (SE = 3. 7 %) and 46 % (SE = 1. 5 %), respectively.

40|$|The body {{condition}} index (i. e., body mass corrected for age or size differences) {{is commonly used}} to investigate offspring condition in nestling birds. The {{body condition}} index reflects different parameters related to the general nutritional state of nestlings and may predict survival prospects. Since conditions experienced during the growth period can affect the fitness of nestlings in adulthood, we investigated proximate and ultimate factors underlying body condition index variation in kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) nestlings in a 9 -year field study and we carried out two cross-fostering experiments to disentangle the origin (genetics plus maternal effects) and <b>rearing</b> (environment effect) <b>components</b> of body condition index variation. In total, we sampled 2, 065 nestlings from 464 broods and used 121 nestlings from 24 broods in the cross-fostering experiments. We found that nestlings from larger broods had higher body condition index than nestlings from smaller ones, but this pattern did not emerge {{in two of the}} 9 years of study; nestlings born later in the breeding season had lower body condition index in some years but not in others; the decrease of body condition index over the breeding season emerged in all but three-chick broods; males and females did not differ neither in body condition index nor in the covariation between body mass and wing length, while this result was limited to one of the nine field study years; the annual mean value of body condition index did not covary with the total rainfall; both the origin and <b>rearing</b> <b>components</b> explained body condition index variation, but their relative contributions varied from a year to another. Overall, these results suggest that the brood size is not a good predictor of body condition index; the rule "nesting early in the season is better" is less general than previously thought; the body condition index may contain origin variance, whose expression may be modulated by environmental conditions...|$|R
