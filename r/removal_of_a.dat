5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In {{people who are}} unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cluster {{headache}} (CH) is a neurovascular, primary headache disorder. There are, however, several {{case reports}} about patients whose CH started shortly after a structural brain disease or trauma. Motivated by {{a patient who}} developed CH 3 weeks after the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eye and by similar case reports, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eye is a risk factor for CH. Methods A detailed headache questionnaire was filled out by 112 patients on average 8 years after enucleation or evisceration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eye. Results While 21 % of these patients experienced previously unknown headaches after the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eye, no patient fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CH. Conclusion Our data does not suggest that the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eye is a major risk factor for the development of CH. </p...|$|R

Roosevelt argues that the urn must be taken from the site and preserved in a museum, much {{to the chagrin of}} Bilac and the tribespeople present. Later, a native shaman distributes Yaje to the local villagers and Bilac. During this ritual, a jaguar spirit kills Roosevelt in his tent.|$|E
5|$|Discectomy (the partial <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disc that {{is causing}} leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year {{but not at}} four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Taft {{wrote for}} a 6–3 {{majority}} in Myers v. United States that Congress could {{not require the}} president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee.

Although Myers involved the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> postmaster, Taft in his opinion found invalid the repealed Tenure of Office Act, for violation of which his presidential predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached, though acquitted by the Senate. Taft valued Myers as his most important opinion.|$|E

5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain. MRI scans, not as widely available, {{may be able}} to demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.|$|E
