50|$|The five point {{safety harness}} is {{required}} for all vehicles. It holds the driver secure in the seat, and {{is equipped with a}} quick <b>release</b> <b>latch</b> which can be released in less than a second should the driver need to leave the car due to fire or explosions.|$|E
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the {{film rewind knob}} with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the film advance lever, the back <b>release</b> <b>latch,</b> and the film rewind release button.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{electromagnet}} in the contactor, if {{power to}} the machine should fail the contactor will automatically disengage. Unlike machines with an ordinary latching switch (such as a common light switch), when the power is resumed the machine will not operate until being turned on again. As a result, magnetic starters often use momentary switches for [...] "off" [...] and [...] "on" [...] functions, as this type of switch returns to a defined normal position when <b>released.</b> <b>Latching</b> switches do not have this feature and therefore are normally not used with a magnetic starter.|$|R

50|$|Dogging is {{distinct}} from simple unlocking, which permits the user {{to open the door}} from both ends but still requires performing an action to <b>release</b> the <b>latches.</b> However in applications where the exterior side contains a dummy lever, it is usually impossible to unlock the crash bar without also dogging it.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} MAB D versions, usually called the Type I and Type II. The Type I MAB D was made 1933-1945 and used an {{external}} muzzle bushing <b>release</b> <b>latch</b> {{in front of}} the trigger guard; the Type II used an internal [...] "bayonet" [...] type release requiring pushing in and turning the muzzle bushing. The MAB factory changed from the Type I to Type II production in June 1945.|$|E
50|$|The basic scooter design {{consists}} of an airplane grade aluminum frame, 98 mm polyurethane wheels, and a hinged fender over the rear wheel, which is pushed down by the foot {{to act as a}} spoon brake. The handlebar and headtube fold when a quick <b>release</b> <b>latch</b> is opened, allowing for easy carriage. This design made the scooters lighter and quieter than the previous models, increasing their popularity with both kids and parents.|$|E
5000|$|Waking {{from their}} latest jump, Ryan Cawdor {{and his friends}} find {{themselves}} in a MAT-TRANS chamber which is smaller than the norm. This curious change is overshadowed by their next discovery: the chamber door <b>release</b> <b>latch</b> is stuck, leaving the group no way to leave the chamber and no way to start another MAT-TRANS jump to a different redoubt. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to make the mechanism work, Krysty Wroth calls upon her mutant strength and forces the door open. This frees the group but breaks the latch mechanism completely, rendering the MAT-TRANS inoperable. Rick Ginsberg, a cryonic patient from 2001 who was [...] "thawed" [...] by Ryan, estimates that he can fix the mechanism, but will need at least basic tools to do so.|$|E
50|$|Technics for seats: Seat back latches, Locking of {{the seat}} in several positions, Kinematic-Devices, Seat-to-floor <b>latches,</b> Lockable <b>latches,</b> <b>Release</b> lever (with indication), Strikers, etc.|$|R
50|$|McDonnell {{engineers}} came up {{with two}} different quick release hatches for the Mercury spacecraft. One with a latch, used on Ham's (a chimpanzee) MR-2 and Shepard's MR-3 missions. The other design was an explosive release hatch. The quick <b>release</b> <b>latching</b> hatch weighed 69 lb (31 kg), {{too much of a}} weight addition to use on the orbital version of the spacecraft. The explosive hatch design used the 70 bolts of the original design, but each quarter-inch (6.35 mm) titanium bolt had a 0.06 in hole bored into it to provide a weak point. A mild detonating fuse (MDF) was installed in a channel between the inner and outer seal around the periphery of the hatch. When the MDF was ignited, the resulting gas pressure between the inner and outer seal would cause the bolts to fail in tension.|$|R
50|$|When modular {{connectors}} are used, the <b>latch</b> <b>release</b> of the connector {{should be}} on the ridge side of flat phone wire in order to maintain polarity.|$|R
50|$|After {{the crash}} of Osoaviakhim-1 the {{military}} demanded an overhaul of safety procedures and features. While USSR-1 gondola was deliberately designed for safety, in case of the catastrophic failure of the balloon the crew had to bail out on personal parachutes. Osoaviakhim-1 envelope and suspension failed at altitudes where humans were not yet able to bail out, its crewmembers probably incapacitated by high g-forces as the gondola erratically rotated around the remaining suspension cables. Thus the designers focused on assuring crew survival above 8,000 meters mark. USSR-1 was re-fitted with new suspension with a quick <b>release</b> <b>latch</b> that enabled instant separation of the gondola from the envelope, and a large (1,000 square meters, 34 meters diameter) parachute capable of stabilizing the fall at safe speeds; the upgraded aircraft was renamed USSR-1 Bis.|$|E
5000|$|The Smith & Wesson Model 10, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Smith & Wesson [...]38 Hand Ejector Model of 1899, the Smith & Wesson Military & Police or the Smith & Wesson Victory Model, is a revolver of worldwide popularity. It was the successor to the Smith & Wesson [...]32 Hand Ejector Model of 1896 {{and was the first}} Smith & Wesson revolver to feature a cylinder <b>release</b> <b>latch</b> {{on the left side of}} the frame like the Colt M1889. In production since 1899, it is a six-shot double-action revolver with fixed sights. Over its long production run it has been available with barrel lengths of 2 in (51 mm), 3 in (76 mm), 4 in (100 mm), 5 in (130 mm), and 6 in (150 mm). Barrels of 2.5 inches (64 mm) are also known to have been made for special contracts. [...] Some 6,000,000 of the type have been produced over the years, making it the most popular centerfire revolver of the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{difference}} in the new design was {{the placement of the}} cylinder <b>release</b> <b>latch.</b> Other revolvers place this latch on the frame, behind the cylinder. The Dan Wesson revolvers have the latch mounted on the cylinder crane, which was intended to increase the strength of the revolver by placing the locking mechanism {{at the point where the}} cylinder crane fits into the frame. Another change from most other existing designs was the use of a coil mainspring, which Lewis had pioneered with his design of the Colt Trooper [...]357. Revolvers with flat mainsprings must have a metal framework to anchor one end, while the other contacts the hammer. This framework generally forms the primary shape of the handgrip, to which the stocks are attached. The Dan Wesson design houses the coil mainspring inside a short extension of the frame, and the stock attaches to this extension with a screw inserted vertically through the bottom of the stock. The lack of a steel frame outline permits a wider amount of grip sizes and styles, since any grip that can accept the short mainspring housing can be used.|$|E
50|$|When {{originally}} {{built the}} estate was also famous for having only three patterns of key amongst {{the hundreds of}} front doors. If locked out, one simply borrowed one's neighbour's key. There were no mortice locks fitted as standard and children returning home were able to put their arms through the side mounted letter boxes and <b>release</b> the <b>latches.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In 1991, a [...] 4.9-liter V8—the {{largest of}} this type—became the new {{standard}} powerplant. Also new was a grille of an inverted trapezoid design (almost upside-down from last years egg-crate keystone design), and revised bumper and body-side moldings. The new grille held the familiar shape of the Cadillac crest itself—a styling cue that continues to this day. The grille was now attached to the forward edge of the hood, and lifted up along with the hood when raised (similar to Mercedes-Benz). The secondary hood <b>release</b> <b>latch</b> {{was at the bottom}} of the grille instead of its previous location above the passenger side headlight. In addition to the new engine and minor front-end restyling, several previously optional features became standard this year, including the anti-lock braking system, accent striping, automatic door locks, twilight sentinel headlamp control, electrochromic inside rear-view mirror, and electric rear window and side mirror defogger. New standard features included rear-seat air conditioning vents, central door unlocking from the driver's door and luggage compartment, sun visors with shaded slide-out extensions, rear window lock-out switch, brake / transmission interlock safety switch, and an oil life indicator through the fuel data center. Other new features included the available remote keyless entry system, and the optional illuminated mirrors now featured a slide switch that offered variable intensity lighting. The first [...] "Deville Touring Sedan" [...] became available to the public on April 1, 1991. As a limited edition of only 1,500 produced for the 1991 model year, it was offered in 5 monochromatic paint schemes: Carmine Red; Cotillion White; Black; Dark Slate Gray metallic; and Black Sapphire Metallic. Larger 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] forged aluminum wheels with a wreath and crest center cap were fitted to P215/60R16 Goodyear GA all-season radial tires. A quicker 17:1 steering gear was also used. The specific Beechwood-color interior of the DeVille Touring Sedan had leather seating areas and revised seat design with integral lumbar support. Both driver and passenger seat featured six-way power seat adjusters and power recliners. This specific interior also featured American Walnut wood accents on the doors and instrument panel. A grill-mounted wreath and crest replaced the traditional stand-up hood ornament. Side door moldings feature [...] "TOURING SEDAN" [...] lettering and import style break-away outside rearview mirrors were painted body color. Revised sport door handles also are painted body color. The revised exterior also included a cloisonne deck lid lock cover similar to the STS and Eldorado Touring Coupe. Approximately 75 of these 1991 models remain roadworthy as of December 31, 2014.|$|E
50|$|All Unionidae {{are known}} to use the gills, fins, or skin of a host fish for {{nutrients}} during the larval glochidia stage. Cyprogenia stegaria release into the water a conglutinate mimicking an Oligochaeta worm which contains the mussel's young. When a fish bites into the conglutinate lure, the young glochida are <b>released</b> and <b>latch</b> onto the fish's gills for nutrients.|$|R
2500|$|Magnetic circuit {{breakers}} use a solenoid (electromagnet) whose pulling force increases with the current. Certain designs utilize electromagnetic forces {{in addition to}} those of the solenoid. The circuit breaker contacts are held closed by a latch. As the current in the solenoid increases beyond the rating of the circuit breaker, the solenoid's pull <b>releases</b> the <b>latch,</b> which lets the contacts open by spring action.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{reviews the}} lessons learned from short-life and long life lubricated space mechanisms. A short-life lubricated mechanisms complete their life test qualification requirements after a few cycles. The mechanisms include the hinges, motors and bearings for deployment, <b>release</b> mechanisms, <b>latches,</b> <b>release</b> springs and support shops. Performance testing can be difficult and expensive but must be accomplished. A long-life lubricated mechanisms requires up to 5 years of life testing, or 10 to 100 years of successful flight. The long-life mechanisms include reaction wheels, momentum wheels, antenna gimbals, solar array drives, gyros and despin mechanisms. Several instances of how a mechanisms failed either in test, or in space use, and {{the lessons learned}} from these failures are reviewed. The effect of the movement away from CFC- 113 cleaning solvent to ODC (Ozone-Depleting Chemical) -free is reviewed, {{and some of the}} alternatives are discussed...|$|R
50|$|A Johnson bar is a {{hand lever}} with several {{distinct}} positions {{and a positive}} latch to hold the lever in the selected position. The latch is typically activated with a spring-loaded squeeze handle on the lever so that only one hand is needed to <b>release</b> the <b>latch,</b> move the lever, then re-engage the latch in a different position. This is an American English term; in British English, the lever is named for its function.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>release</b> of the <b>latch</b> and {{actuation}} of a drive, whether hydraulic (BMW 7 Series) {{or electric}} (BMW X6), which pushes the decklid {{away from the}} lock; the trunk is then open, and the lid reveals the opening. This may then be electrically closed again.|$|R
50|$|When {{the bolt}} release is locked {{down by the}} bolt <b>latch</b> <b>release</b> lock on the buffer tube sleeve, the gun {{functions}} in fully automatic mode. Conversely, the bolt release can be unlocked into the up position resulting in single-shot firing (the gunner must press the bolt <b>latch</b> <b>release</b> to send the bolt forward). Unlike virtually all other modern machine guns, it has no safety (although a sliding safety switch has recently been fielded to USMC armorers for installation on their weapons and is standard-issue for the U.S. Army for all M2s). Troops in the field {{have been known to}} add an improvised safety measure against accidental firing by slipping an expended shell casing under the butterfly trigger. The upgraded M2A1 has a manual trigger block safety.|$|R
50|$|The hinged design {{allows the}} trap to fold up flat into {{something}} only {{the width of}} one side panel. This makes it compact for storage and easy to transport to field locations (e.g. in a back pack). Both ends are hinged, but in normal operation the rear end is closed and the front folds inwards and latches the treadle, trigger plate, in place. When an animal enters far enough to be clear of the front door, their weight <b>releases</b> the <b>latch</b> and the door closes behind them.|$|R
50|$|The DoubleTap {{is unique}} in that it carries two {{chambered}} rounds, one in each barrel. It also carries two additional rounds in the grip which allow for reloading. The ambidextrous thumb <b>latch</b> <b>releases</b> the action and ejects the spent rounds so that the two backup rounds can be loaded.|$|R
50|$|Back tension release {{aids are}} the {{simplest}} mechanically, {{with only one}} moving part. However, {{as a result of}} this, they are the hardest style of release to learn how to use. The aid relies on the muscle tension through the forearms and back in order to <b>release</b> the <b>latch</b> {{at the end of the}} T-handle's leg. These releases are known for their accuracy and dependability on the tournament archery scene. They depend on the fulcrum of a lever over a half-moon-shaped piece of metal in order for the release to go off.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the Brompton or Birdy, this fold is not {{particularly}} compact; in fact, it is larger than many 20 and 16 in wheel folding bicycles (such as those from Dahon). However, the tikit's claim to fame is {{the speed of the}} fold in its [...] "Hyperfold" [...] model. Here, the action of rotating the rear of the bike slackens an internal cable which enables the handlebar stem to be folded. As a result, no quick <b>release</b> clamps, <b>latches,</b> or locks are involved in the fold. This feature, unique among folding bicycles, enables the tikit to fold easily in under five seconds.|$|R
50|$|The pistol has a {{double-action}} {{trigger and}} a rotating firing pin. Each {{pull of the}} trigger cocks and releases the hammer as well as rotating the firing pin to fire each chamber in succession. A top-mounted <b>latch</b> <b>released</b> the barrel assembly to open forward. Mossberg provided a piece of bent sheet metal to extract spent casings.|$|R
2500|$|A magnetic-hydraulic {{circuit breaker}} uses a solenoid coil to provide {{operating}} force {{to open the}} contacts. Magnetic-hydraulic [...] breakers incorporate a hydraulic time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the current exceeds the breaker rating. During an overload, {{the speed of the}} solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current surges beyond normal running current for motor starting, energizing equipment, etc. Short-circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to <b>release</b> the <b>latch</b> regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature. Ambient temperature affects the time delay but does not affect the current rating of a magnetic breaker.|$|R
5000|$|The gunner {{was forced}} to assume a fetal {{position}} within the turret with his back and head against the rear wall, his hips at the bottom, and his legs held in mid-air by two footrests on the front wall. This left him positioned with his eyes roughly level with the pair of light-barrel Browning AN/M2 [...]50 caliber machine guns which extended through the entire turret, located {{to either side of}} the gunner. The cocking handles were located too close to the gunner to be operated easily, so a cable was attached to the handle through pulleys to a handle near the front of the turret. Another factor was that not all stoppages could be corrected by charging (cocking) the guns. In many cases, when a stoppage occurred, it was necessary for the gunner to [...] "reload" [...] the gun, which required access to the firing chamber of the guns. Access was severely restricted by the guns' location in the small turret. Normally, the gunner accessed the firing chamber by <b>releasing</b> a <b>latch</b> and raising the cover to a position perpendicular to the gun but this was not possible in the ball turret. To remedy that, {{the front end of the}} cover was [...] "slotted". The gunner <b>released</b> the <b>latch</b> and removed the cover which allowed space to clear the action. Small ammunition boxes rested on the top of the turret and additional ammunition belts fed the turret by means of a chute system. A reflector sight was hung from the top of the turret, positioned roughly between the gunner's feet.|$|R
40|$|A {{thin-walled}} {{and tight}} core-retainer, {{which can be}} used also as a quick-acting valve for various purposes, was built in different models and successfully tested at sea. It is based on a cloth valve originally adapted to corers by H. Delauze, but twisted in this device, by an encasing torsion spring <b>released</b> by a <b>latch.</b> This latch is directly actuated by the sediment during the pull-up...|$|R
50|$|The {{magazines}} {{retain the}} spur {{at the front}} of the floor plate, common to both the M1934/5 and M1951, as is common for many pistols with a European-style magazine <b>release</b> (a hinged <b>latch</b> in the bottom of the grip against the magazine's floor plate), and also some compact pistols as a means of extending the grip surface while keeping the profile of the pistol small.|$|R
5000|$|ETRS: A {{modification}} introduced July 1982, ETRS {{production discontinued}} September 1989. Unnamed change to original ETRS model. Lens <b>release</b> sliding lever <b>latch</b> located to {{left side of}} camera side panel, film-backs released using two independent tabs. This version is reputedly {{referred to as the}} [...] "plastic" [...] body ETRS and film-back, for the change in the side panels of the body and film-backs to polycarbonate.|$|R
50|$|A hinge in {{the frame}} may allow the rear {{triangle}} and wheel to be folded down and flipped forward, under the main frame tube, as in the Bike Friday, Brompton Mezzo Folder, and Swift Folder. Such a flip hinge may be combined with a folding front fork, as in the Birdy. Swing and flip hinges may be combined on the same frame, as in the Brompton Mezzo Folder and Dahon, which use a folding steering column. Folding mechanisms typically involve <b>latches</b> and quick <b>releases,</b> which affect {{the speed of the}} fold/unfold. Bike Friday offers a model, the Tikit, featuring a cable-activated folding mechanism requiring no quick <b>releases</b> or <b>latches,</b> for increased folding speed.|$|R
