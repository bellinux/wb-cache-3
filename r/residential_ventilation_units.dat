40|$|The California Energy Commission is {{considering}} updating its requirements for <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{in the next}} round of its energy code, known as ''Title 24 ''. This report contains recommendations for potential changes to the code. These recommendations must be further developed into specific wording before they can be formally considered. <b>Residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> standards always address local and whole-house ventilation rates and some basic source control requirements, but there are many interactions with building systems that must also be considered. McKone and Sherman [8] laid out a set of additional issues that should be addressed before any specific changes to the code should be made. Those key issues included the following: Adventitious Air Flow; Air Distribution; Filtration and Air Cleaning; Occupant Acceptability and Control; Outdoor Air; Peak Demand; Unusual Sources and High-Polluting Events; and Window Operation. McWilliams and Sherman reviewed the literature on <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> and in particular these key issues. They also reviewed codes, standards and guidelines relevant to <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation.</b> That literature serves as the technical basis for this report...|$|R

40|$|Background: Workers are {{vulnerable}} to heat stress when they perform tasks in hot environments. Personal cooling systems (PCSs) are designed to reduce heat strain. A cooling vest with ventilation fans {{is a type of}} PCS that can blow air around the body to facilitate convective and evaporative cooling. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the performance of a <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> for a tailor-made cooling vest designed to protect construction workers from heat stress. The performance of this newly designed <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> (Unit B) was compared with that of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> used in a commercially available cooling vest (Unit A). Method: The designed <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> consists of a pair of ventilation fans and a portable battery pack. A hot wire anemometer was used to measure the air flow rate of the fan. The air flow rate and work duration of different <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were compared. The sweating manikin test was conducted to further compare the cooling powers of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Result: Compared with Unit A powered by the alkaline AA battery (6 V, 2122 mAh), Unit B powered by the rechargeable lithium-polymer (Li-Po) battery (7. 4 V, 4400 mAh) achieved a higher air flow rate (8 22 L/s vs. 0 - 13 L/s) and longer work duration (7. 05 h vs. 6. 22 h). The average cooling power of Unit B on the sweating manikin was 68 W, which was higher than that of Unit A (51 W). Practical applications: Results showed that the newly designed <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> exhibited higher air flow rate and cooling power. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> designed in this study will be incorporated into a tailor-made PCS for protecting workers in the heat. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop a <b>Residential</b> Integrated <b>Ventilation</b> Controller (RIVEC) to reduce the energy impact of {{required}} mechanical ventilation by 20 percent, maintain or improve indoor air quality and provide demand response benefits. This represents potential energy savings of about 140 GWh of electricity and 83 million therms of natural gas as well as proportional peak savings in California. The RIVEC controller is intended to meet the 2008 Title 24 requirements for <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> as well as taking into account the issues of outdoor conditions, other ventilation devices (including economizers), peak demand concerns and occupant preferences. The controller is designed to manage all the <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems that are currently available. A key innovation in this controller is the ability to implement the concept of efficacy and intermittent ventilation which allows time shifting of ventilation. Using this approach ventilation can be shifted away from times of high cost or high outdoor pollution towards times when it is cheaper and more effective. Simulations, based on the ones used to develop the new <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> requirements for the California Buildings Energy code, were used to further define the specific criteria and strategies needed for the controller. These simulations provide estimates of the energy, peak power and contaminant improvement possible for different California climates for the various ventilation systems.

40|$|Most of the {{available}} ventilation standards today are either descriptive or based on the perceived air quality theorem presented by (Fanger, 1988) eg. (CEN, 2004). In other research projects, {{the influence of the}} perceived air quality on office work performance (Wargocki et al., 2002), absenteeism or learning (Haverinen-Shaughnessy et al.) was investigated, establishing a correlation {{that can be used to}} trade-off the benefits of higher ventilation rates and the energy and investment cost related to it (Wargocki and Djukanovic, 2005). All of these experiments, however, relate to an active environment. (Seppanen and Fisk, 2004) provide a nice overview of the reported human response to changes in the ventilation rate. Most of {{the available}} <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> standards are more or less prescriptive and not performance based eg. the Belgian <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> standard (BIN, 1991). These standards are not suitable for system optimization due to the fact that they fix the sizing and layout of the systems to an absolute value, rather than the performance of the system. In order to develop a performance based <b>ventilation</b> standard for <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation,</b> understanding the human response to indoor environmental quality (IEQ) parameters will be of crucial importance to fix the performance indicators that are to be used to assess the performance of the system. However, about 70 % of the time we spend at home is spent asleep (Basner et al., 2007, Glorieux, 2008). During this time, we are in a semi-conscious state and are not engaged in tasks of which the performance can be measured by output.

40|$|This study reports {{ventilation}} {{measurement and}} occupant questionnaire results from newly built 102 Finnish detached houses. The {{results show that}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were used constantly and the fan speed setting was changed very seldom. There was a slight tendency to use higher speed in the summer than in winter. <b>Ventilation</b> <b>units</b> provide an average actual air change rate of about 0. 4 ach (13 L/s,pers) both in winter and summer which {{is less than the}} code value of 0. 5 ach. Airflow measurements at design fan speed show that only 57 % of houses comply with regulations. Low actual air change rates were caused by low fan speeds used by occupants as 52 % of houses in the winter and 47 % in the summer used the lowest possible fan speed. Correspondingly, actual supply airflow rates in bedrooms were low, in average 4 L/s. Occupant complaints about ventilation noise correlated with noise level in bedrooms.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{standards}} have been integrated {{in most of}} the buildings codes of European countries. Contrarily to the consolidation effort {{in the development of the}} nonresidential ventilation standard EN 13779, most of the <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> standards have been drafted in a prescriptive way, with disparate sizing prescriptions in the different countries. Due to these differences in ventilation requirements, the reference levels for ventilation heat loss and associated indoor air quality is different in each country. The energy saving potential for demand controlled systems is therefore different in each country as well. In this paper, the performance of natural, exhaust and mechanical <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> as prescribed by the standards of 5 European countries with moderate climate is assessed with regard to perceived air quality and odour spread as well as heating season integrated ventilation heat loss using multi zone simulations with local climate data. These results are then used to calculate the energy saving potential of a demand controlled exhaust ventilation system based taking into account the trade-off between indoor air quality and heat loss. With results showing that about 50 % of ventilation heat loss reductions can be achieved at equivalent indoor air quality levels, we conclude that demand controlled exhaust ventilation has a good potential for reduction of building energy use in moderate climates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the various design {{features}} of ventilated garments on cooling performance. Five jackets with small <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> and closable openings were designed. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> with a flow rate of 12 l/s were placed at five different torso sites. They were examined on a sweating thermal manikin in four clothing opening conditions in a warm environment (Ta=Tmanikin= 34 °C, RH= 60 %, Va= 0. 4 m/s). Total torso cooling was increased by 137 to 251 %, and clothing total dynamic evaporative resistance was decreased by 43 to 69 %. Neither the ventilation location nor the opening design had a significant difference on total torso cooling. The ventilation location had a significant difference on localized intra-torso cooling, but not the opening design. When the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were placed at the local zone where it was ventilated, that zone underwent the highest cooling than other local zones. The study indicated that the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> should be placed at the region where it required the most evaporative cooling, e. g. along the spine area and the lower back. The openings could be adjusted (closed or opened) to make comfortable air pressure for the wearers but without making significant difference on the whole torso cooling under this flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{measures have}} been analysed for a building of around 24000 m 2 from 1978. The property is used by different businesses. The specific energy use for this property is 75 kwh/m 2  for electricity and 114  kwh/m 2  for district heating. This projects ambition is to go lower than the Norrbotten county councils specific energy objective for their real estate facilities. The specific energy objective for year 2020 is {{that the use of}} electricity should be maximum 68  kwh/m 2  and 102  kwh/m 2  for district heating.   The result of the energy audit for the biggest energy consumption users (ventilation, heat and cooling) for the property is that 56 % of the electric consumption and 15 % of the district heating demand was identified. The 56 % can be divided in different parts: 44 % ventilation, lighting 22 %, climate control equipment 16 %, cooling equipment 10 % and engine warmers 8 %. In this project 14 of 19 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are studied and the reason that all {{are not part of the}} study is lack of information. The proposal for action was determined for 10 of the 14 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> The 4 remaining <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were not possible to analyse partly because of lack of logging of energy consumption where frequency converter were used. One of the omitted units had only a fan for supply air and no heat exchanger.   For each of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> in the group of the 10 selected an analysis was made selecting the most cost effective measures of the alternatives; installing a new <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit,</b> installing a frequency converter or replacing the motor of the unit.   The result of energy audit showed that adding extra insulation to the roof and upgrade of the ventilation system are recommended actions. All recommendations are estimated based on an evaluation of the power consumptions in real use denoted as average power of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b>   Proposal A suggests to install one new <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit,</b> install frequency converters in  5 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> and replace motors in 4 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Energy saving of electricity of these actions is 232 MWh and 174 MWh for district heating and the payback time is around 2, 7 years.   Proposal B suggests that 10 <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are replaced with new ones. The energy savings of electricity will be 206 MWh and for district heating 237 MWh and the resulting payback time is about 6, 4 years.   Proposal C is adding extra insulation to the roof and this provides a very cost-effective energy saving. If the roof was insulated with 20 cm the energy saving would be about  260 MWh and the payback time would be around 1, 6 years.   If additional insulation of the roof is installed as proposed in combination with upgrade of the ventilation system, the total energy consumption saving of 15 % is achieved from  4427 MWh to about 3761 MWh depending on choice of ventilation upgrade. (Proposal A+C 3761 MWh and proposal B+C 3724 MWh).   The investment cost is around 1, 5 million kr for proposal A+C and the yearly saving is  0, 7 million kr resulting in a payback time of 2, 3 years. The specific electric consumption would be 65, 3  kwh/m 2  and the specific district heat consumption would be 95  kwh/m 2.   The investment cost is around 3, 3 million kr for proposal B+C and the yearly saving is  0, 7 million kr resulting in a payback time of 4, 7 years. The specific electric consumption would be 66  kwh/m 2  and the specific district heat consumption would be 93  kwh/m 2.

In this study acoustics of an open-plan office at one receiver positon incorporating background speech were auralized. Then ventilation sounds of two different decentralized <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> at three <b>ventilation</b> rates producing sound emissions in between 25 and 45 dB(A) were added.

40|$|Ventilation is the {{cornerstone}} of good indoor air quality. Ventilation requirements have major attention in building regulations, but ventilation in practice is often poor, resulting in increased concentration of pollutants and hence exposure to health risk. Inspection of 500 houses with interviews of occupants provide the data to link <b>residential</b> <b>ventilation</b> with regulations, performance and user behavior. The chain of activities from design through execution to use and maintenance of ventilation systems shows weak links. Noise of fans limits the use of higher set points for the required ventilation volumes. Bedrooms become polluted because air circulation is poor and the ventilation capacity is not sufficient. Ventilation services are poorly maintained and after a few years the capacity is reduced with 30 - 50 %. When compensation for the effects of technical deterioration is not available, complaints about poor indoor air are more likely to occur. Recommendations are given for ventilation functions per individual room, for regulations in support of higher volumes in practice and for maintenance protocols.
