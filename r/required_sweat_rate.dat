The data base included the results from five experimental series involving 32 volunteers; these series involved environmental variations at constant metabolic rate, work-rest cycles in constant ambient conditions and alternate periods of work in heat and rest in neutral conditions. Observed and predicted variations in sweat rate were compared. During exposures to rapid changes in climatic conditions, the best prediction of the body sweat loss was provided by a model involving the simulation of the response of skin temperature and sweat rate to a step change in ambient conditions. The model used exponential weighting algorithms with time constants of 3 and 10 minutes respectively for these two variables. The study showed also that the prediction accuracy of SW(req) index can be significantly improved by adopting a new expression for the calculation of the evaporative efficiency of sweating, by predicting the mean T(sk) value {{as a function of}} the parameters of the work situation and by applying the exponential weighting to the predicted values of sweat rate. Among the various heat stress indices tested in the study, the <b>Required</b> <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> Index gave the best approximation of the body sweat loss...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} air {{velocity}} in promoting cooling through the evaporation of sweat generated when {{working at a}} high metabolic rate and/or in hot environments is well known. Many of the environmental heat stress indices consider the effect of air movement directly or indirectly within their determination, be it {{through the use of}} a specific instrument i. e. a wet-bulb globe temperature meter or Kata thermometer, or inclusion of in the calculation of a stress index, including the effective temperature, air cooling power, thermal working limit, ISO 7933 ?s predicted heat strain model. Within these models, ambient air temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure are also considered in varying degrees to quantify an airstream?s capacity to evaporate sweat. Deep mine studies have shown cumulative increases in heat exhaustion rates with both decreasing air velocity and decreasing air cooling powers. However, despite a capacity to cool, the resultant cooling is very dependant on sweat production and its availability for evaporation; these are included where <b>sweat</b> <b>rates</b> and skin wettedness are considered. The first depends on hydration and physiological factors whereas the second is more an engineering factor related to the degree of clothing <b>required.</b> As <b>sweat</b> <b>rates</b> deteriorate with aging, the benefits of evaporative cooling potential can similarly be expected to be diminished. This paper continues to report upon on-going physiological studies exploring the potential for heat stress in deep underground mines through the simulation of mining activities in environmental chambers and a human calorimeter facility. The focus of this paper is to introduce preliminary data suggesting that increasing air velocity (0. 5, 1. 5 & 3. 0 m/s) is beneficial for young subjects (22 1 1 yrs), as indicated by lower core and skin temperature measures and heart rate during an intermittent work protocol, and then show a lesser benefit for older subjects (62 1 2 yrs).

Nine young male volunteers (22 ± 4 years) were studied in temperate environment in two situations: at rest and during progressive exercise with 25 W increases every 2 min until exhaustion, on a cycle ergometer. In both situations, sweating was induced on the right forearm with 5 ml 0. 5 % pilocarpine hydrochloride applied by iontophoresis (1. 5 mA, 5 min), with left forearm used as control.

To investigate this question, seven subjects performed IHG (35 % maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for 2 min) followed by 2 -min of post-exercise ischaemia (PEI), {{with and without}} partial neuromuscular blockade (PNB). PNB was performed to augment central command during the IHG bout. These trials were conducted while the subject was normothermic, mildly heated, and moderately heated.

In normothermia with PNB, despite reduced force production during IHG (17 ± 9 versus 157 ± 13 N; P < 0. 001), the elevation in <b>sweating</b> <b>rate</b> at the neostigmine-treated site was greater relative to the control IHG bout (P < 0. 05).

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{strategy}} {{for the management of}} heat problems at the workplace. This includes three steps of analysis: the first aims at recognizing the problem and classifying it under one of the categories [...] comfort, discomfort but no health risk, or health risk either in the long term or in the short term. The second is designed to evaluate the magnitude of the problem and to optimize the choice of solutions. The interpretation of the data is based on analytical indices: the PMV-PPD indices for heat discomfort conditions and the <b>Required</b> <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> index for heat stress conditions. The third step involves an in-depth analysis of the situation: this will be undertaken only if a major problem of heat stress has been detected at the previous stage and providing technical solutions cannot be immediately implemented.

40|$|Background: Heat {{stress is}} common among workers in arid and {{semi-arid}} areas. In {{order to take}} every preventive measure to protect exposed workers against heat-related disorders, {{it is crucial to}} choose an appropriate index that accurately relates environmental parameters to physiological responses. Objective: To investigate the consistency between 2 heat stress and strain indices, ie, <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), for the assessment of heat stress of people working outdoor in arid and semi-arid regions in Iran. Methods: During spring and summer, 136 randomly selected outdoor workers were enrolled in this study. Using a defined protocol, the <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> of these workers was measured 3 times a day. Simultaneously, the environmental parameters including WBGT index were recorded for each working station. Results: The level of agreement between <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> and WBGT was poor (κ< 0. 2). Based on <b>sweat</b> <b>rate,</b> no case exceeding the reference value was observed during the study. WBGT overestimated the heat stress in outdoor workers compared to <b>sweat</b> <b>rate.</b> Conclusion: It seems that the <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> standards may need some modifications related to real condition of work in arid and semi-arid regions in Iran. Moreover, it seems that judging workers solely based on monitoring their <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> in such regions, can probably result in underestimation of heat stress...|$|R
40|$|Objectives We {{developed}} a wearable sensor {{for the real}} time measurement of <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> in localized areas of the human body. This sensor represents {{the first step in}} the development of a wearable sensor network capable to estimate the global <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> via an ad hoc algorithm. Such device would be used to monitor athletes' hydration status during training and improve their performances. Equipment and Methods For this study, we tested our sensor on thirteen football players during a cycling test on a cycle ergometer. The <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> sensor was compared to a medical device that, although measuring a different physiological process, provides discrete data based on the same working principle, i. e. the diffusion of the water vapour emitted from the skin. Results Our sensor has a working range up to 400 g/m 2 ·h. The statistical analysis and the Bland-Altman plot proved that our sensor is comparable to the medical device used as gold standard. At low <b>sweat</b> <b>rate,</b> the bias is 3. 4 g/m 2 ·h with a standard deviation of 7. 6 g/m 2 ·h. At maximum <b>sweat</b> <b>rates,</b> the bias is 2. 3 g/m 2 ·h with a standard deviation 6. 9 g/m 2 ·h. The p values for the Bland-Altman plots at low and maximum <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> (0. 1331 and 0. 2477 obtained by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, respectively) allow the hypothesis that there is a significant difference between our <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> sensor and the medical device to be rejected. Conclusion We presented a prototype of a wearable <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> sensor for localized measurements. The trials on thirteen athletes proved that the performance of our sensor is comparable to that of a commercial medical device. This <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> sensor can provide valuable information on athletes' hydration status...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to identify whether the elevation in arterial blood pressure during post-exercise ischaemia contributes to the increase in sweating. In normothermia and during whole-body heating, 2 min IHG exercise at 40 % maximal voluntary contraction, followed by 2 min post-exercise ischaemia, was performed with and without bolus intravenous administration of sodium nitroprusside during the ischaemic period. Sodium nitroprusside was administered to reduce blood pressure during post-exercise ischaemia to pre-exercise levels. <b>Sweat</b> <b>rate</b> was monitored over two microdialysis membranes placed in the dermal space of forearm skin. One membrane was perfused with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine, while the other was perfused with the vehicle. In normothermia, IHG exercise increased <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> at the neostigmine-treated site but not at the control site. <b>Sweat</b> <b>rate</b> remained elevated during post-exercise ischaemia even after mean arterial blood pressure returned to the pre-IHG exercise baseline. Subsequent removal of the ischaemia stimulus returned <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> to pre-IHG exercise levels. <b>Sweat</b> <b>rate</b> during post-exercise ischaemia without sodium nitroprusside administration followed a similar pattern. During whole-body heating, IHG exercise increased <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> at both neostigmine-treated and untreated sites. Similarly, regardless of whether mean arterial blood pressure remained elevated or was reduced during post-exercise ischaemia, <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> remained elevated during the ischaemic period. These results suggest that sweating in non-glabrous skin during post-IHG exercise ischaemia is activated by metaboreflex stimulation and not via baroreceptor loading...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} about {{the evaluation of}} human exposure to thermal environments has been performed for a long time, nowadays making available many indices allowing us to do a complete and refined evaluation. Shortly, the followed approaches are of the two types: that one based on empirically obtained indices (WBGT, Effective Temperature etc.) and the rational one, based on human body heat balance and thermoregulatory response evaluation (PMV-PPD, New Effective Temperature, HSI, <b>Required</b> <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> index etc.). Really and as a general rule, the field of application of these indices {{is limited to the}} evaluation of thermal comfort or alternatively of heat stress, being so required to use different indices for stress or comfort, not existing a single index for an evaluation in both cases. Starting from these premises the authors propose a method for evaluating human thermal exposure with two main goals: to be used also outdoor, thus taking into account direct and not direct thermal effects of solar radiation, and to allow both the evaluation of thermal comfort and stress exposure (as required), even if with a little greater approximation than that one obtained by using the single indices...|$|E
40|$|The ISO 7933 <b>Required</b> <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> Index is {{inappropriate}} {{under conditions of}} fluctuating exposure. Time weighted average values can introduce large underestimations as, for hot conditions, the relationship between physical stress and physiological strain is not linear. Mean skin temperature and sweat rate vary as a first order system, that is, according to an exponential averaging system, {{in response to a}} step function of the primary parameters. A very simple algorithm has been derived to take into account this exponential averaging and to predict the sweat rate at any time, taking into account the past exposure of the subject. It is based on time constants of 3 min for the mean skin temperature and of 25 min (up to a sweat rate of 50 W. m- 2) and 10 min for the sweat rate. The correlation coefficient is 0. 780 between observed and predicted sweat rates in independent experiments used for the validation of the model. This emphasises the necessity for exponential averaging as differences between individuals are very important and the precision of the observed data in these experiments was lower than for laboratory experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of alumina {{involves the use}} of a process known as the Bayer process. This method involves the digestion of raw bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures around 250 °C. The resultant pregnant liquor then goes through a number of filtering and precipitation processes to obtain the aluminium oxide crystals which are then calcined to obtain the final product. The plant is situated in a sub tropical climate in Northern Australia and this combined with the hot nature of the process results in a potential for heat related illnesses to develop. When assessing a work environment for heat stress a heat stress index is often employed as a guideline and to date the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) has been the recommended index. There have been concerns over the past that the WBGT is not suited to the Northern Australian climate and in fact studies in other countries have suggested this is the case. This study was undertaken in the alumina plant situated in Gladstone Queensland to assess if WBGT was in fact the most suitable index for use or if another was more applicable. To this end three indices, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), Heat Stress Index (HSI) and <b>Required</b> <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> (SWreq) were compared and assessed using physiological monitoring of heart rate and surrogate core temperature. A number of different jobs and locations around the plant were investigated utilising personal and environmental monitoring equipment. These results were then collated and analysed using a computer program written as part of the study for the manipulation of the environmental data. Physiological assessment was carried out using methods approved by international bodies such as National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) and International Standards Organisation (ISO) and incorporated the use of a ‘Physiological Factor’ developed to enable the comparison of predicted allowable exposure times and strain on the individual. Results indicated that of the three indices tested, <b>Required</b> <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> was found to be the most suitable for the climate and in the environment of interest. The WBGT system was suitable in areas in the moderate temperature range (ie 28 to 32 °C) but had some deficiencies above this temperature or where the relative humidity exceeded approximately 80 %. It was however suitable as a first estimate or first line indicator. HSI over-estimated the physiological strain in situations of high temperatures, low air flows and exaggerated the benefit of artificial air flows on the worker in certain environments ie. fans...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{acclimation}} reduces sweat sodium 2 The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine the effect of active heat acclimation on the sweat osmolality and sweat sodium ion concentration verses <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> relationship in humans. Eight healthy male volunteers completed 10 days of exercise in the heat. The mean exercising heart rate and core temperature were significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) by 18 beats min- 1 and 0. 6 °C, respectively, following heat acclimation. Furthermore, sweat osmolality and the sweat sodium ion concentration versus <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> relationships were shifted to the right. Specifically, the slopes of the relationships were not affected by heat acclimation. Rather, heat acclimation significantly reduced the y-intercepts of the sweat osmolality and sweat sodium relationships with <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> by 28 mosmol kg – 1 and 15 mmol L– 1, respectively.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} heat acclimation on <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> redistribution and thermodynamic parameters, 9 tropical native volunteers were submitted to 11 days of exercise-heat exposures (40 +/- 0 degrees C and 45. 1 +/- 0. 2 % relative humidity). Sudomotor function was evaluated by measuring total and local (forehead, chest, arm, forearm, and thigh) <b>sweat</b> <b>rates,</b> local <b>sweat</b> sodium concentration, and mean skin and rectal temperatures. We also calculated heat production (H), heat storage (S), heat exchange by radiation (R) and by convection (C), evaporated sweat (E(sw)), sweating efficiency (eta(sw)), skin wettedness (w(sk)), and the ratio between the heat storage and the sum of heat production and heat gains by radiation and convection (S/(H+R+C)). The heat acclimation increased the whole-body <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> and reduced the mean skin temperature. There were changes in the local <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> patterns: on the arm, forearm, and thigh it increased significantly from day 1 to day 11 (all p< 0. 05) and the <b>sweat</b> <b>rates</b> from the forehead and the chest showed a small nonsignificant increase (p= 0. 34 and 0. 17, respectively). The relative increase of local <b>sweat</b> <b>rates</b> on day 11 was not different among the sites; however, when comparing the limbs (arm, forearm, and thigh) with the trunk (forehead and chest), {{there was a significant}} higher increase in the limbs (32 +/- 5 %) in comparison to the trunk (11 +/- 2 %, p= 0. 001). After the heat acclimation period we observed higher w(sk) and E(sw) and reduced S/(H+R+C), meaning greater thermoregulatory efficiency. The increase in the limb <b>sweat</b> <b>rate,</b> but not the increase in the trunk <b>sweat</b> <b>rate,</b> correlated with the increased w(sk), E(sw), and reduced S/(H+R+C) (p< 0. 05 to all). Altogether, it can be concluded that heat acclimation increased the limbs` <b>sweat</b> <b>rates</b> in tropical natives and that this increase led to increased loss of heat through evaporation of sweat and this higher sweat evaporation was related to higher thermoregulatory efficiency.

40|$|Displeasure {{in respect}} to air volumes and {{associated}} airflow velocities are well-documented complaints in underground mines. The complaints often differ in the form that there is too little airflow velocity or too much. In hot and humid climates such as those prevailing in many underground mines, convection heat transfer is the major mode of heat rejection from the human body, {{through the process of}} sweat evaporation. Consequently, the motion of the mine air plays a pivotal role in aiding this process. In this paper, a method was developed and adopted {{in the form of a}} “comfort model” to predict the optimum airflow velocity required to maintain heat comfort for the underground workforce at different activity levels (e. g. metabolic rates). Simulation analysis predicted comfort limits in the form of <b>required</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> and maximum skin wetness. Tolerable worker heat exposure times were also predicted in order to minimize thermal strain due to dehydration. The results indicate that an airflow velocity in the range of 1 – 2  m/s is the ideal velocity in order to provide a stress/strain free climate and also guarantee thermal comfort for the workers. Therefore, an optimal airflow velocity of 1. 5  m/s for the miners' thermal comfort is suggested...|$|E

The scientific bases of this standard were thoroughly reviewed and a revised model, called "Predicted Heat Strain" (PHS), was developed. This model was then used to predict the minute by minute sweat rates and rectal temperatures during 909 laboratory and field experiments collected from the partners. The Pearson correlation coefficients between observed and predicted values were equal to 0. 76 and 0. 66 for laboratory experiments and 0. 74 and 0. 59 for field experiments, respectively, for the sweat rates and the rectal temperatures. The change in sweat rate with time was predicted more accurately by the PHS model than by the <b>required</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> model.

Ainda, o índice de sudorese requerida mostrou-se abaixo do máximo permitido, entretanto, a fração de pele molhada requerida (wreq) é igual à fração de pele molhada máxima (wmax), expondo os indivíduos à situação de perigo. Desta forma, nota-se que a atividade de radiopatrulhamento realizada pelos Policiais Militares do 1 º Batalhão da Paraíba é considerada como inadequada no que se refere aos parâmetros térmicos. One increasingly common workplace {{in the twenty-first century}} is the automobile. It is used to realize the activity of car patrolling by the Military Police. Being the state of Paraíba in a tropical and semi-arid climate, considering the standard uniform used by the police for the activity concerned, besides the instruments needed for the activity, ratings related to thermal comfort of officers on the car patrolling activity becomes summary, being this the objective of this study. For this purpose the following standards were applied: ISO 14505 (2007) : Ergonomics of the thermal environment - Evaluation of thermal environments in vehicles, ISO 7243 (1989) : Hot environments - Estimation of the heat stress on working man, based on the WBTG-index and ISO 7933 (1989) : Hot environments - Analytical determination and interpretation of thermal stress using calculation of <b>required</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>rate.</b> The results showed that all the parameters considered in ISO 14505 - 3 (2006) showed the thermal environment as uncomfortable. Moreover, after correction of the thermal insulation factor for the WBGT index, considering a &# 773;&# 773;&# 773;&# 773;&# 773;&# 773;&# 773;&# 773;&# 773; = 27. 88 º C it is determined that the activities under study can not be performed without precautionary steps to be taken. Still, the required sweating rate was below the maximum allowed, however, the fraction of required wet skin (wreq) is equal to the fraction of maximum wet skin (wmax), exposing the subjects to the danger. Thus, it is noticed that among the studied parameters, the activity of car patrolling performed by the Military Police of the 1 st Battalion of Paraíba is considered inadequate in relation to the thermal parameters...|$|E

Eight healthy male volunteers completed 10 days of exercise in the heat.

Furthermore, sweat osmolality and the sweat sodium ion concentration vs. <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> relationships were shifted to the right.

40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the mean}} skin temperature used for the <b>Required</b> <b>Sweat</b> <b>Rate</b> index was criticised for not being valid in conditions with high radiation and high humidity. Based on a large database provided by 9 institutes, 1999 data points obtained using steady-state conditions, from 1399 experiments and involving 377 male subjects, {{were used for the}} development of a new prediction model. The observed mean skin temperatures ranged from 30. 7 degrees C to 38. 6 degrees C. Experimental conditions included air temperatures (Ta) between 20 and 55 degrees C, mean radiant temperatures (Tr) up to 145 degrees C, partial vapour pressures (Pa) from 0. 2 to 5. 3 kPa, air velocities (v(a)) between 0. 1 and 2 m/s, and metabolic rates (M) from 102 to 620 W. Rectal temperature (T(re)) was included in the models to increase the accuracy of prediction. Separate models were derived for nude (clothing insulation, I(cl), < or = 0. 2 clo, where 1 clo = 0. 155 m 2 x degrees C x W(- 1), which is equivalent to the thermal insulation of clothing necessary to maintain a resting subject in comfort in a normally ventilated room, air movement = 10 cm/s, at a temperature of 21 degrees C and a humidity of less than 50 %) and clothed (0. 6 < or = I(cl) < or = 1. 0 clo) subjects using a multiple linear regression technique with re-sampling (non-parametric bootstrap). The following expressions were obtained for nude and clothed subjects, respectively: T(sk) = 7. 19 + 0. 064 Ta + 0. 061 Tr + 0. 198 Pa - 0. 348 v(a) + 0. 616 T(re) and T(sk) = 12. 17 + 0. 020 Ta + 0. 044 Tr + 0. 194 Pa - 0. 253 v(a) + 0. 0029 M + 0. 513 T(re). For the nude and clothed subjects, 83. 3 % and 81. 8 %, respectively, of the predicted skin temperatures were within the range of +/- 1 degree C of the observed skin temperatures.

Assessment of the heat stress is important from the disease prevention point of view and also for the safety and performance of workers at workplace. Although there are many indices to evaluate the heat stress, it is hard to select an applicable index for a wide range of weather conditions. The purpose of the study was to develop an optimal index based on physiological parameters in a petrochemical industry. &nbsp; Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in a petrochemical industry located in Assaluyeh (south of Iran). Twenty one healthy young men at different levels of fitness and heat acclimation volunteered to participate in the study. Physiological parameters including heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, skin temperature and oral temperature were measured during the working day over two consecutive weeks. Simultaneously, we measured the climatic parameters required to calculate the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), <b>required</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> (SWreq), and the discomfort index (DI) indices. Results: All the measurements took place on 2 sites: Kar (working place) and Paziresh (resting room). Our results showed&nbsp; that the mean values of indices and physiological parameters&nbsp;&nbsp; in Kar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for both acclimated and unacclimated groups were significantly higher than Paziresh (P&lt; 0. 05). There was the strongest linear correlation between WBGT and heart rate (0. 731), systolic blood pressure (0. 695) and diastolic blood pressure (0. 375) and skin temperature (0. 451) respectively. The amounts of DI were 0. 725, 0. 446, 0. 352, and 0. 689 respectively. But the strongest linear relationship existed between SWreq and deep body temperature (0. 766). Conclusion:&nbsp; There were significant differences in the present indices and physiological parameters of Kar and Paziresh, confirming the previous studies findings. Finally, WBGT was considered optimal index and the results revealed the almost perfect linear correlation between WBGT and heart rate. We propose WBGT can be the most applicable index for evaluating heat stress in this climate. &nbsp;&nbsp; st 1 ":*{behavior:url(#ieooui) } /* Style Definitions */ table.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Influential models, capable of predicting human responses to hot and cold environments and potentially suitable for use in practical applications, have been identified and implemented in usable forms onto computers. Six models have been evaluated: the Gagge and Nishi 2 -node model of human thermoregulation, the Stolwijk and Hardy 25 -node model of human thermoregulation, the Givoni and Goldman model of rectal temperature response, the ISO/DIS 7933 analytical determination and interpretation of thermal stress using calculation of <b>required</b> <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> model, the Ringuest 25 -node model of human thermoregulation, and the Wissler 225 -node model of human thermoregulation. A preliminary evaluation enabled the Ringuest and Wissler models to be eliminated from further investigation. In {{the case of the}} Ringuest model this was because of its poor predictions, and for the Wissler model because of practical difficulties with its implementation and use. The remaining models were modified to quantify the insulative effects of clothing by the method considered to be most appropriate, given the current state of knowledge. The modified versions of the models were evaluated by comparing their predictions with human data published previously in the literature. Experimental data were available {{for a wide range of}} environmental conditions, with air temperatures ranging from - 10 to 50 °C, and with different levels of air movement, humidity, work and clothing. Data for a total of 590 subject exposures were used. The experimental data were grouped into environment categories to enable effects such as the influence of wind or clothing, on the accuracy of the models' predictions to be examined. This categorization also enables advice to be given as to which model is likely to provide the most accurate predictions for a particular combination of environmental conditions. For the majority of environment categories, for which evaluation data were available, at least one of the models was able to predict to an accuracy comparable with the degree of variation that occurred within the data from the human subjects. It may be concluded from the evaluation that it is possible to accurately predict deep body and mean skin temperature responses to cool, neutral, warm and hot environmental conditions. The models' predictions of deep body temperature in the cold are poor. Overall, the 25 -node model probably provided the most accurate predictions. The 2 -node model was often accurate, but could be poor for exercise conditions. The rectal temperature model usually overestimated deep body temperature, except for very hot or heavy exercise conditions, where its predictions were reasonable. The ISO model's allowable exposure times were often acceptable, but would not have protected subjects for some exercise conditions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the nonthermoregulatory control of cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) and sweating during recovery from exercise-induced hyperthermia as well as to determine possible sex-related differences during the recovery period. It was hypothesized that an active and passive recovery would maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP), CVC and <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> at higher levels than an inactive recovery and result in a faster rate of esophageal temperature (Tes) decay. It was also hypothesized that changes in MAP, CVC and <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> would be sex dependent. Methods. Eighteen participants (9 males, 9 females) were rendered hyperthermic by exercise (i. e. Tes = 39. 5 °C) and recovered in one of three recovery modalities for 60 -min: (1) active, (2) inactive or (3) passive. Tes, CVC, <b>sweat</b> <b>rate,</b> cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, total peripheral resistance, and MAP were recorded at baseline and 2, 5, 12, 20 and every 10 -min until the end of recovery. Results. Both active and passive recoveries were equally effective in maintaining MAP, CVC and <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> at greater levels compared with an inactive recovery (p ≤ 0. 05). A significantly lower Tes was subsequently observed during passive recovery at 20 -min {{and for the rest of}} recovery compared to the active mode (p ≤ 0. 05). Sex did not affect any of the measured variables at any time point during any recovery mode, with the exception of <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> which was significantly higher in males throughout the recovery period (p ≤ 0. 05). Conclusion. We conclude that despite an important thermal drive, nonthermal input remains an important influence in the modulation of postexercise heat loss responses. Further, action of the muscle pump/mechanoreceptors is the main nonthermal determinant in the postexercise modulation of MAP, CVC and <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> irrespective of sex...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{findings}} suggest that baroreflexes are capable of modulating skin blood flow, but the effects of baroreceptor loading/unloading on sweating are less clear. Therefore, this project tested the hypothesis that pharmacologically induced alterations in arterial blood pressure in heated humans would lead to baroreflex-mediated changes in both skin sympathetic nerve activity (SSNA) and <b>sweat</b> <b>rate.</b> In seven subjects mean arterial blood pressure was lowered (≈ 8 mmHg) and then raised (≈ 13 mmHg) by bolus injections of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. Moreover, in a separate protocol, arterial blood pressure was reduced via steady-state administration of sodium nitroprusside. In both normothermia and heat-stress conditions the following responses were monitored: sublingual and mean skin temperatures, heart rate, beat-by-beat blood pressure, skin blood flow (laser-Doppler flowmetry), local <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> and SSNA (microneurography from peroneal nerve). Whole-body heating increased skin and sublingual temperatures, heart rate, cutaneous blood flow, <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> and SSNA, but did not change arterial blood pressure. Heart rate was significantly elevated (from 74 ± 3 to 92 ± 4 beats min− 1; P < 0. 001) during bolus sodium nitroprusside-induced reductions in blood pressure, and significantly reduced (from 92 ± 4 to 68 ± 4 beats min− 1; P < 0. 001) during bolus phenylephrine-induced elevations in blood pressure, thereby demonstrating normal baroreflex function in these subjects. Neither SSNA nor <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> was altered by rapid (bolus infusion) or sustained (steady-state infusion) changes in blood pressure regardless of the thermal condition. These data suggest that SSNA and <b>sweat</b> <b>rate</b> are not modulated by arterial baroreflexes in normothermic or moderately heated individuals...|$|R
