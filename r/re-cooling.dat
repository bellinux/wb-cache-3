They are both particular cases of the Gibbs Equations of Josiah Willard Gibbs: the Kelvin equation is the constant temperature case, and the Gibbs-Thomson equation is the constant pressure case.This behaviour {{is closely related to}} the capillary effect and both are due to the change in bulk free energy caused by the curvature of an interfacial surface under tension.The original equation only applies to isolated particles, but with the addition of surface interaction terms (usually expressed in terms of the contact wetting angle) can be modified to apply to liquids and their crystals in porous media. As such it has given rise to various related techniques for measuring pore size distributions.

40|$|AbstractA {{reliable}} {{solar thermal}} cooling and heating system with high solar fraction and seasonal {{energy efficiency ratio}} (SEER) is preferable. By now, bulky sensible buffer tanks are used to improve the solar fraction for heating purposes. During summertime when solar heat is converted into useful cold by means of sorption chillers the waste heat dissipation to the ambient is the critical factor. If a dry cooler is installed the performance of the sorption machine suffers from high cooling water temperatures, especially on hot days. In contrast, a wet cooling tower causes expensive water treatment, formation of fog and the risk of legionella and bacterial growth. To overcome these problems a latent heat storage based on a cheap salt hydrate has been developed to support a dry cooler on hot days, whereby a constant low cooling water temperature for the sorption machine is ensured. Therefore the need of a wet cooling tower is avoided and neither make-up water nor maintenance is needed. The same storage serves as additional low temperature heat storage for heating purposes allowing optimal solar yield due to constant low storage temperatures. Four pilot installations between 7 kW and 90 kW nominal cooling capacity were equipped with latent heat storages between 80 kWh and 240 kWh energy content.

In ad hoc networks, the main issue about designing of protocols is quality of service, so that in wireless sensor networks the main constraint in designing protocols is limited energy of sensors. In fact, protocols which minimize the power consumption in sensors are more considered in wireless sensor networks. One approach of reducing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks {{is to reduce the}} number of packages that are transmitted in network. The technique of collecting data that combines related data and prevent transmission of additional packages in network can be effective in the reducing of transmitted packages’ number. According to this fact that information processing consumes less power than information transmitting, Data Aggregation has great importance and because of this fact this technique is used in many protocols [5]. One of the Data Aggregation techniques is to use Data Aggregation tree. But finding one optimum Data Aggregation tree to collect data in networks with one sink is a NP-hard problem. In the Data Aggregation technique, related information packages are combined in intermediate nodes and form one package.

For the single-effect water LiBr absorption chiller process a physical model to describe steady-state process-behaviour is developed. Furthermore, the possibilities to develop optimised system components as well as the influence of operation and design parameters are examined. The influence of chilled water, <b>re-cooling</b> water, hot water temperature and mass flow of internal solution to chiller capacity and COP are examined by use of this model. Concerning the generator design three different concepts to guarantee of a possible high level capacity for low driving heat temperatures are considered, a flooded ripped-tube-evaporator (standard solution), a concept with plate heat exchanger and separated steam drum and a concept with a horizontal spray film evaporator. An optimisation of the process design for different operation conditions is included. Due to the dynamically unfavourable operating behaviour of single-effect water LiBr absorption chiller a dynamic model of the absorption process is developed and the dynamic operation characteristics are studied. Additional to this analysis new control concepts are discussed and new solutions to guarantee a better operational behaviour are suggested. Furthermore, the influence of initial concentration and initial hold-up of the different main components to the performance characteristics of the chiller are studied. Finally, the analysis of results are compared to the behaviour of a single stage absorption chiller unit of the chiller plant of the University of Dortmund...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of the non-linear behaviour of a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) coupled to a RF tank circuit. We consider two regimes, one where the underlying SQUID behaviour is non-hysteretic with respect to an externally applied magnetic flux, and the other where hysteretic (dissipative) behaviour is observed. We show that, by following non-linearities induced in the tank circuit response, the underlying behaviour of the SQUID ring can be inferred. Experimental techniques used to probe the coupled system are described and we demonstrate that by achieving an exceptionally low noise environment a number of new and significant non-linear phenomena are exposed. We show that these, and other new dynamical phenomena, can only be predicted by a rigorous, non-linearised approach to the Resistively Shunted Junction plus Capacitance (RSJ+C) model of a SQUID. The system response to a monochromatic electromagnetic (em) field is investigated for frequencies in the UHF and microwave ranges. Most significantly, we show experimentally that for frequencies in the microwave range, there is a remarkable rise in Rf power at the resonant frequency of the tank circuit, consistent with down conversion from the em field. Moreover, we demonstrate that such down conversion is most dominant in a previously unexplored region of parameter space. The theoretical modelling is extended by investigating the dynamical behaviour of the system in previously unexplored regions of parameter space. We show that these calculations predict a range of previously unreported dynamical I-V characterises for SQUID rings in the strongly hysteretic regime. Finally, we present the successful realisation of a novel experimental technique that permits the weak link of a SQUID to be probed independently of the associated ring structure by mechanically opening and closing the ring. We demonstrate that this process can be completed during the same experimental run without the need for warming and <b>re-cooling</b> of the sample.
