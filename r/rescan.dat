40|$|In recent years, {{particle}} {{therapy has}} become a widely accepted form of cancer treatment and technological advances in beam delivery technology (i. e. pencil beam scanning (PBS)) have enabled the application of highly conformal dose distributions to static targets. Current research focuses on the possibilities {{for the treatment of}} mobile targets with these techniques. Of different motion mitigation methods being investigated, <b>rescanning</b> is perhaps the easiest to apply clinically. In general however, different PBS delivery systems exhibit a different temporal parameter space between delivery and target motions, due to the system specific beam position adjustment times (BPATs). Depending on these BPATs, dosimetric effects appearing during irradiation of moving targets vary significantly. In this work, volumetric and layered <b>rescanning</b> were compared for four different scenarios [...] a combination of fast and slow BPATs laterally (4 ms and 10 ms) and in depth (80 ms and 1 s); and nine different treatment plan arrangements for two clinical liver cases. 4 D dose calculations were performed assuming regular, sinusoidal rigid motion as a worst-case motion scenario to model interplay effects. Calculations were sampled over three different starting phases resulting in a total of 432 dose distributions. It was found that layered <b>rescanning</b> is the method of choice for slow scanning systems, both in terms of dose homogeneity (D 5 - 95 values are lower by up to 16 % with layered <b>rescanning)</b> and in the estimated treatment delivery times (reduction of up to 300 s with layered <b>rescanning).</b> Analysis of dose homogeneity showed that layered <b>rescanning</b> leads to a smoother decrease in dose inhomogeneity {{as a function of the}} number of <b>rescans</b> than volumetric <b>rescanning,</b> which shows larger fluctuations. However, layered <b>rescanning</b> appears to be more sensitive to the starting phase. When analyzing the performance of both approaches and different scanning speeds as a function of delivery time, layered <b>rescanning</b> appears to be the only viable approach for slow energy changing systems, even approaching the performance of fast energy changing systems, as long as lateral scanning speeds are kept high. Similar results were found for multiple field plans and when analyzing different field directions...|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of mobile targets with scanned particle beams is challenging, {{and the effects}} of motion will be especially pronounced in hypo-fractionated treatment regimes {{due to the lack of}} statistical smoothing through fractionation and the prolonged delivery times per session. Therefore, motion mitigation techniques will play a major role for radiosurgery approaches. This article concentrates on the motion mitigation technique called <b>rescanning.</b> It alludes the existence of many scanning/rescanning flavors and raises awareness of the importance of an optimized flavor choice. Furthermore, it is discussed that <b>rescanning</b> can compensate for the lack of statistical wash-out, target dose conformity, however, will remain degraded. Therefore, especially in the context of radiosurgery, <b>rescanning</b> should be combined with other motion mitigation techniques like breath hold, gating and/or tracking...|$|R

40|$|Pencil beam scanned (PBS) {{proton therapy}} has many {{advantages}} over conventional radiotherapy, but its effectiveness for treating mobile tumours remains questionable. Gating dose delivery to the breathing pattern is a well-developed method in conventional radiotherapy for mitigating tumour-motion, but its clinical efficiency for PBS proton therapy {{is not yet}} well documented. In this study, the dosimetric benefits and the treatment efficiency of beam gating for PBS proton therapy has been comprehensively evaluated. A series of dedicated 4 D dose calculations (4 DDC) have been performed on 9 different 4 DCT(MRI) liver data sets, which give realistic 4 DCT extracting motion information from 4 DMRI. The value of 4 DCT(MRI) is its capability of providing not only patient geometries and deformable breathing characteristics, but also includes variations in the breathing patterns between breathing cycles. In order to monitor target motion and derive a gating signal, we simulate time-resolved beams' eye view (BEV) x-ray images as an online motion surrogate. 4 DDCs have been performed using three amplitude-based gating window sizes (10 / 5 / 3 [*]mm) with motion surrogates derived from either pre-implanted fiducial markers or the diaphragm. In addition, gating has also been simulated in combination with up to 19 times <b>rescanning</b> using either volumetric or layered approaches. The quality of the resulting 4 DDC plans has been quantified {{in terms of the}} plan homogeneity index (HI), total treatment time and duty cycle. Results show that neither beam gating nor <b>rescanning</b> alone can fully retrieve the plan homogeneity of the static reference plan. Especially for variable breathing patterns, reductions of the effective duty cycle to as low as 10 % have been observed with the smallest gating <b>rescanning</b> window (3 [*]mm), implying that gating on its own for such cases would result in much longer treatment times. In addition, when <b>rescanning</b> is applied on its own, large differences between volumetric and layered <b>rescanning</b> have been observed as a function of increasing number of re-scans. However, once gating and <b>rescanning</b> is combined, HI to within 2 % of the static plan could be achieved in the clinical target volume, with only moderately prolonged treatment times, irrespective of the <b>rescanning</b> strategy used. Moreover, these results are independent of the motion surrogate used. In conclusion, our results suggest image guided beam gating, combined with <b>rescanning,</b> is a feasible, effective and efficient motion mitigation approach for PBS-based liver tumour treatments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{antibody}} microarray {{technique is}} a newly emerging proteomics tool for differential protein expression analyses that uses fluorescent dyes Cy 3 and Cy 5. Environmental factors, such as light exposure, {{can affect the}} signal intensity of fluorescent dyes on microarray slides thus, it is logical to scan microarray slides immediately after the final wash and drying processes. However, no research data are available concerning time-dependent changes of fluorescent signals on antibody microarray slides to this date. In the present study, microarray slides were preserved at - 20 Â°C after regular microarray experiments and were <b>rescanned</b> at day 10, 20 and 30 to evaluate change in signal intensity. Results Fluorescent intensities of microarray spots were detected using a confocal laser scanner after the experiment at day 0, and re-examined at day 10, 20 and 30, respectively. Fluorescent intensities of <b>rescanned</b> microarray spots did not show significant changes when compared with those scanned immediately after standard microarray experiments. Conclusion Microarray slides can be preserved and <b>rescanned</b> multiple times using a confocal laser scanner {{over a period of}} days or weeks. </p...|$|R
