This new phase {{will be based on}} both an increased presence of personnel from these Laboratories at the JET site and on Remote Participation. In contrast to High Energy Physics the operation of a large device as a 'community' effort is new to the fusion research field. Remote Participation will include: remote data access, <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments,</b> remote preparation of experimental sessions, remote access to JET office computing services and remote participation in meetings.

To demonstrate these techniques, an Intel-Play QX 3 microscope has been "grid-enabled" using a combination of software to control the microscope imaging, and sample handling hardware built from LEGO Mindstorms. The whole system is controlled remotely by passing messages using an IBM WebSphere Message Broker. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Non-intrusive <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> {{data centre}} {{services}} should be {{such that it}} does not require (or minimal) modification of legacy code and standard practices. Also, allowing third party agent to sit on every server in a data centre is a risk from security perspective. Hence, use of standard such as SNMPv 3 is advocated in this kind of environment. There are many tools (open source or commercial) available which uses SNMP; but we observe that most of the tools do not have an essential feature for auto-discovery of network. In this paper we present an algorithm for <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> services in a data centre. The algorithm has two stages: 1) auto discovery of network topology and 2) data collection from remote machine. Further, we compare SNMP with WBEM and identify some other options for <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> services and their advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
