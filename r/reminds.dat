40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2007. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 45). This is not always possible {{for a person to}} remember all things or events by himself or herself, he or she needs to be <b>reminded.</b> To <b>remind</b> or not to forget to do things at right time on the right place is called Reminder Service. It could be <b>reminded</b> by one’s own self, someone else or have sort of technological intervention or gadgets to <b>remind.</b> Manually people <b>remind</b> by calendar or it could be <b>reminded</b> by reminder card, to do list, cheat sheet etc. But now-a-days reminder could be done by technologically by computer, e-mail from websites or by PDA and most of all by cell-phone. Cell-phone has great potential for reminder purpose because of wide availability. But the cell phone’s built in reminder system requires user to be smart enough to activate and deactivate the service when never appropriate. An easy alternative solution could be SMS based reminder. To <b>remind</b> someone’s birthday, anniversary, holiday, parties, deadlines etc are the most common purposes for Reminder Service. The objective of my thesis is to explore the perception of potential users about such SMS based reminder service and evaluation of effectiveness of demo based reminder service. Md. Rajib HasanB.
