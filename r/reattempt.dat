On 22 October, mortars were placed and the bombardment began, which continued for four days and caused five fires in the fort at Viborg. After the bombardment, Russian forces retreated to Saint Petersburg after commanders realized that a siege could not be carried out without naval support and larger cannon. Also, autumn was not considered a suitable time for siege operations. The idea to <b>reattempt</b> a capture of Viborg was first proposed by Peter the Great in 1708, but rejected by the military due to the recent Swedish offensive.|$|E

Objective: To determine {{incidence and}} risk factors of suicide <b>reattempts</b> within 1 year after psychiatric hospital discharge in mood disorder patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by reviewing medical charts at Suanprung Psychiatric Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Mood disorder patients, diagnosed with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 th Revision codes F 31. x, F 32. x, and F 33. x, who were admitted owing to suicide attempts between October 2006 and May 2009 were eligible. The influence of sociodemographic and clinical risk factors on suicide <b>reattempts</b> was investigated using Cox&# 39;s proportional-hazards regression analysis. Results: Of 235 eligible mood disorder patients, 36 (15. 3 %) <b>reattempted</b> suicide (median 109. 5 days, range 1 &ndash; 322), seven (3. 0 %) completed suicide (median 90 days, range 5 &ndash; 185), and 192 (84. 2 %) neither <b>reattempted</b> nor completed suicide during follow-up. Of all nonfatal suicide <b>reattempts,</b> 14 patients (38. 9 %) did so within 90 days. Among suicide completers, one (14. 3 %) did so 5 days after discharge, and four (57. 1 %) did so within 90 days. The following three risk factors explained 73. 3 % of the probability of suicide reattempts: over two previous suicide attempts before the index admission (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2. 48; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 07 &ndash; 5. 76), being concomitantly prescribed typical and atypical antipsychotics (adjusted HR 4. 79; 95 % CI 1. 39 &ndash; 16. 52) and antidepressants, and taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor alone (adjusted HR 5. 08; 95 % CI 1. 14 &ndash; 22. 75) or concomitantly with norepinephrine and/or serotonin reuptake inhibitors (adjusted HR 6. 18; 95 % CI 1. 13 &ndash; 33. 65). Conclusion: Approximately 40 % of suicide <b>reattempts</b> in mood disorder patients occurred within 90 days after psychiatric hospital discharge. For mood disorders and when there have been over two previous suicide attempts, prescribed antipsychotics or antidepressants may help predict suicide <b>reattempts.</b> Keywords: bipolar disorders, major depressive disorders, suicide attempts, suicide completion...|$|R

Reviewers complained that the Spectrum game controls were difficult to decipher. The Ars Technica reviewer thought that the compilation did a poor job of explaining each game's controls, and wondered why Rare did not include introductory or how-to videos. Instead, he turned to YouTube videos and external FAQs before playing each game. Eurogamer and Ars Technica disagreed on the virtues of having the Spectrum emulator replicate the graphical glitches of the original console. Jaz Rignall of USgamer appreciated the added option to save game progress at any time for the Spectrum classics, and wrote that the collection will remind players how difficult games used to be.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} architecture {{also features}} specific measures at the decoder {{to reduce the}} suffered distortion due to any SW coded information that fails to decode properly. For this purpose, the principles of successive SI refinement[33] are adopted.

Given the improved SI at every refinement level, SW decoding is <b>reattempted</b> for all SW coded information that failed to decode at previous levels, when only a poorer version of the SI was available. The proposed decoding process thereby merges SI refinement, SW decoding and <b>reattempts</b> at SW decoding of any SW coded information that failed to decode at previous refinement levels. In contrast, the approach in[23] first decodes an entire WZ frame, after which additional SI updates create new opportunities to attempt decoding bit-planes that failed to SW decode successfully.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the effects over one year of contacting patients by telephone one month or three months after being discharged from an emergency department for deliberate self poisoning compared with usual treatment. DESIGN: Multicentre, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 13 emergency departments {{in the north of}} France. PARTICIPANTS: 605 people discharged from an emergency department after attempted suicide by deliberate self poisoning. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of contacting patients by telephone at one month or three months after discharge from an emergency department for attempted suicide to evaluate the success of recommended treatment or to adjust treatment. Control patients received treatment as usual, in most cases referral back to their general practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were proportion of participants who <b>reattempted</b> suicide, number of deaths by suicide, and losses to follow-up at 13 months' follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were types and number of contacts with health care. RESULTS: On an intention to treat basis, the three groups did not differ significantly for further suicide attempts, deaths by suicide, or losses to follow-up: contact at one month (intervention 23 % (34 / 147) v controls 30 % (93 / 312), difference 7 %, 95 % confidence interval - 2 % to 15 %), three months (25 % (36 / 146) v 30 %, difference 5 %, - 4 % to 14 %). Participants contacted at one month were less likely at follow-up to report having <b>reattempted</b> suicide (12 % v 22 % in control group, difference 10 %, 2 % to 18 %). CONCLUSION: Contacting people by telephone one month after being discharged from an emergency department for deliberate self poisoning may help reduce the number of <b>reattempted</b> suicides over one year...|$|R
