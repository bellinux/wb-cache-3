50|$|During {{his time}} in the navy it had often seemed obvious to Lumley that a new way needed to be found to attach a hose to a pipe. On leaving the Navy he spent much time with a friend who had a lathe in his garage, making things, and in {{particular}} looking for a simple and effective solution to the problem. Once he had the first clips made he went to London every day attempting to sell them. His wife Emily had such faith in her husband that she suggested <b>re-mortgaging</b> their house to pay for the first lot of steel, but this was never necessary, because the company took off.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{advantage}} to an IVA over bankruptcy is the control the debtor may have over their home. In bankruptcy, the debtor's assets will vest in the Trustee (some assets are excluded, notably those used as tools of trade, ordinary household contents). This will usually include equity in their {{property and the}} trustee may force its sale. An IVA proposal may exclude the property altogether, or propose a <b>re-mortgage</b> or offer income based contributions {{for a longer period}} in lieu of the debtor's equitable interest in the property. The supervisor may register a restriction on the property to ensure that his or her consent is required before the property is, for example, sold or <b>re-mortgaged.</b>|$|R

[...] He appealed this decision, making him the first MP to do so, and argued {{that he was being}} penalised for using his own money instead of claiming a greater amount from the taxpayer. [...] His appeal was successful, with Sir Paul Kennedy accepting that the arrangement cost the taxpayer less than the alternative options and saying that Browne had acted [...] "openly and honestly, and for the very purpose for which ACA was established".

Poirot explains his concern to Nick. Poirot suspects someone in Nick's inner circle. Nick's nearest living relative is a lawyer cousin, Charles Vyse, who arranged the <b>re-mortgaging</b> on End House for her to supply desperately needed funds. Her housekeeper is Ellen, and the lodge near End House is leased by Australians Mr and Mrs Croft. George Challenger has a soft spot for Nick. Nick's two closest friends are Freddie Rice, an abused wife, and Jim Lazarus, an art dealer in love with Freddie. When Nick had surgery six months earlier, the Crofts suggested she make a will.|$|E
5000|$|By 1893, the Hall {{had been}} heavily mortgaged, and legal action {{taken by the}} main lender {{resulted}} in its further sale and <b>re-mortgaging</b> in October 1901. With {{the end of the}} Council in 1909, the City of Sydney took over the Town Hall, settling its outstanding debts. In March 1909 it was reported to the finance committee of the Sydney City Council that the Town Hall was in a poor state, and that money needed to be put forward for its repair, which was done, and the Hall continued its use as a community meeting place. However, by 1917 the City Council eventually resolved to demolish the old Town Hall [...] "to make way for the construction of two shops and a bank". Its demolition was reported with great interest when the time capsule was uncovered from the foundation stone with several monetary items missing.|$|E

5000|$|Together {{with his}} MP wife Ann Keen, the couple used their {{combined}} second homes allowances {{to buy an}} apartment in an up-market development at Waterloo on the South Bank of the River Thames, claiming £175,000 over five years. The Waterloo apartment is nine miles from their constituency home in Brentford, a 30-minute drive from Westminster. MPs who reside near the Keens in Brentford, such as Home Office Minister Phil Woolas {{who lives in the}} next street, are able to commute from there to Westminster. The couple claimed for both the interest payments on the Waterloo flat and the cost of <b>re-mortgaging</b> their Brentford home. The Fees Office agreed with the couple's argument that this was claimable because it was used to raise equity for the flat. The mortgage also included the cost of [...] "compulsory" [...] life insurance attached to the mortgages, a practice which is now banned.

5000|$|Guetta {{accepts the}} assignment, {{adopting}} the name [...] "Mr. Brainwash", putting up street {{art in the}} city and six months later, <b>re-mortgaging</b> his business to afford renting copious equipment and a complete production team to create pieces of art under his supervision. He rents a former CBS studio to prepare his first show, [...] "Life Is Beautiful", and scales up his production to something much larger than Banksy suggested, but with little focus. When Guetta breaks his foot after falling off a ladder, Banksy realises that the show may become a trainwreck, and sends a few professionals to help Guetta out. While the producers take care of the practical side of the show, Guetta spends his time on more publicity, asking support from both Fairey and Banksy, eventually taping up huge billboards with their quotes, and ultimately ending up on the cover of L. A. Weekly. Preparation is seriously behind schedule, and Guetta's production team insists that he must make decisions - yet Guetta spends his time hyping up and marketing his work {{for tens of thousands of}} dollars. Eight hours before the opening, paintings are still missing from the walls, and since Guetta is busy giving interviews, the eventual layout of the show is decided by the crew itself.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse {{security}} aspects on home ownership in a European perspective. The conventional view is that homeowners' security is achieved through equity formation in their homes. This opens up possibilities to withdraw equity in order to supplement a faulting social support system, to retire early or, in general, to increase consumption. This can be achieved through <b>re-mortgaging</b> or by moving and scaling down. These opportunities are predominant in all parts of Europe, and have been proliferated through the recent price boom. Research demonstrates that equity release in any form seldom happens. Instead, security through home ownership seems to be mitigated through low housing expenditures in older age, as a result of debt repayments at an earlier age. This life cycle pattern of housing expenditures may change in the future with more debts and a lower inflation rate. The housing security aspect creates differences across tenure forms and has wider distributional effects, due to differences in household composition in different countries and due to the size of the owner-occupied sector. Equity release, housing expenditure, homeowner security, elderly household, European market,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} factors driving US {{household}} borrowing up to 2007. Two popular explanations are tested: First, the expenditure cascades hypothesis {{based on the}} assumption of debt-financed expenditures driven by an increasingly polarised distribution of income (‘keeping up with the Joneses’) and second, the hypothesis of Minskyian households which identifies climbing real estate prices as the decisive factor in household debt accumulation (<b>re-mortgaging</b> in order to cash in on capital gains and rising loan-to-value ratios in property purchases). This paper develops a method for obtaining individual household borrowing figures despite the lack of a panel structure from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF); it is the first to use the high quality information the SCF provides to investigate the impact of shifts in the income distribution and asset prices on household borrowing. The findings indicate that it is the interaction between the concentration of income {{at the top of the}} distribution and rising real estate prices which explains a large fraction of the increase in household borrowing prior to 2008. Therefore, neither the expenditure cascades hypothesis nor the hypothesis of Minskyian households are, in isolation, sufficient in order to understand household debt accumulation and thus the paper calls for a synthesis: future research should analyse the role of the distribution of income and asset prices together rather than separately...|$|E
50|$|The {{competition}} was {{run on a}} shoestring. Russian players sold souvenirs before and during matches to raise funds to cover their expenses, while four England administrators <b>re-mortgaged</b> their houses to cover the expenses of attending the competition.

We use inheritances and unanticipated movements in house prices as instruments for shocks to liquidity. Results indicate that inheritances are a poor instrument for liquidity constraints because both past and future inheritances predict entry to self-employment.

The adviser should inform the debtor of all the solutions available, commonly including dealing with priority debts first, <b>re-mortgage,</b> consolidating debts into a loan, debt management, bankruptcy, a Debt Relief Order, and IVA. The adviser should look at all the debtor's circumstances, what they own, what they owe, and their household income & expenditure to advise the best solution.
