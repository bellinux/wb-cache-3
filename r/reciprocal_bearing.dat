60|$|I {{have been}} often asked to {{republish}} {{the first book}} of mine which the public noticed, and which, hitherto, remains their favourite, in a more easily attainable form than that of its existing editions. I am, however, resolved never to republish the book as a whole; some parts of it being, by the established fame of Turner, rendered unnecessary; and others having been always useless, in their praise of excellence which the public will never give the labour necessary to discern. But, finding lately {{that one of my}} dearest friends, who, in advanced age, retains the cheerfulness and easily delighted temper of bright youth, had written out, for her own pleasure, a large number of passages from 'Modern Painters,' it seemed to me certain that what such a person felt to be useful to herself, could not but be useful also to a class of readers whom I much desired to please, and who would sometimes enjoy, in my early writings, what I never should myself have offered them. I asked my friend, therefore, to add to her own already chosen series, any other passages she thought likely to be of permanent interest to general readers; and I have printed her selections in absolute submission to her judgment, merely arranging the pieces she sent me in the order which seemed most convenient for the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>bearing</b> of their fragmentary meanings, and adding here and there an explanatory note; or, it may be, a deprecatory one, in cases where my mind had changed. That she did me the grace to write every word with her own hands, adds, in my eyes, and will, I trust, in the readers' also, to the possible claims of the little book on their sympathy; and although I hope to publish some of the scientific and technical portions of the original volumes in my own large editions, the selections here made by my friend under her quiet woods at Coniston--the Unter-Walden of England--will, I doubt not, bring within better reach of many readers, for whom I am not now able myself to judge or choose, such service as the book was ever capable of rendering, in the illustration of the powers of nature, and intercession for her now too often despised and broken peace.|$|E
5000|$|The marine hand compass, or hand-bearing compass {{as it is}} termed in {{nautical}} use, {{has been}} used by small-boat or inshore sailors since at least the 1920s to keep a running course or to record precise bearings to landmarks on shore in order to determine position via the resection technique. [...] Instead of a magnetized needle or disc, most hand bearing compasses feature liquid damping with a floating card design (a magnetized, degreed float or dial atop a jeweled pivot bearing). [...] Equipped with a viewing prism, the hand bearing compass allows instant reading of forward bearings from the user to an object or vessel, and some provide the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>bearing</b> as well. [...] Modern examples of marine hand bearing compasses include the Suunto KB-14 and KB-77, and the Plastimo Iris 50. [...] These compasses frequently have battery-illuminated or photoluminescent degree dials for use in low light or darkness.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, {{the actual}} plane - Lady Be Good - {{failed to find}} its airbase near the African coast after a bombing raid on Naples. Instead the crew mistakenly flew on {{hundreds}} of miles into the desert. This was because the plane's navigation system could not distinguish between a direct or <b>reciprocal</b> <b>bearing</b> contact. The same radio bearing would be returned whether the bomber was inbound or outbound from its base. Eventually as the B-24's fuel ran out, the nine-man crew bailed out into the Libyan desert. The eight survivors tried to walk to safety; their remains were eventually found in 1960 some 80 to 100 {{miles north of the}} wreckage site. The aircraft broke into two pieces upon impact. When it was found in 1958 by an oil surveying team, the bomber remains were well-preserved with edible food and water still on board. Its machine guns and radio were also still in working order.|$|E

25|$|Such {{detection}} {{would not}} have helped the Americans track the Japanese fleet. A radio direction finder (DF or RDF) from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous <b>reciprocal</b> <b>bearings.)</b> To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target. If the target was moving, the detections must be close {{to one another in}} time. To plot the task force's course with certainty, at least four such detections must have been made in proper time-pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means. This complex set of requirements did not occur; if the Kido Butai was detected, it was not tracked.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1967, successors of M-40 {{have been}} offered as KB line, which {{consists}} of high-quality hand-bearing surveying compasses and inclinometers that are accurate to fractions of a degree. Traditionally made of a solid block of machined aluminum, each KB compass contains a magnetized dial with calibration markings printed along its outer edge. A magnifying lens (KB-14) or prismatic sight (KB-77) is mounted {{at one end of}} the instrument with a crosshair providing a view of the disc, containing both forward and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>bearings.</b> In operation, the user divides his or her field of vision with the instrument, using the device's lens or prism to precisely measure the bearing of the object in view. [...] Suunto has since discontinued production of the KB-77. A newer model, the KB-20, utilizes a housing composed of high-impact plastic to allow the compass to float if dropped into water.|$|R
50|$|On 25 November 1941 Upholder {{left for}} her eighteenth patrol. Wanklyn {{positioned}} the submarine south {{east of the}} Messina straits. At 07:30 on the 27 November they sighted a large tanker with destroyers for escort. Wanklyn fired a full salvo at 2,800 yards but underestimated the enemy's speed. This convoy was later intercepted, and the tanker sunk, by Force K. On 29 November Upholder sailed into {{the midst of an}} Italian naval squadron on a night exercise. The enemy fleet consisted of three cruisers and five destroyers. With the closest vessel only 3,000 yards away Wanklyn continued to calculate the bearing and speed of the enemy, until eventually he ordered the boat to dive. He could not see anything through the periscope in the winter night. By using dead-reckoning, he fired off a salvo at the last ship using his asdic. The target disappeared on a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>bearing</b> and then reappeared right over the top of Upholder. Wanklyn docked at Malta on the morning of 21 December 1941.|$|E
5000|$|At 07:10, Kufra finally {{heard from}} the Blenheims, when {{aircraft}} Z7610 requested a bearing, and Kufra requested that it transmit dashes so that the direction-finding station could establish its bearing; the aircraft did not respond. At 07:27, Major de Wets Blenheim, Z7513, requested a course {{for a return to}} Kufra, but its radio operator ceased broadcasting before the direction-finding station could determine its bearing; after taking a snap bearing, Kufra radioed 120-3=0527, meaning that the aircraft should [...] "steer 120° (zero wind) third-class fix, time 05h27 GMT," [...] but the aircraft appears only to have heard the numbers 3-0-5 and as a result believed the course to base was 305°. The aircraft turned to this course at 07:42, and Allied infantrymen at Taizerbo heard them fly past to the west; at 08:10 they turned 180° to fly on the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>bearing,</b> 125°. After T2252s starboard engine began to malfunction around 09:00 hours, Major de Wet ordered the aircraft to land in the desert, which they did successfully at 09:15.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} controlling a formation of quadrotor UAVs equipped with onboard cameras able to measure relative bearings in their local body frames w. r. t. neighboring UAVs. The control goal is twofold: (i) steering the agent group towards a formation {{defined in terms of}} desired bearings, and (ii) actuating the group motions in the 'null-space' of the current bearing formation. The proposed control strategy relies on an extension of the rigidity theory to the case of directed bearing frameworks in R^ 3 × S^ 1. This extension allows to devise a decentralized bearing controller which, unlike most of the present literature, does not need presence of a common reference frame or of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>bearing</b> measurements for the agents. Simulation and experimental results are then presented for illustrating and validating the approach...|$|E
40|$|Cloned genes {{have been}} {{purified}} from recombinant DNA bacteriophage libraries by a method exploiting homologous reciprocal recombination in vivo. In this method 'probe' sequences are inserted {{in a very}} small plasmid vector and introduced into recombination-proficient bacterial cells. Genomic bacteriophage libraries are propagated on the cells, and phage bearing sequences homologous to the probe acquire an integrated copy of the plasmid by <b>reciprocal</b> recombination. Phage <b>bearing</b> integrated plasmids can be purified from the larger pool of phage lacking plasmid integrates by growth under the appropriate selective conditions...|$|R
40|$|Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour {{suppressor}} in renal {{cell carcinoma}} (RCC) leads to failure of proteolytic regulation of the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), constitutive upregulation of the HIF complex, and overexpression of HIF target genes. However, recent {{studies have indicated that}} in this setting, upregulation of the closely related HIF-alpha isoforms, HIF- 1 alpha and HIF- 2 alpha, have contrasting effects on tumour growth, and activate distinct sets of target genes. To pursue these findings, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying target gene selectivity for HIF- 1 alpha and HIF- 2 alpha. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation to probe binding to hypoxia response elements in vivo, and expression of chimaeric molecules <b>bearing</b> <b>reciprocal</b> domain exchanges between HIF- 1 alpha and HIF- 2 alpha molecules, we show that selective activation of HIF-alpha target gene expression is not dependent on selective DNA-binding at the target locus, but depends on non-equivalent C-terminal portions of these molecules. Our data indicate that post-DNA binding mechanisms that are dissimilar for HIF- 1 alpha and HIF- 2 alpha determine target gene selectivity in RCC cells...|$|R
