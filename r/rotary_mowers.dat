40|$|Battery-powered {{autonomous}} mowers {{are designed}} to reduce the need of labor for lawn mowing compared with traditional endothermic engine mowers {{and at the same}} time to abate local emissions and noise. The aim of this research was to compare autonomous <b>mower</b> with traditional <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> on a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) lawn under different nitrogen (N) rates. A two-way factor experimental design with three replications was adopted. In the study, fourNrates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kghaL 1) and two mowing systems (autonomous mower vs. gasolinepowered walk-behind <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> equipped for mulching) were used. As expected, N fertilization increased turf quality. At the end of the trial, the autonomous mower increased turf density (3. 2 shoots/cm 2) compared with the <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> (2. 1 shoots/cm 2) and decreased average leaf width (2. 1 mm) compared with the <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> (2. 7 mm). Increased density and decreased leaf width with autonomous mowing yielded higher quality turf (7. 3) compared with the <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> (6. 4) and a lower weed incidence (6...|$|R

50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> is {{a unit of}} powered {{machinery}} that uses a rotating blade or blades to cut vegetation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> with {{internal}} combustion engines come in three price ranges. Low priced mowers use older technology, smaller motors, and lighter steel decks. These mowers are targeted at the residential market and typically price {{is the most}} important selling point.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> {{were not}} {{developed}} until engines were small enough and {{powerful enough to}} run the blades at sufficient speed. Many people experimented with rotary blade mowers in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and Power Specialties Ltd. introduced a gasoline-powered rotary mower. Kut Kwick replaced the saw blade of the [...] "Pulp Saw" [...] with a double-edged blade and a cutter deck, converting the [...] "Pulp Saw" [...] into the first ever out-front rotary mower.|$|E
50|$|Mulching mowersSpecial {{mulching}} blades {{are available}} for <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers.</b> The blade is designed to keep the clippings circulating underneath the mower until the clippings are chopped quite small. Other designs have twin blades to mulch the clippings to small pieces. This function has the advantages of forgoing the additional work collecting and disposing grass clippings while reducing lawn waste {{in such a way}} that also creates convenient compost for the lawn, forgoing the expense and adverse environmental effect of fertilizer.|$|E

50|$|In {{agriculture}} a <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> {{takes the}} form of a piece of tractor machinery that is often pulled behind the tractor and powered by the Power take-off; it uses thick blades of sharpened metal to cut thick grass, heavy bushes, weeds, and small trees. Due to the high torque and power associated with the implement, shields made of hanging heavy chain or thick vinyl or rubber are often provided around the discharge chute to control flying debris. French agricultural machinery manufacturer Rousseau SA claims to have invented the mechanical <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> in 1962.|$|R
50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> {{that applies}} {{chemical}} while cutting was patented by Tom Burch of Boone, N.C {{and was later}} sold to Diamond Mowers Inc. of Sioux Falls, SD under the name Wet Bladehttps://web.archive.org/web/20080715053746/http://www.diamondmowers.com/Products/WetBlade.cfm.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>mowers,</b> {{also called}} drum mowers, have a rapidly {{rotating}} bar, or disks {{mounted on a}} bar, with sharpened edges that cut the crop. When these mowers are tractor-mounted they are easily capable of mowing grass at up to 20 miles per hour (32 km/h) in good conditions. Some models {{are designed to be}} mounted in double and triple sets on a tractor, one in the front and one at each side, thus able to cut up to 20 foot (6 metre) swaths.|$|E
50|$|Two main {{styles of}} blades {{are used in}} lawn mowers. Lawn mowers {{employing}} a single blade that rotates about a single vertical axis are known as <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers,</b> while those employing a cutting bar and multiple blade assembly that rotates about a single horizontal axis are known as cylinder or reel mowers (although in some versions, the cutting bar is the only blade, and the rotating assembly consists of flat metal pieces which force the blades of grass against the sharp cutting bar).|$|E
50|$|One {{company that}} {{produced}} <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> commercially was the Australian Victa company, starting in 1952. Its mowers were lighter {{and easier to}} use than similar ones that had come before. The first Victa mowers were made at Mortlake, an inner suburb of Sydney, by local resident Mervyn Victor Richardson. He made his first model out of scrap in his garage. The first Victa mowers were manufactured, going on sale on 20 September 1952. The new company, Victa Mowers Pty Ltd, was incorporated on 13 February 1953.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>rotary</b> lawn <b>mower</b> accident statistics showed that measures must be undertaken {{to reduce or}} to guard against the hazards of operating these machines. A cantilever rod blade guard was designed, built, developed, and tested. The <b>rotary</b> <b>mower,</b> when equipped with a blade guard, mowed the lawn satisfactorily and yet, when encountering a test object (a dressed chicken), passed over it without inflicting injury to the test object...|$|R

5000|$|Mower blade — a <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> {{generally}} has one blade that rotates horizontally. The blade features edges that slightly curved up {{to generate a}} continuous air flow as the blade rotates, thus creating a sucking and tearing action.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{developer of}} the rollermower is uncertain, but Howard Rotavator Pty Ltd manufactured {{and sold the}} 72RLM (later the HS20RLM/180) Rollamowa in Australia from the early 1970s. These were linkage-mounted three-spindled <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> with a cutting width of 1.8m (72”). A larger version (HS20RLM/300) was also produced before manufacturing ceased in about 1984. The company was absorbed by Howard Australia Pty Ltd and from 1985 sourced its rollermowers from Trimax Industries Ltd (later Trimax Mowing Systems) in New Zealand. Trimax then sold the same machines under the Trimax brand around the world.|$|E
50|$|A roller mower, or rollermower, is a tractor-powered multi-spindled <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> {{that have}} full width rollers front and rear. Most rollermowers attach to a four-wheeled tractor via the three-point linkage and are {{powered by the}} tractor’s power {{take-off}} (PTO), though larger models connect three or more complete mowing decks to a separate chassis that is towed behind the tractor. Good rollermowers can produce a finish rivalling that of reel (cylinder) mowers while generally being far more robust and requiring considerably less maintenance. Modern machines can also cope efficiently with {{a wider range of}} grass lengths and densities than cylinder mowers.|$|E
5000|$|Elec-trak branded {{attachments}} included electric trimmers, edgers, chainsaws, radios, arc welders, fork lifts, front-end loaders, rotary brooms, roller aerators, lawn rollers, dump carts, large vacuums, agricultural sprayers, moldboard plows, {{row crop}} cultivators, tillers, disk harrows, sickle bar mowers, belly mowers, front-mounted <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers,</b> front or rear-mounted ganged reel mowers, lawn sweepers, electric rakes, snowblowers, snowplows, golf bag holders, double seats, 120vac rotary inverters, canopy tops, and more. [...] Most of these attachments were {{connected by a}} 36VDC [...] "power take off" [...] using a NEMA 10-50 outlet, usually used in the U.S. for 240VAC clothes dryers and thus compatible with readily available cords {{in most of the}} USA.|$|E
50|$|In {{horticulture}} a <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> {{is usually}} an integral machine that is either pushed by hand or {{driven by a}} riding operator, and used to cut amenity and sports turf. The first successful such machine was developed in Australia in 1952 by the Victa company.|$|R
5000|$|The Roths Country Boy was {{introduced}} sometime around 1954-1955. It is unknown {{how many of}} these units were manufactured.

50|$|A {{brushcutter}} (also {{called a}} brushsaw or clearing saw) is a powered garden or agricultural tool used to trim weeds, small trees, and other foliage not accessible by a lawn <b>mower</b> or <b>rotary</b> <b>mower.</b> Various blades or trimmer heads can {{be attached to}} the machine for specific applications.|$|R
50|$|A {{rotary mower}} rotates about a {{vertical}} axis with the blade spinning {{at high speed}} relying on impact to cut the grass. This tends {{to result in a}} rougher cut and bruises and shreds the grass leaf resulting in discolouration of the leaf ends as the shredded portion dies. This is particularly prevalent if the blades become clogged or blunt. Most <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> need to be set a little higher than cylinder equivalents to avoid scalping and gouging of slightly uneven lawns, although some modern rotaries are fitted with a rear roller to provide a more formal striped cut. These machines will also tend to cut lower (13 mm) than a standard four-wheeled rotary.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> {{can throw}} out debris with extreme {{velocity}} and energy. Additionally, the blades of a self-powered push mower (gasoline or electric) can injure a careless or inattentive user; as such, many come {{equipped with a}} dead man's switch to immediately disable the blade rotation when the user is no longer holding the handle. In the United States, over 12,000 people per year are hospitalized {{as a result of}} lawn mower accidents. The vast majority of these injuries can be prevented by wearing protective footwear when mowing. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children be at least 12 years old before they are allowed to use a walk-behind lawn mower and at least 16 years of age before using a riding mower. They also should demonstrate proper judgment and maturity. Persons using a mower should wear heavy footwear, eye protection, and hearing protection in the case of engine-powered mowers.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} transmissions, {{often called}} gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, {{an increase in}} speed), sometimes {{in conjunction with a}} right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in helicopters, see picture). These are often used on PTO-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers),</b> or horizontally extending {{from one side of the}} implement to another (as with manure spreaders, flail mowers, and forage wagons). More complex equipment, such as silage choppers and snowblowers, have drives with outputs in more than one direction.The gearbox in a wind turbine converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the electrical generator. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For aerodynamic and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand rpm.) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft. Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.|$|E

25|$|Montgomery {{held the}} first patent on a <b>rotary</b> blade <b>mower.</b> In the late 1940s and early 1950s, mowers were {{equipped}} with a rotating reel assembly that was either pushed by hand or was propelled by a small gasoline engine. This kind of mower worked well in short grass, but it clogged up in tall grass. Montgomery did not invent this mower, but he obtained the patent from a frustrated inventor in Chicago, Illinois. The first commercially produced <b>rotary</b> <b>mower,</b> the Yazoo Master Mower, was then produced by a small manufacturing plant in Jackson, Mississippi. Montgomery was the Louisiana distributor of Yazoo until 1981, when he closed his lawnmower business in Ruston.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of forage production machinery system is partially reflected in someclassical economical indices, because the real {{efficiency of}} mechanical tillageutilization at forage harvesting and preparation must {{be reflected in}} the foragequality increasing and feed superior valorization by the farm livestock.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation thesis deals with <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers,</b> specifically {{with the issue}} of mulching. In the theoretical part the reader is being familiar with the technology of mulching and its importance. Further, the individual types of mulchers and its advantages and disadvantages are described. The literary analysis of energy demands of <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> is stated. Further, the parameters influencing energy demands of the mulcher are also analyzed. The results of measurement of the energy demands of the mulcher with vertical axis of rotation are presented. The dependency of input power, specific energy consumption and fuel consumption on mass performance of the machine are created. Furthermore, the energy demands was determined, while mulcher was working continuously at the permanent grassland. The energy losses of the mulcher were also analyzed. The effect of modification of operational and constructional parameters on the energy demands and quality of work of the mulcher wit vertical axis of rotation is studied. From the constructional parameters the shape of working tool, especially cloth angle and rake angle of the tool, and shape of the cover of the mulcher workspace is modified. From the operational parameters the cutting speed and mass performance according to conditions is modified...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar o manejo do solo na entrelinha da seringueira de forma mecânica com grade e roçadora e com cultura de cobertura sobre as propriedades físicas do solo. Para isto, implantou-se a seringueira (PB 235 e RRIM 701) em Latossolo Vermelho em Jaboticabal-SP, em 1992, de forma que a área da entrelinha da cultura foi manejada com gradagem, roçadora e cultura de cobertura kudzu-tropical (Pueraria phaseoloides). Após 8 anos de cultivo, foram analisados alguns atributos físicos do solo (densidade, macro, micro e porosidade total, granulometria e argila dispersa em água), na entrelinha da cultura. O manejo mecânico e o de culturas de cobertura na entrelinha da seringueira afetaram as propriedades físicas do solo, especialmente a porosidade e a densidade, entretanto não influenciaram significativamente a granulometria do solo. As maiores alterações físicas em função do manejo da entrelinha da seringueira manifestaram-se especialmente na camada {{superficial}} do solo (0 - 20 cm). O manejo com roçadora reduziu significativamente a porosidade do solo (0, 08 - 0, 04 m³/m³) e aumentou a sua densidade (1, 4 - 1, 5 kg/dm³), ao passo que o manejo com grade não degradou as propriedades físicas do solo, comparado com roçadora e a cultura de cobertura com kudzu tropical. This work {{aimed to}} mechanically evaluate {{the effect of}} soil management between rubber tree rows using heavy bars and <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> and cover crop on the physical properties of the soil. Thus, rubber trees (PB 235 and RRIM 701) were established in a Dystrophic Hapludox soil in Jaboticabal-SP in 1992, so that the spaces between the rows were managed with heavy bars, <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> and tropical Kudzu crop cover (Pueraria phaseoloides). After eight cropping years, some physical attributes of the soil (density, macro and microporosity, particle size and water clay dispersion) were analyzed in the rows. The mechanical and cover crop management {{in the space between}} the rows had affected the physical properties of the soil, especially porosity and density although not influencing significantly soil particle size. The greatest physical alterations in the soil in function of the management of the space between the rubber tree rows became evident only in the superficial layer of the soil (0 - 20 cm). Rotary mower management significantly reduced soil porosity (0. 08 - 0. 04 m³/m³) and increased soil density (1. 4 - 1. 5 kg/dm³) while management with heavy bars did not degrade the physical properties of the soil compared with the <b>rotary</b> <b>mowers</b> and crop cover using tropical Kudzu...|$|E
40|$|O manejo das entrelinhas dos pomares de citros tem sofrido grandes alterações nos últimos anos. Dessa forma, este trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar influência da adubação verde de inverno e o uso de roçadoras laterais, na produção da laranjeira-'Pera'[Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck]. O ensaio foi conduzido em duas safras (2007 / 2008 e 2008 / 2009), em esquema de parcela subdividida, onde, nas parcelas, semearam-se três espécies de inverno (aveia-preta, tremoço e nabo forrageiro) e nas subparcelas utilizaram-se dois tipos de roçadoras laterais (convencional e "ecológica"). Vegetação espontânea e herbicida (glyphosate) em área total foram tratamentos de referência. No mês de julho (2007 e 2008), quantificaram-se a massa verde e a seca das vegetações intercalares e da projeção da copa, após roçagem. Para o cálculo da produção da laranjeira-'Pera', colheram-se os frutos das diferentes parcelas, efetuando-se as pesagens e, posteriormente, obtendo-se a eficiência de produção. Os tratamentos com adubo verde proporcionaram maior produção de massa verde e seca, e a utilização da roçadora "ecológica" lançou quantidade de {{material}} vegetal significativamente superior sob a copa das plantas de laranjeira-'Pera'. Nas duas safras, maior produção e eficiência de produção de frutos foi observada nas parcelas com uso da roçadora "ecológica". Quanto aos adubos verdes de inverno, apenas o tremoço incrementou a eficiência de produção em 2009. Conclui-se que o uso de roçadora "ecológica" incrementa a produção de laranjeira-'Pera'. The inter-row {{management of}} citrus orchards has undergone {{major changes in}} recent years. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of winter cover crops and <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> in sweet orange 'Pêra' production. The experiment was conducted in two seasons (2007 / 2008 and 2008 / 2009), in a split plot design, where at the plots three species of winter cover crops (oat, lupine and radish) were sown in April and in sub-plots it was used two types of <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> (conventional and ecological). Natural vegetation (NV) and NV+herbicide (glyphosate) in the total area were the standard treatments of the experiment. In July (2007 and 2008) it was measured the mass of fresh and dry mass of each treatment and also after mowing. To calculate the production in August (2007 and 2008) the fruit were harvested and weighted and later it was obtained the efficiency of production. The treatments with winter cover crops showed greater production of fresh and dry mass {{and the use of}} ecological <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> released amount of plant material significantly higher under the canopy of sweet orange 'Pera' plants. In two seasons, higher production and efficiency of fruit production occurred in plots using the ecological <b>rotary</b> <b>mower.</b> Only lupines increased the efficiency of production of sweet orange 'Pêra' in 2009. Thus, it can be concluded that the use of ecological <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> increases the production of sweet orange 'Pera'...|$|R
