Offers a review of the issues raised in the literature on careers and the psychological contract and a case study of the impact of change on individual middle managers. Describes the empirical work carried out in British Telecom on which the article is based. Concludes that both the nature of middle management jobs and the career opportunities available have changed considerably, resulting in breaches of the psychological contract. However, individual managers have reacted differently to the changes, depending on their ability and willingness to pursue informal networks and personal contacts...|$|R

5000|$|Rawlinson has a {{background}} in banking and investment gained with Lazard and Flemings. After attending the University of Cambridge he spent {{a significant part of}} his career in South Africa which was followed by leadership of the Fleming Family & Partners business in London. He is an independent director of a number of companies and is a non-executive director of Parkmead Group PLC. As Executive Chairman of The Monarch Group from 2009 Rawlinson initiated a reorganisation and modernisation of this long established UK based travel group. Throughout his Chairmanship Rawlinson lead two successful turnarounds of the Group in 2010 and 2013 without <b>redundancy</b> <b>programmes</b> or cost to the public purse. He believed that the correct industry response to the competitive pressures experienced in European commercial aviation in 2014 [...] was consolidation of carriers, creating alliances which would result in efficiencies and the safeguarding of employment and pensions. Rawlinson built up and communicated a distinct investment case and track record for each of the Monarch Group’s three businesses in order to allow the underlying value of each to be demonstrated. In June 2014 however, it became apparent that the plan which Rawlinson had envisaged was failing, with Monarch requiring £60m to shore up its finances. After the current owners had declined to invest any more money, Rawlinson asked Dean Street Advisors for help. Rawlinson was pushed out of the business shortly after, and replaced by Andrew Swaffield. In the resulting restructure, Monarch made 700 redundancies, and staff faced large wage and pension cuts.|$|R
40|$|Redundancy, delayering, downsizing, {{and various}} other forms of {{organizational}} change have become increasingly prevalent. This article focuses {{on the impact of}} different forms of organizational change on managers' perceptions of the organizations they work within and the comparison between changes that involve redundancy and/or delayering and those that do not involve such changes. The literature has many accounts of the negative effects associated with redundancy and delayering, but are these effects unique to these types of change or are they a consequence of negative experiences of a range of organizational changes? Hypotheses were tested to assess, first, whether there are differences between different levels of management, notably between directors and nondirectors in the way they perceive organizational change, second, to assess how change has affected managers' perceptions of their organizations and their working lives, and third, to explore if different forms of change are associated with differences in managers' perceptions of their organizations “as a place to work”. Hypotheses were tested with data from a cross-sectional survey with 830 managers from the UK. Organizational changes include cost reduction and culture change programmes, delayering, mergers/demergers, outsourcing, <b>redundancy</b> <b>programmes,</b> and contract/ temporary workers. The analyses reported here indicate clearly that specific forms of change are associated with managers' reports of their experiences at work; some forms of change (notably redundancy and delayering) seem to have particularly damaging implications for managers' experiences in the workplace. The analyses also show that there is a difference in the way directors and nondirectors perceive the changes. Finally, the article considers strategies for ameliorating the effects of change including the role of HR...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the end of}} 2002, Schwartz was {{appointed}} Vice Chancellor of Brunel University in the United Kingdom: a university with 2,400 staff, 13,000 students and a yearly budget of £140+ million. Brunel had decided under Michael Sterling, the previous VC, to refocus its mission on research. To help achieve this goal, the university under Schwartz sought to hire new research active staff, and, to help fund this, {{to reduce the number}} of non-research active staff (43 eventually accepted voluntary redundancy). The <b>redundancy</b> <b>programme</b> was highly controversial and was fiercely resisted by staff unions who ran a highly personalised campaign against Schwartz. As a part of the repositioning of the university, the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences was closed and the staff that didn't leave were redeployed (and one accepted voluntary redundancy). Despite the depleted staff base, Geography was still deemed strong enough to be returned in the 2008 RAE when it received an average score of 2.15 out of a possible 5. [...] Schwartz's changes were supposed to produce increased research output and RAE ratings, bolstering the economic viability of the university. Brunel moved up the university league tables, (but has since fallen back), international income doubled, entry scores of students rose, the first venture capital trust for a university was established, and management was completely restructured. Similar to the experience at Murdoch, cutbacks led to staff action, including picketing and paid ads on Google.|$|E

' This quote from the Organisation's pre-budget submission of January 1989 was a clarion call to the Government on behalf of a depleted health service.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of its {{strategy}} for the reform of public companies in Africa, the World Bank became involved in redundancies of questionable legality. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, the Bank arranged and financed a voluntary severance programme in 2003, whereby 10, 000 employees of the mining company Gécamines, some 45 % of its workforce, left in return for an arbitrarily fixed lump-sum payment. Based on ethnographic research, this paper discusses {{the history of the}} protest movement which emerged from this mass <b>redundancy</b> <b>programme,</b> the arguments deployed by the movement and the resources available to it.

40|$|Recent reforms on {{state-owned}} enterprises {{have led to}} millions of workers retrenched. This paper presents two theoretical models, one to explain why firms have to lay-off workers, {{and the other to}} explain how redundancy can affect poverty. Both first-hand and official survey data are used to examine how redundancy has affected the living standards and poverty of urban households. It is estimated that about one-fifth of the current urban poverty has been caused by the <b>redundancy</b> <b>programme.</b> The survey results have a number of interesting findings, which have important policy implications. It is concluded that the pressure to lay-off workers was due to excessively high wages and the cessation of soft budget. The probability of a household falling into poverty depends not only on the probability that household members are retrenched, but also on the probability that retrenched workers can find alternative employment. Most affected households do not think the reform is wrong, but they are pessimistic about their future. The government is thought to be ineffective in helping retrenched workers, and poverty is to become a permanent feature of urban China, an ironic phenomenon that was unthinkable even before the economic reforms started in 1978.

40|$|Organisations in {{and around}} Britain {{continue}} to restructure and downsize their workforce. Redundancies and reorganisation of staff remains a major aspect of internal organisational change. However, the effects of redundancy on those who remain, the survivors, are still little understood (Armstrongstassen, 1993 a). This paper attempts to rectify this situation by reviewing theories principally developed in North America within a British context. In particular, the research identifies how organisational justice theories (e. g., Bies et al, 1988; Greenberg, 1990; McFarlin & Sweeney, 1992) are a means to understand the potential effects on survivors of redundancy. The literature review is supported by empirical research which has been conducted in two major British organisations who have experienced significant downsizing and restructuring. The research aim was to explore the range of reactions; emotional attitudinal and behavioural which were experienced by the survivors of a <b>redundancy</b> <b>programme.</b> Data was collected {{using a variety of}} methods, including focus groups, in-depth semi-structured interviews and a company wide survey in both case study organisations. The results enabled the development of a conceptual framework which extends previous understanding of the effects of redundancy on survivors. The conceptual framework draws together the current findings with previous research in this field formulating an overview of the factors which influence survivor reactions. Understanding survivor reactions helps to further the knowledge of the potentially damaging effects of redundancy on the future of an organisation. The results indicate that organisational justice theories indeed promote the understanding of the effects of redundancy. In previous studies the emphasis has been laid on distributive and procedural justice (e. g., Daly & Geyer, 1994; Brockner & Greenberg, 1990), however, the current study highlights the importance of interactional justice. The results suggest that survivors reactions are particularly dependent on the interpersonal treatment they receive from both the management team and their immediate line manager or supervisor. Further analysis shows that the communication and amount of interaction a survivor receives from their line manager influences their level of organisational commitment, job insecurity, job satisfaction and turnover intention. Survivors who perceived they had a 'good' relationship with their line manager were less likely to react negatively to the <b>redundancy</b> <b>programme.</b> The research also indicates that survivors were influenced by their work environment and their work colleagues. The analysis found that when survivors perceived their work colleagues to react negatively to the redundancies, {{they were more likely to}} react negatively themselves. In practical terms, when implementing redundancies, management should be aware of the potentially damaging effects not only on those who leave, but also on the survivors. The research indicates that the 'line manager' holds a very important role in maintaining the morale and motivation of the remaining staff. The ability to maintain good communication and support to employees can help in the future success of the organisation. The framework developed in this study builds on previous research and introduces new variables found to be important in the field...|$|E

This follow-up study is loosely linked to the study Redundancy in Steel : Labour Market Behaviour, Domestic Organisation and Local Networks, 1981 - 1982 (SN 1637), which looked at {{the effects of the}} 1980 <b>redundancy</b> <b>programme</b> of the British Steel Corporation on the local economy of Port Talbot. Those interviewed in Redundancy in Steel (SN 1637) were offered a redundancy package which differed according to the age of the worker. Those under the age of 55 (born in 1926 or later) were offered significant inducements to find and take on work with other employers. In contrast, those aged 55 or more were given the opposite: an immediate pension and 'make-up' money (matching their former wages) which they lost were they to obtain further paid employment. All 108 men interviewed for the Retirement Through Redundancy (SN 7056) study were aged 55 or more at the time of redundancy. Half of those interviewed had been miners earlier in life and the miners' strike was current when the interviews took place. Respondents were interviewed using an interview schedule which included information transcribed from an earlier interview they took part-in with a Gallop interviewer from the Redundancy in Steel (SN 1637) study. Of the 108 interviews, 45 have been transcribed and are available from the UK Data Archive. Main Topics : The main topics included: early retirement; the redundancy process; pension, income and standard of living; disability, ill-health and benefits. <br...|$|E
