40|$|E-science is {{hailed as}} {{a new way of}} doing science. Its aim is to create an {{infrastructure}} which enables collaborative and distributed work, coupled with large computational processing power and data storage facilities. E-Science brings together a number of challenges both social and technical, and most of the time, a combination of both. These include collaborative working, information governance, database linking, security etc. Whilst there is an understanding of some of the challenges that face e-science projects, there has been little attention on the requirements capture process of e-science projects. This thesis aims to examine the requirements specification of the projects and aims to draw out any differences from traditional requirements specification. This research proposal will outline the background to the literature, and how the research will be carried out, progress from the first year of study and proposed work for the next <b>remainder</b> <b>period</b> of study...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{performed in}} the framework of the completion of the Ph. D. dissertation, is focused on the optimal reservoir operation for irrigation purposes during the irrigation period. The time interval is the 10 days. The <b>remainder</b> <b>period</b> of year determines the reservoir storage {{in the beginning of the}} irrigation period, while so much the reservoir storage in the beginning of the irrigation period and inflow during the irrigation period are regulated and used for the irrigation. The objective function maximizes the total farm income, which is based on actual yield, area, production cost and crop prices. The constraints include the state equation of reservoir, reservoir storage, irrigation requirements of a crop and reservoir release, yield and cropped area. The decision variables are the optimal allocation of cultivation areas for any number of irrigated crops and the optimal irrigation schedule, which specifies the amount of irrigation to be applied to each crop during its growing season. The actual yield is calculated with the production function given by Jensen and the maximum evapotranspiration coincides with crop evapotranspiration, which is the product of a crop factor and the reference evapotranspiration which is computed from the FAO Penman-Monteith equation. The determination of the actual evapotranspiration is becomes with the soil water balance and soil water depletion function. The optimization of the nonlinear discrete-time dynamic model is performed in two stages. During the first stage the simulated annealing (SA) global optimization stochastic search algorithm is used and in a second stage it is refined the solution reached by the SA, using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. SA has been proved under suitable conditions (Gauss distribution to generate test points, Boltzman distribution for acceptance of these and logarithmic reduction of temperature) to converge with probability one to the global optimal solution, in the limiting case of infinite iterations. The optimisation model is applied on historical and synthetically data from a planned reservoir on the Havrias River in Northern Greece. Synthetically data are referred to rainfall, inflow and reference evapotranspiration are calculated with frequency analysis Summary 321 in a synthetic series duration of 50 years (economic life of work), which resulted from 100 synthetic series that were produced for every of this variables. The optimization computes the optimal distribution of areas and crops, the water release to satisfy irrigation requirements and the total profit. The procedure is relatively easy to apply and can be used as a decision support tool for cropping patterns of an irrigated area and irrigation scheduling. ...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater {{recharge}} {{and base}} flow using different investigated methods are simulated in the 15 -ha Bukmoongol small-forested watershed {{located at the}} southern part of Korea. The WHAT system, PART, RORA, PULSE, BFI, and RAP software are used to estimate groundwater recharge or base flow and base flow index from the measured streamflow. Results show that about 15 – 31 per cent of annual rainfall might be contributed for base flow. The watershed groundwater recharge proportions are computed to about 10 – 21 per cent during the wet period and 23 – 32 per cent for the <b>remainder</b> <b>periods.</b> Mean annual base flow indices vary from 0. 25 to 0. 76 estimated using different methods. However, the study found out that all methods were significantly correlated with each other. The similarity of various methods is expressed as a weighted relationship provided by the matrix product from the principal component analysis. Overall, the BFI and WHAT software appeared consistent in estimating recharge or base flow, and base flow index under Korea’s conditions. The case study recommends the application of different models to other watersheds as well as in low-lying areas where most observation groundwater wells are located with available streamflow data. 1...|$|R

50|$|Here we {{see that}} the period of 3k modulo 7 is 6.

Targets set for the national economy in the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-65) quickly proved to be overly ambitious, particularly with regard to foreign trade. The plan was dropped after a recession in 1962, and annual plans covered the <b>remainder</b> of the <b>period.</b> National income actually declined in 1963.
