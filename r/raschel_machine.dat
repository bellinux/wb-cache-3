A German firm used this machine to produce [...] "Raschel" [...] shawls, named after the French actress Élisabeth Félice Rachel. In 1859 Wilhelm Barfuss improved the machine to create the Raschel machines. The Jacquard apparatus was adapted {{to it in the}} 1870s. The <b>Raschel</b> <b>machine</b> could work at higher speeds than the Leavers machine and proved the most adaptable to the new synthetic fibres, such as nylon and polyester, in the 1950s.

40|$|This part aims to {{investigate}} the effects of structural parameters and lamination on the impact force attenuation properties of warp-knitted spacer fabrics developed for impact protectors. A series of warp-knitted spacer fabrics was produced on a double-needle bar <b>Raschel</b> <b>machine</b> by varying their structural parameters including spacer monofilament inclination and fineness, fabric thickness, and outer layer structure. The effects of fabric structural parameters, impact energy levels, and laminated layers on the protective performance of the spacer fabrics were tested and analyzed based on {{the assessment of the}} peak transmitted force. The results showed that all the structural parameters significantly affect the impact force attenuation properties of the warp-knitted spacer fabrics. It was also found that lamination of the spacer fabrics can effectively improve the force attenuation performance. Three layers of the developed warp-knitted spacer fabrics in a total thickness of about 2. 5 [*]cm can meet the requirement of the transmitted force lower than 35 [*]kN at an impact energy of 50 [*]J according to the European Standard BS EN 1621 - 1 : 1998.

40|$|Nowadays, textile {{technologies}} {{develop to}} adapt their different techniques for creating new {{products for the}} different sectors of application every day. Particularly, warp knitted fabrics and warp-knitting technology have applications in all different groups of technical textiles. It {{could be the most}} applied technique, the most versatile technology to develop new textile products for the new textile market. Warp knitted fabrics play the most important role among the technical textile fabrics. This technology is used in different product groups such as mobile textiles (car seat covers, dashboard cover), industrial textiles (composites), medical textiles (anti-decubitus blankets), sports textiles and foundation garments (bra cups, pads for swimwear). This study presents some examples of the application of this technology in some markets Within the market of technical textile, medical textile has an increasing relevance and knitted fabrics and knitting technology, at the same time, play a very important role in the fields of technical and medical textiles. Studies have demonstrated that knitted structures possess excellent mechanical properties and can promote more effective regenerative medicine, tissue repair, ligament, tendon cartilage, reconstruction, etc. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present different possibilities of textiles developed with this kind of structures, to present different alternatives, different examples of products obtained with this kind of textile structure combined with the correct kind of textile fiber. In this kind of technology, double-bar <b>Raschel</b> <b>machines</b> used for producing three-dimensional textiles, spacers, play an important role. ...|$|R
40|$|On the {{assumption}} that grid-like knitted fabrics from flax fibres should be embedded in light-weight concrete, cellular concrete and plaster, investigations were performed on various yarns from flax fibres under near-practical conditions (pH-value 12, temperature 80 - 190 C, storage time up to 10 hours). At increasing temperature and storage {{time there was a}} different decrease of the maximum tensile force in connection with a reduction of the other testing features (Tt, EpsH, fibre length) according to the texture and fineness of the flax yarns. It was proved that yarns from flax fibres and flax tows can be processed on knitting <b>machines</b> (<b>raschel</b> knitting <b>machines,</b> stitch-bonding and small circular warp knitting machines) to knitted grids with different mesh sizes and net mesh structures without problems. Surprisingly it was found that there was nearly no degradation at the immersion in alkali for net grids with mesh legs of a high packing density. Single tests for the reinforcement of test beams from light-weight concrete and plaster were performed with the producted knittted grids. The bending tensile tests with light-weight concrete (cement mortar with light-weight aggregates) result in a slight increase of the bending tensile strength and with cellular concrete partly in a substantial increase of the same. The reinforcing tests with plaster did not result in an increase of the bending tensile strength. For all reinforced variants a distinct reduction of the crack propagation was determined. Fundamental informations on the adhesive bond and the concrete compatibility were obtained. Due to the shortened time for the subject matter systematic repeat tests were not possible so that a statistical assurance {{of the results of the}} reinforcing tests can only be attained in a later timeSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1176 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
5000|$|Raschel knits do not stretch {{significantly}} {{and are often}} bulky; consequently, they are often used as an unlined material for coats, jackets, straight skirts and dresses. These fabrics can be made out of conventional or novelty yarns which allows for interesting textures and designs to be created. [...] The qualities of these fabrics range from [...] "dense and compact to open and lofty and can be either stable or stretchy, and single-faced or reversible. [...] The largest outlet for the <b>Raschel</b> warp knitting <b>machine</b> is for lace fabric and trimmings. Raschel knitting is also used in outdoors and military fabrics for products such as backpacks.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the impact compressive behavior of warp-knitted spacer fabrics developed for human body protections. A series of warp-knitted spacer fabrics was produced on a double-needle bar <b>Raschel</b> warp knitting <b>machine</b> by varying their structural parameters, including spacer monofilament inclination and fineness, fabric thickness, and surface layer structure. A drop-weight impact tester was used to test these fabrics with predefined impact energy. The impact process of a typical spacer fabric was analyzed based on its impact contact force-displacement curve, energy absorbed-contact force curve and transmitted force-time curve. The effects of the structural parameters on the impact compressive behavior of the warp-knitted spacer fabrics were also discussed. The relationship between the peak transmitted force and peak contact force was established for these fabrics. The study shows that the warp-knitted spacer fabrics {{can be used as a}} type of effective material for human body protection due to their high energy absorption capacity and reduction of the contact peak force. The study also shows that all the structural parameters significantly affect the impact compressive behavior of the warp-knitted spacer fabrics in terms of peak contact force, peak transmitted force, and energy absorbed at different impact compressive stages. According to the results obtained, the warp-knitted spacer fabrics studied can reduce about 33. 16 % of the peak contact force. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
