40|$|Railroads are {{important}} to the U. S. economy. They transport freight efficiently, requiring less energy and emitting fewer pollutants than other modes of surface transportation. While the railroad industry has steadily improved its fuel efficiency [...] by 16 % over the last decade [...] more can, and needs to, be done. The ability of locomotive manufacturers to conduct research into fuel efficiency and emissions reduction is limited by the small number of locomotives manufactured annually. Each year for the last five years, the two North American locomotive manufacturers [...] General Electric Transportation Systems and the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors [...] have together sold about 800 locomotives in the United States. With such a small number of units over which research costs can be spread, outside help is needed to investigate all possible ways to reduce fuel usage and emissions. Because fuel costs represent {{a significant portion of the}} total operating costs of a railroad, fuel efficiency has always been an important factor in the design of locomotives and in the operations of a railroad. However, fuel efficiency has recently become even more critical with the introduction of strict emission standards by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, to be implemented in stages (Tiers 0, 1, and 2) between 2000 and 2005. Some of the technologies that could be employed to meet the emission standards may negatively affect fuel economy [...] by as much as 10 - 15 % when emissions are reduced to Tier 1 levels. Lowering fuel economy by that magnitude would have a serious impact on the cost to the consumer of goods shipped by rail, on the competitiveness of the railroad industry, and on this country's dependence on foreign oil. Clearly, a joint government/industry R&D program is needed to help catalyze the development of advanced technologies that will substantially reduce locomotive engine emissions while also improving train system energy efficiency. DOE convened an industry-government workshop in January 2001 to gauge industry interest. As a result, the railroads, their suppliers, and the federal government 5 have embarked on a cooperative effort to further improve railroad fuel efficiency [...] by 25 % between now and 2010 and by 50 % by 2020, on an equivalent gallon per <b>revenue</b> <b>ton-mile</b> basis, while meeting emission standards, all in a cost-effective, safe manner. This effort aims to bring the collaborative approaches of other joint industry-government efforts, such as FreedomCAR and the 21 st Century Truck partnership, to the problem of increasing rail fuel efficiency. Under these other programs, DOE's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies has supported research on technologies to reduce fuel use and air emissions by light- and heavy-duty vehicles. DOE plans to bring similar efforts to bear on improving locomotives. The Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad Administration will also be a major participant in this new effort, primarily by supporting research on railroad safety. Like FreedomCAR and the 21 st Century Truck program, a joint industry-government research effort devoted to locomotives and railroad technology could be a 'win' for the public and a 'win' for industry. Industry's expertise and in-kind contributions, coupled with federal funding and the resources of the DOE's national laboratories, could make for an efficient, effective program with measurable energy efficiency targets and realistic deployment schedules. This document provides the necessary background for developing such a program. Potential R&D pathways to greatly improve the efficiency of freight transportation by rail, while meeting future emission standards in a cost-effective, safe manner, were developed jointly by an industry-government team as a result of DOE's January 2001 Workshop on Locomotive Emissions and System Efficiency and are presented here. The status of technology, technical targets, barriers, and technical approaches for engine, locomotive, rail systems, and advanced power plants and fuels are presented...|$|E

Railroad Operational Performance in the United States by Denver Tolliver, John Bitzan, and Doug Benson This paper examines the effects of increased car weights, train size, and distance on railroad operational performance, which is measured in <b>revenue</b> <b>ton-miles</b> per train hour. A statistical model is estimated from Class I data that explains most of the variation in this index, while controlling for commodity and fixed network effects. The results suggest that length of haul, net load, and train size contributed significantly to performance gains from 1987 to 2006. However, train miles per track mile increased by 89 % during the same period, resulting in line and yard congestion...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{measurement}} of productivity has increasingly focused on measuring total factor productivity or TFP. Additional research has investigated the reasons for differences in TFP between firms. The implicit assumption behind this work is that simpler measures of industry productivity (such as <b>revenue</b> <b>ton-miles</b> per employee) can seriously misstate both the level and growth rate of productivity. As a result, accurate analysis of productivity requires information on TFP. While this argument is not open to debate on a theoretical basis, the extent that simple measures of productivity inaccurately portray TFP has not been investigated in anything but a cursory manner. This paper investigates the relationship between typical industry measures of productivity and TFP using a data set of U. S. and non-U. S. airlines for the period 1970 - 1983. The paper examines both levels of productivity and growth rates. The results indicate {{the extent to which}} industry measures accurately or inaccurately reflect the more comprehensive measure of productivity (TFP). To the extent that industry measures are inaccurate, this paper investigates the possible sources of error in order to determine if slightly altered industry measures might more accurately reflect TFP. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{railroad}} {{industry was}} substantially deregulated by the Staggers Act in 1980. While railroad rates, {{as measured by}} industry-wide <b>revenue</b> per <b>ton-mile,</b> declined since that time, it is unclear why rates declined. Changes in commodity mix, length of haul, shipment size, lading weight, equipment ownership, railroad costs, competition from other modes, and demand for railroad transportation have all played some role. This paper assesses the importance {{of each of these}} factors in explaining the decline in railroad rates since the Staggers Act. After controlling for changes in commodity mix, the analysis indicates that shippers received nearly $ 28 billion per year in rate reductions as a result of changes that took place between 1982 and 1996. The reduction in productivity-adjusted railroad costs explains almost 90 % of the reduction in railroad rates, with other factors playing much lesser roles. Railroad Rates Deregulation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an overview of the US air cargo industry since airline deregulation in 1978, including a brief overview of the historical evolution of air cargo transport in the US from the early 1900 s until the late 1970 s and a discussion about the major international factors affecting global air cargo. A deeper analysis of the US air cargo industry follows these background discussions, emphasizing the growth of all-cargo carrier traffic in the past 30 years while noting the decline of combination carrier traffic within the past decade. Furthermore, operating cost analyses for the past 20 years reveal that major improvements in labor productivity have helped all-cargo carriers and combination carriers decrease unit costs, even while the price of fuel has risen dramatically. Productivity of US air cargo carriers is explored from 1990 to 2010 through two types of metrics, single-factor productivity (SFP) and multi-factor productivity (MFP). SFP metrics measure an airline's ability to turn inputs, such as fuel, labor, and capital, into outputs, such as available <b>ton-miles</b> (ATMs) and <b>revenue</b> <b>ton-miles</b> (RTMs). The MFP metric presented measures how effectively an airline produces an output from multiple inputs, essentially combining the SFP metrics. Single-factor productivity results show that the US air cargo industry has made significant improvements in labor productivity and capital productivity, with minor improvements in fuel productivity. FedEx and UPS have achieved the smallest improvements over the past 20 years, while other all-cargo carriers and combination carriers realized substantial advancements in the past two decades. Multi-factor productivity results echo the SFP results. Over the past 20 years, FedEx and UPS improved MFP 18 %, combination carriers became approximately twice as productive, and the other all-cargo carriers increased MFP dramatically. However, questionable data reported by all-cargo carriers and methods used to determine only cargo-related data for combination carriers limit the accuracy of these results and caused difficulties calculating productivity throughout this thesis. by David J.

25|$|The {{earliest}} predecessor of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Aurora Branch Railroad, was chartered by {{act of the}} Illinois General Assembly on October 2, 1848. The charter {{was obtained}} by citizens of Aurora and Batavia, Illinois, who were concerned that the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad would bypass their towns in favor of West Chicago on its route; at the time, {{that was the only}} line running west from Chicago. The Aurora Branch was built from Aurora, through Batavia, to Turner Junction in what is now West Chicago. The line was built with old strap rail and minimal, if any, grading. Using a leased locomotive and cars, the Aurora Branch ran passenger and freight trains from Aurora to Chicago via its own line from Aurora to Turner Junction and one of the G's two tracks east from there to Chicago. The G required the Aurora Branch to turn over 70 percent of their <b>revenue</b> per <b>ton-mile</b> handled on that railroad; as a result, in the mid-1850s, surveys were ordered to determine the best route for a railroad line to Chicago.|$|R
30|$|Rail freight has {{despite the}} major recent {{economic}} recession grown, as has rail passenger traffic, {{in recent years}} in response to a mix of technical, operational, ownership and governance changes. This has been true of European systems leading to expressions of concern for capacity and the development of new infrastructure. In North America which has a much more limited passenger traffic base rail freight has grown with particular strength in inter-modal and single commodity block trains. An important aspect of the successful of U. S. railroad is the deregulatory measures: the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act known as or 4 R Act of 1976; the famous Staggers Rail Act (SRA) of 1980; and the last but not least the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA) that allowed the operators to work in a better competitive environment. This has resulted in not just a fewer but stronger Class 1 railroad operators [3, 14, 11]. The deregulation has benefited the customers as well. For example, [1], p. 3) claims that average rail freight rates (measured by inflation-adjusted <b>revenue</b> per <b>ton-mile)</b> were 44 %t lower in 2012 than in 1981. North American rail freight still includes a high proportion of carload or carload groups and this reflects the remaining high availability of sidings, spurs and industrial branches together with the pro-active regional and small line railroads that actively support and service this type of traffic. The regional and short line model may be an option to be developed much further in Europe as a means of capturing traffic back to rail.|$|R
