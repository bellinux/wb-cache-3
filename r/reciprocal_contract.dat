40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} study of everyday relations between residents and the state on a post-industrial council estate in England. Drawing upon historical and ethnographic data, it analyses how, often under conditions of sustained exclusion, residents rely upon the state in their daily struggles for security and survival. My central ethnographic finding is that residents personalise the state alongside informal networks of support and care into a local sociality of reciprocity. This finding can be broken into three interconnected points. First, I argue that the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>contract</b> between citizens and the state emerged in the post-war years when the residents on the newly built estates negotiated their dependence upon the state by integrating it into their on-going social relations. A climate of relative material affluence, selective housing policies, and a paternalistic regime of housing management all created conditions which were conducive for this temporary union between residents and the state. Second, however, I argue that with the decline of industry and shifts towards neoliberal policies, residents increasingly struggle to hold the state accountable to its reciprocal obligations towards local people. This becomes manifest today both in the material neglect of council estates {{as well as in}} state officials' reluctance to become implicated in social relations with and between residents. Third, I argue that this failure {{on the part of the}} state to attend to residents' demands often has onerous effects on people's lives. It not only exacerbates residents' exposure to insecurity and threat, but is also experienced as a moral affront which generates larger narratives of abandonment and betrayal. Theoretically, this dissertation critically discusses and challenges contrasting portrayals of the state, and of state-citizen relations, in two bodies of literature. On the one hand, in much of the sociological and anthropological literature on working class communities, authors have adopted a community-centred approach which has depicted working class communities as self-contained entities against which the state emerges as a distant or hostile entity. I argue that such a portrayal is premised upon a romanticised view of working class communities which neglects the intimate presence of the state in everyday life. On the other hand, the theoretical literature on the British state has adopted a state-centred perspective which has seen the state as a renewed source of order and authority in disintegrating communities today. My suggestion is that this portrayal rests upon a pathologising view of social decline which fails to account for the persistence of informal social relations and the challenges that these pose to the state's authority from below. Finally, moving beyond the community-centred and state-centred perspectives, I argue for the need to adopt a middle ground which combines an understanding of the nature and workings of informal relations with an acknowledgement of the ubiquity of the state. Such an approach allows us to recognise that, far from being a hostile entity or, alternatively, an uncontested source of order, the state occupies shifting positions within an overarching sociality of reciprocity and its associated demands for alliances and divisions. I refer to such an approach as the personalisation of the state. </p...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore {{how and why the}} content of individuals' psychological contracts changes over time. The contract is generally understood as "individual beliefs, shaped by the organisation, regarding the terms of an exchange agreement between individuals and their organisation" (Rousseau, 1995, p. 9). With an overall study sampling frame of 320 graduate organisational newcomers, a mixed method longitudinal research design comprised of three sequential, inter-related studies is employed in order to capture the change process. From the 15 semi-structured interviews conducted in Study 1, the key findings included identifying a relatively high degree of mutuality between employees' and their managers' <b>reciprocal</b> <b>contract</b> beliefs around the time of organisational entry. Also, at this time, individuals had developed specific components of their contract content through a mix of social network information (regarding broader employment expectations) and perceptions of various elements of their particular organisation's reputation (for more firm-specific expectations). Study 2 utilised a four-wave survey approach (available to the full sampling frame) over the 14 months following organisational entry to explore the 'shape' of individuals' contract change trajectories and the role of four theorised change predictors in driving these trajectories. The predictors represented an organisational-level informational cue (perceptions of corporate reputation), a dyadic-level informational cue (perceptions of manager-employee relationship quality) and two individual difference variables (affect and hardiness). Through the use of individual growth modelling, the findings showed differences in the general change patterns across contract content components of perceived employer (exhibiting generally quadratic change patterns) and employee (exhibiting generally no-change patterns) obligations. Further, individuals differentially used the predictor variables to construct beliefs about specific contract content. While both organisational- and dyadic-level cues were focused upon to construct employer obligation beliefs, organisational-level cues and individual difference variables were focused upon to construct employee obligation beliefs. Through undertaking 26 semi-structured interviews, Study 3 focused upon gaining a richer understanding of why participants' contracts changed, or otherwise, over the study period, with a particular focus upon the roles of breach and violation. Breach refers to an employee's perception that an employer obligation has not been met and violation refers to the negative and affective employee reactions which may ensue following a breach. The main contribution of these findings was identifying that subsequent to a breach or violation event a range of 'remediation effects' could be activated by employees which, depending upon their effectiveness, served to instigate either breach or contract repair or both. These effects mostly instigated broader contract repair and were generally cognitive strategies enacted by an individual to re-evaluate the breach situation and re-focus upon other positive aspects of the employment relationship. As such, the findings offered new evidence for a clear distinction between remedial effects which serve to only repair the breach (and thus the contract) and effects which only repair the contract more broadly; however, when effective, both resulted in individuals again viewing their employment relationships positively. Overall, in response to the overarching research question of this thesis, how and why individuals' psychological contract beliefs change, individuals do indeed draw upon various information sources, particularly at the organisational-level, as cues or guides in shaping their contract content. Further, the 'shapes' of the changes in beliefs about employer and employee obligations generally follow different, and not necessarily linear, trajectories over time. Finally, both breach and violation and also remedial actions, which address these occurrences either by remedying the breach itself (and thus the contract) or the contract only, play central roles in guiding individuals' contract changes to greater or lesser degrees. The findings from the thesis provide both academics and practitioners with greater insights into how employees construct their contract beliefs over time, the salient informational cues used to do this and how the effects of breach and violation can be mitigated through creating an environment which facilitates the use of effective remediation strategies...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} the exceptio non adimpleti contractus (defence of the unfulfilled contract / right to withhold {{performance of a}} reciprocal obligation if the other party did not make or tender proper performance). It first focuses {{on the role of}} this defence in lease contracts. The weight of South African authority is in favour of only recognising proportional reduction in rent as a remedy for a lessee who received partial use and enjoyment of the leased object, so that a right to withhold the full rent with reference to the exceptio is not available as a further defence. Nevertheless, the case of Ntshiqa v Andreas Supermarket, which applied the exceptio and the rules on the relaxation thereof in the leading case on the exceptio of BK Tooling v Scope Precision Engineering in this context, has not been specifically overruled, and has often been cited with approval by academic writers. This creates uncertainty about the lessee's exact obligations and remedies. If it is accepted that proportional reduction in rent is the appropriate remedy, rather than the exceptio, it may give the impression that the law of lease is not consistent with the general principles of contract law on remedies for breach, which recognise that the exceptio applies to all <b>reciprocal</b> <b>contracts.</b> However, there may be good policy reasons why different types of specific contracts should have their own deviating rules. This contribution shows that in this instance the rules on lease could be reconciled with the general principles. It argues for some modification of the currently accepted principles on the exceptio as well as recognition of proportionate reduction in price as a generalised remedy for breach. There is already implicit support for this modification in the cost orders made by courts who relaxed the exceptio. When rent is payable in advance, the right to suspend performance {{in the face of an}} anticipatory breach becomes relevant, and proposals are also made in this regard. The rules argued for in this contribution are consistent with a more general principle that the exceptio as well as the remedy of suspension may only be raised to the extent consistent with good faith or reasonableness.

Firms may benefit in two different ways: directly, from workers reciprocating higher sick pay with higher efforts; and indirectly, from self-selection of <b>reciprocal</b> workers into <b>contracts</b> with higher sick pay. Our main finding is that the direct effect is rather weak in terms of effort and negative in terms of profits.

30|$|By {{analyzing}} {{the dimensions of}} a transaction, transaction cost analysis determines the most efficient governance structure (market, hybrid contractual agreements, or hierarchy) for a transaction to take place (make-or-buy decision) (Williamson 1979, 1981), where {{the main difference between}} the governance structures is the underlying contract law (Williamson, 1991). Market governance describes a setting where buyer and seller meet and the transaction is conducted via a single purchase contract—the classical sale (Williamson 1979). It is the setting with the lowest transaction costs for nonspecific transactions, both for single and recurrent transactions (Williamson 1979). A vertically integrated, centralized organization within which the transaction is concluded (hierarchical governance) is recommended for transactions with high specificity (Williamson 1979, 1981). The hybrid governance modes can take various forms of two organizations cooperating like long-term <b>contracting,</b> <b>reciprocal</b> trading, regulation, or franchising (Williamson 1991). The applied neoclassical contract law is more flexible than in a hierarchy but stricter than in a market (Williamson 1991). Hybrid modes are a compromise between the extremes of market and hierarchy as they combine advantages of both governance forms. A transaction is efficient, if it has the lowest transaction costs and production costs, while a trade-off between transaction costs and production costs might exist (Williamson 1985).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the livelihood {{strategies of}} Turkana people of North-Western Kenya from {{the context of}} cultural modes of existence developed to weather the effects of food crises. The paper makes a thorough assessment to determine how effective some of these indigenous customary livelihood strategies still are at present times, and with what frequency and intensity they are being implemented. It is argued that Turkana peoples’ social institutions act as a foundation of social capital which is traditionally a fundamental livelihood strategy. For example, territoriality and neighborhoods were units of identification in a given geographical space and enabled social forces such as ethnic groups to establish inter-unit relations in the utilization of resources. The organizational structure of splitting the family unit into grazing homesteads and browse homesteads was ecologically innovative, as it utilized the widely dispersed vegetation {{in order to meet}} the dietary needs of livestock. Labour organization within the family was geared towards the sustenance of the pastoral economy. Furthermore, the head of the household performed a supervisory role of herding, branding, and watering animals. Women performed the task of milking and watering young animals, while young girls assisted in fetching water, cooking, and herding goats and sheep. Young boys herded young stock, such as calves and lambs. Stock associateship enabled individuals to widely disperse livestock among affinals in order to prepare against instant decimation of livestock by ecological disasters such as framine and drought. It also enabled individuals to establish social bonds and <b>reciprocal</b> relations between <b>contracting</b> parties. Legality in Turkana society guided individuals in the utilization of the pastoral resources such as water, salt licks, and grass. It enabled them to contain deviant behaviour and to resolve conflict. The same social institutions such as kinship and rangeland territoriality were the basis of organizing sustenance in producing activities such as pastoralism. They were also the basis of identity and legitimization of the Turkana social and economic quests. The Turkana also believed on the high God to bless them with the domestic stock and abundant grass, drive away diseases and multiply and fatten their domestic animals...|$|R
30|$|Firms {{have become}} {{increasingly}} embedded in interorganizational networks with respect to social, professional, and exchange relationships (see Granovetter 1985; Gulati 1998; Parkhe et al. 2006; Snow 2015; Snow et al. 2016). Digitization has become an accelerator for this development {{to the extent that}} firms have changed their modus operandi from competition to cooperation to collaboration due to social and technological conditions (Snow 2015, p. 1). Interorganizational networks encompass a firm’s relationships to suppliers, customers, competitors, or other entities across boundaries of industries or countries. Thereby, they can take different forms such as strategic alliances, joint ventures, franchising, long-term marketing and licensing <b>contracts,</b> <b>reciprocal</b> trade agreements, R&D partnerships, buyer-supplier relationships, director interlocks, investment bank ties, personnel movement links or cross-patent citation ties (Gulati et al. 2000, p. 203; Zaheer et al. 2010, p. 62). Interorganizational networks are constituted of organizations which are connected through a wide range of social and economic relationships. In general, a network is considered to be “a set of nodes and the set of ties representing some relationship, or lack of relationship, between nodes” (Brass et al. 2004, p. 795). Nodes are referred to actors (e.g. persons, teams, units, organizations) which are connected by ties to a set of binary social relations. Ties can have varying contents, strengths, and directions, “limited only by a researcher's imagination” (Brass et al. 2004, p. 795). The pattern of ties forms a specific structure in a network whereas actors occupy positions within this structure. Nodes in interorganizational networks are referred to as firms connected by ties which represent a set of relationships such as exchange, power, or solidarity. Organization scholars have developed a huge and diverse network research generating broad insights about the fragmented field of interorganizational networks (Baker and Faulkner 2002, p. 520; Zaheer et al. 2010, p. 64). Drawing on different theoretical approaches, network-related research has gained insights on how firms may intentionally affect structure and ties of networks to generate superior outcomes by accessing valuable and inimitable resources and capabilities (e.g. Dyer and Singh 1998; Gulati et al. 2000; Gulati 1999; Powell et al. 1996), gaining power and control (e.g. Burt 1992; Cook 1977; Santos and Eisenhardt 2009), establishing trust (e.g. Beamish and Lupton 2009; Coleman 1988; Gulati 1995; Zaheer et al. 1998) and signaling status (e.g. Baum et al. 2000; Higgins and Gulati 2003; Podolny 2005, 1993).|$|R
40|$|Afer World War ?, many {{international}} human rights treaties have been ratified. Although an expectation that {{international human}} rights law makes world better to protect human rights, there are still vast human rights violations in various countries. From the gap between expectation to {{international human rights}} law and reality of human rights violations, {{the purpose of this}} thesis is to point out the problem of international human rights law and not only to point out the problem but also to suggest a coherent and logical explanation. To achieve the goal, this thesis investigates three questions: what is the better way to understand international law?, why do states comply with international law?, and what is the problem of international human rights law?. The first, this paper argues and represents that law and economics approach can be the better way to understand international law and can be a useful methodology to research international law. Despite of some concerns from misunderstanding of law and economics approach, law and economics can give insights to study international law, using economic theories such as price theory, transaction cost economics, game theory. The second, this paper shows the reason why states comply with international law. Although there are previous studies that explain compliance with international law, the studies have limitations to suggest a coherent and logical explain. By law and economics analysis, the key for states’ compliance is the three Rs of compliance: reciprocity, retaliation, and reputation. The three Rs makes and raises cost for states’ non-compliance with international law. Therefore, through the three Rs, international law can work as self-enforcing mechanism and can induce states to comply with international law. The third, this paper point out problems of international human rights. This paper argues that international human rights law has different character or concept compared with other international laws such as WTO law and law of war. International human rights law is not based on <b>reciprocal</b> character as <b>contract</b> model but based on moral foundation that makes consent between states as declarations of existing moral norms. Because this different character, the three Rs as the key for compliance cannot work well. Only reputation little works. Moreover, there are no strong enforcement mechanisms in international human rights regimes. Although there are some enforcement mechanisms in international human rights system, they have limitations to induce states to comply with international human rights law and do not impose costs for states’ non-compliance. In conclusion, from law and economics approach, international human rights law as self-enforcing mechanism cannot satisfy the conditions for compliance of international law: reciprocity, retaliation, and reputation. Moreover, there are not strong and effective enforcement mechanisms to assure compliance in international human rights treaties. Therefore, current international human rights law cannot fully induce and facilitate states to comply with international human rights obligations...|$|R
