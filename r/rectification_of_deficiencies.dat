It details methods of financial analysis and their application in the selected company, assesses individual indicators and identifies shortcomings. Based on these findings, there are proposed measures in area of outstandings and liabilities, liquidity, productivity and profitability that will lead to <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and preservation of financial stability and the financial health of the company...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} a refined technique {{to measure and}} interpret variables associated {{with the quality of}} an inspection [...] be it port state control or vetting inspections towards the probability of a very serious, serious or less serious casualty. It concentrates on filtering out the effect of variables such as detention, the port state control regime that inspected the vessel, time in-between inspections, deficiencies found during an inspection and the effect of vetting inspections. The consensus amongst policy makers in the shipping industry is that data cannot be combined to target vessels. While this article does demonstrate that the decrease in the probability of casualty is stronger for the South American Region, the Indian Ocean Region and Australia versus North Europe, North America or the Caribbean, it also demonstrates that the data can be combined to target vessels for inspections. Since the time in-between inspections and detention is mostly not significant towards decreasing the probability of casualty, these results reflect the lack of coordination amongst port state control regimes and industry inspections. Due to this lack of coordination and trust, a ship might be inspected in several regimes during a relative short time period where the benefit of an inspection can be easily saturated. Our recommendation on direct policy implication is to promote the harmonization of inspection databases across port state control regimes, preferably with the coordination of the development of the Global Integrated Ship Information System (GISIS) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to review the policy of a release of a vessel from detention and to increase cooperation amongst regimes with respect to the follow up of the <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Port state control Casualty per regions Probability of casualty Effectiveness of inspections Vetting inspections Binary logistic regression Harmonization of inspections...|$|E

40|$|The {{globalization}} has plotted {{the course of}} the humanity, towards the conformation of the society of the information and the knowledge. Nevertheless, the deficiencies in the matter of habits and reading understanding, combined to the changing Technologies of the Information and the Communication (TIC), deepen the inequalities between prosperous and developing countries and individuals of a same nation, which throws lamentable numbers of functional illiteracy, informational and technological. Before such situation, the public libraries, like institutions of social and cultural character, must contribute in the processes <b>of</b> <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> these <b>deficiencies,</b> {{as well as to the}} formation and consolidation of the reading society. In this direction, the investigation assumes the compared study of an intentional sample of reading plans, designed by organisms and international, national and regional institutions of iberoamerican countries, with the purpose of presenting a set of methodologic criteria for the planning of promotion of the reading, that allows the active participation of the public library in the construction of the society of the shared knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggest that}} marketing {{should be at}} the heart of strategic decision making, yet lament its continued inability to establish a presence at business’s top table. Such failure is generally deemed to be the fault of the organization at large, and there is a generally implied presumption that marketers are unfairly marginalized. For marketing to succeed, however, it must be perceived as both credible and contemporary, yet there are small, though substantive, bodies of research implying, 1) that marketing’s reputation is still far from ideal and, 2) that practicing marketers prefer traditional means of endeavour that are likely counter-productive in the context of new, customer-focused, manifestos. Analysis of both the marketing and psychology literatures reveals that there is no existing measure that might be used to evaluate attitudes of marketers toward either MO or post-MO marketing concerns and that, consequently, we never test the commitment of the agent most critical to marketing’s strategic aspirations. This paper makes a strong case for the <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> such <b>deficiency</b> and, via critical reflection on some recent debates concerning marketing measures, suggests an inaugural perspective on how evaluation might be achieved. An agenda for further research is offered, too...|$|R

Die Autorinnen möchten mit ihrer Studie einen Beitrag zum Abbau dieses Forschungsdefizits leisten. In ihrer empirisch-biografischen Untersuchung gehen Ingrid Herlyn und Dorothea Krüger der Frage nach, ob späte Erstmutterschaft ein neues biografisches Muster der Familiengründung darstellt oder ob Mutterschaft nach wie vor eine selbstverständlich anerkannte Norm ist, deren Realisierung im Lebenslauf lediglich zeitlich später stattfindet.

Without the <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> names, different words would have different actions. This essentially means for every action, there is a word that describes that action. The belief is that by following the <b>Rectification</b> <b>of</b> Names, one would be following the correct/right path.

They form two of the thirteen Archimedean solids, which are the convex uniform polyhedra with polyhedral symmetry.|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{shipping}} industry's international legal framework, there are loopholes in the system, which {{can increase the}} risk of incidents with high economic costs due to the substandard operation of vessels. This article uses duration analysis and through the creation of ship life cycles provides insight into the effectiveness of inspections on prolonging ship lives. The analysis accounts for fluctuations in the relevant economic environment and the (possibly time-varying) ship particulars. It is based on a unique dataset containing information on the timing of accidents, inspections and ship particular changes of more than 50, 000 vessels over a 29 -year time period (1978 – 2007). The results reveal that {{the shipping}} industry is a relatively safe industry but there is a possible over-inspection of vessels. The effect of inspections varies across ship types and the prevention of incidents with high economic costs can be improved by a coordinated approach of all types of inspections that are performed which allows the decrease of unnecessary inspections. Further, more emphasis should be placed on the <b>rectification</b> and follow-up <b>of</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and the implementation of the ISM code. Another added benefit for the industry would be to improve transparency related to class withdrawals and class transfers for all classification societies. Another interesting finding is that for the majority of ship types, an increase in earnings decreases the incident rate. This is in contrast to the industry perception of the impact of earnings. ...|$|R
