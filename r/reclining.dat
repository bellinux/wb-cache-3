5|$|His {{forms are}} usually abstractions {{of the human}} figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or <b>reclining</b> figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his <b>reclining</b> figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Moore's {{signature}} form is a <b>reclining</b> figure. Moore's {{exploration of}} this form, {{under the influence}} of the Toltec-Mayan figure he had seen at the Louvre, was to lead him to increasing abstraction as he turned his thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier <b>reclining</b> figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through them as he pierced the forms with openings.|$|E
5|$|Objects {{connected}} with death, in particular sarcophagi and cinerary urns, {{form the basis}} of much of current knowledge of the ancient Etruscan civilization and its art, which once competed with the culture of ancient Rome, but was eventually absorbed into it. The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a <b>reclining</b> image of the deceased. The <b>reclining</b> figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the mano cornuta to protect the grave.|$|E

The <b>reclining</b> figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.|$|E

When the canvas is unframed, a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of various durations of wheelchair tilt-in-space and <b>recline</b> on enhancing skin perfusion over the ischial tuberosity in people {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI). DesignRepeated-measures, intervention and outcomes measure design. SettingUniversity research laboratory. ParticipantsPower wheelchair users with SCI (N= 9). InterventionsThree protocols of various durations (3 min, 1 min, and 0 min) of wheelchair tilt-in-space and <b>recline</b> were randomly assigned to the participants. Each protocol consisted of a baseline 15 -minute sitting, a duration of 0 - to 3 -minute <b>reclined</b> and tilted, a second 15 -minute sitting, and a 5 -minute recovery. The position at the baseline and the second sitting was no tilt/recline of the participant and at the <b>reclined</b> and tilted and recovery was at 35 ° tilt-in-space and 120 ° <b>recline.</b> Main Outcome MeasuresSkin perfusion response to tilt and <b>recline</b> was assessed by laser Doppler and was normalized to mean skin perfusion at the baseline sitting. ResultsThe results showed that mean skin perfusion during recovery at the 3 -minute duration was significantly higher than that at the 1 -minute duration (P<. 017) and mean skin perfusion was not significantly different between the 1 -minute and 0 -minute durations (not significant). Skin perfusion during the second sitting was significantly higher at the 3 -minute duration than at the 1 -minute and 0 -minute durations (P<. 017). ConclusionsOur findings suggest that performing the 3 -minute duration of wheelchair tilt-in-space and <b>recline</b> is more effective than the 1 -minute duration in enhancing skin perfusion of weight-bearing soft tissues...|$|R

In the finished work, she gestures outwards from the circle, creating a clear narrative flow in the positions of the figures: from the single men on the left, to the man choosing a wife, to the group of dancing women, to the couple leaving the circle of dancers to join the <b>reclining</b> lovers on the far right.|$|E
