Another commonly used measure is the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> at fracture [...] The ductility of steel varies depending on the alloying constituents.

30|$|However, it is {{difficult}} to measure ductility of a fine wire in terms of handling based on ISO 6892 - 1. For a wire with a diameter less than 0.2  mm, an elaborate measurement method for elongation has traditionally been required, even though the elongations and reductions of area of the wires greater than 0.2  mm in diameter have been calculated successfully (Ochiai et al. 1993; Zelin 2002; Hyung et al. 2007). For example, Khatibi et al. used a non-contact extensometer to perform tensile testing on a wire with a diameter under 0.1  mm (Khatibi et al. 2004). However, using such non-contact extensometers is a time-consuming process. Furthermore, the authors have measured the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> in a wire with a 0.06 -mm diameter using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of a fractured piece following tensile testing.

30|$|The {{applicable}} standard, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 6892 - 1 (ISO 6982 - 1 2016), {{refers to}} a method for measuring the ductility of bulk metal using its elongation and <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>area.</b> In general, the elongation is measured from the extension of a wire. The extension is measured by an extensometer, not by the stroke increment of a cross-head (henceforth simply {{referred to as the}} stroke increment) which is measured by the rotation angle of a ball screw in a universal testing machine. The stroke increment should be smaller than the genuine extension. This is because cross-heads bend during tensile testing due the application of a large tensile load to the wire. Therefore, the ISO standard recommends an extensometer be placed upon the tested wire. The <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>area</b> is calculated from the diameter of a wire prior to tensile testing, and the diameter at the most constricted point after tensile testing is complete. These diameters are measured by joining fractured pieces.|$|E
