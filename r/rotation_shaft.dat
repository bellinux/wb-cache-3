40|$|Artificial gravity {{provided}} by short radius centrifugation {{is considered a}} promising countermeasure to the deleterious physiological effects of microgravity during long-duration space flight. We investigated the feasibility of dual countermeasures to address space flight deconditioning of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, by combining centrifugation with lower-body exercise. The exercise device is a small stair-stepper with constant resistance {{provided by}} dampers beneath each foot, and is the first such device {{to be used in}} centrifuge studies. We modified the existing centrifuge to support the additional stresses due to exercise and added following structural elements: support struts on the <b>rotation</b> <b>shaft,</b> a redesigned footplate to which the exercise device was mounted, and horizontal support beams. We also added a sliding mattress with linear ball bearings on rails, so that the subject's body can move up and down while stepping. Design changes and exercise feasibility were validated by having subjects exercise during centrifugation at 23 rpm. We measured heart rate, blood pressure, forces on the feet, and knee deflection due to Coriolis accelerations, for up to four subjects. As expected, heart rate and blood pressure did increase normally with exercise on the centrifuge, relative to when not exercising. However, both heart rate and systolic blood pressure were higher for exercise on the non-spinning centrifuge than on the spinning centrifuge, attributable to the necessity of pulling against the stair-stepper's dampers in order to exercise while lying supine. Approximately half the subject's weight was exerted on the footplate when not exercising. (cont.) This was expected: since the subject's head was at zero radius and thus at 0 -g radially, the 100 % artificial gravity gradient along the body's longitudinal axis gave an average effective gravity of about 0. 5 g. More pressure (up to 80 % body weight) was exerted when the subject was stair-stepping. The measured lateral deflection of the knee during normal stair-stepping and knee bend exercises increased up to three inches compared to deflections in a non-rotating environment. This issue must be further addressed to determine if stair-stepping or knee bend exercises are to be used safely in artificial gravity. by Jessica Leigh Edmonds. Thesis (S. M.)

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device for laser processing of workpieces, where the focal spot of a laser beam (1) is three-dimensionally movable, comprises two reflecting elements (2, 3) by which the laser beam is directed on a workpiece surface to be processed after dual reflection. The reflecting elements are mounted on two carrier elements (2. 1, 3. 1) and are rotatable to the optical axis of the laser beam hitting on the first reflecting element. The carrier elements are connected by a guide rod (4) and the interval of the reflecting elements is changeable in longitudinal direction of the guide rod. A drive is provided for a common rotation of the reflecting elements with the respective carrier elements and for the interval change of the reflecting elements on the device. The drive for the common rotation and/or translatoric movement grips on carrier element of the second reflecting elements. The guide rod is fixed {{on one of the}} carrier elements in its longitudinal direction and is arranged on another carrier element in a longitudinal guidance (5). The carrier element of the second reflecting element is movable in longitudinal axis of the laser beam directed on the workpiece surface and reflecting elements and the guide rod and/or the longitudinal guidance are pivotably arranged vertically to longitudinal axis of the laser beam directed on the workpiece surface. On the reflecting elements, a rotation drive is arranged by which an angle is pivotable that corresponds to 0. 5 times of the angle by which the guidance rod is directed to 90 degrees to longitudinal axis of the laser beam directed on the workpiece surface. The drive is formed as gear-, frame- or friction gear, where an edge is connected with the respective carrier element and the other edge is connected with the <b>rotation</b> <b>shaft</b> of the respective reflecting elements. The drive is formed as double cross slide for a two-dimensional movement of {{the focal point of the}} laser beam, and for a three-dimensional deflection in the form of a tripod mechanic. The first carrier element is rotatable to the optical axis of the laser beam hitting on its reflecting element and is fixed for other movement. The guidance rod comprises a cross-section with a guide contour and a guidance contour complementary to the longitudinal guidance is present that forms a twist protection.
