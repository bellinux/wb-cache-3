5|$|In 1858, the {{government}} lifted the licensing <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number of performers, and Offenbach {{was able to}} present more ambitious works. His first full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), was presented in October 1858. Offenbach, as usual, spent freely on the production, with scenery by Gustave Doré, lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra.|$|E
5|$|In August 1957, the US assented to {{a two-year}} testing {{moratorium}} {{proposed by the}} Soviet Union, but required that it be linked to <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> production of fissionable material with military uses, a condition that the Soviet Union rejected. While Eisenhower insisted on linking a test ban to a broader disarmament effort (e.g., the production cut-off), Moscow insisted on independent consideration of a test ban.|$|E
5|$|Percy Bysshe Shelley was in Italy and did {{not hear}} of the {{massacre}} until 5 September.

5|$|The bay {{serves as}} a nursery for shrimp and as an {{ecosystem}} for diverse species of birds and fish. Shrimp farms have been established inland to circumvent <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bay. The area close to shore is prone to flooding, and can sometimes accumulate large populations of mosquitos. As a consequence, no major settlements have been founded on the bay. However, the small communities of Port Alto and Carancahua have been established on the western and eastern shores, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The long {{sentences}} of the Gun Court and its <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{rights of the}} accused {{have given rise to}} constitutional challenges, some of which have been appealed to the Privy Council in London. These cases have resulted in some modifications to the court, but have upheld it on the whole. The Gun Court system has also been the target of criticism because of its lengthy delay in hearing cases, and the continuing rise in gun violence since its adoption.|$|E
5|$|The {{privatisation}} {{of public}} assets was combined with financial deregulation {{in an attempt}} to fuel economic growth. Chancellor Geoffrey Howe abolished the UK's exchange controls in 1979, which allowed more capital to be invested in foreign markets, and the Big Bang of 1986 removed many <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> London Stock Exchange.|$|E

5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912.

It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
