25|$|Commentators {{have stated}} that one {{motivation}} to submit these reports may be to avoid identification by other states as having failed to implement ICCPR principles, or risk the embarrassment of being blacklisted. The publication of State Reports on the internet allows for individual access to a country's progress {{as well as the}} response from the HRC. Public accessibility to reports has been further aided with a United Nations General Assembly resolution (57/300) to make available in the UN information centre of each state, copies of recent state reports, summary records and concluding observations. This stigma that may result from non-compliance does not prevent some reports being excessively late, and in some cases, erroneous. The non-invasive nature of the process means the committee is precluded from enforce recommendations made during the <b>reporting</b> <b>process,</b> therefore the power lies with the state in deciding whether the observe these observations.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{and policymakers}} who address {{controversial}} safety-related {{issues have been}} targets of threats or violence {{for hundreds of years}} from those with strong feelings who wish to obstruct certain knowledge for the basis of evidence-based policy. More recently, researchers and their institutions have come under attack for work in the areas of firearms and motorcycle helmets. These sorts of things are known because they {{have been the subject of}} editorials in journals and even print and broadcast news stories. However, providers of scholarly information such as SafetyLit have also been harmed by those who disagree with part of its content. Some SafetyLit readers write letters to the agencies and organizations that provide funding for the project. Others take more extreme action to make their point. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have been made against the SafetyLit servers. Other attackers organized their interest groups to subscribe to the SafetyLit email service and then to label the SafetyLit messages as unsolicited spam by using their internet service providers' automated <b>reporting</b> <b>process.</b> This in an unsuccessful attempt to block all users of that ISP from receiving SafetyLit email messages.|$|E

2500|$|In the <b>reporting</b> <b>process,</b> {{challenges}} typically {{arise in}} delays of reporting or consideration, non-reporting. In its 2006 Annual Report, the committee listed {{a number of}} countries overdue in reporting, for example Gambia (21 years overdue) and Equatorial Guinea (17 years overdue) and the aforementioned duplication of report requirements among treaty bodies. In his September 2002 report the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on 'Strengthening the United Nations; an agenda for further change' suggests one solution to the duplication issue may be to streamline reports. As [...] "the content and timeliness of reports affects the quality of decision-making throughout the system" [...] delays are critical and therefore, standardisation of reporting requirements will provide an efficient system and improve the state <b>reporting</b> <b>process</b> overall. A further suggestion of Annan was for [...] "an integrated treatment of interrelated issues" [...] through a single document to address adherence to ratified treaties.|$|E

These collaborations have created a robust program of projects, benchmarking efforts, and research. Much of the research and focus on adverse events has been on medication errors–the most frequently reported adverse event for both adult and pediatric patients. It is also of interest to note that medication errors are also the most preventable type of harm that can occur within the pediatric population. It {{has been reported that}} when pediatric medication errors occur, these patients have a higher rate of death associated with the error than adult patients.

The schematics attempt to outline the steps of different <b>reporting</b> <b>processes.</b> The steps are depicted by basic flowchart shapes and icons. A box with special comments and a key with icons are displayed in the lower right corner of each schematic. The <b>reporting</b> <b>processes</b> presented are: • Summary (overview of all public health reporting) • Communicable Disease • HIV/AIDS • Nebraska Newborn Screening Program • Newborn Hearing Screening • Chronic Disease • Nebraska Cancer Registry • Nebraska Trauma Registry • Immunization The first schematic that is presented is the Summary Schematic which begins with each reporting entity and what health conditions or test they report. From there, the schematic shows how the health information is reported, to whom it is reported, and how the data are reported back to the community. The following schematics that are presented include specific <b>reporting</b> <b>processes.</b> These schematics first indicate the initial health condition or test and then who is reporting. The next steps that are displayed include to whom the health information is reported, how it is reported, and how the data are reported back to the community. The matrix reiterates the flow of health information from healthcare providers to the state and national programs. Information is displayed by columns that include which health information is reported, for whom the health condition is reported, who reports the required information, who receives the information, how it must be reported, how often is it sent, who reports the information to the partners, how the information is relayed back to the community, and what are the challenges to the <b>reporting</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
