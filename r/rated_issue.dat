5000|$|Reviewing Fear Itself: The Deep #1, Hunt {{opined that}} the book was not an {{essential}} tie-in. He criticized the destruction of New Atlantis, without any mention of Utopia, which was supported by New Atlantis. He also thought {{that the development of}} Namor, while potentially interesting, did not entirely work. Though he suggested that Defenders fans would enjoy the book's improvised incarnation of that team, and Lee Garbett's art clear and enjoyable, there was little to either complain about or distinguish it. Ray Tate gave the book 4 out of 5 bullets, however, finding the change in the Defenders roster engaging (Loa in particular), and beautifully characterized. Tate also liked the creative team's design of the demons, and their rendition of the cast and their heroics. Jesse Schedeen of IGN <b>rated</b> <b>issue</b> #1 of [...] "Mediocre" [...] 5.5 out 10, finding the characterization at times erratic, inaccurate and flat, in particular that of Namor and Attuma. While Schedeen thought Garbett's art was [...] "functional, if a little cramped" [...] in the underwater scenes, he perceived a sharp divide in quality between his cover and interior work, and the colors to be too dim.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the first}} issue, James Hunt of Comic Book Resources <b>rated</b> <b>issue</b> #1 {{four and a}} half out of five stars. Hunt called the issue [...] "technically strong", and praised the writing and art. He defended the absence of Peter Parker in the book, stating that the story's {{chronology}} and need to establish Miles and his supporting cast necessitated this, though he felt that story was over far too quickly, and would've benefited from a double-sized issue. Although Hunt noted that while Bendis paced Miles' origin story slowly enough that Miles does not yet appear in costume (much as Bendis had done with Peter Parker), he did so in order to emphasize character, which Hunt felt Bendis did well. Reviewing the same issue for Newsarama, David Pepose wrote that [...] "the biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us care about him, and care about him quickly. Even though we're still scratching the surface of what makes him tick, we're seeing the world through his eyes, and it's similar to Peter Parker's but a whole lot tougher. But that kind of Parker-style guilt — that neurotic, nearly masochistic tendency for self-sacrifice that comes with great power and greater responsibility — is still intact." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN wrote that [...] "Miles still feels like a bit of an outsider in his own book. Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles - his thoughts, motivations, personality quirks, and so forth. Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles." [...] Schedeen also opined that [...] "Miles occupies a more urban, racially diverse, and tense landscape. All the story doesn't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward. Miles is simply a character who speaks to a slightly different teen experience, and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter's." ...|$|E

It is recognized that these processes are mainly enzymatic in nature and involve proteolytic systems. Two concepts based on enzymatic biochemistry during meat aging are currently in explaining meat tenderness. Firstly, some researchers postulate that meat tenderization is affected mainly or solely by µ-calpain, a proteinase responsible for myofibrilar protein degradation. Secondly, others have suggested a hypothesis that tenderization is a multienzymatic process corresponding to apoptosis, where µ-calpain i...|$|E
