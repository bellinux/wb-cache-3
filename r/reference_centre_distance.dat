40|$|Overcut means tip {{interference}} of a pinion and {{an internal}} gear outside {{the line of}} action. Until 1969, the phenomenon was described by an involute theory with fixed centre distance, either kinematically [1. [...] 6] or geometrically [8]. The cutting process was neglected or confused with radial assembly. Inspired by a partly correct comment in [4], the mystery of tip interference [9] was solved by a study of interference at changing centre distance [10, 11]. Now, the theory includes the cutting process when the cutter moves in an arbitrary direction (oblique retraction). A <b>reference</b> <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> defines a cycloidal tip curve, whilst a conjugate centre distance defines the generated involute that recovers the excavation of the reference cycloid. The conjugation of centre distances provides an effective mathematical tool, which is developed into easy computation procedures...|$|E

40|$|The general goal of <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> is {{to support}} the community, from {{diagnostic}} laboratories to research institutions, in the execution of their work by providing reference strains and reagents and giving instructions and recommendations to individual colleagues and national and international organisations {{on a wide variety}} of issues. There are different levels of <b>reference</b> <b>centres,</b> from local to international, with an increasing package of tasks and responsibilities. Local <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> might limit activities to diagnostic confirmation by applying standard testing, while international <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> cover a wider range of activities from design, validation and harmonisation of diagnostic and reference technologies to international monitoring associated with recommendations on the global burden and distribution of leptospirosis and its prevention and control to national and international health decision makers. This chapter focusses on four major pillars constituting reference tasks in addition to the obvious provision of reference substances, i. e. Research and training, Diagnosis, Identification of Leptospira and Surveillance. Due to financial and organisational constraints, <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> are restricted in their capacity for basic research and consequently focus on applied research into various aspects of leptospirosis. They offer training, either individually or group-wise, that might vary from standard technologies to novel sophisticated methodologies, depending on the need and requests of the trainee. Most <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> are involved in the confirmation of preliminary diagnosis obtained at peripheral levels, such as local hospitals and health centres, while other major activities involve the design and validation of diagnostics, their international harmonisation and quality assurance. Identification of causative Leptospira strains (or serovars) is key to the identification of infection sources and is critical for surveillance. Hence, <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> also focus on the development, application and provision of methods that are required for unambiguous characterisation of new and recognised Leptospira strains and the maintenance of the integrity of strain collections. In line with their central role, <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> are frequently associated with local, national and/or international surveillance activities linked to an advisory role and the production of guidelines. Such surveillance activities usually comprise collation of morbidity and mortality data, signalling of outbreaks and the investigation of infection sources and risk...|$|R
40|$|Quietness and reliability, {{together}} with efficiency and lightweight design, are key requirements {{to compete in}} current mechanical industry. Within the latter, gearboxes {{play an important role}} as the usual choice to transmit mechanical power with high energy density, especially when using cylindrical involute gears. Noise and vibration performance are strongly influenced by tooth microgeometry modifications. Typical modifications are applied along the profile and the lead of the teeth. Profile modifications mainly compensate for tooth deflections; lead modifications mainly compensate for angular misalignments. Both modification types yield optimal performance at a given operating condition (e. g. nominal transmitted torque under ideal alignment), minimizing the meshing excitation. One key operating condition for the gear pair is represented by the instantaneous <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> between the gears. <b>Centre</b> <b>distance</b> variations affect mainly the pressure angle for the transmitted contact force, the total contact ratio and the active tooth height. Furthermore after a change in <b>centre</b> <b>distance,</b> the contacting surfaces on the tooth flanks shift with respect to each other; this yields a mismatch with respect to the theoretical start for the tooth profile modifications. A precision gear test rig, where operating conditions can be varied and tightly controlled, is used in this paper to evaluate the effects of <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> variations on the dynamic behaviour of a spur gear pair. The dynamic behaviour is characterized relying on the so-called Static Transmission Error (STE). Spectral analysis of the STE provides an indication of the internal excitation generated by gear meshing. Results show that the STE is sensitive to small changes in <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> (in the order of 0. 1 % of the nominal value). In particular, it is also observed that the transmitted torque for obtaining minimum STE peak to peak value changes significantly {{as a function of the}} <b>centre</b> <b>distance.</b> status: submitte...|$|R

40|$|In the 1990 s, the {{government}} of Senegal implemented a series of policy changes {{for the provision of}} family planning services through the public sector. A strategy to provide high quality services through <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> was adopted. This paper presents findings from a longitudinal survey of 1, 320 Senegalese women who had sought family planning services at ten public sector facilities- five <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> and five health centres. Information was collected on the quality of care they received at the time they adopted family planning. One thousand one hundred and ten of the respondents were followed up sixteen months later to ascertain their contraceptive status. The first principal finding was that attendees at <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> reported receiving relative better care than those who attended health centres. On average, clients at <b>reference</b> <b>centres</b> received 4. 3 out of five units of care, compared to 3. 8 units as reported by health centre clients. Second, multivariate analyses indicated that quality of care received at the time of adopting a contraceptive has a significant influence on subsequent contraceptive use.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} {{the rates of}} pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations and their determinants in children with chronic medical conditions. Patients and Methods Children with HIV infection, cystic fibrosis, liver transplantation and diabetes mellitus were enrolled. Physicians of regional <b>Reference</b> <b>Centres</b> for each condition, primary care paediatricians and caregivers of children provided information through specific questionnaires. For diabetes, 3 <b>Reference</b> <b>Centres</b> were included. Results Less than 25 % of children in each group received pneumococcal vaccination. Vaccination rates against influenza were 73 % in patients with HIV-infection, 90 % in patients with cystic fibrosis, 76 % in patients with liver transplantation, and ranged from 21 % to 61 % in patients with diabetes mellitus. <b>Reference</b> <b>Centres</b> rather than primary care paediatricians had {{a major role in}} promoting vaccinations. Lack of information was the main reason for missing vaccination. Awareness of the severity of pneumococcus infection by key informants of at-risk children was associated with higher vaccination rate. Conclusions Vaccination rates in children with chronic conditions were poor for pneumococcus and slightly better for influenza. Barriers to vaccination include lack of awareness, health care and organization problems. </p...|$|R
