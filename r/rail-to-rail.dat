50|$|The Davenport Diamond is an {{at-grade}} <b>rail-to-rail</b> {{crossing of}} the GO Barrie line and east-west CP Rail North Toronto subdivision tracks near Davenport Road in Toronto.

This process anticipates a start of construction in 2017.|$|E
50|$|Bullet Fins {{were invented}} in the 2005 by Ron Pettibone to {{increase}} surfboard hull planing and <b>rail-to-rail</b> transition speed. The patent-pending fins {{are based on}} 50 years of hydrodynamic research on the bulbous bow hull design. Just as with the bow of a ship, the traditional surfboard fin creates a wave as it displaces the water in its path. The resulting turbulence places drag on the surfboard. The bulb of the Bullet Fin reduces this drag by creating a new (primary) fin wave {{in front of the}} original (secondary) wave. This new bulb wave is designed to be nearly 180 degrees out of phase with the original fin wave to subtract its turbulence thus reducing fin drag.|$|E

50|$|GO TRIP's {{priority}} was augmenting the capacity {{and reliability of}} the existing GO rail network, but not substantively expanding the catchment area or adding new corridors. The majority of spending was allocated to reducing the interface between GO trains and growing volumes of Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Canadian National Railway (CN) freight traffic. This included <b>rail-to-rail</b> grade separations where GO's north-south lines cross east-west freight lines: the Snider Diamond, where the Barrie line had crossed the CN York Subdivision, was replaced by an overpass completed in June 2007; the Hagerman Diamond, where the Stouffville line had crossed the same CN line, was replaced by an underpass completed in November 2008.

5000|$|The {{peak-to-peak}} of a solid-state transformerless amplifier (most {{integrated circuit}} and discrete solid state circuits) {{is limited to}} the power supply voltage less a small amount that depends on the design of the circuit (especially the driver configuration) and the saturation voltage (Vce(sat) for bipolar transistors, or Rds(on) for Field Effect Transistors), and further reduced if the output stage does not have a quiescent DC output voltage set to half the supply voltage. For example, with a typical operational amplifier the Absolute Maximum Rating for the supply voltage is 36 volts, but a safe operating design supply voltage is 30 volts; if this was supplied as a perfectly balanced +15V and -15V then the theoretical peak output for an ideal <b>rail-to-rail</b> output opamp would be 15 Volts peak (10.6V RMS, 30V peak-to-peak), but a real-world opamp such as the 741 is likely to only be able to drive about 10 volts peak into loads above 2 kilohms, i.e. about 7.1V RMS).|$|E
