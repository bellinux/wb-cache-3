40|$|The {{concept of}} {{financial}} balances {{implies that the}} general government balance can be improved only if the enterprise sector and the foreign sector simultaneously increase their financial deficits and the household sector cuts its surplus. This paper explores how these adjustments can be influenced by economic policy during “a period of diminished expectations” (a period of weak GDP growth {{which is expected to}} persist for the coming years). Credit financed growth of private investment is unlikely to accelerate as capacity utilization rates are low. Increased spending by the foreign sector, which allows an export oriented growth strategy, could be dampened by simultaneous budget consolidation efforts of all European countries. Savings rates of private households have increased during the crisis. In order to reduce them various alternatives are discussed. Firstly, a credit financed housing bubble This has been practiced by some economies in recent years, but proved to be not sustainable. Secondly, a decline of unemployment rates and consequently of precautionary saving: During periods of low growth of GDP and employment, improvements in the employment elasticity of growth enhancing policy measures and <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> could be effective in this respect. Thirdly, incentives for upper income households to expand investment expenditures and cut back their savings.

However by reviewing those various arrangements one striking element has appeared : the abandoned parts of work almost always related to collective work. Either collective work was rationalised and reduced to a minimum, or the amount of time devoted to this type of work was the most reduced, or the reorganisation caused by this time reduction led to less stable and more transitory teams. It should be underlined, in addition, that, in many cases, this reduction was accompanied by a significant transformation of the forms of co-operation.

40|$|Manpower {{planning}} can be {{an important}} instrument to control shortages (or oversupply) within the health care labour market. The Netherlands is one of the countries that have a relative long tradition of manpower planning in health care. In 1973 the government introduced the numerus clausus for the study of medicine. From this moment on, it explored different approaches to plan health manpower. In 2001, a stock and flow model was developed to estimate the required number of General Practioners in training to meet the demand for care in The Netherlands. This model is based on realizing equilibrium in the target year based on assumptions and statistics about the demand and supply side of the health care labour market. At the supply side, trends are modelled for different cohorts of general practitioners (GPs), for example about their working hours. At the demand side, trends in the demand for health care services are projected, based on mostly demographic and epidemiological developments. Demand is basically measured as the total number of GPs needed and the supply as the total number of GPs available. The difference between required and available supply can be translated into an advice regarding the future number of GPs to be trained. Forecasting and planning results are presented in scenarios that vary on basic dimensions as high/low expected demand growth, high/low expected <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> average <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> high/low expected efficiency gains, resulting in a broad advice on the number of students to be trained. In this presentation we will show how the outcomes of different scenarios relate to the actual inflow of GPs in training.

The paper relies upon responses to questions on the 35 hours drawn from an original survey - carried out two years after the implementation of the first law - on the reconciliation between work and family life, using a representative sample of families recipient of family allowances. The survey also provides information about parents' perception of changes induced in the management of their daily life by the work time reduction. Six out of ten respondents reported a positive impact of the reduction on their work/family balance.

A idéia, conhecida como partilha do trabalho (work-sharing), é que a redução de jornada permitiria que o mesmo trabalho fosse repartido por mais trabalhadores. No entanto, a maior parte dos artigos contesta a base teórica e a observação empírica de ocorrência de partilha do trabalho. O objetivo deste artigo é estudar os efeitos da redução de jornada prescrita pela Constituição de 1988, de 48 para 44 horas por semana, sobre o mercado de trabalho no Brasil. Os resultados do exercício empírico mostram que as alterações da Constituição, referentes à jornada de trabalho, provocaram uma queda da jornada efetiva de trabalho, não aumentaram a probabilidade de o trabalhador afetado pela mudança ficar desempregado em 1989 (quando comparada a outros anos), diminuíram a probabilidade de o trabalhador afetado de ficar sem emprego em 1989 (o que inclui os que saíram da força de trabalho) e implicaram um aumento do salário real horário (apesar de menor do que o observado para trabalhadores que reduziram a jornada em outros anos).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the author wishes to}} discuss {{some of the}} {{hypotheses}} which seek to explain the "law of the development stages" (or Clark-law). &# 13; In a situation where the productive sector appears to be more and more influenced by tertiarization phenomena (at least in the developed countries), the author examines the causes of what happened. &# 13; The author concludes that the explanations of the development of the tertiary sector are mainly based on the needs (true or supposed) to which this sector answers. There is, instead, little or no discussion on the constraints that the goods (products of the primary and secondary sector) and the services (products of the tertiary sector) impose to their purchaser. These could be the real cause of the changes in the demand of households and firms. &# 13; The author remarks that, due to their tangibility, the goods impose a particular constraint to their purchaser (both in the case when the purchase is made for consumption or capital expansion). &# 13; This constraint is not adequately stressed at the microeconomic level and is represented by the need for an adequate space. &# 13; In fact the purchaser of a good must allocate it in a space which is under his control; otherwise he can loose the property of it. This physical space could be his own fridge (or, in the limit, his own stomach) if the good is food. It could also be the living room if the good is a TV set. It could finally be a building if the good is a machinery. &# 13; The purchase of services, in contrast, does not impose any space constraint, but a constraint upon time. The user, to be such, needs an adequate time to benefit from it. &# 13; In this way the author poses the foundations for a revised consumption theory. In fact, according to the previous considerations, the consumer would split his endowment into goods purchases and service purchases, (by assuming no saving) considering his own time and space constraints. &# 13; In the long run it has been noticed a remarkable increase of leisure time by the consumers, (as a consequence <b>of</b> the dramatic <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>working</b> <b>time)</b> whereas to some phenomenon has not been observed for the disposable space. &# 13; The author concludes that the "constraint-system" has produced (through the mechanism described above) a shift of the demand from goods to services and, as a consequence, a real phenomenon of tertiarization of the economy from the supply-side. &# 13; On the other hand the phenomenon of tertiarization originates not only from changes within the household sector, but also from processes generated within the firm sector. In fact the effect of a time-saving technological development (keeping the product constant) can induce the enterpreneur to increase the production by purchasing more machinery. In this case it is not unlikely to observe the need for additional space to allocate the new durables. &# 13; Together with (or alternatively to) the acquisition of more durables, the enterpreneur could be induced (to face competition, for reasons connected with the organization, for lack of space and so on) to use the resources which are free in order to increase e. g the quality or the distribution of the product by using e. g engineering services or marketing services or other. &# 13; In this way the possibility of an acceleration of the development of the tertiary connected to production is generated. This could take place either implicitly, that is contained within the primary and secondary sector, or explicitly. &# 13; This phenomenon could be considered as another cause of the development of the tertiary sector...|$|R
