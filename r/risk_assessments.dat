Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological <b>risk</b> <b>assessments</b> have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes.

This research aimed to explore how service users experience <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> in the context of developing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship in a Community Mental Health Recovery Service.
