6000|$|... "Just {{after ten}} I touched {{the lower edge}} of the upper cloud-stratum. It {{consisted}} of fine diaphanous vapour drifting swiftly from the westward. The wind had been steadily rising all this time and it was now blowing a sharp breeze--twenty-eight an hour by my gauge. Already it was very cold, though my altimeter only marked nine thousand. The engines were working beautifully, and we went droning steadily upwards. The cloud- bank was thicker than I had expected, but at last it thinned out into a golden mist before me, and then in an instant I had shot out from it, {{and there was an}} unclouded sky and a brilliant sun above my head--all blue and gold above, all shining silver below, one vast glimmering plain as far as my eyes could reach. It was a quarter past ten o'clock, and the barograph needle pointed to twelve thousand eight hundred. Up I went and up, my ears concentrated upon the deep purring of my motor, my eyes busy always with the watch, the <b>revolution</b> <b>indicator,</b> the petrol lever, and the oil pump. No wonder aviators are said to be a fearless race. With so many things to think of there is no time to trouble about oneself. About this time I noted how unreliable is the compass when above a certain height from earth. At fifteen thousand feet mine was pointing east and a point south. The sun and the wind gave me my true bearings.|$|E

50|$|The Morris Ten Six Special sports {{displayed}} at Olympia in October 1933 {{had a long}} bonnet with a strap, louvred valances by the frame without running boards, low-sloping or cutaway doors, and a flared back with a low tail. Its chassis was as the Ten Six with twin carburettors, a special radiator with stone-guard, spring steering wheel, special speedometer and <b>revolution</b> <b>indicator,</b> remote gearbox control, two horns, an electric petrol pump and automatic ignition advance.|$|E
50|$|The {{chartroom}} {{was located}} on the main deck. It contained the chart table, a casual berth and a second steering position. On the forward bulkhead a navigational switchboard was fitted, which included a duplicate set of engine <b>revolution</b> <b>indicators,</b> switches for the navigation lights, clear view screens and the “action-stations” alarm.|$|R
50|$|Despite a 100 {{percent rise}} in average annual oil income since the <b>revolution,</b> most <b>indicators</b> of {{economic}} welfare have steadily deteriorated. … Average inflation {{in the years after}} the revolution has been at least twice as high as during the 1970s, unemployment has been three times higher, and economic growth is two-thirds lower. As a result, Iran's per capita income has declined by at least 30 percent since 1979. By official admission, more than 15 percent of the population now lives below the absolute poverty line, and private estimates run as high as 40 percent.|$|R
5000|$|In early vessels, {{from the}} 19th century until about 1950, the device usually {{consisted}} of a round dial about nine inches (~20 centimetres) in diameter with a knob at the center attached {{to one or more}} handles, and an indicator pointer {{on the face of the}} dial. There would also be a <b>revolutions</b> per minute <b>indicator,</b> worked by a hand crank. Modern E.O.T.s on vessels which still use them use electronic light and sound signals.|$|R
30|$|The {{temperature}} and relative humidity {{of the experiment}} environment were 28 ° and 70 % respectively. The engine was warmed up for 30  min before the 90  min driving experiment through which the engine driving characteristics and exhaust elements were measured. Data sampling was conducted at every minute. Since the experimental engine had a speed governor, the speed setting was adjusted to the full so that the rated revolution per minute of the crank shaft could be maintained {{to the level of}} 3600  rpm, with the load of the dynamometer manually controlled. The engine speed was measured by means of the <b>revolution</b> <b>indicator</b> TDP- 3321 A-E (Coco Research Co.). The torque at the cam shaft of the engine was measured by means of the dynamometer. For the measurement of exhaust temperature, O 2, CO 2, NO, NO 2 and NOx, HT- 2300 (HODAKA Co.) was utilized.|$|E
25|$|That the {{government}} still displays such heightened sensitivities around the Cultural <b>Revolution</b> is an <b>indicator</b> {{that it still}} considers itself, at least in part, an inheritor of its legacy. The government is apprehensive that academic probing and popular discussions will lead to ideological conflict and increase social instability. It may threaten the foundations of Communist rule. The focus of the Chinese government on maintaining political and social stability has been a top priority since the Tiananmen crackdown on reformers on June 4, 1989, and the current government {{has no interest in}} re-evaluating any issue that might lead to a split in the Chinese leadership, or which might polarize the Party on ideological grounds.|$|R

This includes a ship's wheel, the ship's <b>revolutions</b> per minute <b>indicator,</b> engine telegraphs, and communications gear. A mannequin is visible in this photo. A portion of a small viewing port is visible at the back of the space. The outer shell of the Conning Tower consists of 17 inches of solid steel armor, designed to resist the impact of a 1-ton shell. The door for this entrance (not shown) weighs more than a ton. Seen at the Battleship New Jersey, on the Delaware River in Camden, New Jersey.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to compare the data such as {{government}} effectiveness, voice of accountability, and corruption indexes of the Kyrgyz Republic and Georgia as a consequence of political instability or revolution. The purpose of the country selection was due to their common similarities such as: they both are CIS countries, they both went through a revolution, and the degree of their economies are almost the same. Special attention is given to the reasons of the revolution in these countries as an important fact in the history of the countries. While comparing we can see that the data indicators of both Kyrgyzstan and Georgia were approximately the same in the period of <b>revolution.</b> However, these <b>indicators</b> also show that there was a positive and negative change after the revolution. revolution, corruption, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan...|$|R
40|$|The 1960 s and 1970 s were {{critical}} {{years in the}} development of American fiber art. One of the major and most exciting centers of change was California. This paper will look at California’s transforming role in the fiber <b>revolution.</b> One noteworthy <b>indicator</b> of change in fiber art was the series of twelve exhibitions entitled California Design. They were held at the Pasadena Art Museum from 1954 to 1971 and at another venue in 1976. Exhibition catalogs were published for the last five exhibitions (1962, 1965, 1968, 1971 and 1976). The catalog pages document the movement within the fiber area - away from functional textiles and towards two dimensional wall pieces and sculpture, from design to fine art. For this presentation, the work presented in the catalogs is juxtaposed with social and political events in California and those in the field of fiber art to provide context...|$|R
