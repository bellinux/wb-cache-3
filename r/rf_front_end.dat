40|$|Circuit {{boards that}} contain {{radio-frequency}} (RF) and digital circuitry {{have been developed}} by NASA to satisfy a requirement of the Port of Houston Authority for relatively inexpensive Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers that indicate the azimuthal headings {{as well as the}} positions of ships. The receiver design utilizes the unique architecture of the Mitel commercial chip-set, which provides for an accurate GPS-based heading-determination device. The major components include two <b>RF</b> <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> (each connected to a separate antenna), a surface-acoustic-wave intermediate-frequency filter between second- and third-stage mixers, a correlator, and a reduced-instruction- set computer. One of the <b>RF</b> <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> operates as a master, the other as a slave. Both <b>RF</b> <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> share a 10 -MHz sinusoidal clock oscillator, which provides for more accurate carrier phase measurements between the two antennas. The outputs of the <b>RF</b> <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> are subjected to conventional GPS processing. The commercial-based chip-set design approach provides an inexpensive open architecture GPS platform, which can be used in developing and implementing unique GPS-heading and attitude-determination algorithms for specific applications. The heading is estimated from the GPS position solutions of the two antennas by an algorithm developed specifically for this application. If a third (and preferably a fourth) antenna were added, {{it would be possible to}} estimate the attitude of the GPS receiver in three dimensions instead of only its heading in a horizontal plane...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The use {{of direct}} RF {{sampling}} has been explored {{as a means}} of designing multifrequency <b>RF</b> <b>front</b> <b>ends.</b> Such <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> will be useful to multifrequency RF applications such as global navigation satellite system receivers that use global positioning system (GPS) L 1, L 2, and L 5 signals and Galileo signals. The design of a practical multifrequency direct <b>RF</b> sampling <b>front</b> <b>end</b> is dependent on having an analog-to-digital converter whose input bandwidth accommodates the highest carrier frequency and whose maximum sampling frequency is more than twice the cumulative bandwidth about the multiple carrier signals. The principle of direct RF sampling is used to alias all frequency bands of interest onto portions of the Nyquist bandwidth that do not overlap. This paper presents a new algorithm that finds the minimum sampling frequency that avoids overlap. This design approach requires a multifrequency bandpass filter for the frequency bands of interest. A prototype <b>front</b> <b>end</b> has been designed, built, and tested. It receives a GPS coarse/acquisition code at the L 1 frequency and GPS antispoofing precision code at both L 1 and L 2. Dual-frequency signals with received carrier-to-noise ratios in excess of 52 dB-Hz have been acquired and tracked using this system.
