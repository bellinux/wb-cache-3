40|$|Japanese is {{a complex}} {{language}} that requires not only grammatical understanding but also also social understanding in order to <b>reach</b> <b>fluency.</b> Due to this, native Japanese speakers employ a complex blend of verbal and nonverbal cues in every conversation they hold. The verbal cues are particularly important to understand, as they often times become indicators of not only {{the nature of the}} relationship between two people, but also the characteristics of both the speaker and listener. Without an understanding of these concepts,reaching fluency in Japanese is nearly impossible. This research will explore the relationship between Japanese proficiency in Japanese language learners and and native-like understanding of speaking norms and speaker perceptions...|$|E

40|$|Through {{the long}} {{exploration}} of reading in SLA, metacognitive strategies {{have been found}} to facilitate the process from decoding to understanding, to <b>reaching</b> <b>fluency</b> in reading. One of these investigated metacognitive strategies, reading aloud, also involves another realization of a word, i. e. its spoken form, but the relationship between the use of reading aloud and its effect on the oral fluency in L 2 has not been investigated and documented as of yet. This paper presents and discusses a research study that examined the effect of reading aloud on second language oral fluency in adult learners of English. After presenting the theoretical basis for this focus, i. e. a gap in the literature, I hypothesized that learners who use the reading aloud strategy will exhibit the occurrence of a parallel increase in both oral reading fluency and oral fluency in their second language and that the result of the continuous use of reading aloud will result in the increase in the oral fluency. The results which were obtained through the study showed thought-provoking patterns that suggest the significance and pedagogical applications of reading aloud. Department of EnglishThesis (M.

50|$|Fedele {{was born}} in Venice in 1465 to Barbara Leoni and Angelo Fedele. While Fedele does not mention her mother in her writings, we have {{evidence}} that her father was respected among the aristocracy and took {{a great interest in}} his daughter's learning. When Fedele <b>reached</b> <b>fluency</b> in Greek and Latin at the age of twelve, she was sent by her father to Gasparino Borro, a Servite monk, who tutored her in classical literature, philosophy, the sciences, and dialectics. In 1487, at twenty-two years of age, she achieved success in Italy and abroad when she delivered a Latin speech in praise of the arts and sciences at her cousin's graduation at Padua. Her speech, Oratio pro Bertucio Lamberto, was published in Modena (1487), Venice (1488), and Nuremberg (1489). From 1487 to 1497, she exchanged letters with prominent humanists and nobles throughout Spain and Italy. One of these correspondents, Isabella I of Castile, urged Fedele to join her court in Spain. Fedele declined the invitation, writing that she could not go while Italy was at war with France. However, Fedele's early biographers believed that the doge Agostino Barbarigo would not allow Fedele to leave Italy, although {{there is no evidence of}} such a decree.|$|R

50|$|Sheltered Instruction, also {{referred}} to as SDAIE in California, is a teaching style founded on the concept of providing meaningful instruction in the content areas (social studies, math, science) for transitioning Limited English Proficient (LEP) students towards higher academic achievement while they <b>reach</b> English <b>fluency.</b> This method type is often used in mainstream secondary classrooms where the students have a foundation of English education. A variety of instruction is used including the theories of Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development. Instead of providing watered down curriculum for LEP student, sheltered instruction allows for the content to be equal to that of native English speakers while improving their grasp of the language. The teacher provides varied methods of instruction that allow students to create meaning of multifaceted content in classroom discussion, activities, reading and writing. Teachers call on a number of different instruction methods {{such as the use of}} socialization practices to allow the content to be more accessible.|$|R

An additional source of dark signal in electron irradiated devices was observed and explained by impact ionization by holes, released by tunneling from defect states near the Si-SiO 2 interface. A model for the CTE in a two-phase CCD as a function of temperature, background charges and clock timing is described.

40|$|Focal adhesions {{are highly}} ordered {{assemblies}} of transmembrane receptors, extracellular matrix proteins, {{and a large}} number of cytoplasmic proteins, including structural proteins, as well as tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, and their substrates. They are now accepted as a prime component of signal transduction. Because focal adhesions also {{play an important role in}} cell morphology and migration, it can be argued that their presence is indicative of healthy cells. This has been the reason for several research groups to conclude that biomaterials sustaining focal adhesion assembly are biocompatible. In this study we demonstrate that cells under cytotoxic stress may still be able to retain their focal adhesions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells at passage 2 were exposed to nickel and zinc ion solutions ranging from 1 to 0. 01 mM for 4 and 24 h. Cells were seeded on fibronectin precoated glass slides or in tissue culture quality 96 -well plates. MTT conversion with 1 and 0. 5 mM nickel and zinc was strongly depressed, indicating that these concentrations are cytotoxic. Proliferative activity was also affected by these concentrations. Cells exposed to zinc typically retracted and detached from the surface, whereas cells exposed to nickel remained on the surface without signs of retraction. Nevertheless, cells exposed to nickel were impaired to <b>reach</b> con <b>fluency,</b> which was determined by cadherin- 5 expression. All these data indicate that nickel ions at a sufficient concentration influence cells in a cytotoxic way. Despite this apparent cytotoxicity, focal adhesion distribution as visualized by immunofluorescence staining of vinculin was not affected. With zinc the morphological changes were accompanied by apparent fusion of focal adhesions during retraction and finally dissolution. These data indicate that the mere presence of focal adhesions does not allow a reliable statement about the functional status of a fell. On the other hand, when focal adhesions are affected it is an excellent monitor of disturbed cell function. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Low energy {{ion beam}} {{irradiation}} proved {{itself to be}} suitable technique to alter chemical and physical properties of polymer surfaces. Spin coated thin films and commercial sheets of polymers were irradiated with argon, nitrogen and oxygen ions at energies of 0. 5 – 5 keV in the fluence range from 10 E 12 to 10 E 16 cm- 2. When ion interacts with polymer surface, chain bonds are broken resulting {{in the formation of}} smaller molecules, many of which may be volatile that are desorbed. At the same time, formed free radicals participate in different reactions during which the chemistry of polymer surfaces is easily and irreversibly changed resulting in alteration of polymer surface properties. Polymer sputter rates were found to depend on polymer chemistry and ion beam parameters. The sputter rates of polymers decreased strongly with the ion fluence, followed by constant removal rate in the steady-state region. The decrease of typically one order of magnitude was attributed to the chemical changes in polymer structure that occurred in the ion fluence range 10 E 13 – 10 E 15 cm- 2 depending on polymer chemistry, ion energy and type. Induced changes in the polymer surface layer showed large influence on metal/polymer adhesion properties. Three types of practical adhesion strength, measured using 90 ° peel test, were observed: (i) adhesion increased with the ion fluence until saturation was reached; (ii) peel strength increased at low ion <b>fluencies,</b> <b>reached</b> maximum and at prolonged treatment decreased; (iii) no improvement in the peel strength on treated polymer surfaces was recorded. XPS analysis of peeled-off surfaces showed that in most cases the failure location changed from interfacial for untreated polymers to cohesive failure in the polymer for treated surfaces. An improvement in the metal polymer adhesion in the ion fluence range 10 E 13 – 10 E 16 cm- 2 is attributed {{to the creation of a}} large density of new adsorption sites resulting in larger contact area and incorporation of chemically active groups that lead to the increased interaction between metal and polymer through metal-oxygen/nitrogen-polymer species formation...|$|R
