5|$|During 1943, Bulleid began {{planning}} for the post-war locomotive requirements of the railway and identified {{the need for a}} stop-gap steam locomotive design for those main lines in South East England scheduled for electrification, had the Second World War not taken place. Although the new Merchant Navy class was available for the heaviest Continental expresses, the resumption of frequent passenger services over poorly maintained infrastructure, following the war, would require a lighter locomotive with wider <b>route</b> <b>availability.</b>|$|E
5|$|The N1s {{compared}} favourably {{with the}} Nclass, although the type showed little improvement in performance. More {{of the class}} were built {{when it became clear}} that the type's smaller cylinders provided greater <b>route</b> <b>availability.</b> A total of six engines were built. The N1class was primarily used on the Eastern section of the Southern Railway network, and used by the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) from 1948. The N1s gave valuable service until they were withdrawn in 1962. None were preserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebuilding}} solved most of {{the maintenance}} problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on the track, a complaint that was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their <b>route</b> <b>availability,</b> meaning {{that they could not}} be used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, the Southern Railway {{ordered a}} final batch of 15 {{locomotives}} (Nos.14001414) to expand class availability on the Southern Railway's network. These were built at Ashford works and {{differed from the}} previous 65 {{in a number of}} ways. The cabs of the final eight locomotives (Nos.14071414) were fitted for left-hand driving, which was adopted as standard by the Southern Railway. The original Nclass chimney was replaced with the lower-profile version used on the U1class, which increased <b>route</b> <b>availability</b> by allowing the locomotives to pass under lower bridges and tunnels. Maunsell had begun to research smoke deflection techniques to improve driver visibility on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927, which resulted in the adoption of a standard smoke deflector design for the Southern Railway. A smaller version was fitted to Nos.14001414 during building.|$|E
5|$|The Clan Class {{was based}} upon the Britannia Class design, {{incorporating}} a smaller boiler and various weight-saving measures to increase the <b>route</b> <b>availability</b> of a Pacific-type locomotive for its intended area of operations, the west of Scotland. The Clan Class received a mixed reception from crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving favourable reports as regards performance. However, trials {{in other areas of}} the British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive made it hard to adhere to timetables. Reports exist that suggest a degree of the disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they were only a Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell in 1914 to provide a sturdy mixed-traffic locomotive with high <b>route</b> <b>availability.</b> Intended to replace several obsolete 0-6-0 types, the Nclass {{was the first step}} in the SECR's fleet standardisation programme, which also included the Kclass 2-6-4T passenger tank locomotive. Maunsell enlisted the help of former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft, who suggested that a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement would allow the class to run on the poor-quality track in north Kent. This arrangement allowed for a longer wheelbase with leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on tight track curves, which had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR. A longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than an 0-6-0, giving the Nclass sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Railway was {{primarily}} a passenger-carrying railway which used most of its resources to extend its electrified lines. There was a continuing need for steam freight locomotives however, although the Traffic Department preferred mixed traffic designs which could also haul passenger trains on the remaining non-electrified lines at peak periods. By the late 1930s the Southern Railway was adequately served with powerful mixed traffic locomotives of the S15 and N and N1 classes, {{but there was a}} need for a smaller freight locomotive with high <b>route</b> <b>availability</b> that could also undertake light passenger duties. This role had been performed by the ex-LSWR 'Jubilee' A12 0-4-2, which were approaching the end of their useful lives.|$|E
5|$|The offset boiler {{and coal}} bunker caused the locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's <b>route</b> <b>availability</b> during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's cab. To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank and coal chute and therefore away from the hot gases circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E

40|$|Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMSs) are {{characterized}} by concurrency, resource sharing, routing flexibility, limited buffer sizes, and variety of lot sizes. The sharing of resources and the limitations on buffer sizes may lead to deadlock situations. One {{of the most challenging}} problems in FMSs design and operation is to assign the shared resources to jobs efficiently and without causing deadlocks. To date, little has been done to achieve deadlock-free scheduling in FMSs. In this research a new efficient scheduling algorithm for finding an optimal or near-optimal deadlock-free schedule was developed based on the depth-first and backtracking search technique. Two efficient truncation techniques and three heuristic functions were developed and tested using several randomly generated case studies. The performance of flexible manufacturing systems that exhibits deadlocks was analyzed under different levels of routing flexibility and other factors using Petri Nets. It was expected that routing flexibility would complicate the Petri Net model and create new deadlocks, which in turn could negatively affect the system performance. The results showed that increasing routing flexibility improves the system performance, measured by average flow time, in systems exhibiting deadlocks. A novel heuristic deadlock-free rescheduling algorithm based on Petri Nets was developed {{in order to deal with}} machine breakdowns in real-time. It guarantees a deadlock-free new schedule and relies on local rather than global rescheduling. The existence of alternative <b>routes,</b> <b>availability</b> of material handling facilities, and the limitations of buffer capacities were considered. In conclusion, the thesis introduces an integrated approach for production scheduling, control and performance evaluation of flexible manufacturing systems that exhibit deadlocks. The first part takes care of optimizing the performance of the manufacturing system, by generating optimal or near optimal schedules, and avoiding the deadlock situations in the same time. The second part could be used in answering the questions of the what-if analysis. Finally, the third part maintains the production control in real-time.

40|$|Abstract: The biggest {{challenge}} in MANETs {{is to find}} most efficient routing due to the changing topology and to reduce the energy consumption. Existing routing protocols may not perform well during difficult conditions like poor link quality and high mobility. In this paper, a new routing method based on link quality and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is proposed for MANETs. It {{has been found that}} Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a special kind of optimization technique which is highly suitable for finding the adaptive routing for such type of volatile network. To enhance the routing algorithm a new link quality metric is defined to handle the link quality between nodes to evaluate routes. The residual energy of the node is a key factor, which {{plays an important role in}} determining the lifetime of the network and hence it is taken as one of the metric in the <b>route</b> selection. <b>Availability</b> of a good estimation of link longevity between neighbouring nodes could permit the selection of a more stable route, thus enabling a better implementation of quality of service (QoS) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{flagship}} {{train on}} the Northern Pacific Railway ("NP") main line was the North Coast Limited, which had begun running in 1900. Its running mate since 1952 was the Mainstreeter, which operated on a slower schedule with fewer amenities. The Northern Pacific main line mirrored {{that of its}} great rival, the Great Northern Railway ("GN"), running through southern Montana and North Dakota. Even after the merger of the NP, GN, and Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad ("CB") into the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970, service continued on both the ex-Northern Pacific and ex-Great Northern. When passenger service was transferred to Amtrak, the new provider chose the Great Northern's Empire Builder as its Chicago–Pacific Northwest route. Amtrak based this decision on several factors, including the overall higher speed of the ex-Great Northern <b>route</b> and better <b>availability</b> of alternative transportation options along the ex-Northern Pacific.|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} {{proposals}} {{as to the}} precise route, and so the canal engineer Robert Whitworth was asked to survey a route. By the time he reported back in September 1793, the route started from the Kennet and Avon Canal at Freshford near Limpley Stoke, rather than Bath, and having passed through Stalbridge, headed for Blandford rather than Wareham. The new <b>route</b> reflected the <b>availability</b> of water to supply the canal. Whitworth was busy and recommended that the projectors of the scheme should employ William Bennet of Frome as engineer. Bennet completed a detailed survey in 1795, estimating {{that the cost of}} the canal would be about £200,000, and the projectors approved most of his plan at a meeting in July. Short branches to Hamworthy and Wareham were added to the scheme, and the proposed junction with the Kennet and Avon Canal was later moved to Widford.|$|R
25|$|The AA {{class was}} {{gradually}} made redundant by {{the delivery of}} large numbers of 4-6-0 locomotives of the new Dd and A2 classes between 1902 and 1922, which eventually totalled 446 locomotives.

25|$|The {{second of}} William Adam's 0-4-4 designs, the O2 Class was a {{development}} {{of his previous}} T1 class of 1888. The brief behind the design {{was to create a}} locomotive capable of mixed-traffic operations, a characteristic dictated by the relatively small wheel diameter and smaller cylinders, effectively to replace the obsolete Beattie Well Tank. As a result, a compact locomotive with high <b>route</b> <b>availability</b> was produced, a factor that would be essential during the later career of the class.|$|E
25|$|All {{locomotives}} were inherited by British Railways in 1948, {{and from}} 1955, {{several members of}} the class received new chimneys of the British Railways Standard Class 4 variety and replacement cylinders, which had become worn through intensive use. No major redesign of the front-end of the U1 class was required, with all the steam passages fully streamlined as a result of experience with the previous five Maunsell designs. The U1 Class members working on the Hastings route were subjected to excess flange wear because of the tight curves, a problem also experienced when used on the network west of Exeter, when the aging T9 class 4-4-0 locomotives designed by Dugald Drummond were finally withdrawn from service in the early 1960s. The locomotive crews of the area took a dislike to the U1 in preference to the smaller-wheeled N class, which performed better on the steeper gradients found {{in this part of the}} railway network. With the electrification of the Kentish main lines of the Eastern section, the amount of work that required the U1 class' <b>route</b> <b>availability</b> advantage was reduced, and the class was congregated at Stewarts Lane shed in London. The majority of the class was withdrawn from service in 1962, with the final three (including the prototype) gone by June 1963, outlasting their N1 class siblings by one year. Having been replaced by Bulleid’s Light Pacifics, no members of the U1 class were preserved.|$|E

As long as biomass mainly contains carbohydrates, subcritical hydrothermal conversion products and their wastes will be fundamentally analogous to those displaying cellulose.

Using DSR, the network is completely self-organizing and self-configuring, requiring no existing network infrastructure or administration. The Internet draft defines DSR. The protocol allows each MANET node to have multiple routes in the route chache. However, it does not specifiy a mechnism to prioritize those routes. In this paper, we will set up a performance model to optimize the route selection mechanism by relabeling ad hoc <b>routes</b> with the <b>availability</b> metrics derived from imortant factors.

Fourteen of the 38 C-terminal toxin A repeats (14 CDTA) were cloned into pTECH- 1 in frame with the immunogenic fragment C of tetanus toxin (TETC) to generate plasmid p 56 TETC. Expression of the TETC- 14 CDTA fusion protein was driven from the anaerobically inducible nirB promoter within attenuated Salmonella typhimurium BRD 509 (aroA aroD). The TETC- 14 CDTA fusion protein was purified and shown to bind to known toxin A receptors found on the surface of rabbit erythrocytes. Intranasal (i. n.) and intragastric (i. g.) immunization with 107 and 1010 CFU, respectively, of BRD 509 (p 56 TETC) generated significant (P < 0. 05) anti-toxin A serum responses after a single dose.

In Pakistan, school safety and preparedness is still a choice, rather than a mandatory requirement for all schools. But schools in Pakistan do {{have a responsibility to}} keep safe the students in their care, especially during and after the catastrophic events. This implies the need to maintain the environment in and around school property, so as to minimize the impacts of floods and to have the mechanisms in place to maximize a school’s resilience. This study examined the emergency preparedness activities of 20 schools in four districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province that had recently been severely affected by floods. Through face to face interviews and a structured questionnaire (n[*]=[*] 100) we collected data on the four pillars of emergency preparedness: emergency planning, preparation measures, safe school facilities, and hazard education and training. The study revealed {{that the majority of the}} sample schools had experienced more than one natural hazard-induced disaster, predominantly flooding, yet despite this had not undertaken adequate emergency preparedness activities. There are particular gaps with regard to plans for students with disabilities, the continuity of school operations after a disaster, the presence of maps to identify evacuation <b>routes,</b> the <b>availability</b> of emergency equipment and resources, disaster preparedness guidelines, and psychological first aid and crisis counseling.
