40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to model the impact of cross-coupling noise on interconnect delay. We introduce a new linear driver model that accurately models the noise pulse induced on a switching signal net due to cross coupling capacitance. The proposed model effectively captures the non-linear behavior of the victim driver gate during the transition and has an average error below 8 % whereas the traditional approach using a Thevenin model incurs an average error of 48 %. We also discuss the worst case alignment of the aggressor net transitions with respect to the victim net transition, emphasizing the need to maximize not merely the delay of the interconnect alone but the combined delay of the interconnect and <b>receiver</b> <b>gate.</b> We show that the worst case alignment of an aggressor net transition {{is a function of the}} <b>receiver</b> <b>gate</b> output loading, victim transition edge rate, and th...|$|E

The input signal is gated to a transducer 26 by a transmitter gate 25 to produce ultrasonic waves in the sample 28. The resulting ultrasonic echoes are converted into electrical signals by the transducer and then gated into the spectrum analyzer by <b>receiver</b> <b>gate</b> 29. This arrangement produces spectra that are equivalent to shock-exciting the transducer with a true delta function shock-excitation...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{ultrasonic}} frequency analysis is introduced which employs frequency-tracked gated RF drive pulses rather than shock-excited broadband spikes {{to generate the}} ultrasonic waveform. The new technique, {{a variation of the}} sampled-continuous wave technique, eliminates problems associated with finite pulse widths of conventional methods. It is shown to yield correct ultrasonic wave velocity measurements of the sample irrespective of <b>receiver</b> <b>gate</b> width or position provided any portions of two successive echoes are gated simultaneously into the spectrum analyzer. The experimental observations are substantiated by a theoretical model based on the time-frequency domain formulation of ultrasonic frequency analysis...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} power supply {{integrity}} on a design {{has become a}} critical issue, not only for functional verification, but also for performance verification. Traditional analysis has typically applied a worst case voltage drop at all points along a circuit path {{which leads to a}} very conservative analysis. We also show that in certain cases, the traditional analysis can be optimistic, since it ignores the possibility of voltage shifts between driver and <b>receiver</b> <b>gates.</b> In this paper, we propose a new analysis approach for computing the maximum path delay under power supply fluctuations. Our analysis is based on the use of superposition, both spatially across different circuit blocks, and temporally in time. We first present an accurate model of path delay variations under supply drops, considering both the effect of local supply reduction at individual gates and voltage shifts between driver/receiver pairs. We then formulate the path delay maximization problem as a constrained linear optimization problem, considering the effect of both IR drop and LdI/dt drops. We show how correlations between currents of different circuit blocks can be incorporated in this formulation using linear constraints. The proposed methods were implemented and tested on benchmark circuits, including an industrial power supply grid and we demonstrate a significant improvement in the worst-case path delay increase. ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{algorithms}} {{are available}} for SAR data processing {{and it has been}} shown that they lead to acceptable results in standard situations. However, processing of SAR data is a very difficult task if high resolution is to be achieved in spotlight mode with a large squint angle. In this case the echoes of a scene span a wide range area and the storage in a rectangular data field is inefficient. This paper presents an extended range migration algorithm which solves the problem by an adaptation of the <b>receiver</b> range <b>gate.</b> Then, the signal can be described in modified range and wave number components leading to a reduction of the memory requirement. Because of the limitation of the processed data to the scene echoes the processing efficiency increases. Beside the theoretical presentation of the new method the applicability is shown using simulated data...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} method to capture crosstalk-induced noisy {{waveform}} for crosstalk-aware static timing analysis. The effects of capacitive coupling noise on timing are conventionally measured as delay variation. On the other hand, the propose method derives an equivalent waveform to a crosstalk-induced noisy waveform. The crosstalk effects on timing are all included in the equivalent waveform. With the derived equivalent waveform, we can perform static timing analysis with consideration of dynamic delay variation due to crosstalk noise. The equivalent waveform is derived by our improved least square fitting with weighting coefficient. Our method can naturally consider the slew variation due to crosstalk noise {{as well as the}} delay variation. We experimentally verify that our method can estimate the delay variation at the output of the <b>receiver</b> <b>gate</b> accurately. The strength is that the proposed method requires no additional library characterization and is easy to be integrated into usual static timing analysis methods...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports on}} the design and {{performance}} of a scanning, photon-counting laser altimeter, capable of daylight operations from aircraft cruise altitudes. In test flights, the system has successfully recorded high repetition rate, single photon returns from clouds, soils, man-made objects, vegetation, and water surfaces under full solar illumination. Following the flights, the signal was reliably extracted from the solar noise background using a Post-Detection Poisson Filtering technique. The passively Q-switched microchip Nd:YAG laser measures only 2. 25 mm in length and is pumped by a single 1. 2 Watt GaAs laser diode. The output is frequency-doubled {{to take advantage of}} higher detector counting efficiencies and narrower spectral filters available at 532 nm. The transmitter produces a few microjoules of green energy in a subnanosecond pulse at few kilohertz rates. The illuminated ground area is imaged by a 14 cm diameter, diffraction-limited, off-axis telescope onto a segmented anode photomultiplier. Each anode segment is input to one channel of "fine " range receiver (5 cm resolution), which records the times-of-flight of individual photons.

40|$|In {{terms of}} microembolic signal (MES) detection, {{the anatomy of}} the middle {{cerebral}} artery (MCA) mainstem has only scarcely been considered. The vessel itself, however, could be at least {{partly responsible for the}} enormous variation when calculating the essential time difference (¿t) values of MES using the dual-gate technique. Therefore, we studied the time characteristics of MES in a computer simulation applying an anatomically realistic vessel and a dual-gate TCD approach. Three different MCA anatomies and two MES to blood intensities were simulated as well as two different sample volume settings. The MES length (proximal sample volume t 1; distal sample volume t 2) and ¿t were calculated for different angles of insonation and sample volume depths. The calculations of the time characteristics of MES showed extreme variation, with only modest changes of the insonation angle (t 1 4 – 34 ms; ¿t 9 – 27 ms) or the sample volume depth (t 1 7 – 27 ms; ¿t 6 – 32 ms). The variation could be considerably reduced with modified TCD settings i. e., a shorter gate separation combined with a shorter <b>receiver</b> <b>gate</b> time in the distal sample volume (¿t with changing insonation angles 6 – 19 ms; ¿t with changing insonation depths 13 – 17 ms). These results not only urge us to a cautious interpretation of the properties of single MES, but also contribute {{to an understanding of the}} marked ¿t variation using the dual-gate technique...|$|E

50|$|Rivers led {{the league}} in passing yards, {{throwing}} for a career-high 4,710 yards - 10 yards more than second-place finisher, Peyton Manning. The Chargers started off the year slowly again at 3-5 and finished a disappointing 9-7 and their four-year reign as AFC West champions ended while they missed the playoffs. Rivers' top wide receiver, Vincent Jackson, did not make a catch until the Chargers' 13th game of this season after a suspension due to a contract dispute with the team. In week 3 against the Seattle Seahawks Rivers threw for 455 yards and 2 touchdowns in a losing effort 20-27. These 455 yards broke the San Diego Chargers single-game record for most passing yardage, previously held by Dan Fouts, who had 444 in 1982. Rivers went over 400 yards and threw 2 touchdowns, but lost to the Oakland Raiders in week 5.In Week 8, Rivers threw for 305 yards, with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception in a 33-25 win against the Tennessee Titans, extending his active player-leading streak to 21 games with a touchdown thrown and giving him the record for most passing yards (2,649) ever after 8 games, passing Dan Fouts' previous record (2,580). Rivers threw for 4 touchdowns, two to backup tight end Randy McMichael and the other two to rookie receiver Seyi Ajirotutu in a comeback 29-23 victory over the Houston Texans. The Chargers' top <b>receivers</b> <b>Gates</b> (torn plantar fascia), Vincent Jackson (suspended), Malcom Floyd (hamstring), and Legedu Naanee (hamstring) did not play in the game.Rivers lost his first ever game in December, a 13-28 loss at home against the Oakland Raiders.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a lidar technique for measuring the tropospheric C 02 concentrations {{as a candidate for}} NASA's planned ASCENDS mission. Our technique uses two pulsed laser transmitters allowing simultaneous measurement of a C 02 absorption line in the 1570 nm band, 02 extinction in the Oxygen A-band and surface height and backscatter. The lidar measures the energy and time of flight of the laser echoes reflected from the atmosphere and surface. The lasers are stepped in wavelength across the C 02 line and an 02 line region during the measurement. The receiver uses a telescope and photon counting detectors, and measures the background light and energies of the laser echoes from the surface along with scattering from any aerosols in the path. The gas extinction and column densities for the C 02 and 02 gases are estimated from the ratio of the on- and off- line signals via the DIAL technique. Pulsed laser signals and a time <b>gated</b> <b>receiver</b> are used to isolate the laser echo signals from the surface, to reject laser photons scattered in the atmosphere, and measure the surface height and scattering profile in the path.

40|$|We {{have been}} {{developing}} a laser-based sounding technique for the remote {{measurement of the}} tropospheric CO 2 concentrations from orbit for NASA is ASCENDS mission. The mission's goals are to provide measurements of tropospheric CO 2 abundance with global-coverage, a few hundred km spatial and monthly temporal resolution. These are needed to better understand CO 2 fluxes and the processes that regulate CO 2 storage by the land and oceans. For the lIP, we are developing and demonstrating the lidar techniques and key lidar technology that will permit measurements of the CO 2 column abundance in the lower troposphere from aircraft. Our final goal is to demonstrate the key capabilities needed for a space lidar and mission approach for the ASCENDS mission. We use a pulsed lidar technique, which is much less sensitive to errors from cloud and atmospheric scattering and to noise from solar background. It allows continuous measurements of CO 2 mixing ratio in the lower troposphere during day and night. Our approach uses the 1570 nm CO 2 band and a two-wavelength laser absorption spectrometer, which continuously measures at nadir from a circular polar orbit. It directs the narrow co-aligned laser beams from the instrument's lasers toward nadir, and measures {{the energy of the}} laser echoes reflected from land and water surfaces. It uses a pair of tunable laser transmitters, which allowing measurement of the extinction from a single selected CO 2 absorption line in the 1570 nm band and from a line pair in the Oxygen A-band near 765 nm. These regions have temperature insensitive absorption lines are free from interference from other gases. The lasers pulse at 10 KHz, use tunable diode seed lasers followed by laser amplifiers, and have MHz spectral widths. During the measurement the lasers are stepped across the selected lines at a kHz rate. The receiver uses a 1 -m class telescope and photon sensitive detectors and measures the background light and energies of the laser echoes from the surface. The extinction and column densities for the CO 2 and O 2 gases are estimated from the ratio of the on and off line echo pulse energies via the integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) technique. Our technique exploits the atmospheric pressure broadening of the lines to weight the measurement sensitivity to the atmospheric column below 5 km. Pulsed laser signals, time <b>gated</b> <b>receiver</b> are used to isolate the surface laser echo signals and to exclude photons scattered from clouds and aerosols. We have successfully demonstrated many key aspects of the approach and lidar technology in the laboratory. We have demonstrated CO 2 column measurements in airborne flights during the summers of 2009 and 2010. These included measurements from 3 -l 3 km altitudes made over a variety of surfaces and through thin and broken clouds.

40|$|Measurements of tropospheric CO 2 {{abundance}} with global-coverage, a {{few hundred}} km spatial and monthly temporal resolution are needed to quantify processes that regulate CO 2 storage by the land and oceans. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) is the first space mission focused on atmospheric CO 2 for measuring total column CO, and O 2 by detecting the spectral absorption in reflected sunlight. The OCO mission is an essential step, and will yield important new information about atmospheric CO 2 distributions. However there are unavoidable limitations imposed by its measurement approach. These include best accuracy only during daytime at moderate to high sun angles, interference by cloud and aerosol scattering, and limited signal from CO 2 variability in the lower tropospheric CO 2 column. We have been developing a new laser-based technique for the remote measurement of the tropospheric CO 2 concentrations from orbit. Our initial goal is to demonstrate a lidar technique and instrument technology that will permit measurements of the CO 2 column abundance in the lower troposphere from aircraft. Our final goal {{is to develop a}} space instrument and mission approach for active measurements of the CO 2 mixing ratio at the 1 - 2 ppmv level. Our technique is much less sensitive to cloud and atmospheric scattering conditions and would allow continuous measurements of CO 2 mixing ratio in the lower troposphere from orbit over land and ocean surfaces during day and night. Our approach is to use the 1570 nm CO 2 band and a 3 -channel laser absorption spectrometer (i. e. lidar used an altimeter mode), which continuously measures at nadir from a near polar circular orbit. The approach directs the narrow co-aligned laser beams from the instrument's lasers toward nadir, and measures the energy of the laser echoes reflected from land and water surfaces. It uses several tunable fiber laser transmitters which allowing measurement of the extinction from a single selected CO 2 absorption line in the 1570 nm band. This band is free from interference from other gases and has temperature insensitive absorption lines. During the measurement the lasers are tuned on- and off- a selected CO 2 line near 1572 nm and a selected O 2 line near 768 nm in the Oxygen A band at kHz rates. The lasers use tunable diode seed lasers followed by fiber amplifiers, and have spectral widths much narrower than the gas absorption lines. The receiver uses a 1 -m diameter telescope and photon counting detectors and measures the background light and energies of the laser echoes from the surface. The extinction and column densities for the CO 2 and O 2 gases are estimated from the ratio of the on and offline surface echo via the differential optical absorption technique. Our technique rapidly alternates between several on-line wavelengths set to the sides of the selected gas absorption lines. It exploits the atmospheric pressure broadening of the lines to weight the measurement sensitivity to the atmospheric column below 5 km. This maximizes sensitivity to CO 2 in the boundary layer, where variations caused by surface sources and sinks are largest. Simultaneous measurements of O 2 column will use an identical approach with an O 2 line. Thee laser frequencies are tunable and have narrow (MHz) line widths. In combination with sensitive photon counting detectors these enables much higher spectral resolution and precision than is possible with passive spectrometer. 1 aser backscatter profiles are also measured, which permits identifying measurements made to cloud tops and through aerosol layers. The measurement approach using lasers in common-nadir-zenith path allows retrieving CO 2 column mixing ratios in the lower troposphere irrespective of sun angle. Pulsed laser signals, time <b>gated</b> <b>receiver</b> and a narrow receiver field-of-view are used to isolate the surface laser echo signals and to exclude photons scattered from clouds and aerosols. Nonetheless, the optical absorption change due to a change of a few ppO 2 is small, 600 : 1 are needed to estimate CO 2 mixing ratio at the 1 - 2 ppm level. We have calculated characteristics of the technique and have demonstrated aspects of the laser, detector and receiver approaches in th e laboratory We have also measured O 2 in an absorption cell, and made C 02 measurements over a 400 m long (one way) horizontal path using a sensor breadboard.
