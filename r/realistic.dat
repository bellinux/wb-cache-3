5|$|After {{a conference}} with leading counsel and the police, a {{decision}} was taken, in agreement with all parties, that there was insufficient evidence for a <b>realistic</b> prospect of conviction.|$|E
5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more <b>realistic</b> storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests than had {{been done in the}} past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and <b>realistic</b> than in past titles.|$|E
5|$|Francisco de Zurbaran Baroque Artist {{renowned for}} his {{powerful}} and <b>realistic</b> interpretation of monastic life in 17th-century Spain.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it {{is tempting to}} conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with <b>realistic</b> matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also {{at the beginning of a}} wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all <b>realistic</b> future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with <b>realistic</b> properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, M-theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle physics. Phenomenology is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct <b>realistic</b> models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. String phenomenology {{is the part of}} string theory that attempts to construct <b>realistic</b> models of particle physics based on string and M-theory.|$|E
5|$|In post-production, {{the visual}} effects were handled by Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs. The {{military}} aircraft they created was so <b>realistic</b> that the Indian Air Force called {{to check the}} producer's permission of using an actual MiG-21.|$|E
5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the <b>realistic</b> appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and <b>realistic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{elements}} in the panel incorporate earlier iconographical conventions depicting hell. However, Bosch is innovative in that he describes hell not as a fantastical space, but as a <b>realistic</b> world containing many elements from day-to-day human life.|$|E
5|$|Prus' novel The Doll, {{with its}} rich <b>realistic</b> detail and simple, {{functional}} language, was considered by Czesław Miłosz {{to be the}} great Polish novel.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{a country}} village and with <b>realistic</b> characters, it {{tells the story of}} how, after a late {{surprise}} revelation, true love prevails over the combined efforts of ambitious parents and a scheming marriage broker.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} changes after the Heian period {{resulted in a}} more <b>realistic</b> depiction of figures including movements and gestures.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} greeted warmly by the {{majority}} of the boxing community, with many experts believing the Rocky character is still a key symbol of the sport and that the boxing scenes were the most <b>realistic</b> of any film. On the DVD, Stallone attributes this {{to the fact that he}} used <b>realistic</b> sound-effects (the previous installments had become notorious for their unrealistic and loud sounds of punches landing) and the fact that both Stallone and Tarver threw real punches at each other.|$|E
5|$|The hobby of {{creating}} reborn baby dolls began around 1939 when doll enthusiasts wanted more <b>realistic</b> dolls. Since then, an industry surrounding reborn dolls has emerged.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum has}} a {{permanent}} exhibition of paintings by Lodewijk Bruckman (1903–1995). Bruckman lived in Bellingwolde {{in a hotel}} opposite to the museum from 1987 to 1989. He donated 21 paintings to the Bellingwedde municipality in 1988. These paintings, which are now exhibited in the museum, are mostly still lifes in a style which is described as <b>realistic,</b> surrealistic, or magic <b>realistic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{new century}} saw an {{increasing}} number of multi-platform releases. The move to 3D game engines, along with constant improvements in graphic quality, led to progressively detailed and <b>realistic</b> game worlds.|$|E
5|$|The puppets of Thunderbirds Are Go are of {{identical}} proportions {{to the television}} puppets. However, while production of the film continued, AP Films developed a prototype with a latex mouth to result in more <b>realistic</b> movement of the lips and jaws. However, this animatronic technology proved to be insufficiently advanced and the idea was abandoned. For the later television series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, a brand-new puppet design of <b>realistic</b> anatomical proportions made its debut appearance when the solenoid of the lip-synch mechanism was relocated from the puppet head to the torso area.|$|E
5|$|The show is <b>realistic</b> in {{depicting}} {{the processes of}} both police work and criminal activity. There have even been reports of real-life criminals watching the show {{to learn how to}} counter police investigation techniques. The fifth season portrayed a working newsroom at The Baltimore Sun and was described by Brian Lowry of Variety magazine in 2007 as the most <b>realistic</b> portrayal of the media in film and television.|$|E
5|$|To {{create a}} <b>realistic</b> compost pile, the Art Department photographed fifteen {{different}} kinds of produce, such as apples, berries, bananas, mushrooms, oranges, broccoli, and lettuce, {{in the process of}} rotting.|$|E
5|$|To provide <b>realistic</b> bodies while {{preventing}} the corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a <b>realistic</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} to London in August 1917, Nevinson first completed six lithographs {{on the subject of}} Building Aircraft for the War Propaganda Bureau portfolio of pictures, Britain's Efforts and Ideals, and then spent seven months in his Hampstead studio working up his sketches from the Front into finished pieces. A number of officials from the Department of Information visited the studio and soon began complaining about these new works. Nevinson was now focused on individuals, either as people displaying heroic qualities or as victims of warfare. He did this by painting in a <b>realistic</b> manner using a limited colour palette, sometimes only mud-brown or khaki. Whereas for his 1916 exhibition Nevinson had displayed both <b>realistic</b> works and pieces using Cubist and Futurist techniques, for his 1918 exhibition all the works were <b>realistic</b> in style and composition.|$|E
5|$|A popular myth emerged that, {{in order}} for Leigh's scream in the shower to sound <b>realistic,</b> ice-cold water was used. Leigh denied this on {{numerous}} occasions, saying the crew was very accommodating, supplying hot water throughout the week-long shoot. All of the screams are Leigh's.|$|E
5|$|After {{the science}} fiction-focused Moonraker, the {{producers}} wanted {{a return to}} the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier, more <b>realistic</b> approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and England, while underwater footage was shot in The Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|Although one of {{the more}} fantastic {{elements}} of science fiction is central to the film, Carruth's goal was to portray scientific discovery in a down-to-earth and <b>realistic</b> manner. He notes that many of the greatest breakthrough scientific discoveries in history have occurred by accident, in locations no more glamorous than Aaron's garage.|$|E
5|$|Bound {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} film critics who praised the humor {{and style of}} the directors {{as well as the}} <b>realistic</b> portrayal of a lesbian relationship in a mainstream film. Detractors of the film found its plot superficial and criticized the violence as excessive. The film won several festival awards.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} Renaissance, {{painters}} such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces {{first with a}} green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more <b>realistic</b> hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.|$|E
5|$|For Sarah's nuclear {{nightmare}} scene, Robert and Dennis Skotak of 4-Ward Production {{constructed a}} cityscape of Los Angeles using large-scale miniature buildings and <b>realistic</b> roads and vehicles. The pair, after having studied actual footages of nuclear tests, then simulated the nuclear blast by using air mortars to knock over the cityscape, including the intricately built buildings.|$|E
5|$|Her early {{style is}} less {{individual}} and more <b>realistic</b> or primitive, despite {{her lack of}} knowledge of, or perhaps rejection of, basic perspective. Initially she created simple compositions or copied existing images. As her career advanced she created complicated, panoramic compositions of rural life.|$|E
5|$|In January 1972, the State Committee for Cinematography {{requested}} editorial changes before releasing Solaris. These {{included a}} more <b>realistic</b> film with a clearer {{image of the}} future and deletion of allusions to God and Christianity. Tarkovsky successfully resisted such major changes, and after a few minor edits Solaris was approved for release in March 1972.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design {{was too much of}} a change from the more <b>realistic</b> designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, as opposed to the more mature, <b>realistic</b> fare developed by competitors.|$|E
5|$|In each case, these {{simplified}} models display many of {{the issues}} that have to be handled in practice. Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism problems, can express various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). This allows the models to be made more <b>realistic</b> and practical.|$|E
5|$|It was inevitable... On {{one hand}} our stubbornness has paid off, {{but on the}} other hand refusing to buy into the way things are {{traditionally}} supposed to be done has made things worse for us... The <b>realistic</b> part is it hasn't proved to be a huge money-making venture for a lot of guys in the band.|$|E
5|$|Motifs in {{multiple}} works are Marko and Ravijojla, Marko and his mother, Marko and Šarac, Marko shooting an arrow, Marko plowing the roads, the fight between Marko and Musa and Marko's death. Also, several artists {{have tried to}} produce a <b>realistic</b> portrait of Marko based on his frescoes. In 1924 Prilep Brewery introduced a light beer, Krali Marko.|$|E
5|$|On {{compatible}} systems, the Microsoft Windows version uses Nvidia's PhysX software {{engine to}} produce more <b>realistic,</b> dynamic interactions with the game world. With PhysX enabled, some areas contain additional snow or fog (which reacts to Batman moving through it); with PhysX disabled, the effects are lessened or absent.|$|E
5|$|Reconciling the {{continuity}} of the monthly strip with the stories that preceded and followed it presented difficulties, forcing the story's writers to alter its history in a number of ways, a technique known as retroactive continuity. Significantly, the strip rewrote various parts of Melchester's history, and shortened Roy Sr.'s recorded playing career to a more <b>realistic</b> level.|$|E
5|$|The LCS also lacked {{knowledge}} of MI5's Double-Cross System and its double agents. The department were unaware that no uncontrolled German operatives {{were active in}} the UK, and so incorrectly believed any deception {{would have to be}} highly <b>realistic</b> to appear genuine.|$|E
