5|$|The most {{decorated}} room in {{the building}} is the Sala Nobile (Noble Hall) on the first floor, which was originally a courthall, and which is now used as a meeting <b>room.</b> <b>Here</b> the judge and the nominated College of Advocates sat on a bench, which itself was a platform, wearing typical silk gown clothing of the period. The advocates on the bench were nominated and removed {{at the discretion of}} the Grand Master. When Malta was a British colony a similar short lived system was adopted, on 14 August 1832, known as the King's Counsel. The bench consisted of the Advocates of the King, and survived seven years. This room has coats-of-arms of the Castellani depicted on the upper side of the walls. There are 105 coats-of-arms, belonging to the Castellani from 1609 to the last in 1798, after which the position was abolished.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in <b>room.</b> <b>Here,</b> the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E
25|$|After {{each country}} has rehearsed, the {{delegation}} meets with the show's artistic {{director in the}} video viewing <b>room.</b> <b>Here,</b> they watch the footage of the rehearsal just performed. At this point the Head of Delegation may make known any special requirements needed for the performance, and request them from the host broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions. The rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing. A printed summary of the questions and answers which emerge from the press conferences is produced by the host press office, and distributed to journalists' pigeon-holes.|$|E

500|$|Starr said, [...] "We {{really looked}} {{out for each}} other and we had so many laughs together.

He added, [...] "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel <b>room</b> <b>here</b> and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 15th century, {{both the}} {{fortress}} and the Rocher {{continued to be}} extended and further defended until it became a garrison accommodating some 400 troops. The slow transformation from fortified house to palace (Illustration 7) began during this era, first with building by Lamberto Grimaldi, Lord of Monaco (who between 1458 and 1494 was [...] "a noteworthy ruler who handled diplomacy and the sword with equal talent"), and then by his son Jean II. This period saw {{the extension of the}} east side of the fortress with a three–floored wing, guarded by high scalloped walls connecting the bastion towers—St Mary (M in Illustration 7), Middle (K) and South (H). This large new wing contained the palace's principal room, the State Hall (today known as the Guard <b>Room).</b> <b>Here</b> the princes carried out their official business and held court. Further, more luxurious, rooms complete with balconies and loggias were designed for the private use of the Grimaldi family. In 1505 Jean II was killed by his brother Lucien.|$|E

In a statement, the group called Fazzi [...] "talented and versed in many musical instruments", mentioning that he would be [...] "bring his unique talent and style to the mix". Rubano was uneasy with Fazzi initially: [...] "He was this very nice, very talented, ambitious, happy guy, and I was like, 'This guy isn't going to last with us, this guy's the wrong fit.'" [...] Around this time, Fazzi and Rubano visited Lazzara in Texas; accompanied by acoustic guitars and a bass, the trio practiced in Lazzara's living <b>room.</b> <b>Here,</b> the trio wrote [...] "New Again" [...] which helped [...] "catapult the energy for the beginning of writing [...] forward," [...] according to Rubano.

He would later say: [...] "I watched them go from {{a bunch of kids}} to a group of musicians with work ethic," [...] also adding: [...] "On their first tour or two, {{it was more of a}} party than anything else. I still scratch my head and say, 'How in the hell did they make it?' They used to practice in my living <b>room</b> <b>here</b> – a lot of the songs they did on Dookie. You hear it coming together, and you don't expect people are going to go out and buy it. But when it does, you just say, 'Wow that's so cool.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{officers}} crept {{through the}} house until reaching the front <b>room</b> <b>here</b> the gang had gathered. They then rushed the gangsters in a surprise attack and the startled men were forced back momentarily. O'Connor immediately had his men break down the doors and within 15 minutes had placed all of the men under arrest and put them [...] "handcuffed and bleeding" [...] in a paddy wagon to a nearby precinct. Both Madden and Tanner received light punishments and were allowed to see Mayor William J. Gaynor [...] who convinced him {{that the police had}} used excessive force and claimed they had been arrested during a card game. Gaynor then passed [...] "Order No. 7" [...] which prohibited a police officer to use of his club [...] "unless he was prepared to prove that it was in defense of his life".|$|E
