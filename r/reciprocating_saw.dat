2500|$|In 2011, Bailey's human {{sexuality}} class at Northwestern made the headlines of major news organizations after he allowed a female guest speaker and her male partner {{to perform an}} impromptu live mechanized sex toy demonstration using a [...] "fucksaw"a modified <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> converted into a sex toy by attaching a [...] "phallic object" [...] instead of a bladeto bring the woman to orgasm in front the audience. Students were advised beforehand {{of the nature of}} the demonstration in this optional after-class event on kinky sex and female orgasm. In the aftermath, Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro criticized Bailey for [...] "extremely poor judgment" [...] and launched an investigation. Bailey at first defended the demonstration, saying that students found lectures featuring guest speakers valuable, but subsequently issued an apology, saying he regretted the upset caused and its effect on the university's reputation. He said there would be no repeats, but maintained that the demonstration had been relevant to the topic of his course, and said that the students who chose to attend were over 18, [...] "legally capable of voting, enlisting in the military, and consuming pornography", and contended that the criticism he had received was poorly reasoned. The response among academics was mixed. Joseph Epstein criticized Bailey's class as failing academic standards in a long piece for The Weekly Standard, and ultimately compared Bailey to a pimp. In contrast, Laurie Essig, writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, thought that the incident [...] "triggered a national conversation about what we can and cannot look at". In a web-only feature for Esquire, Bailey's former research assistant Paul Schrodt defended his teaching and research methods. Alice Dreger also defended Bailey's class as being of high quality in general, but agreed with Shapiro that the demonstration [...] "was a case of poor judgment, because it wasn't worth it". Eventually, in response to the incident, Northwestern administrators removed Bailey's {{human sexuality}} course from the following year's curriculum. A year later, Northwestern [...] reintroduced a somewhat differently themed sexuality class taught by Lane Fenrich, according to whom the new class emphasized [...] "the major questions" [...] and [...] "the major thinkers" [...] rather than being [...] "geared toward sexual practices".|$|E

5000|$|All sawmills use rip saws {{of various}} types {{including}} the circular saw and band saw. Historically sawmills used one or more <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> more specifically known as an [...] "up-and-down" [...] or [...] "upright saw" [...] which are of two basic types, the frame saw or a muley (mulay) saw {{which is similar to}} the hand powered pit saw. Some sawmills also use crosscut saws to cut boards and planks to length.|$|R

50|$|A power hacksaw (or {{electric}} hacksaw) {{is a type}} of hacksaw that {{is powered}} either by its own electric motor or connected to a stationary engine. Most power hacksaws are stationary machines but some portable models do exist; the latter (with frames) have been displaced to some extent by <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> such as the Sawzall, which accept blades with hacksaw teeth. Stationary models usually have a mechanism to lift up the saw blade on the return stroke and some have a coolant pump to prevent the saw blade from overheating.|$|R
50|$|By 1887 Elgin had general stores, a livery, a hotel, and a church, {{as well as}} {{a nearby}} sawmill, which {{continues}} as a more modern Boise Cascade mill. Between 1887 and 1908, the area around Elgin had 35 sawmills, most transportable water-driven whipsaws (vertical <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws).</b> Local landowners would sell the trees for 50 centers per thousand board feet, which is about how much the sawmills could handle in a day. Log transportation cost about two dollars per thousand board feet, and a mill could sell the processed lumber for $6-10 per thousand board feet.|$|R

50|$|After the {{competition}} the interfering tube was cut {{out with a}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> and a diagonal tube was welded in so that the chain did not interfere. This setup lasted many drive days until eventually causing a crack {{in one of the}} original chassis tubes.|$|E
50|$|A dragsaw is {{an early}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> using a 1.8 m (6-foot) steel {{crosscut}} saw to buck logs to length. Prior to the popularization of the chainsaw during World War II, the dragsaw was a popular means of taking the hard work out of cutting wood.|$|E
50|$|Wire saws {{are similar}} in {{principle}} to band <b>saws</b> or <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws,</b> but they use abrasion to cut rather than saw teeth. Depending on the application, diamond material {{may or may not}} be used as an abrasive. The wire can have one strand or many strands braided together (cable). A single-strand saw can be roughened to be abrasive, abrasive compounds can be bonded to the cable, or diamond-impregnated beads (and spacers) can be threaded on the cable. Wire saws are often cooled and lubricated by water or oil.|$|R
5000|$|All dentofacial osteotomies are {{performed}} under general anesthesia, causing total unconsciousness. General anesthesia allows surgeons to perform dentofacial osteotomies effectively without involuntary muscle movement or complaints about minor pain. Prior to any Osteotomy, third molars (wisdom teeth) are extracted {{to reduce the}} chance of infection.Dentofacial osteotomy is usually performed using oscillating and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws,</b> burs, and manual chisels. <b>Reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> are straight and are used for making straight bone cuts. Oscillating saws are angled, to different degrees, {{in order to make}} deep curved cuts for certain osteotomies like mandible angle reduction. The recent advent of piezoelectric saws has simplified bone cutting, but such equipment has not yet become the norm outside of the most developed countries.The surgery might involve one jaw or both jaws cuncurrently. The modification is done by making cuts in the bones of the mandible and/or maxilla, and repositioning the cut pieces in the desired alignment. This surgery is usually performed with the use of general anaesthetic and a nasal tube for intubation. The nasal tube enables the teeth to be wired together during surgery. The surgery usually does not involve cutting the skin. Instead, the surgeon is often able to go through the interior of the mouth.Cutting one bone is known as an osteotomy, while performing the surgery on both jaws simultaneously is known as a bi-maxillary osteotomy (cutting the bone of both jaws) or a maxillomandibular advancement.|$|R
50|$|Designs range {{widely in}} power, speed, and features, from less {{powerful}} portable, handheld models {{that are usually}} shaped like a cordless drill, to high-power, high-speed, corded models designed for heavy construction and demolition work. Modern <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> almost all have variable speed, either through trigger sensitivity or through a dial. Another feature that has become important to the way these saws are used is the inclusion of an orbital action. This action consists of oscillating the traversed reciprocation in up and down fashion (perpendicular to the motion of cut) causing {{the tip of the}} blade to move in an oval pattern, up and down as well as back and forth. This feature is primarily for wood, allowing quick cuts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sabre saw}} (also saber saw) is a {{hand-held}} powered <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw.</b> It is similar to, but larger than, a jigsaw. The sabre saw uses a toothed blade, chiefly {{to cut through}} wood and other soft materials. The term 'sabre saw' is occasionally also {{used to refer to}} Sawzall style hand-held reciprocating saws.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> or [...] "sabre saw" [...] (UK and Australia): a {{saw with}} an [...] "in-and-out" [...] or [...] "up-and-down" [...] action {{similar to a}} jigsaw, but larger and more powerful, and using a longer stroke with the blade {{parallel}} to the barrel. Hand-held versions, sometimes powered by compressed air, are for demolition work or for cutting pipe.|$|E
50|$|A rotary <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> {{is a type}} of {{saw that}} spins a cutting {{implement}} around a rotary axis, instead of thrusting it along a linear axis. The first use of such devices was in medicine, where cutting through bone warranted the need for a saw with minimal stroke length, and a cutting action that could be implemented through depth cut rather than a follow through cut.|$|E
50|$|According to one hypothesis, {{evidence}} {{for the use of}} stone-cutting dragsaws may date from the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, about 4,500 years before its commonly accepted date of invention.Dragsaws were the grandfather of our well known chain and <b>reciprocated</b> <b>saw</b> and are known as the first mechanical saws used in the timber industry operation. Powered by a steam-powered winch, they supposed to be portable, but in reality many of them weighed nearly 400 pounds, making its mobility very difficult. These huge tools were a great help for the log business, because they were efficient and very resilient. Early dragsaws of the modern era were steam powered and later gasoline powered. Some manufacturers included Multnomah, Vaughn and Wee McGregor.|$|R
5000|$|Blades for {{bandsaws}} and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> {{are often}} made with bimetal construction. The teeth, made of high speed steel, are bonded (by various methods, for example, electron beam welding or laser beam welding) to the high-strength carbon steel base. Such construction makes for blades {{with a better}} combination of cutting speed and durability than shown by non-bimetal blades, because {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each of the metals are applied in the best locations: the teeth are harder (and thus cut better), but therefore also brittler; meanwhile, the body area of the band is softer (which would make for poorer teeth), but also less brittle, and thus more resistant to cracking and breaking (which is desirable in the body area).|$|R
5000|$|A sternal saw is a bone cutter used {{to perform}} median sternotomy, opening the {{patients}} chest by splitting the breastbone, or sternum. It is a <b>reciprocating</b> blade <b>saw</b> {{that resembles a}} jigsaw in appearance. It was invented and introduced by Dr. Edward P. ("Ted") Diethrich in 1963 ...|$|R

50|$|Devices can be penetrative or extractive. A typical penetrative machine {{works by}} the {{transfer}} of rotational or reciprocating force from a motor to a directional motion on a shaft, which is tipped by a dildo. A hand-held modified <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> device is sometimes called a fucksaw, a hand-held modified drill motor rotating device is sometimes called a drilldo, and a modified jigsaw is called a jillsaw. An extractive device works like a milking machine and can {{be attached to the}} penis, breast, or other body part.|$|E

While Geoff supervises Deen and Simon on cutting the plating (Geoff teaching Deen {{how to use a}} metal grinder and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw),</b> Andrew teaches Matt how to use plastic plumbing pipes. After a while, he pulls Angela to assist him. Cory's hands-on leadership pays off in spades, as the challenge is finished on time.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} cost tradeoffs for shaping modified square wafers from cylindrical crystals. Tests were conducted {{of the effectiveness of}} texture etching for removal of surface damage on sawed wafers.

50|$|There {{are only}} a few ways to lower the {{severity}} and risk of damage from HAVS without complete engineering redesign on the operation of the tools. A few examples could be increasing the dampening through thicker gloves and increasing the trigger size of the tool to decrease the stress concentration of the vibrations on the contact area, but the best course of action would be to buy safer tools that vibrate less. These Exposure Action Values and Exposure Limit Values seem rather low, when compared to lab tested data, shown by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Power Tools Database. Just an example out of the database, the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> look to have extremely violent vibrations with one of the saws vibrations reaching 50 m/s2 in one hand and over 35 m/s2 in the other.|$|R
40|$|Power-tool {{vibrations}} {{can cause}} a variety of health disorders, ranging from inconsequential to disastrous. These vibrations may not be harmful when received in small doses but can cause vasospastic disorders, such as vibration-induced white finger disease (VWF), with frequent use or accumulated over time. Existing occupational guidance does not adequately describe the health risks associated with power-tool vibrations. In the current study, vibration levels for major brands of <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> and impact drivers were measured under typical use conditions, along with user comfort levels after different usage times. Results are provided in terms of acceleration and comfort levels {{as a function of}} usage time, varied grip-force conditions, and with or without use of gloves. Based on the VWF-incidence data from prior occupational studies, guidance on restrictions on usage of power tools is provided. It is found that existing ISO guidance for Europe overestimates allowable times, compared to those determined here...|$|R
