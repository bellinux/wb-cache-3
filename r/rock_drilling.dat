Through {{analysis}} of the dynamics process of hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drill,</b> this paper builds {{a model of the}} impact mechanism of hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> with AMESim software, obtains curves of the displacements of the piston and valve core, and gets the pressure of the piston chamber. The dynamic {{analysis of}} the results indicates that the model of the impact mechanism of hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> agrees well with the principle of hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drill.</b> As a result, this research provides a new theoretical basis and method for the hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drill...</b>|$|R

A 1974 reconstruction, by Ken Cook and Ann Christopher, is part of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery's collection. <b>Rock</b> <b>Drill</b> has been heralded as embodying the spirit of [...] "radical Modernism more dramatically than any other sculpture, English or continental, then or since".|$|R
50|$|In a new {{innovation}} for Queensland {{several kinds}} of drilling machines were experimented with but all failed. As {{a result of this}} hand drilling operations were resorted to. The use of <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> in driving this tunnel may have been unsuccessful, however there is evidence of the use of <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> in cuttings to the south of this tunnel as far as the head of Rosenthal Creek. The use of the <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> is contemporary with the introduction of the Low patent <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> into Victoria where it was used for driving the Mount Tarrengower tunnel at Maldon. Earthworks were also greater than expected due to the unstable nature of rock that was encountered.|$|R

5000|$|In Europe {{since the}} late 1840s, the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, had been contemplating the {{excavation}} of a 12 km tunnel through Mount Fréjus to create a rail link between Italy and France, which would cross his realm. [...] The need for a mechanical <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> was obvious and this sparked research on pneumatic <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> in Europe. A Frenchman, Cavé, designed, and in 1851 patented, a <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> that used compressed air; but the air had to be admitted manually to the cylinder during each stroke, {{so it was not}} successful. [...] In 1854, in England, Thomas Bartlett made and then patented (1855) a <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> whose drill bit was connected directly to the piston of a steam engine. In 1855 Bartlett demonstrated his drill, powered by compressed air, to officials of the Mt. Fréjus tunnel project. [...] (In 1855, a German, Schumann, invented a similar pneumatic <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> in Freiburg, Germany.) Bartlett’s drill was refined by the Savoy-born engineer Germain Sommeiller (1815-1871) and his colleagues, Grandis and Grattoni, by 1861. [...] Thereafter, many inventors refined the pneumatic drill.|$|R

50|$|Ernst Waldemar Jungner (June 19, 1869 - August 30, 1924) was a Swedish {{inventor}} and engineer. In 1899 {{he invented}} the nickel-iron electric storage battery (NiFe), the nickel-cadmium battery (NiCd) and the rechargeable alkaline silver-cadmium battery (AgCd).

50|$|In <b>rock</b> <b>drilling,</b> {{the hole}} is usually not made through a {{circular}} cutting motion, though the bit is usually rotated. Instead, {{the hole is}} usually made by hammering a drill bit into the hole with quickly repeated short movements. The hammering action can be performed from outside of the hole (top-hammer drill) or within the hole (down-the-hole drill, DTH). Drills used for horizontal drilling are called drifter drills.|$|E

50|$|A {{pneumatic}} tool is first {{thought to have}} been used for <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> in 1844. Many quarries used hand held tools that required the driller to suspend himself from a rope over the quarry face in order to place the drill hole in the required position. This system used small diameter holes and was not only terribly inefficient, but very dangerous due to flying rock {{as a result of the}} inaccuracy of the drilled borehole.|$|E
50|$|The Rock Quality Designation {{index was}} {{developed}} by Deere in the 1960s to classify {{the quality of a}} rock core based on the integrety of borehole cores. Nowadays the classification system itself is not very often used, but the determination of the RQD as index for rock core quality is standard practice in any geotechnical <b>rock</b> <b>drilling,</b> and is used in many, more recent, rock mass classification systems, such as RMR and Q-system (see above).|$|E
