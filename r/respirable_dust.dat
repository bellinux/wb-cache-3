The cohort comprised 3, 250 employees with a median follow-up duration of around 37 years. Incident cases of silicosis were identified via silicosis registries (Chinese X-ray stage I, similar to International Labor Organisation classification scheme profusion category 1 / 1).

40|$|The {{inhalation}} {{of china}} clay dust by man can cause pneumoconiosis. In {{an attempt to}} identify the factors responsible the cytotoxicity in vitro of china clay dust towards mouse peritoneal macrophages was examined. <b>Respirable</b> <b>dusts</b> collected at china clay drying plants were cytotoxic towards the cells.

The cytotoxicity of kaolinite was not due to particle morphology and the positively charged edges of the mineral contributed only slightly to cytotoxicity. An electron microscope study showed that macrophages phagocytosed PVPNO-coated kaolinite particles indicating that the low cytotoxicity of these particles was not due to poor phagocytosis. Residence of china clay in rat lungs appeared to reduce its cytotoxicity.
