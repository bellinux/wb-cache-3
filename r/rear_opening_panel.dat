50|$|By {{the time}} the {{prototype}} was ready to fly in October 1941, the war was already in progress and the Luftwaffe took over development. Like earlier tail-dragger designs, the Ju 252 would normally be difficult to load when parked, owing to the sloping floor. Junkers had already pioneered - with the earlier Junkers Ju 90's fifth and sixth prototype airframes during 1939 - a unique solution to this problem, the Trapoklappe, a hydraulically powered ventral rear loading ramp that possessed powerful enough operating mechanisms to lift the plane off its tailwheel, leveling the floor and allowing oversized cargo to be loaded directly forward into the fuselage. Even as cargo aircraft of all nations since World War II have used nosewheel landing gear undercarriage designs, the Trapoklappe concept of a rear loading ramp, that forms the <b>opening</b> <b>rear</b> ventral <b>panel</b> of the fuselage of a cargo aircraft, is a ubiquitous feature of most military airlift cargo aircraft to the present day.|$|R

5000|$|Wetsuits : <b>Rear</b> <b>openings</b> on wetsuits {{and diving}} suits {{can make it}} easier for a wearer to enter them.

50|$|Synthetic {{screen media}} is used where wear life is an issue. Large {{producers}} such as mines or huge quarries {{use them to}} reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact screen media material used on the top deck of a scalper screen. To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen <b>panels,</b> slotted <b>opening</b> <b>panels</b> and diamond <b>opening</b> <b>panels.</b> Due to the 7-degree demoulding angle, polyurethane screen media users can experience granulometry changes of product during the wear life of the panel.|$|R

50|$|Many finish {{options are}} {{available}} to the tilt-up contractor, from paints and stains to pigmented concrete, cast-in features like brick and stone to aggressive erosion finishes like sandblasting and acid-etching. Shapes are also a feature that have become dominant in the tilt-up market, with many panels configured with circular or elliptical <b>openings,</b> <b>panel</b> tops that are pedimented or curved, facades that are curved or segmented and featured with significant areas of glazing or other materials.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} bridge the two strands, R. Sikoryak's {{original}} <b>opening</b> <b>panels</b> were cut, although he later drew the oddly-shaped [...] "splash panel" [...] that now begins the narrative. Spiegelman himself drew the three panels that link Strand 1 to Strand 2 (bridging the contributions of Joe Sacco and Savage Pencil), while Richard McGuire {{was brought in to}} link Strand 2 back to Strand 1 (bridging the contributions of Carol Swain and Drew Friedman).|$|R
50|$|Like many of Clowes' {{extended}} works, Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron originally {{appeared in}} serial form in his comic book Eightball (issues #1-#10, 1989-1993) {{but has been}} reprinted as a trade paperback. The <b>opening</b> <b>panels</b> of later chapters of the story were presented in color when originally published in Eightball. When collected in trade paperback form, the chapters of the story were given names, and a table of contents was added to reflect this.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is a monocoque pod and {{boom structure}} also built with composite sandwich layers, but with carbon fibre added. Its T-tail is constructed from GRP; the tailplane carries an elevator. There is {{no provision for}} water ballast. The two tandem seats have a common upper line but two single piece canopies, the forward one forward hinged and the <b>rear</b> <b>opening</b> to starboard. The undercarriage is fixed, with a main monowheel, fitted with an hydraulic brake, placed at the pod-boom transition within a prominent fairing and assisted by a smaller nosewheel.|$|R
5000|$|Cyclosalpa bakeri {{moves by}} {{contracting}} its bands of muscles rhythmically {{at the same}} time opening and closing the front and <b>rear</b> <b>openings</b> appropriately. This squeezes water out from the hollow interior and the animal moves in the opposite direction, a form of jet propulsion. This water movement brings in suspended phytoplankton which are caught by a mucus net. Cyclosalpa bakeri is an extremely efficient feeder. The aggregates can grow by a quarter of their size each day and individuals can eat more than half their body mass daily.|$|R
5000|$|The styling of the 1960 - 1961 {{model year}} took cues {{from the late}} 1950s Chevrolet cars and had large oval ports above the grille. Front {{independent}} suspension was new for 1960. The cab featured a [...] "wrap around" [...] windshield. Both tailgate and <b>panel</b> doors <b>rear</b> <b>openings</b> were available. From 1962 onwards, the hood styling was more conservative, with hoods that eliminated the large ports. In 1964, the front glass area was updated to a flatter windshield, and larger door glass. 1150 lb of cargo could be carried in the back.|$|R

50|$|For 1975, the Eldorado {{was given}} {{rectangular}} headlamps, full <b>rear</b> wheel <b>openings</b> sans fender skirts and crisper lines {{which resulted in}} a much sleeker appearance reminiscent of the 1967-70 models.|$|R

Among the stories adapted by Simon and Kirby was Come With Me and Diel, about a criminal who targeted his victims during The Blitz, in London, England. In the <b>opening</b> <b>panel</b> (comics) the reader is introduced to the comic's narrator, Inspector Greeno of Scotland Yard. Greeno solves the crime because of an ID tag which the killer inadverdently dropped during an attempted homicide.|$|R
25|$|By July 1969 a three-door wagon version {{intended}} for private use arrived, the LS11 Suzuki Fronte Estate, to give passenger car buyers a model with more luggage room without {{the indignity of}} having to buy a commercial vehicle. The Estate had the same top-hinged <b>rear</b> <b>opening,</b> but featured a more comfortable, while still folding, rear seat. There was also a folding luggage shelf in the trunk. Sops to safety, already somewhat better than the regular Fronte because of the engine location and the driver's seat being located farther back, included an anti-glare dashboard and a round horn pad in the steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|Chrysler played {{catch-up}} on some wagon {{specific features}} in 1969: The tailgate became a two-way door-gate, able to swing sideways or drop downward, a feature Ford had pioneered in 1965. And, the rear axle track was widened nearly 3 in to 63.4”, enabling a full 48.5” wide load floor between the wheel wells, a feature GM had pioneered, also in 1965. Chrysler sought to leapfrog those competitors {{with a few}} wagon only features of its own, including passenger assist handles integrated into the <b>rear</b> <b>opening</b> trim molding, and a tailgate window washer, contained entirely inside the tailgate.|$|R

2500|$|The FJ Cruiser {{features}} a short wheelbase, stocky frame, and grille-headlight arrangement {{much like the}} original FJ40. Other throwback design cues include a nearly vertical windshield with three windshield wipers for maximum surface area coverage. The FJ Cruiser also featured the name [...] "Toyota" [...] spelled out across the grille instead of the corporate emblem {{which has been in}} use since 1990, another reference to the FJ40 and other older Toyota trucks. The FJ's body features <b>rear</b> <b>opening</b> access doors that give a unique look to the SUV. Special high-strength steel was used to give the vehicle side impact protection without the need for a door pillar.|$|R
