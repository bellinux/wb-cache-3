5|$|The Adagio is in sonata {{form and}} {{presents}} a single theme. While the exposition modulates to a re-statement {{of the theme}} in F major, the <b>recapitulation</b> modulates to D major.

50|$|The entire {{development}} {{section of}} the first movement is absent from the sketch {{and had to be}} reconstructed by Newbould.

5|$|The concerto {{also calls}} on the soloist {{to be nothing more}} than an accompanist to the {{orchestra}} for extended periods, such as the ricochet arpeggios {{at the start of the}} <b>recapitulation.</b> This too was novel for a violin concerto of its time.|$|E
5|$|The first {{movement}} {{follows the}} standard {{outline of a}} sonata form concerto movement of the Classical period.

5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{thematic}} material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the <b>recapitulation.</b> Mozart manages to recapitulate all of the themes in the home key of C minor. The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist. The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, {{which has not been}} heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano. The <b>recapitulation</b> concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential trill leads into a ritornello. The ritornello in turn leads into a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical survey of 283 symphonies dating from 1800 – 1899.

5|$|A <b>recapitulation</b> {{theory of}} {{evolutionary}} development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first {{like that of a}} fish, then in turn like that of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned <b>recapitulation,</b> though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{the unusual}} {{placement}} of the cadenza before the <b>recapitulation</b> {{is reflected in the}} violin concertos of Tchaikovsky (where the cadenza is similarly placed) and Sibelius (where the cadenza serves to extend the development section). Moreover, following this concerto it was very rare for a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten for the soloist to improvise as in the days of Mozart and Beethoven. The linking of the three movements also influenced other concertos, such as Liszt's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|Most of the overtures are {{in three}} sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a {{concluding}} allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a <b>recapitulation</b> and a coda. However, Sullivan himself {{did not always}} follow this pattern. The overture to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to Utopia Limited is dominated by a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.|$|E

5|$|The Estonian embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer stated {{what are}} now called von Baer's laws in 1828, noting that related animals begin their {{development}} as similar embryos and then diverge: thus, {{animals in the}} same family are more closely related and diverge later than animals which are only in the same order and have fewer homologies. von Baer's theory recognises that each taxon (such as a family) has distinctive shared features, and that embryonic development parallels the taxonomic hierarchy: not the same as <b>recapitulation</b> theory.|$|E

5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and <b>recapitulation</b> sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it. The <b>recapitulation</b> starts only with a statement of the second phrase of the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the statement of the first phrase of the theme in the tonic. It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the statement of the main theme in the tonic that the listener might have been expecting, and it does so after two measures of pointed silence.|$|E
5|$|Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto {{opens with}} the almost {{immediate}} entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage {{as the music}} subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as {{a link to the}} <b>recapitulation,</b> where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the <b>recapitulation,</b> the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.|$|E
5|$|The first {{movement}} is in cut common (2/2) time. It {{starts with the}} cello, alone, playing eight quarter notes on the same B-flat. It is not until the third measure of the movement that the violins and viola enter. The cello's eight throbbing notes act as more than an introduction. They reappear at critical junctures throughout the movement, including {{at the beginning of}} the development and <b>recapitulation</b> sections, illustrating that they are part of the movement's primary thematic material. The melody that follows the eight cello notes is echoed in Beethoven's String Quartet No. 1 (Op. 18, No. 1).|$|E
50|$|Given Crapanzano’s {{stress on}} the individual, life histories, and the {{importance}} of self-reflection and self-positioning in anthropological research, it seems inevitable that he would turn to the consideration of his own life experiences. In <b>Recapitulations,</b> a self-reflective memoir - some have called it a meta-memoir - he reflects on the existential implications of both insignificant and significant events in his own life.5 Taking ironic pleasure in the paradoxes in his life and by implication in the life of others, his self-questioning seems also to be questioning of the very questions he poses. In this way he leads his readers to question what they themselves take for granted in their own lives. Here, as in so much of Crapanzano’s writing, his intentions are tempered by his irony.|$|R

5|$|The {{sketches}} {{were written}} {{during the spring}} and summer of 1828, possibly even earlier. The inner movements were sketched up to the final bar, while the outer, sonata-form movements were only sketched up to the beginning of the <b>recapitulation</b> and in the coda. In the sketches, passages from different movements (or even different sonatas) sometimes appear on the same leaf; such evidence suggests that the last two sonatas were composed in parallel, at least in part. Furthermore, in the B-flat Sonata, Schubert sketched the finale before completing the first movement, unlike his usual practice, in which finales were conceived at a later stage.|$|E
5|$|Finale in {{moderate}} or fast tempo, and in sonata or rondo-sonata form. The {{themes of}} the finales are characterized by long passages of melody accompanied by relentless flowing rhythms. The exposition has no repeat written in. The development section is more ordinary in style {{than that of the}} first movement, with frequent modulations, sequences, and fragmentation of the exposition's first theme (or the main theme of the rondo). The <b>recapitulation</b> closely resembles the exposition, with the minimal harmonic changes needed to end the section in the tonic: the first theme returns in a shortened version; the second theme returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The coda is based on the exposition's first theme. It is composed of two parts, the first quiet and attenuated, creating a sense of expectation, the second animated, dissipating the final tension in decisive, agitated motion and ending with fortissimo tonic chords and octaves.|$|E
5|$|First {{movement}} in moderate or fast tempo, and in sonata form. The exposition {{consists of two}} or three thematic and tonal areas and, as common in the Classical style, moves from tonic to dominant (in major mode works) or to the relative major (in minor mode works). However, as often with Schubert, the harmonic scheme of the exposition involves additional, intermediate tonalities, which may be quite remote from the tonic-dominant axis, and sometimes imbue certain expository passages with the character of a development section. The main themes of the exposition are often in ternary form, with their middle section digressing to a different tonality. The themes generally do not form symmetrical periods, and irregular phrase lengths are prominent. The exposition ends with a repeat sign. The development section opens with an abrupt turn into a new tonal area. A new theme, based on a melodic fragment from the second thematic group of the exposition, is presented in this section over recurrent rhythmic figuration, and then developed, undergoing successive transformations. The first thematic group returns in the <b>recapitulation</b> with different or additional harmonic digressions; the second group returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The short coda maintains the tonic key and mainly soft dynamics, achieving a resolution of the movement's conflicts and ending pianissimo.|$|E

50|$|Liszt's {{approach}} to musical form in his symphonic poems was also unorthodox.
