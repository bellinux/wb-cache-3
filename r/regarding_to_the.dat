5|$|As {{with all}} {{games in the}} series, Wipeout 64 was {{developed}} by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis and was published by Midway Games - marking {{the first and only}} time in the Wipeout series where one of the games were not published by Psygnosis or SCE Studio Liverpool (their future name). The game {{is one of the few}} N64 titles to have noticeable load times, disguised by the request 'Please Wait'. Load times between levels in Wipeout 64 are approximately a few seconds long due to the need for sound decompression, according to Psygnosis in a later interview with IGN. Psygnosis used the Nintendo 64's analogue stick to their benefit; thus rendering the D-Pad obsolete so that ships could respond quickly and more precisely in improvement <b>regarding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> older games.|$|E

2500|$|Fatimah's burial {{place is}} a disputed issue among Muslims from {{different}} sects. It is famous that Ali ibn Abi Taleb buried his wife in an unknown location, because it was Fatimah's decision [...] According to Madelung in The Succession to Muhammad, the secret burial {{was done with the}} aim of avoiding the presence of caliph (Abu Bakr). Different locations have been mentioned as the possible burial places of Fatimah some of which are said to be nearer to fact. Al-Baqi', her house and between the Prophet's tomb and his minbar are the possible places of her grave. One of the important reasons that Fatima’s grave was concealed is because of her protest against what happened <b>regarding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> caliphate of the Holy prophet. [...] Hence, as long as the Muslims don’t believe in what Fatima believes relating to the Holy prophet’s succession, the reason for the concealment of her grave will remain. One of the historians in this filed says: [...] "… In any case, concealment of the prophet’s daughter indicates that she was dejected about some people and it’s clear that she wanted to declare her dissatisfaction and unhappiness".|$|E

His results concerning electromagnetic and optical phenomena (...) agree in the main with those which we have obtained in the preceding pages, the chief difference being that Einstein simply postulates what we have deduced, with some difficulty and not altogether satisfactorily, from the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field. By doing so, he may certainly take credit for making us see in the negative result of experiments like those of Michelson, Rayleigh and Brace, not a fortuitous compensation of opposing effects, but the manifestation of a general and fundamental principle.Yet, I think, something may also be claimed in favour of the form in which I have presented the theory. I cannot but regard the ether, which can be the seat of an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations, as endowed with {{a certain degree of}} substantiality, however different it may be from all ordinary matter. In this line of thought, it seems natural not to assume at starting that it can never make any difference whether a body moves through the ether or not, and to measure distances and lengths of time by means of rods and clocks having a fixed position relatively to the ether.It would be unjust not to add that, besides the fascinating boldness of its starting point, Einstein's theory has another marked advantage over mine. Whereas I {{have not been able to}} obtain for the equations referred to moving axes exactly the same form as for those which apply to a stationary system, Einstein has accomplished this by means of a system of new variables slightly different from those which I have introduced. 1910 (published 1913), 1913 (published 1914),Einstein said in a nutshell, that all of those mentioned questions have no meaning. Then he arrives at the [...] "abandonment" [...] of the aether. Incidentally, the latter is to a certain extent a quarrel about words: it makes no great difference whether one speaks about the vacuum or the aether. In any case, according to Einstein it has no meaning to speak about motion relative to the aether. He also denies the existence of absolute simultaneity.It is certainly remarkable that these relativity concepts, also with respect to time, have been incorporated so quickly.The evaluation of these concepts belongs largely to epistemology to which we can left the judgment, trusting that it can consider the discussed questions with the necessary thoroughness. But it is sure that for a large part it depends on the way of thinking to which one is accustomed, whether one feels attracted to the one view or the other. <b>Regarding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lecturer himself, he finds a certain satisfaction in the older views, that the aether has at least some substantiality, that space and time can be strictly separated, that one can speak about simultaneity without further specification. Regarding the latter, one can probably refer to the ability that arbitrary great velocities can at least imagined by us. By that, one comes very near to the concept of absolute simultaneity. or in 1912 (published 1922).Of course, the description of natural phenomena and the testing of what the theory of relativity has to say about them can be carried out independently of what one thinks of the aether and the time. From a physical point of view these questions can be left on one side, and especially the question of the true time can be handed over to the theory of knowledge.The modern physicists, as Einstein and Minkowski, speak no longer about the aether at all. This, however, is a question of taste and of words. For, whether there is an aether or not, electromagnetic fields certainly exist, and so also does the energy of the electrical oscillations. If we do not like the name of [...] "aether," [...] we must use another word as a peg to hang all these things upon. It is not certain whether [...] "space" [...] can be so extended as to take care not only of the geometrical properties but also of the electric ones.One cannot deny to the bearer of these properties a certain substantiality, and if so, then one may, in all modesty, call true time the time measured by clocks which are fixed in this medium, and consider simultaneity as a primary concept.|$|E
