2500|$|Females {{give birth}} to their young on the ice in November. Pups are nursed for only four weeks before weaning. [...] Mating is thought to occur {{underwater}} shortly after the pup is weaned, but has never been observed. <b>Ross</b> <b>seals</b> mature sexually at approximately three years of age, and are thought to live around 20 years in the wild.|$|R
5000|$|Pinnipeds: Elephant <b>seals,</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>seals</b> and South American {{fur seals}} are classed as molluscivores. [...] The walrus eats benthic bivalve molluscs, {{especially}} clams, {{for which it}} forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae. The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.|$|R
5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the <b>Ross</b> <b>seal</b> and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
25|$|The crabeater seal {{shares a}} common recent {{ancestor}} {{with the other}} Antarctic seals, which are together known as the lobodontine seals. These include the <b>Ross</b> <b>seal</b> (Ommatophoca rossii), leopard seal (H. leptonyx) and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli). These species, collectively belonging to the Lobodontini tribe of seals, share teeth adaptations including lobes and cusps useful for straining smaller prey items {{out of the water}} column. The ancestral Lobodontini likely diverged from their sister clade, the Mirounga (elephant seals) in the late Miocene to early Pliocene, when they migrated southward and diversified rapidly in relative isolation around Antarctica.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Ross</b> <b>seal</b> feeds {{primarily}} on squid and fish, primarily Antarctic silverfish, in the pelagic zone. [...] Ross seals are {{presumed to be}} preyed upon by killer whales (Orcinus orca) and leopard seals, large predators that share their Antarctic habitat, though there are no documented observations of predation.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} a unique site for almost all bird species {{breeding}} in East Antarctica, including Antarctic petrels, Antarctic fulmars, Cape petrels, snow petrels, Wilson's storm petrels, south polar skuas and Ad√©lie penguins. To the south-east of the island, {{there is a large}} colony of emperor penguins breeding on fast ice. The island and the adjacent emperor penguin rookery site are protected under the Antarctic Treaty System as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.127. The area also supports five species of <b>seals,</b> including <b>Ross</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Seven {{pinniped}} species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, {{the elephant}} seal (Mirounga leonina), can reach up to , while females of the smallest, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), reach only [...] These two species live {{north of the}} sea ice, and breed in harems on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) form breeding colonies, whereas leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and <b>Ross</b> <b>seals</b> (Ommatophoca rossii) live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and {{spend a great deal}} of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators.|$|R
5|$|While most vocals are audible to {{the human}} ear, a captive leopard seal was {{recorded}} making ultrasonic calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce infrasonic vibrations. Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers against their bodies as warnings. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings. Visual displays also occur: Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture when patrolling under the ice, and <b>Ross</b> <b>seals</b> will display the stripes on their chests and teeth when approached. Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.|$|R
2500|$|The total <b>Ross</b> <b>seal</b> {{population}} {{is estimated at}} around 130,000 individuals, but there is great uncertainty in this estimate (reported 95% confidence intervals range from 20,000 to 227,000). Thus, very {{little is known about}} trends in the population. [...] A genetic survey did not detect evidence of a recent, sustained genetic bottleneck in this species, which suggests that populations do not appear to have suffered a detectable and sustained decline in the recent past.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Ross</b> <b>seal</b> (Ommatophoca rossii) {{is a true}} seal (family Phocidae) with a range {{confined}} {{entirely to}} the pack ice of Antarctica. [...] It is the only species of the genus Ommatophoca. First described during the Ross expedition in 1841, it is the smallest, least abundant and least well known of the Antarctic pinnipeds. [...] Its distinctive features include disproportionately large eyes, whence its scientific name (Ommato- meaning [...] "eye", and phoca meaning [...] "seal"), and complex, trilling and siren-like vocalizations.|$|E
2500|$|Although Weddell seals, crabeater {{seals and}} leopard seals are {{ubiquitous}} in Antarctic waters, the <b>Ross</b> <b>seal</b> is an uncommon and relatively unknown animal, {{considered to be}} the least common pack ice seal. It almost never leaves the Antarctic Ocean, with the very rare exception of stray animals found around subantarctic islands, and uniquely, off the south coast of Australia. [...] Nonetheless, its distribution is circumpolar, with individuals found in low densities - usually singly - in very thick pack ice in all regions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant <b>seals,</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>seals</b> and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|R

40|$|The {{digestive}} tract {{of a female}} juvenile Hawaiian monk seal was dissected and described. Intestine lengths were measured {{for a total of}} 19 seals ranging in age from 1 day old to over 10 yr old. Small intestine (SI) lengths were measured for 10 seals and ranged from 7. 1 to 16. 2 m; mean SI to standard ventral length (SVL) ratio was 7. 1 ¬± 0. 9 m. Large intestine (LI) lengths were measured for 11 seals and ranged from 0. 4 to 1. 2 m; mean LI: SVL was 0. 5 ¬± 0. 1 m.

SI and LI lengths both exhibited a linear relationship relative to SVL, whereas stomach weight: SVL showed an exponential relationship. TI: SVL was significantly smaller than ratios determined for harbor, harp, and northern elephant seals, but was not significantly different from those of crabeater, leopard, and <b>Ross</b> <b>seals.</b> No correlation was seen between gut length and body length for seven species of seals, including the Hawaiian monk seal...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Ross</b> <b>seal</b> is able {{to produce}} a variety of complex twittering and siren-like sounds that are {{performed}} on ice and underwater, where they carry for long distances. The underwater siren sound can be composed of two harmonically unrelated superimposed tones that are pulsed with the same rhythm. [...] Uniquely, the vocalizations, whether on ice or in water, are made with a closed mouth - emitting no air. The purpose of these sounds is unknown, though their distinctive nature and long range are likely to facilitate either encounters or avoidance of individuals.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} the genetic {{variability}} in Weddell seal from colonies in Terra Nova Bay and Wood Bay, both sites {{located in the}} Ross Sea area, Antarctica. Two mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene, with different mutation rates, were sequenced to investigate the haplotype diversity of the colonies and to test for a possible recent expansion. Fifteen microsatellites were used to analyze their genetic structure. Sequenced genes and microsatellites were also used to estimate the effective population size of the studied colonies and the <b>Ross</b> Sea <b>seal</b> population. The <b>Ross</b> Sea has a high density population of Weddel seals, with an estimated effective number of 50, 000 females, and 1, 341 individuals for the sampling area, possibly due to its high primary production. The colonies showed high diversity (Hd > 0. 90) and many exclusive haplotypes (> 75 %), likely {{a consequence of the}} surprisingly high site fidelity of Weddell seals, despite the proximity of the colonies. Nevertheless, there was low microsatellite differentiation between colonies, suggesting that {{they are part of a}} single larger population. Their expansion seemed to have started during the last glacial cycle (around 58, 000 years ago), indicating that the <b>Ross</b> Sea <b>seal</b> populations have been present in the area for long time, probably due to the lack of hunting by humans and terrestrial predation. As a top predator, the role of Weddell <b>seals</b> in the <b>Ross</b> Sea ecology is crucial, and its demographic dynamics should be monitored to follow the future changes of such an important ecosystem...|$|R

50|$|The Weddell seal {{has perhaps}} the most {{elaborate}} vocal repertoire with separate sounds for airborne and underwater contexts. Underwater vocals include trills, chugs, chirps, chugs and knocks. The calls appear to contain prefixes and suffixes that serve to emphasize a message. The underwater vocals of Weddell seals can last 70 seconds, which is long for a marine mammal call. Some calls have around seven rhythm patterns and are comparable to birdsongs and whalesongs. Similar calls have been recorded in other lobodontine seals and in bearded seals. In some pinniped species, {{there appear to be}} geographic differences in vocalizations, known as dialects, while certain species may even have individual variations in expression. These differences are likely important for mothers and pups who need to remain in contact on crowded beaches. Otariid females and their young use mother-pup attraction calls to help them reunite when the mother returns from foraging at sea. Female pinnipeds are also known to bellow when protecting their young.While most vocals are audible to the human ear, a captive leopard seal was recorded making ultrasonic calls underwater.

40|$|In December 2005 the PerenniAL Acoustic Observatory in the Antarctic Ocean (PALAOA, Hawaiian whale) {{was set up}} on the Ekstr√∂m ice shelf, Antarctica {{near the}} German Neumayer Station (Boebel et al., 2006). Since then it almost continously records the {{underwater}} soundscape {{in the vicinity of the}} shelf ice edge and is intended to do so over the duration of several years. These long-term recordings allow studying the acoustic repertoire of whales and seals in an environment almost undisturbed by humans. The data is analyzed to detect species specific vocalizations, infer the approximate number of animals inside the measuring range, calculate their movements relative to the observatory, and examine possible effects of the sporadic shipping traffic on the acoustic and locomotive behaviour of marine mammals. Underwater sound is recorded by means of four hydrophones located through boreholes below the 100 m thick floating ice sheet. They are attached to an autonomous, wind and solar powered station, which can record at 192 kHz/ 24 Bit. A compressed data stream is transmitted in real time via wireless LAN from PALAOA to the German Neumayer Base at 15 km distance. From there, a permanent satellite link transmits an even more compressed stream to the AWI in Germany. It can be accessed live from our webpage at [URL] So far, Weddell <b>seals,</b> crabeater <b>seals,</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>seals,</b> leopard seals, killer whales, blue whales, fin whales and minke whales have been identified in the recordings along with several vocalizations which could not be assigned certainly to a species yet. Additionally many non-biological sounds were recorded, mostly generated by ice and some anthropogenic events like ships passing by and human activities on the ice. Difficulties arise from the sheer size of this constantly growing dataset, more than 7500 hours so far. We develop interfaces and setups to process this stream in real time and analyze it both interactively and by means of batch processes running in parallel on a workstation cluster, for example applying detectors specific to single species, based on hidden Markov models. These recordings, which are largely free of anthropogenic noise, provide also a base to set up passive acoustic mitigation systems used on research vessels by developing automatic pattern recognition procedures to be used in the presence of interfering sounds, e. g. propeller noise...|$|R

25|$|Sealing at Heard Island {{came to an}} end in {{the late}} 19th century, after the seal populations there had either become locally extinct or reduced to levels too low to exploit economically.

Leopard seals visit regularly in winter to haul-out though they do not breed on the islands. Crabeater, <b>Ross</b> and Weddell <b>seals</b> are occasional visitors.|$|R
2500|$|Despite its name, the crabeater seal {{does not}} feed on crabs (the few crab species in its range are mostly found in very deep water).

These patterns appeared to reflect a close linkage to their known foraging ecology and diving behaviors, and agreed well with their presumed dietary diversity. The more enriched d 13 C and d 15 N values in male Weddell seals than those in females suggested differences in for-aging preferences between them. Significant differences in d 15 N were also found among different age groups of Weddell seals. A strong correlation between the C:N ratios and serum cholesterol was probably due to ex-tremely high cholesterol levels in phocids.
