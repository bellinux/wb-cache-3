5000|$|On July 13, {{the reactor}} {{experienced}} {{a series of}} temperature and radiation fluctuations (known as [...] "excursions", because they were an unexpected departure from expected conditions). The power level rose from about 4 MW to about 14 MW (70 percent of full power) {{over a period of}} about two minutes. The excursion required the operators to manually override a malfunctioning automatic-control switch, and the reactor was shut down. The switch was repaired, and the reactor was slowly restarted. The following day, monitors again indicated elevated airborne radioactivity levels within the reactor building. The source was traced to two locations at the <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> <b>loading</b> face, which were sealed; airborne radioactivity within the reactor building was reduced. The reactor was restarted, but the operators noted unusual behavior over the next few days. The reactor increased power faster than expected, and the temperature difference between the reactor bottom (where the sodium entered) and the reactor top (where the sodium exited) was unusually high. Radioactivity within the reactor also increased. The operators investigated, performing several exercises to understand and correct the reactor behavior.|$|E

It is becoming increasingly necessary to organize a mixed fuel cycle which would be presumed to have ordinary, low-enriched uranium fuel and weapons-grade plutonium fuel in a one-time <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> <b>loading.</b> This research examined {{the problem of how to}} detect the possible substitution of a low-enriched uranium bundle for a bundle containing weapons-grade plutonium.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} analysis of a deterministic optimization scheme termed Greedy Exhaustive Dual Binary Swap for the optimization of nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> <b>loading</b> patterns. The goal of this optimization scheme is to emulate the approach taken by an engineer when manually optimizing a <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> <b>loading</b> pattern. This is to determine if this approach is able to locate high quality patterns that, due to their location in the core loading solution space, are consistently missed by standard stochastic optimization methods {{such as those in}} the genetic algorithm class, or those in the simulated annealing class. This optimization study is carried out using the poropy tool to handle the reactor physics model. Initially, optimizations are carried out using beginning of cycle eigenvalue as a surrogate for core excess reactivity and thus cycle length. The deterministic Dual Binary Swap is found to locate acceptable patterns less reliably than stochastic methods, but those that are located are of higher quality. Optimizations of the full depletion problem result in the deterministic Dual Binary Swap optimizer locating patterns that are of higher quality than those found by the stochastic Simulated Annealing, with comparable frequency. The Dual Binary Swap optimizer is, however, found to be very dependent on the starting core configuration, and can not reliably find a high quality pattern from any given starting configuration. by Carl C.

40|$|Approaches are {{examined}} in the present paper to the application of genetic algorithms for optimization of initial reactor load and subsequent reloading and reshuffling of fuel assemblies in the nuclear reactor core. The issues associated with selection of the optimization criterion, which was chosen to be the nuclear fuel burnup depth, are discussed. The burnup depth is estimated after the fuel assembly is unloaded from the core, i. e. after residence in the reactor core during 3 fuel irradiation campaigns. An important aspect determining {{the efficiency of the}} use of the genetic algorithm in the problem under examination is that the neutronics calculation of the reactor core is to be performed in sufficient details allowing "feeling" the change in the location of the fuel assemblies relative to each other. The use of low-precision instrument results in the uselessness of the proposed approach to the optimization of <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> <b>loading.</b> The opposite extreme, i. e. the excessive degree of details, is associated with significant increase of expended computer CPU time. In the presented paper, the TRIGEX [1, 2] application software package was used in the analysis of neutronics characteristics of the reactor core providing acceptable degree of details and capable to demonstrate sensitivity of the results to the changes in the reactor load arrangement. The genetic algorithm incorporates the use of at least two basic procedures—selection and mutation. One of the most important issues in the application of the genetic algorithm is the definition of the basic concepts, namely the concepts of mutation, crossing, and specimen. The answers to these questions as applicable to the problem under discussion are provided in the present paper. In addition, the main recommendations for the organization of crossing and mutation procedures are also given. The efficiency of use of the developed model of the genetic algorithm is demonstrated by the test example of a BN type reactor. The results of the test run demonstrated that the use of the proposed approach allows searching for optimal reactor load mapping for each separate core reshuffling operation. The main objective of the performed study was to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the new up-to-date approach to solving the problem of fuel loading into a nuclear reactor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn Part I of this paper, the two-temperature homogenized {{model for}} the fully ceramic {{microencapsulated}} fuel, in which tristructural isotropic particles are randomly dispersed in a fine lattice stochastic structure, was discussed. In this model, the fuel-kernel and silicon carbide matrix temperatures are distinguished. Moreover, the obtained temperature profiles are more realistic than those obtained using other models. Using the temperature-dependent thermal conductivities of uranium nitride and the silicon carbide matrix, temperature-dependent homogenized parameters were obtained. In Part II of the paper, coupled with the COREDAX code, a <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> <b>loaded</b> by fully ceramic microencapsulated fuel in which tristructural isotropic particles are randomly dispersed in the fine lattice stochastic structure is analyzed via a two-temperature homogenized model at steady and transient states. The results are compared with those from harmonic- and volumetric-average thermal conductivity models; i. e., we compare keff eigenvalues, power distributions, and temperature profiles in the hottest single channel at a steady state. At transient states, we compare total power, average energy deposition, and maximum temperatures in the hottest single channel obtained by the different thermal analysis models. The different thermal analysis models {{and the availability of}} fuel-kernel temperatures in the two-temperature homogenized model for Doppler temperature feedback lead to significant differences...|$|R

40|$|By now, {{vast amounts}} of {{plutonium}} have been accumulated in spent nuclear fuel from different types of reactors (power, research, propulsion) {{as part of the}} Soviet (Russian) nuclear program. Issues concerned with the future of the accumulated plutonium (or plutonium being accumulated), including its long-term storage, disposal or use as fuel in a closed fuel cycle, require an exact knowledge of where, in what quantities and in what condition plutonium is stored at a particular time point. The existing nuclear material control and accounting system does not provide for the required information. This study deals with the further evolution of a specialized database on civil plutonium (SDBP) in Russia the work on which was started in 2013 and which would allow preparing input data for system analytical investigations to support the decision-making on the future use of civil plutonium in Russia. The prime objective of the study is to enable the selection of technological batches of extracted plutonium for the manufacturing of the BN- 800, BREST and BN- 1200 fast <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> <b>loads.</b> The SDBP can be also used to address a broader range of problems involved in justification of the closed nuclear fuel cycle. Cooperation with such powerful software systems as the CYCLE code will make it possible to perform high-accuracy calculations from a single workplace and within a compressed timeframe.

40|$|AbstractRequired {{properties}} of fast <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> with nitride fuel are reached {{only if the}} fuel it is loaded with is plutonium-based and has strictly determined (equilibrium) isotopic composition and strictly determined plutonium mass fraction (plutonium enrichment).

It {{is not possible to}} predict exactly isotopic composition of plutonium which will be obtained after blending different batches of plutonium. Therefore, measures must be anticipated allowing compensating for the deviations of fuel isotopic composition and enrichment from the designed values. Algorithm accounting for such deviations is required for the purpose. Such algorithm can be built by calculating sensitivity of physical characteristics to the deviations of reactor fuel load. Two approaches to the calculation of sensitivities of reactor parameters to the variation of plutonium isotopic composition are examined.
