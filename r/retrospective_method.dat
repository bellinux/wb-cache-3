5000|$|Before the {{development}} of the current tests for the assessment of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), a <b>retrospective</b> <b>method</b> was used to determine the patient's condition, consisting of one or more interviews with the patient after the episode of PTA was judged to be over. The <b>retrospective</b> <b>method,</b> however, fails to account for the apparent lucidity of patients who are still experiencing substantial disorientation, or the finding that the recovery from post-traumatic amnesia is often characterized by the presence of [...] "islands of memory" [...] (short periods of clarity). A failure to take these facts into consideration may have biased retrospective methods towards underestimating the length and severity of an episode of PTA. Also, the <b>retrospective</b> <b>method</b> relies on retrospective memory, one's memory for past events, which is not very reliable in healthy individuals, and even less so in patients who have recently experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients may also unconsciously or consciously bias their answers because they want to appear more healthy or more ill than they truly were, or because of poor insight. The <b>retrospective</b> <b>method</b> is also flawed because there is no standard measurement procedure. Although the <b>retrospective</b> <b>method</b> may provide useful subjective data, it is not a useful tool for measurement or categorization.|$|E

The three major monetary methods of human capital are the prospective method, the <b>retrospective</b> <b>method</b> and the integrated approach. The income-based approach (prospective method) estimates human capital based on the present value of a person’s future income stream. The cost-based approach (<b>retrospective</b> <b>method)</b> is centered on the “production” costs of human capital, trying to determine the costs of producing human capital by adding up the education and schooling costs. The integrated approach is a mixture of the prospective and <b>retrospective</b> <b>method.</b> On the other side, the non-monetary measures are essentially education-based indicators, such as the literacy rate, the school enrollment rate or the average years of education...|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{a retrospective}} interview was {{employed in the}} study. That is to say, the participants {{took part in a}} retrospective activity in which {{the participants were asked to}} report on their metacognitive awareness after they finished writing. One of the major shortcomings of <b>retrospective</b> <b>methods</b> is that learners may forget the mental processes. Furthermore, memory distortions may disrupt the flow of information. It is also assumed that <b>retrospective</b> <b>methods</b> can assess individuals’ declarative knowledge. This means that the procedural knowledge which is employed in the process of composing is not adequately assessed through interviews. Accordingly, the participants’ may provide the researcher with invalid data. As such, future studies with thinking aloud protocols accompanying the interview would gain a clearer view of the participants’ metacognitive awareness. Moreover, further research with the recruitment of EFL learners from diverse regions of the country is also essential to enhance the generalizability of the findings.|$|R

40|$|Hospitals {{can apply}} {{prospective}} and <b>retrospective</b> <b>methods</b> {{to reduce the}} large number of medical errors. <b>Retrospective</b> <b>methods</b> are used to identify errors after they occur and to facilitate learning. Prospective methods aim to determine, assess and minimise risks before incidents happen. This paper questions whether the order of implementation of those two methods influences the resultant impact on incident reporting behaviour. From November 2007 until June 2008, twelve wards of two Dutch general hospitals participated in a quasi-experimental reversed-treatment non-equivalent control group design. The six units of Hospital 1 first conducted a prospective analysis, after which a sophisticated incident reporting and analysis system was implemented. On the six units of Hospital 2 the two methods were implemented in reverse order. Data from the incident reporting and analysis system and from a questionnaire were used to assess between-hospital differences regarding the number of reported incidents, the spectrum of reported incident types, and the profession of reporters. The results show that carrying out a prospective analysis first can improve incident reporting behaviour in terms of a wider spectrum of reported incident types and a larger proportion of incidents reported by doctors. However, the proposed order does not necessarily yield a larger number of reported incidents. This study fills an important gap in safety management research regarding the order of the implementation of prospective and <b>retrospective</b> <b>methods,</b> and contributes to literature on incident reporting. This research also builds on the network theory of social contagion. The results might indicate that health care employees can disseminate their risk perceptions through communication with their direct colleagues.

40|$|High-resolution {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved {{into one of the}} major non-invasive tools to study the healthy and diseased mouse heart. This study presents a Cartesian CINE MRI protocol based on a fast low-angle shot sequence with a navigator echo to generate cardiac triggering and respiratory gating signals retrospectively, making the use of ECG leads and respiratory motion sensors obsolete. MRI of the in vivo mouse heart using this sequence resulted in CINE images with no detectable cardiac and respiratory motion artefacts. The <b>retrospective</b> <b>method</b> allows for steady-state imaging of the mouse heart, which is essential for quantitative contrast-enhanced MRI studies. A comparison was made between prospective and retrospective methods in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio between blood and myocardial wall, as well as global cardiac functional indices: end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume and ejection fraction. The <b>retrospective</b> <b>method</b> resulted in almost constant left-ventricle wall signal intensity throughout the cardiac cycle, at the expense of a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio between blood and myocardial wall as compared with the prospective method. Prospective and retrospective sequences yielded comparable global cardiac functional indices. The largest mean relative difference found was 8 % for the end-systolic volum...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{explore how}} {{hospital}} management could {{gain a better}} picture of risks to support them in setting priorities for patient safety. Methods and Setting. This study deals with the combined application of prospective and <b>retrospective</b> <b>methods</b> for risk analysis on two units of a Dutch general hospital. In the prospective analyses, employees identified and assessed possible risks in selected processes. In the retrospective analyses, incidents were reported by employees and subsequently investigated. The methods were integrated by using information from retrospective incident reports for prospective risk identification and assessment, and by matching their categorization schemes. Two evaluation forms provided insight into the perceived usefulness of the methods and their integration. Results and Conclusions. For both units, the prospective and retrospective analyses resulted in divergent overviews of risks in terms of nature and magnitude, which suggests that one or both methods were subject to biases. Findings from the evaluation forms showed that both methods were perceived as useful and that triangulation provided additional insight into risks. Due to the convergent evidence, triangulation of prospective and <b>retrospective</b> <b>methods</b> can provide hospital management and frontline staff with a more complete and less biased picture of risks. An integrative approach might be advantageous in terms of efficiency of analysis, setting priorities for patient safety and improving the methods themselves.
