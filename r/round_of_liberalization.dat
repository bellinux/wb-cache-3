50|$|In the mid 1970s, the Shah {{was once}} again taken under the US {{pressure}} for violation {{of the human rights}} and mistreatment of the political prisoners. The paralyzing crisis of the state made the Shah concerned about thefuture of his throne. Although, very undesirable for Shah to introduce another <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> policies, the first round being in the early 1960s, he had no other choice but to do so. Therefore, in the early 1977 Shah announced liberalization policies to gain the US support once again and resolve the crises of the state. In the mid 1977, Shah allowed open discussion forum for the Rastakhiz Party to discuss the social issues publicly. As Amjad quotes Tocqueville in his book,the political liberalization following a long period of repression results in a social upheaval and revolution. In the Iranian case, although the aim of the policy was to appease the oppositions and gain the US support, insteadit provided the suitable condition for the opposition to organize its forces against the regime. Following the liberalization policies, the network of 80,000 mosques run by 180,000 mullahs {{played a crucial role in}} mobilizing the people against the regime.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the determinants of the allocation process of labour time between farm and off-farm activities (OFAs) in north-east rural China during the late 1990 s. The question is addressed {{by means of a}} dedicated fieldwork survey of 450 rural households in a clustering of nine villages in Xinmin County located in Liaoning Province. The econometric methodology consists of deploying a multinomial logit model to track the distribution of OFA employment opportunities. Our results reveal that market forces, rather than overt political connections, are assuming increasing significance, especially for those operating own-account enterprises (OAEs); that birthplace and location remain potent determinants of work destination and earnings capacity; and that being male and single motivates rural inhabitants to seek OFAs to a much greater extent than other household members. These findings have implications for those responsible for framing policy. In particular, a further <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalization</b> to favour OFAs is suggested.

40|$|Abstract: The broadened {{scope of}} the GATT/WTO through {{successive}} <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>liberalization</b> is explained {{as a result of}} trade-partner specificity, linked agreements, and cross retaliation. In more recent years, however, countries have pursued trade liberalization through sector specific zero-for-zero agreements and preferential trade agreements, both of which have a reduced chance of suffering cross retaliation. This increase in unlinked agreements is explained by imperfect observability of trade policies generating gratuitous trade disputes and unjustified cross retaliation. If the dispute generating noise is perfectly correlated across sectors, however, then it provides no reason not to link agreements in a static sense and in many cases incremental linking still produces more liberalization than static linking. It is only when the noise is imperfectly correlated that linking and cross retaliation are problematic so that some sectors can enforce more liberalization in an unlinked agreement. If the correlation drops, the noise increases, or the number of sectors already covered is large, then incremental linking of more sectors is inefficient and countries pursue unlinked agreements...|$|R

However, in subsequent years, no clear pattern emerges for these PCMs. Additionally, the paper accounts for the sensitivity of each industry to the initial level of its tariff and presents evidence showing that while NAFTA had an effect on the PCMs of the group of industries that liberalized in 10 years, no robust effect was found for the group of industries that liberalized in 5 years. The results on the group of industries that liberalized in 10 years suggest that NAFTA sharpened competition and exerted market discipline by forcing firms with market power to set prices closer to marginal costs. The findings on the group of industries that liberalized in 5 years suggest that additional factors may be also playing a role in the containment of their market power...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} a decade since Oudiz and Sachs (1984) first applied game theory {{techniques}} to empirical models {{in an attempt to}} quantify the gains to coordinating the macroeconomic policies of major industrialized economies. A large literature has subsequently emerged, following and extending this research strategy. This paper surveys the empirical evidence from this and the related literature on regime choice. It focusses on the evidence from studies based on small theoretical simulation models, large scale multi-country models and reduced form econometric evidence. There is a widely held view that the empirical evidence shows negligible gains to coordinating macroeconomic policies. This belief is largely based on results from studies that compare optimal cooperative and non-cooperative policy responses to various shocks. Although described as small by most authors, the size of these gains ar similar to the original results of Oudiz and Sachs. These gains are estimated to be between 0. 5 to 1 percent of GDP, or about the size of gains estimated to result from the recent Uruguay <b>Round</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>liberalization.</b> Other studies surveyed in this paper that explicitly deal with uncertainty in the optimizing framework and studies that focus on the performance of alternative policy regimes suggest that the gains to coordinating policies are potentially larger...|$|R
40|$|As {{successive}} <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> {{global trade}} <b>liberalization</b> have lowered broad industry-level tariffs, antidumping duties {{have emerged as}} a WTO-consistent means of protecting certain industries. Using the Grossman-Helpman (GH) "Protection for Sale" model, we examine {{the extent to which}} political contributions affect the outcomes of decisions in antidumping cases. We find that antidumping duty rates tend to be higher for politically-active petitioners. The relationship between the import penetration ratio and duties imposed depends on whether or not petitioners in a case are politically active. Consistent with the predictions of the GH model, antidumping duties are positively correlated with the import penetration ratio for politically inactive petitioners, but negatively correlated for politically active petitioners. Thus, our paper supports the predictions of the Grossman-Helpman model using a fresh set of data that allows us to avoid some of the compromises made in previous empirical work.

The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture. Following the Uruguay <b>Round</b> <b>of</b> multilateral trade <b>liberalization</b> all nontariff barriers to trade were converted, through the process of tariffication, into tariffs. However, in the dairy sector, the border measure most commonly adopted by developed countries was a system of tariff rate quotas. Tariff rate quotas are two-tiered tariffs which allow a small quantity of the product to be imported at a low or zero tariff, while quantities above the minimum access amount are charged much higher and often prohibitive tariffs. Tariff rate quotas cause the excess supply curve facing an importing country to be discontinuous at the minimum access amount. The objective of this paper is to review key issues related to modeling trade liberalization for the international dairy economy, given the existence of tariff rate quotas and export subsidies.
