5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other <b>recommendations</b> <b>that</b> are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{structure}} of the Botanical Code the Cultivated Plant Code is set out {{in the form of an}} initial set of Principles followed by Rules and <b>Recommendations</b> <b>that</b> are subdivided into Articles. Amendments to the Cultivated Plant Code are prompted by international symposia for cultivated plant taxonomy which allow for rulings made by the International Commission on the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants. Each new Cultivated Plant Code includes a summary of the changes made to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995.|$|E

Named for its chairman and principal author, zoologist and conservationist A. Starker Leopold, the report proved influential for future preservation mandates.|$|E

5|$|Despite Blom-Cooper's <b>recommendations</b> <b>that</b> Bird {{never be}} allowed to hold public office again and strong {{opposition}} disapproval, he was made Minister of Science, Technology and Communications in a cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 1996. He soon found himself {{at odds with the}} Prime Minister; after the government announced plans to evict Thomas Bufton and his wife from Guiana Island, where they had lived for 32 years, in order to build a tourist resort, Bird began serving as the Buftons' lawyer. A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird's law offices, during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997; this followed Bird speaking up for the Buftons' cause before voting in support of a motion to allow the police to evict them, using force if necessary. Bufton was later acquitted of attempted murder, but still evicted.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, due {{to further}} cuts in defence {{spending}} and an eagerness {{of the government}} to implement those <b>recommendations</b> <b>that</b> could assist in achieving this goal, units that were unable to meet attendance requirements were disbanded or amalgamated with others, thus further diffusing the community links units had established in their local areas and thus further impacting upon recruitment and retention. Further, {{the decision was made to}} abolish the old CMF divisions, as the role of the Army Reserve would no longer be to act as a skeleton force that would be filled out upon mobilisation, but rather a force that could provide individual sub-units of capability should the need arise to augment the Regular Army. Centralisation of training was also a result of the Millar Report; beforehand, recruit training had been an ad hoc process managed mainly by the units themselves. Other issues such as pay and conditions of service, protection of civilian employment and recruitment and retention were touched upon but remained largely unaddressed until more recently.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} Safety Recommendation {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate safety <b>recommendations</b> <b>that</b> the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E

5|$|The Downtown Transit Project {{subcommittee}} unanimously approved Metro <b>recommendations</b> <b>that</b> {{would reduce}} the number of bus tunnel stations from six to five, saving $35 million, as well as opting for tunnel boring machines for the 3rd Avenue segment to minimize surface-level disruptions that would be present from cut-and-cover excavation. Stations would be located at Union Station south of Jackson Street, under 3rd Avenue and James Street, under 3rd Avenue and University Street, at the Westlake Mall and at 9th Avenue and Pine Street near the Washington State Convention Center. The Metro Council approved the station sites and use of tunnel-boring machines in July 1985, proceeding with final design by approving a $25.9 million contract with Parsons Brinckerhoff for engineering work related to the project.|$|E
