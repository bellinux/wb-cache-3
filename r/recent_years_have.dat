In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews.

5|$|One of these, The Talk of the Town, was {{the first}} three-time World Grand Champion. Midnight Sun was also great-grandsire of I Am Jose, the second three-time winner.

Midnight Sun sired approximately 2,600 foals in his lifetime, and during his stud career earned his owners close to $100,000 a year, mostly through the then-new use of artificial insemination (AI). Through his offspring, he has also influenced the Racking Horse and Spotted Saddle Horse breeds. For many years, a life-size statue of Midnight Sun, commissioned after his death by his former owner Geraldine Livingston, stood at the TWHBEA headquarters in Lewisburg, Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St Peter & St Paul is {{situated}} in {{the centre of the}} town. A church has been on the site since at least 1162, although the current tower dates from 1352. The building had fallen into disrepair during the 19th century, and the majority of the building is the result of an intensive restoration in 1910. This included restoring a pitched roof and adding new aisles, although the nave arches are original. In 1935, a new two manual Harrison & Harrison organ was installed, a fine example of a pneumatic action instrument. <b>Recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> seen the construction of several new facilities, such as the Bricstan room extension. The church lists itself as being of the low church branch of the Church of England. The church also hosts the town's Catholic congregation.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some have even been found to roost in caves and {{possibly}} housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, {{it was found that the}} species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. <b>Recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>have</b> seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.|$|E
