40|$|Friction stir welding is a {{solid-phase}} joining, or {{welding process}} that {{was invented in}} 1991 at The Welding Institute (TWI). The process is potentially capable of joining {{a wide variety of}} aluminum alloys that are traditionally difficult to fusion weld. The friction stir welding (FSW) process produces welds by moving a non-consumable <b>rotating</b> <b>pin</b> tool along a seam between work pieces that are firmly clamped to an anvil. At the start of the process, the <b>rotating</b> <b>pin</b> is plunged into the material to a pre-determined load. The required heat is produced by a combination of frictional and deformation heating. The shape of the tool shoulder and supporting anvil promotes a high hydrostatic pressure along the joint line as the tool shears and literally stirs the metal together. To produce a defect free weld, process variables (RPM, transverse speed, and downward force) and tool pin design must be chosen carefully. An accurate model of the material flow during the process is necessary to guide process variable selection. At MSFC a plastic slip line model of the process has been synthesized based on macroscopic images of the resulting weld material. Although this model appears to have captured the main features of the process, material specific interactions are not understood. The objective of the present research was to develop a basic understanding of the evolution of the microstructure to be able to relate it to the deformation process variables of strain, strain rate, and temperature...|$|E

40|$|In {{friction}} stir welding (FSW), a <b>rotating</b> <b>pin</b> is translated along a {{weld seam}} so as to stir {{the sides of the}} seam together. Metal is prevented from flowing up the pin, which would result in plowing/cutting instead of welding, by a shoulder on the pin. In conventional FSW, the weld metal rests on an "anvil", which supports the heavy "plunge" load on the tool. In this study, both embedded tungsten wires along and copper plating on the faying surfaces were used to trace the flow of AA 2219 weld metal around the C-FSW tool. The effect of tool rotational speed, travel speed, plunge load, and pin thread pitch on the resulting weld metal flow was evaluated.

40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{is a new}} {{solid state}} process for joining metals by {{plasticizing}} and consolidating materials around the bond line using thermal energy producing from frictional forces.

FSW process consists of a special <b>rotating</b> <b>pin</b> tool that is positioned to plunge into the MMC surface at the bond line. As the tool rotates and move forward along the bond line, the material at the bond line is heated up and forced to flow around the rotating tip to consolidate on the tip's backside to form a solid state joint.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between vortices {{in a thin}} superconducting film and one magnetic dipole {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field applied parallel to the film surfaces are studied theoretically in the London limit. The dipole magnetic moment is assumed to have constant magnitude and freedom to <b>rotate.</b> The <b>pinning</b> potential for an arbitrary vortex configuration is calculated exactly. It is found that, due to the dipole freedom to <b>rotate,</b> the <b>pinning</b> potential differs significantly from that for a permanent dipole. In particular, its dependence on the applied field is non-trivial and allows for tuning of the pinning potential by the applied field. The critical current for one vortex pinned by the dipole is obtained numerically as a function of the applied field and found to depend strongly on the field. Order of magnitude changes in the critical current resulting from changes in the direction and magnitude of the applied field are reported, with discontinuous changes taking place in some cases. The effect of vortex pinning by random material defects on the critical current is investigated using a simple model. It is found that if random pinning is weak the critical current remains strongly dependent on the applied field. Possible applications to vortices pinned by arrays of magnetic dots are briefly considered. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} we {{address the problem}} of numerically {{simulating}} the Friction Stir Welding process. Due to the special characteristics of this welding method (i. e., high speed of the <b>rotating</b> <b>pin,</b> very large deformations, etc.) finite element methods (FEM) encounter several difficulties. While Lagrangian simulations suffer from mesh distortion, Eulerian or Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) ones still have difficulties due to the treatment of convective terms, the treatment of the advancing pin, and many others. Meshless methods somewhat alleviate these problems, allowing for an updated La-grangian framework in the simulation. Accuracy is not affected by mesh distortion (and hence the name meshless), but the price to pay is the computational cost, higher than in the FEM. The method used here, the Natural Element Method (NEM), presents some inter-esting characteristics, such as the ease of imposition of essential boundary conditions and coupling with FEM codes. Evenmore, since the method is formulated in a La-grangian setting, it is possible to track the evolution of any material point during the process and also to simulate the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) of two slabs of different materials...|$|E
