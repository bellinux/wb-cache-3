50|$|A special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> {{obtained}} in an auction is not transferable, {{that is to}} say, the number can be used only on vehicles registered {{under the name of}} the buyer. Transferring a special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> from one vehicle to another is permitted provided that they are both owned by the same person. Sale or transfer of vehicles bearing a special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> to someone else would lose that special <b>registration</b> <b>mark.</b> If the buyer is assigned the special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> to a vehicle, and later dies, the special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> cannot be transferred together with the vehicle to his heirs. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} consider in whose name one should buy a special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> in an auction. The use of a limited liability company as the buyer gets around the non-transferrable restriction because of its perpetual succession and the ability to transfer the company shares.|$|E
