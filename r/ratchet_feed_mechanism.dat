50|$|The {{machine gun}} feeds from the {{left-hand}} side {{through a variety}} of disintegrating ammunition belt types: the American M13 linked belt, the German DM6 counterpart to the M13 or the segmented German DM1 belt. The <b>ratcheting</b> wheel <b>feed</b> unit was designed as an easily removable module that is inserted into the bottom portion of the feed block (installed in place of the standard magazine well), below the barrel axis. As a result of this configuration (the bolt passes over the belt), the ammunition belt is aligned upside down compared to most other belt-fed weapons (that is, the links face downward). The <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism</b> is actuated by the reciprocating movement of the bolt; a curved cam slot {{on the bottom of the}} bolt engages an actuator in the <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism,</b> rotating the double sprockets and positioning a new round in the feed path. Simple conversion from belt to magazine feed is possible by installing an adapter in the feed block which enables the use of H&K’s proprietary 20-round box magazine (from the G3 rifle) or a 50-round drum magazine. The HK21 uses a modified G3 receiver that has been extended to the front sight base and is equipped with a detachable bipod (mounted either in front of the <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism</b> or at the muzzle) and tripod and vehicle mounting points. The HK21 has close to a 48% parts interchangeability with the G3.|$|R

40|$|Three {{types of}} <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are known in dinoflagellates: pallium feeding, tube feeding, and direct engulfment. Pallium feeding {{has only been}} {{described}} for heterotrophic thecate species (Protoperidinium, Diplopsalis group). Tube feeding is commonly found among both naked and thecate species of mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates (e. g. Amphidinium, Dinophysis, Gyrodinium, Peridiniopsis). Direct engulfment is mainly found among naked species(e. g. Gymnodinium, Gyrodinium, Noctiluca); recently, however, some thecate species {{have been shown to}} use this <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> as well. <b>Feeding</b> behavior in dinoflagellates involves several steps prior to actual ingestion, including precapture, capture, and prey manipulation. As <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> allow the ingestion of relatively large prey or parts thereof, dinoflagellates are regarded as raptorial feeders. While prey size {{plays an important role in}} the ability of dinoflagellates to ingest food, this alone cannot explain observed prey preferences.

40|$|The elasmobranch fishes {{possess a}} {{remarkable}} diversity of <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{for a group}} containing relatively few species (~ 1200). The three most prevalent of these mechanisms involve prey capture during which the predator overtakes its prey (ram), prey is drawn {{into the mouth of}} the predator (suction), and relatively stationary consumption of sessile or substrate affixed prey (biting). Biomechanical modeling of cranial force distributions, in situ bite performance trials, and kinematic analysis of prey capture behaviors were employed to identify morphological and behavioral specializations and constraints associated with these <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in lemon Negaprion brevirostris (ram), whitespotted bamboo Chiloscyllium plagiosum (suction), and horn Heterodontus francisci (biting) sharks. Biomechanical modeling of the forces generated by the cranial musculature was used to theoretically estimate the maximum bite force and mechanical loadings occurring throughout the hyostyl ic jaw suspension mechanisms of each species, characterized by suspensory hyomandibular cartilages between the back of the jaws and cranium and anterior ligamentous attachments. To assess the mechanical factors involved in the evolution of elasmobranch jaw suspension <b>mechanisms,</b> the <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the sharpnose sevengill shark Heptranchias perlo was modeled as well. Heptranchias perlo possesses an ancestral amphistylic jaw suspension mechanism including non-suspensory hyomandibular cartilages, a large post-orbital articulation between the jaws and cranium, and anterior ligamentous attachments. Theoretical estimates of maximum bite force were compared to voluntary bite forces measured during in situ bite performance trials. Voluntary bite force measurements allowed the quantification of discrete behavioral attributes of bite force application in each species. To further assess the behavioral specializations associated with these <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> high-speed digital videography w as used to analyze the prey capture cranial kinematics of species.

40|$|Flexible Multibody System Dynamics (FMSD) is a {{simulation}} technique {{that can be}} used to study the behavior of the mechanical systems that consists of one or more deformable bodies. A deformable body can be modeled using a number of approaches while the floating frame of reference formulation is a widely used approach. In that approach, flexibility within Multibody System Dynamics (MSD) is described by employing the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with a modal reduction approach. The applicability of an FMSD in the <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of vertebrate structures is tested in order to utilize the potential of the method in biological research. Flexible Multibody System Dynamics is explored studying the <b>feeding</b> <b>mechanism</b> in a skull of Edingerella madagascariensis.

50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge.
