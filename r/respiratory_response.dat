50|$|Investigation of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> to Acute {{intermittent}} hypoxia (AIH), repeated {{episodes of}} hypoxia, reveals connection to various breathing disorders, such as Rett syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. AIH leads to persistent increases in respiratory frequency and amplitude of integrated motor neuronal bursts in vivo. These changes lasting for 90 minutes or longer are termed long-term facilitation (LTF). AIH causes homeostatic changes in multiple {{sites of the}} respiratory system; the pre-BötC is likely {{the site for the}} LTF, since intermittent hypoxia causes an increase in persistent frequency after ongoing hypoxia.The respiratory system is regulated by multiple forms of long-term synaptic plasticity.The role of synaptic inhibition has been proved widespread and critical within the expiratory Botzinger complex respiratory network, through cross-correlation and antidromic mapping techniques. The inhibitory connections discovered indicate their ability to connect different classes of neurons, their importance in regulating the interval of inspiration, and their ability to control driving potential of respiratory neurons. These characteristics show the interaction between the parafacial respiratory group and the pre-Bötzinger complex, which allows for active expiration to be produced by synaptic inhibition within the respiratory network. Synaptic inhibition is critical for allowing the pre-Bötzinger complex to communicate with other respiratory centers in order to generate respiratory activity.|$|E

Hypoxic <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> was produced by ventilating the rabbit with 10 % O 2 -balance 90 % N 2 for 5 minutes. The responses of phrenic nerve discharge to hypoxia were observed before and after microinjecting PTK inhibitor genistein, AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX, or inactive PTK inhibitor analogue daidzein at the region of ambiguus nucleus (NA) at levels 0 - 2 mm rostral to obex where the inspiratory subgroup of VRC were recorded.

The current study examines the effects of inhibition of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex during presentation of stressors of various lengths and intensities in conscious unrestrained rats. 8 Wistar rats were implanted with bilateral guide cannulas targeting the prelimbic prefrontal cortex and received microinjections of either saline of GABAA agonist muscimol prior to recording sessions.

40|$|The {{carbon balance}} of Arctic {{ecosystems}} is particularly sensitive to global environmental change. Leaf respiration (R), a temperature-dependent key process {{in determining the}} carbon balance, is not well understood in Arctic plants. The potential for plants to acclimate to warmer conditions could strongly impact future global carbon balance. Two key unanswered questions are (1) whether short-term temperature responses can predict long-term respiratory responses to growth in elevated temperatures and (2) {{to what extent the}} constant daylight conditions of the Arctic growing season inhibit leaf respiration. In two dominant Arctic species Eriophorum vaginatum (tussock grass) and Betula nana (woody shrub), we assessed the extent of respiratory inhibition in the light (RL/RD), <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> to short-term temperature change, and respiratory acclimation to long-term warming treatments. We found that R of both species is strongly inhibited by light (averaging 35 % across all measurement temperatures). In E. vaginatum both RL and RD acclimated to the long-term warming treatment, reducing the magnitude of <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> relative to the short-term response to temperature increase. In B. nana, both RL and RD responded to short-term temperature increase but showed no acclimation to the long-term warming. The ability to predict plant <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> to global warming with short-term temperature responses will depend on species-specific acclimation potential and the differential response of RL and RD to temperature.

Serotonin is a potent modulator of cortical and respiratory activity through 5 -HT 2 receptors. Present study investigated whether 5 -HT 2 receptors might {{be involved in the}} EEG and respiratory relationship during normoxic and hypoxic respiration assessed from integrated phrenic (Phr) and hypoglossal (HG) nerve activities. EEG signal recorded from the frontal cortex was subjected to power spectral analysis in delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Systemic administration of 5 -HT 2 agonist DOI (1 -(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -iodophenyl) - 2 -aminopropane) enhanced tonic and lowered peak phasic respiratory activity, and increased frequency of bursts of Phr and HG activity. At the same time, EEG activity became desynchronized and arterial blood pressure (ABP) increased. Following DOI pretreatment, 11 % hypoxia induced an augmented <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> in comparison with the response in the baseline condition. ABP fell less then in the control hypoxia. EEG pattern changed less than in the baseline state.

40|$|The {{respiratory}} {{regulatory system}} {{is one of}} the most extensively studied homeostatic systems in the body. Despite its deceptively mundane physiological function, the mechanism underlying the robust control of the motor act of breathing in the face of constantly changing internal and external challenges throughout one's life is still poorly understood. Traditionally, control of breathing has been studied with a highly reductionist approach, with specific stimulus-response relationships being taken to reflect distinct feedback/feedforward control laws. It is assumed that the overall <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> could be described as the linear sum of all unitary stimulus-response relationships under a Sherringtonian framework. Such a divide-and-conquer approach has proven useful in predicting the independent effects of specific chemical and mechanical inputs. However, it has limited predictive power for the <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> in realistic disease states when multiple factors come into play. Instead, vast amounts of evidence have revealed the existence of complex interactions of various afferent-efferent signals in defining the overall <b>respiratory</b> <b>response.</b> This thesis aims to explore the nonlinear interaction of afferents in respiratory control. In a series of computational simulations, it was shown that the <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> in humans during muscular exercise under a variety of pulmonary gas exchange defects is consistent with an optimal interaction of mechanical and chemical afferents. This provides a new understanding on the impacts of pulmonary gas exchange on the adaptive control of the exercise <b>respiratory</b> <b>response.</b> Furthermore, from a series of in-vivo neurophysiology experiments in rats, it was discovered that certain respiratory neurons in the dorsolateral pons in the rat brainstem integrate central and peripheral chemoreceptor afferent signals in a hypoadditive manner. Such nonlinear interaction evidences classical (Pavlovian) conditioning of chemoreceptor inputs that modulate the respiratory rhythm and motor output. These findings demonstrate a powerful gain modulation function for control of breathing by the lower brain. The computational and experimental studies in this thesis reveal a form of associative learning important for adaptive control of respiratory regulation, at both behavioral and neuronal levels. Our results shed new light for future experimental and theoretical elucidation of the mechanism of respiratory control from an integrative modeling perspective. by Chung Tin. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Here, {{we take a}} first step towards this goal and investigate whether event-related <b>respiratory</b> <b>responses</b> can be identified, and whether they are accessible to a model-based approach. New methodWe regard <b>respiratory</b> <b>responses</b> as the output of a linear time invariant system that receives brief inputs after psychological events. We derive average responses to visual targets, aversive stimulation, and viewing of arousing pictures, in interpolated respiration period (RP), respiration amplitude (RA), and respiratory flow rate (RFR). We then base a Psychophysiological Model (PsPM) on these averaged event-related responses. The PsPM is inverted to yield estimates of cognitive input into the respiratory system. This method is validated in an independent data set. ResultsAll three measures show event-related responses, which are captured as non-zero response amplitudes in the PsPM. Amplitude estimates for RA and RFR distinguish between picture viewing and the other tasks. This pattern is replicated in the validation experiment.

Adult male Wistar rats (n = 8) received microinjections of GABA A agonist muscimol or saline into the amygdala bilaterally and were subjected to a respiratory recording using whole body plethysmography. Presentation of acoustic stimuli (500 -ms white noise, 40 – 90 dB) caused transient <b>responses</b> in <b>respiratory</b> rate that were proportional to the stimulus intensity, ranging from + 13 ± 9 cpm to + 276 ± 67 cpm for 40 - and 90 -dB stimuli, respectively.

The medullary e. c. f. pH change following a rapid step-change in end-tidal PCO 2 requires at least 5 min for a new steady state to be achieved. Steady-state studies in twenty-six cats show: (a) that the <b>respiratory</b> <b>response</b> to progressive hypercapnic stimulation of the central chemoreceptors is curvilinear (Eldridge, Gill-Kumar & Millhorn, 1981), (b) {{that the relationship between}} increasing end-tidal PCO 2 and medullary hydrogen ion concentration [(H+]) or changes of pH is linear (r = 0. 995); a doubling of PCO 2 causes 0. 260 units pH change, (c) there is a curvilinear relationship between e. c. f.

We conclude that medullary e. c. f. pH measured by means of a surface electrode accurately reflects the CO 2 -induced [H+] stimulus to respiration.
