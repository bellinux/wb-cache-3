50|$|DEME has a {{fleet of}} almost 300 vessels, among which over 80 main {{dredging}} and hydraulic engineering vessels. At the end of 2009 DEME owned and operated 25 trailing suction hopper dredgers (TSHDs such as the Jade River) with a capacity from 1,635 to 30,000 m3. They include the 24,130 m3 Pearl River {{which was the first}} megatrailer in the world when she was commissioned in 1994. At the same date the group owned and operated 20 cutter suction dredgers (CSD's), whose installed power is between 441 kW and 28,200 kW. The CSD fleet includes the world's heaviest self-propelled and ocean-going <b>rock</b> <b>breaker,</b> the 28,200 kW d'Artagnan. d'Artagnan was built for DEME's French subsidiary Société de Dragage International (SDI) and launched in 2005.

The process flow involved - <b>rock</b> <b>breaker,</b> converter kettles for 12 hours desulphurising process, then to the lead furnaces. A new electric plant was also installed.A new lead furnace was blown in on 21 January 1908. However in 1908 there was hardly a mine operating outside of the company mines as an outcome of wage increases with the emergence of unions and declining copper prices. The new copper furnace was blown in on 20 February 1908 and the converter plant was operating effectively by early March that year. Much better lead recoveries were noticeable after the second converter was introduced into the line, and ores had to be preliminarily roasted as well. At a cost of £70,000 the Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company Pty Limited could treat sulphide ores from its Mungana mines as well as public ore. They could also treat the Penzance (Redcap), Boomerang (Calcifer) and Calcifer slag dump material, along with self-fluxing mixture with Ruddygore ore. To achieve this the company had to extend its tramline from the Chillagoe railway at Harper Siding to the Boomerang and Calcifer slag dump.|$|E

This paper seeks to highlight how the RTK GPS from Trimble is being employed at Gold Fields Ghana Limited, Tarkwa Mine to provide accurate drill depth and drill pattern design. The usage, problems, processing and efficiency of this system in a mining environment is also explored. It also looks at the level of accuracies provided by this system. Before the introduction of RTK GPS into the blasting process, the current blast fragmentation was resulting in sub-optimal feed size to crushers on the Mine and an unfriendly floor conditions resulting in excessive sheeting of digging floor to prevent tyre damage. It was decided to use RTK GPS to improve the fragmentation through accurate drill depth and design pattern in order to achieve a constant throughput to the north heap leach crusher of 1500 t/hr, a 5 % increase in pit loading efficiency and a 50 % decrease in <b>rock</b> <b>breaker</b> hours, equipment damage costs and in-pit sheeting costs respectively. This paper is intended to take the reader through the application of RTK GPS in accurate drill depth and drill pattern which have resulted in a 10 % reduction in loading times, of which half has been attributed to improved fragmentation, as well as a substantial increase in blasted stocks whiles <b>rock</b> <b>breaker</b> hours have also decreased resulting in substantial financial gains to the company.

To deal with this, rockbreakers are placed {{at the top of the}} mine shafts to crush these before transport. The reasons for having a <b>rock</b> <b>breaker</b> is to prevent large {{boulders}} to block the ore shafts, crushes or the filling station. This also gives a opportunity to discover unwanted objects such as rock bolts and other metal objects. Today it takes quite a lot of time to steer the rockbreaker arm into the right position. The operator also has to check every bucket emptied by the loader, on the grizzly. If the grizzly is empty, the operator gives a clear signal. There is not a range camera on the market today that can meet the requirement that are needed for scanning such a large area in such environment. The project consists of constructing a range camera, made of a CCD camera and a light projector, in order to get a 3 D image over the rock. The report is describing the range camera and the possible setups and alterations for it.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the automatization of a <b>rock</b> <b>breaker</b> boom {{equipped with a}} hydraulic hammer. The studied use case of an automatized breaker boom consists of trajectory generation from a standby position to preprogrammed locations on a steel grid. The operator shall {{be able to choose}} a specific location of the grid from a user interface and the boom shall automatically move above the chosen location, do an approach movement towards the grid and switch the hydraulic hammer on when contact with an external object is detected. During this sequence the angle of the rock hammer should be constantly maintained at vertical orientation relative to the grid. The developed solution for contact detection is based on impedance control, which is a form of indirect force control built on top of an underlying operational-space tool centre control scheme. To implement impedance control for hydraulic manipulators, pressure sensors and knowledge of boom kinematics and dynamics are necessary. In its simplest form, modeled configuration-dependent gravitational forces affecting the hydraulic cylinders are subtracted from pressure readings and mapped into forces affecting in Cartesian space to yield a rough estimate of contact forces affecting on the manipulator. The estimated contact forces are then filtered into a position modification that indirectly regulates the force affecting on the tool tip of the manipulator. The force tracking performance is dependent on the underlying position controller, which is why the control scheme is referred to as position-based impedance control. In this thesis, an impedance controller was developed for a four degrees-of-freedom hydraulic manipulator and it was verified using a simulation model of the manipulator. The sequence was implemented on the actual breaker plant and a simple position controller was tuned, but the original objective of identifying dynamic parameters and testing of the impedance controller for contact detection {{as a part of the}} automatic sequence was not met...|$|E

40|$|The {{depth of}} permafrost, defined as {{continuous}}, {{in the upper}} terrace in Seymour Island (Marambio Island) near James Ross Island in the Weddel Sea, exceeds 180 m. In continuous permafrost regions in Arctic and Antarctic regions, ice-wedge is a common feature. Ice-wedge is a wedge-shaped ground ice developed into the frozen ground. The origin of ice-wedge is frostcracking caused by thermal contraction in cold environment. In the wintertime, {{the upper part of}} frozen ground is cooled to - 30 ℃ or lower temperature. Then the frozen ground tends to shrink and large shear stress causes cracks due to fracture of the frozen layer. In spring and summer, melt water percolates into open cracks and in-situ freezing takes place. Repeated cycles of crack development and melt water during the winter months cause the ice to grow into the frozen ground. The severe winter coldness and the warm summer melting ice account for the formation of ice-wedge. The characteristics of ice-wedge were studied by excavation of frozen ground using the <b>rock</b> <b>breaker</b> and the boring machine at three different locations on the upper terrace (+ 200 m above sea level). The vertical profile of ice-wedge shows it is 180 cm deep and 40 cm wide at the top. Compared with ice-wedge in Arctic regions, ice-wedge in Seymour Island is smaller than the latter. Ice structure of ice-wedge with oriented air bubbles in it is clearly visible. The high salt concentration is observed by the chemical analysis of melt water. Especially concentration of NaCl is half sea water. Ice-wedge has grown into the Tertiary bedrock. Formation of new frost cracks was monitored by changing the distance between two poles over the ice-wedge head. Widening of cracks by 2 mm was observed in midwinter. This observation implies the ice-wedge formation is active under the present climatic conditions. However, the water content in the upper active layer is very small and a little water is supplied during the summer season. Thus, the growth rate of ice-wedge is lower than that in Arctic regions. The age of ice-wedge is estimated as older than 10000 years based upon the comparison with those in Arctic environment...|$|E
40|$|Articulated {{machines}} such as load-haul-dump machines, {{wheel loaders}} and haulers operate {{in many different}} environments and driving conditions. In particular {{they need to be}} able to perform well with road conditions and loads that can change drastically, setting hard requirements on performances and robustness. The control challenges for off-road vehicles are hence quite different from standard cars or trucks, which mostly drive on regular roads. An important aspect characterising this is the fact that wheel slip may cause severe damage to the wheels and ground. Particularly, tyre lifespan is a serious problem since for instance in a modern hauler the tyres often represents 20 %- 25 % of a hauler overall operating cost. Better traction control algorithms can strongly contribute to reducing tyre wear and hence operating costs. Increasing fuel prices and increasing environmental awareness have influenced all the main vehicle manufacturers so that the commitment towards less fuel consumption has become one of the main goals for development. During the last few years’ hybrid vehicles have been vigorously developed. For wheel loaders, in particular, the series hybrid concept seems to be suitable whereby a diesel engine generates electricity for a battery that serves as the power source of the individual wheel motors, enabling regenerative braking as well as partial recovery of the energy necessary to lift the load. Hence, traction control algorithms should be adapted for use with individual wheel drives. Load-haul-dump machines, wheel loaders and haulers are sometimes used in cyclic operations in isolated areas, which is a typical driver for automation. The use of the loadhaul-dump machine in underground hard rock mines such as iron ore mines is one example where the conditions for automation are excellent. The working conditions for a driver in the cabin are monotone. The working conditions are improved by moving the driver from the machine to a control room and alternate between different remote operations, for instance between load-haul-dump machines and remote controlled <b>rock</b> <b>breaker.</b> Moving the driver from the cabin to the control room also have a positive effect on the personnel costs since one operator can handle several machines. However, for the automation to be successful, the cycle time and loading capacity of an automated machine has to match a manual machine operated by skilled drivers. A challenge is the remote bucket filling, where traditional tele remote loading is based only on slightly delayed video feedback from the machine. This is in sharp contrast to the manual loading where the driver close the loop based on non-delayed 3 D vision of the machine relative the pile as well as listening to the noise and sensing the vibrations of the machine.
