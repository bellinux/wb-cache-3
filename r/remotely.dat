5|$|Proposed {{pathfinder}} {{version with}} <b>remotely</b> operated tail guns and powered by Conway engines. Rejected {{in favour of}} Valiant B.2.|$|E
5|$|Classes {{began at}} 8:30 that morning. Kehoe had set {{an alarm clock}} in the {{basement}} of the north wing of the school, and <b>remotely</b> detonated the dynamite and pyrotol which he had hidden there at about 8:45a.m.|$|E
5|$|Its {{early life}} was fraught with {{technical}} difficulties, but {{the size of}} the maintenance team has been reduced from 30 in 1989 to 12 in 2010. Maintenance of the penstocks, which formerly required them to be drained, is now done using a <b>remotely</b> operated underwater vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The opening was a placid Nimzo-Indian Defence, {{and after}} 17...Ba4 {{the game was}} even (Filip). After a series of piece exchanges the {{position}} in the diagram was reached after 29.b5. It {{appeared to be a}} dead-drawn ending, and no one would have been <b>remotely</b> surprised if the players had agreed to a draw here.|$|E
5|$|The {{statements}} {{cited by}} Universal {{recognize that the}} Donkey Kong theme loosely evokes the King Kong films. However, none of the statements <b>remotely</b> suggests that the authors were {{under the impression that}} Donkey Kong was connected with the company holding the King Kong trademark.|$|E
5|$|Wade Load (voiced by Tahj Mowry): a 10-year-old {{computer}} genius who informs Kim and Ron about upcoming missions {{from his}} bedroom, <b>remotely</b> assisting, guiding and equipping them with useful tools, weapons and gadgets, including Kim's Kimmunicator, via which he communicates and provides his teammates with vital information. Wade is {{also responsible for}} maintaining Kim's website.|$|E
5|$|When Catwoman rejects Cobblepot's advances, he attacks {{her with}} his {{helicopter}} umbrella. Fleeing the police, Batman realizes that Cobblepot is <b>remotely</b> controlling the Batmobile, taking it on a rampage through Gotham. Batman records the Penguin's insults about how gullible the Gotham citizens are and disables the device.|$|E
5|$|All new MRT lines built {{since the}} North East Line in 2003 are {{equipped}} with moving block CBTC from the outset, and {{have the capability to}} be completely driverless and automated, require no onboard staffing. Operations are monitored <b>remotely</b> from the operations control centre of the respective lines. Trains {{are equipped with}} intercoms to allow passengers to communicate with staff in emergencies.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of <b>remotely</b> operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class <b>remotely</b> operated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|An {{operation}} is {{launched by the}} task force {{to take back the}} site from Zakhaev’s forces via halo jump. However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and <b>remotely</b> destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E
5|$|As {{the program}} (and PAVN air defences) evolved, {{so did the}} relay aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be <b>remotely</b> piloted, and which had undergone primary mission equipment and PME flight tests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E
5|$|At Thap Kaew, ML Pin also {{arranged}} {{for the construction of}} the Sound Library, a <b>remotely</b> accessible on-demand audio collection. King Bhumibol Adulyadej donated recordings of his speeches to the library, and later remote access via radio from Bangkok was developed, but the library was not maintained after ML Pin's presidency ended and thus fell into disuse.|$|E
5|$|At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in {{a heavily}} weaponized {{version of the}} Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko <b>remotely</b> takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's {{bodyguard}} Happy Hogan go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko seemingly commits suicide by blowing up his suit.|$|E
5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and <b>remotely</b> operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) {{can carry}} out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E
5|$|Crash Boom Bang! {{features}} forty mini-games {{that can}} be played alone or <b>remotely</b> against friends. Balance, timing, and intelligence are required to win these mini-games. When a player is not {{taking part in a}} mini-game, he or she can bet Wumpa Fruit on the winner. The player can help players that have been bet on or obstruct players that have not been bet on by using the Motion Panel. If the player has a special item, the player can access the Shop screen from the Bet screen and buy or sell items.|$|E
5|$|Georgian forces {{started moving}} towards Tskhinvali {{following}} {{several hours of}} bombardment and engaged South Ossetian forces and militia near the town at 04:00 on 8 August, with Georgian tanks <b>remotely</b> shelling South Ossetian positions. An attempt to take the village of Kvaysa from the west of South Ossetia by the Georgian special forces was thwarted by a platoon of South Ossetian troops occupying fortified positions; several Georgian soldiers were wounded. By the morning, the South Ossetian authorities had reported that the Georgian shelling had killed at least 15 civilians.|$|E
5|$|IAF {{aircraft}} carried {{electronic countermeasures}} pods to foil radar tracking. The IAF command post in Tel Aviv provided Ivry a real-time command {{picture of the}} air battle through various data links. E-2Cs with airborne surveillance radar down-linked their pictures to the command post. A squadron of Tadiran Mastiff and IAI Scout <b>Remotely</b> Piloted Vehicles (RPV) kept at least two vehicles in the air all the time, providing constant location of the SAM batteries. A two-way voice communications link between Ivry and his pilots was set up, allowing for real-time command.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017 the {{critical}} WiFi vulnerability BroadPwn affecting many iOS devices, including the iPad 2 was published. It allows an attacker to <b>remotely</b> {{take control of}} all affected devices within WiFi range without any user interaction. Since iOS 9 is in its end of life the iPad 2 won't receive a security patch for this vulnerability, making it dangerous to use them further.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, {{shortly after}} the game's main release, a PlayStation 4 version was announced; {{it would not be}} {{released}} until January of the following year. In a January 2014 interview, Rollins mentioned internal discussions of creating a PlayStation Vita version of Don't Starve, citing massive community interest in playing it on the PlayStation 4 <b>remotely.</b> An iOS edition was released in July 2014. The company is also considering other mobile phone adaptations, as well as a potential sequel, but is not prioritizing them.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, {{as is the}} case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops <b>remotely</b> and use additional battle commands.|$|E
5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and <b>remotely</b> controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|Other funded {{improvements}} to the A-10 fleet include a new data link, the ability to employ smart weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser, {{and the ability to}} carry an integrated targeting pod such as the Northrop Grumman LITENING or the Lockheed Martin Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). Also included is the <b>Remotely</b> Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) to provide sensor data to personnel on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Ripley {{discovers that}} Burke sent the colonists to {{investigate}} the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the eggs, believing he could become wealthy by recovering alien specimens for use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop informs the group of a greater danger: The power plant was damaged by the dropship crash and will soon explode {{with the force of}} a 40-megaton thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter and <b>remotely</b> pilot the Sulacos remaining dropship to the surface.|$|E
5|$|SAM {{has been}} used as a source of {{alignments}} for protein structure prediction to participate in the CASP structure prediction experiment and to develop a database of predicted proteins in the yeast species S. cerevisiae. HHsearch is a software package for the detection of <b>remotely</b> related protein sequences based on the pairwise comparison of HMMs. A server running HHsearch (HHpred) was by far the fastest of the 10 best automatic structure prediction servers in the CASP7 and CASP8 structure prediction competitions.|$|E
5|$|Shortwave {{listening}} also remains {{popular with}} some expatriates who tune in shortwave transmissions from their homeland. Additionally, {{a number of}} <b>remotely</b> controlled shortwave receivers located {{around the world are}} available to users on the web. While radio hobbyists report that the number of shortwave listening clubs has diminished and printed magazines devoted to the hobby are few, enthusiasts such as Glenn Hauser and others continue to populate web sites, and originate podcasts dedicated to the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{can swim}} rather slowly by {{opening and closing}} its valves. It {{advances}} in this way with {{the rim of the}} shell to the front. It can detect the movement of nearby objects with its rudimentary eyes and, in order to escape predators, can move much more swiftly umbones first, by clapping its valves shut. A <b>remotely</b> controlled camera stationed on the sea bed is apt to find that all the scallops that were originally in its field of view have moved off to other locations.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{has helped}} autistic {{individuals}} bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing {{that they find}} so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work <b>remotely.</b> Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox One {{controller}} {{includes a}} micro USB port; when attached via a micro-USB cable, the controller can operate without battery power and can charge <b>remotely,</b> and is supported on computers running Windows 7 or later with drivers. The Xbox One Wireless Adapter accessory allows wireless use of Xbox One controllers on Windows computers also running Windows 7 or later.|$|E
5|$|The game {{introduces}} a fast travel system, allowing Batman to <b>remotely</b> summon his plane (the Batwing) to transport him {{to other areas}} of the game world quicker than gliding or grappling could. Enemy tower installations prevent Batman from summoning the craft in some areas, and must be disabled to make the Batwing (not player-controlled) available. Some towers may be disabled only when the player has the necessary equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} operation {{was guided by}} the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) with resources from the Canadian Forces, Canadian Coast Guard, RCMP, and other agencies. The area was surveyed using route survey sonar, laser line scanners, and <b>remotely</b> operated vehicles (ROVs) to locate items. After being located, the debris was then recovered (initially by divers and ROVs, later by dredging and trawling).|$|E
5|$|The search {{team and}} {{equipment}} {{had to be}} organised within four months, {{to take advantage of}} a narrow window of calm conditions in the North Atlantic. Organisation of the search was complicated by the presence on board of a documentary team and their film equipment, along with a television journalist who made live news reports via satellite during the search. The search team also planned to stream video from the <b>remotely</b> operated underwater vehicle (ROV) directly to Channel 4's website.|$|E
5|$|The subte {{operations}} are radio-controlled and monitored <b>remotely</b> from the Metrovías Central Operations Post (PCO in Spanish). In it, 24 operators have been monitoring {{four of the}} six subway lines (lines C and H have separate monitoring) since 2001. As of 2015, last formations arrive at their respective terminals at approximately 11:30pm, where maintenance and cleaning operations take place until about 04:00am.|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} economy of {{multiple}} rocket launchers (MRL) have {{led them to}} continue to be developed. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha-like MRL, notably the BM-21 launchers somewhat inspired by the earlier weapon, and the larger BM-27. Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha-type multiple launch rocket systems, including bomblet submunitions, <b>remotely</b> deployed land mines, and chemical warheads.|$|E
5|$|Video {{games are}} played using a {{controller}} to create results on a screen. They {{can also be}} played online with participants joining in <b>remotely.</b> In {{the second half of}} the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world. Video games are popular in East Asian countries such as South Korea.|$|E
5|$|X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse is not set in any {{particular}} Marvel Comics universe. The game takes place some time after the events of X-Men Legends. The mutant supervillain Apocalypse, having witnessed the X-Men's defeat of Magneto <b>remotely,</b> declares that the Age of Apocalypse is nigh. Prior to the game's campaign he kidnaps Professor X and Polaris for unknown purposes. Locations include a military prison in Greenland, the fictional mutant sanctuary of Genosha, the Savage Land and Egypt.|$|E
