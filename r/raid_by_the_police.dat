6000|$|There {{was nothing}} either meretricious or {{sinister}} in {{the aspect of}} that favored resort, the Cockpit, as the Decade Club was familiarly called by its friends--and enemies. Two young Merton men and the freshman from New, who were enjoying their Christmas vacation in town, and had been dining with Maitland, were a little disappointed in {{the appearance of the}} place. They had hoped to knock mysteriously at a back door in a lane, and to be shown, after investigating through a loopholed wicket, into a narrow staircase, which, again, should open on halls of light, full of blazing wax candles and magnificent lacqueys, while a small mysterious man would point out the secret hiding-room, and the passages leading on to the roof or into the next house, in case of a <b>raid</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> Such was the old idea of a [...] "Hell;" [...] but the advance of Thought has altered all these early notions. The Decade Club was like any other small club. A current of warm air, charged with tobacco-smoke, rushed forth into the frosty night when the swinging door was opened; a sleepy porter looked out of his little nest, and Cranley wrote the names of the companions he introduced in a book which was kept for that purpose.|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} consists {{mainly of}} Rose’s mother Gertrud Leon’s letters {{to her in}} the years 1938 - 1942; other family members’ letters are also included. There are about 175 letters, 40 postcards and 20 telegrams including returned mail from Rose to her mother. Bernhard’s and Gertrud’s planned emigration to Cuba and then the USA is the main topic in the telegrams. In the letters, Gertrud talks a lot about her daily life and what other family members are doing; she also asks about Rose’s life and comments on what Rose tells her. The letters from other family members contain similar topics. The more recent correspondence between Peter Leon and Beate Niemann (2002 - 2003) deals with the past of Beate’s Nazi parents and their connection to the Leons, in whose house Beate was born. All correspondence as described above is located in Series I. The collection includes also some personal documents of the Rollmann/Koburger-Reiss family (1884 - 1986), family friends of the Wegner/Leons, located in Series II. The following individuals are mentioned in this collection:Leon, Bernhard; Leon, Gertrud; Leon, Peter; Mayer (née Leon), Ilse Jeanette; Mayer, Julius; Niemann, Beate; Wegner, Rose; Wegner, Steven. See inventory listRose Wegner, born in 1909, was the penultimate of Bernhard and Gertrud Leon's five children. Apparently, the family changed their name from Loewy to Leon. Bernhard was the youngest of six children in a family that had long lived in Berlin. He married Gertrud Markwald, whose family was also originally from Berlin. Rose had a sister, Ilse Jeanette, born in 1903, and three brothers, Arno, born in 1905, Heinz, born in 1907, and Gerhard, born in 1911. In Berlin, the Leons belonged to Rabbi Leo Baeck's congregation in Fasanenstrasse. Heinz emigrated to England when he was 18 or 19 years old, in approximately 1926. He would later help his siblings come to England. On March 31, 1933, Rose went to England and, thereafter, traveled back and forth between England and Germany. In 1936, Rose, who was a professional silversmith, returned to Germany to collect the silver from her workshop. In 1938, Rose married Steven Wegner (born March 14, 1901), another German refugee whom she met in England. Steven had been born Sally but changed it because he disliked that name. The Leon children attempted to get Bernhard and Gertrud out of Germany. They arranged for a visa to Cuba for their parents (emigration to Britain which was at war with Germany, was obviously not permitted). Bernhard died on April 16 th, 1941 of natural causes, aggravated perhaps by political conditions in Germany. The visa process was delayed by the bureaucratic need to resubmit the papers for Gertrud alone. Eventually, the plan for Gertrud to emigrate collapsed and, in 1943, she was deported to Theresienstadt, where she again encountered Rabbi Leo Baeck. On September 10, 1944, Gertrud was deported to Auschwitz and was murdered there. Other relatives were also victims of the Holocaust, including Bernhard's older brother Moritz, who was thrown from stairwell of his fourth story apartment during a <b>raid</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> Moritz's maid, Grete, who tried to protect him, was stomped to death. In England, the three Leon brothers served in the British army. Heinz died of cancer in service in North Africa. After the war, Ilse met Leo Baeck again, who informed the family of Gertrud's deportation from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. Arno returned after the war to Germany with the British Occupation Forces and is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Duesseldorf. Ilse (married to Julius Meyer with her children Daisy and Harald) and Gerhard remained in Britain. Rose and Steven remained in the greater New York metropolitan area, where they raised two children, Bryan (*summer 1939) and Marian. Steven died on May 17, 1968. In 2002, Beate Niemann approached Peter Leon, Gerhard’s son in London, to ask him about his family’s past because she was born in 1942 in Gertrud’s house at Manfred-von-Richthofen-Str. 125 in Berlin Tempelhof. Her parents had “bought” the house from Gertrud. Niemann’s father was SS-Sturmbannfuehrer Bruno Sattler. Niemann tried {{to find out more about}} her own and the Leon family. Her story was eventually filmed by the documentary film maker Yoash Tatari (DVD can be found in the LBI’s audio-visual collection) and published in 2003 by WDR (West German Broadcasting.) Peter Leon forwarded his whole conversation with Beate Niemann to his cousin Marian, Rose’s daughter. digitizedLetters # 73 and # 74 from and # 25, # 32, # 42, # 43, and # 53 from 1941 are not extant.
