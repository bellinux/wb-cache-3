The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, and the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the province.

25|$|Thus, in English law all {{errors of}} law are {{now to be}} {{considered}} as jurisdictional and ultra vires in a broad sense of the term. This implies that ouster clauses should not be effective against any error of law. The Anisminic principle was upheld by the Supreme Court in R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal (2011) so that the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> promoted, among other reasons. Since it is practically immaterial to the victim of an error of law {{whether it is a}} jurisdictional error or otherwise, it would be manifestly unjust if judicial review was precluded when a non-jurisdictional error was egregious and obvious, but allowed for a small jurisdictional error.|$|E
25|$|Verse Draft (Erstschrift des Textbuches) – a {{first draft}} of the final libretto, written in an archaic form of German alliterative verse known as Stabreim. Wagner created his verse drafts by versifying the {{dialogue}} already contained in his prose drafts – turning prose into poetry – or by creating new verse to replace those sections of the prose drafts {{for which he had}} not yet sketched any dialogue. He also added new elements not present in the prose drafts. For instance, the symbolic use of Wotan's spear and its engraved runes to embody the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> not present in the prose draft of Das Rheingold: this idea only came to Wagner while he was working on the verse draft of Die Walküre. It was also while developing the latter that he first thought of making Loge a god of fire: in the prose draft of Das Rheingold he is merely a trickster and teller of unwelcome truths. While writing his verse drafts, Wagner also greatly expanded his stage directions (which, of course, were always in prose).|$|E

500|$|Paul Craig, in {{analysing}} Dworkin's view, drew three conclusions. First, Dworkin {{rejects the}} need to distinguish between [...] "legal" [...] rules and a more complete political philosophy, since the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> basically the theory of law and adjudication that he believes is correct. Secondly, the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> not simply the thin or formal rule of law; the latter forms part of Dworkin's theory of law and adjudication. Thirdly, since taking a substantive view {{of the rule of}} law requires choosing what the best theory of justice is, it is necessary to articulate particular conceptions of what liberty, equality and other freedoms require.|$|E
500|$|In Raz's view, one of {{the virtues}} of the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> the {{restraint}} it imposes on authorities. It aims to exclude arbitrary power as it is said that most of the exercises of arbitrary power violate the rule of law. Arbitrary power is excluded when courts hold themselves accountable only to the law and observe [...] "fairly strict procedures". Another virtue is the protection it accords to individual freedom, namely, [...] "the sense of freedom in which it is identified with an effective ability to choose between as many options as possible". Most importantly, to adhere to the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> to respect human dignity by [...] "treating humans as persons capable of planning and plotting their future".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "thin" [...] {{conception}} {{rule of law}} advocates {{the view}} that the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements. People who subscribe to the thin conception are not apathetic towards the content of the law. However, as Ronald Dworkin says, [...] "hey {{say that this is a}} matter of substantive justice, and that substantive justice is an independent ideal, in no sense part of the ideal of the rule of law".|$|E

500|$|The {{extent to}} which {{citizens}} have access to justice in any given society depends on whether a thick or thin conception of <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> adopted. Raz, speaking about a thin conception, proposed that {{the rule of the}} law requires courts to be accessible – that is, the legal system, at a bare minimum, should comprise formal institutions and mechanisms for administering appropriate legal processes and outcomes. A legal system complying with the thin rule of law also requires that laws are fairly, equally and effectively applied. On the other hand, when a thick conception of the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> taken, a greater emphasis is placed on elements of substantive justice. It is suggested that a legal system operating as such may, in addition to the basic elements of access to justice in a thin rule of law, incorporate a moral or political philosophy, may incorporate ideas of [...] "democracy and legality", and give precedence to human rights in the administration of justice. Access to justice operating under a thick rule of law may be achieved by, among other things, increasing the efficiency of the judicial process, and having a robust legal profession, an incorruptible and independent judiciary, and a set of supporting institutions in order to increase the quality of justice administered.|$|E
500|$|Raz also {{identified}} {{some of the}} potential pitfalls {{of the rule of}} law. He opined that as the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> designed [...] "to minimise the harm to freedom and dignity which the law may cause in its pursuit of its goals however laudable these may be", the strict pursuit {{of the rule of law}} may prevent one from achieving certain social goals which may be preferable to the rule of law: [...] "Sacrificing too many social goals on the altar of the rule of law may make the law barren and empty".|$|E
500|$|Demosthenes {{decided to}} prosecute his wealthy {{opponent}} {{and wrote the}} judicial oration Against Meidias.

He stated that a democratic state perishes if the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> undermined by wealthy and unscrupulous men, and that the citizens acquire power and authority in all state affairs due [...] "to the strength of the laws". There is no consensus among scholars either on whether Demosthenes finally delivered Against Meidias or on the veracity of Aeschines' accusation that Demosthenes was bribed to drop the charges.|$|E
40|$|Can the {{reflection}} of legal scholars concerning the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>be</b> enriched by the cultural conception <b>of</b> Freud about <b>law?</b> This article develops this question, based on how the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>was</b> conceived in modernity, from {{a reading of the}} work of Hume and Rousseau, in order to show the potential compatibility that this conception had with the later work of Freud. Thus, Freud’s thinking about <b>law</b> <b>is</b> presented as a dialectical or paradoxical civilizatory force, restraining the passions even though they drive it, from a reading of his work Totem and Taboo. In this reconstruction, the genealogy <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> portrayed, from his story of the primal horde, and unconscious dynamics behind the law itself. Then the uses that various legal scholars have made of Freud in writing about the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>are</b> analyzed, criticizing how they neglect the tragic sentiment of the Freudian cultural vision regarding law. Finally, the article states that the notions developed by Freud can serve critical legal thinking only if the <b>law</b> <b>is</b> seen as part of the culture, which leads to consider legal studies as a form of cultural studies...|$|R

500|$|Hand's {{skepticism}} {{extended to}} his political philosophy: he once {{described himself as}} [...] "a conservative among liberals, and a liberal among conservatives". As early as 1898, he rejected his family's Jeffersonian Democratic tradition. His thoughts on liberty, collected in The Spirit of Liberty (1952), began by recalling the political philosophies of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. Jefferson believed that each individual {{has a right to}} freedom, and that government, though necessary, threatens that freedom. In contrast, Hamilton argued that freedom depends on government: too much freedom leads to anarchy and the tyranny of the mob. Hand, who believed, following Thomas Hobbes, that the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> the only alternative to the rule of brutality, leaned towards Hamilton. Since the freedom granted to the American pioneers was no longer feasible, he accepted that individual liberty should be moderated by society's norms. He nevertheless saw the liberty to create and to choose as vital to peoples' humanity and entitled to legal protection. He assumed the goal of human beings to be the [...] "good life", defined as each individual chooses.|$|E
500|$|In {{an essay}} in 1999, he {{identified}} {{what he saw as}} the harmful role played by sentimentality in a case involving Stephen Lawrence. Lawrence, a young black British man, was murdered and the subsequent case was mired in accusations of racism among the investigating police. Dalrymple wrote that [...] "the response to the Stephen Lawrence case is another example of how the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> to be supplanted by the rule of sentiment—and it is yet one more instance of what one might call the Dianafication of British public life, in which transitory popular enthusiasm trumps venerable tradition". In a 2004 essay, he analysed how sentimentality towards children was closely linked with violence and neglect, particularly in the poorest sections of British society: [...] "The upbringing of children in much of Britain is a witches' brew of sentimentality, brutality, and neglect, in which overindulgence in the latest fashions, toys, or clothes, and a television in the bedroom are regarded as the highest—indeed only—manifestations of tender concern for a child's welfare".|$|E
500|$|In Singapore, {{the rule}} of law {{doctrine}} has been the topic of considerable disagreement and debate, largely through differing conceptions of the doctrine. These conceptions can generally be divided into two categories developed by legal academics, the [...] "thin", or formal, conception and the [...] "thick", or substantive, conception of {{the rule of}} law. The thin conception, often associated with the legal scholars Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz, advocates the view that the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements, such as the stipulations that all laws be prospective, clear, stable and constitutionally enacted, and that the parties to legal disputes are treated equally and without bias on the part of judges. While people subscribing to the thin conception do not dismiss the importance of the content of the law, they take the view that {{this is a matter of}} substantive justice and should not be regarded as part of the concept of {{the rule of law}}. On the other hand, the thick conception of the rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule, it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} {{critics of the}} Government of Singapore have adopted a thick, or substantive, {{conception}} {{of the rule of}} law that encompasses the protection of human rights. In a chapter entitled [...] "Rights and the Rule of Law" [...] in his 1994 book Dare to Change, Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) member (and later Secretary-General) Chee Soon Juan criticized, among other things, the Government's use of the Internal Security Act ("ISA") to detain persons without trial, and the lack of freedom of speech and assembly. In an open letter published on the SDP website dated 6 January 2009 which was addressed to the Chief Justice, Attorney-General and Law Minister, he said: [...] "he <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> not just a system where the government passes legislation and everyone unquestioningly obeys. The concept {{of the rule of law}} necessitates the limitation of state power and the respect of human rights. Our Constitution spells out what these limitations are. It also defines the rights of the citizen." [...] And in a speech delivered to the International Bar Association Conference in Dubai on 4 November 2011, he cited a free media and the rights to free expression and peaceful assembly as essential elements of the rule of law.|$|E
