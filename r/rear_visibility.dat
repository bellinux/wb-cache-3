25|$|The {{windows were}} {{intended}} to offset the significant blind spots created by the very wide C-pillars that were characteristic of American cars produced at this time. Even narrow opera windows helped <b>rear</b> <b>visibility.</b> In an age of decreasing dimensions and increasingly common use of non-opening rear side windows on 2-door models, the small opera windows helped rear passengers to be somewhat less claustrophobic.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 {{the engine}} design evolved again, {{as it was}} bored and stroked to 5167cc and given four valves per cylinder—quattrovalvole in Italian, hence the model's name, Countach 5000 Quattrovalvole or 5000 QV in short. The carburetors were moved from the sides {{to the top of}} the engine for better breathing—unfortunately this created a hump on the engine deck, {{reducing}} the already poor <b>rear</b> <b>visibility</b> to almost nothing. Some body panels were also replaced by Kevlar. In later versions of the engine, the carburetors were replaced with fuel injection.|$|E
25|$|The {{air intake}} {{was in the}} unusual dorsal {{location}} as the Air Force had required the carriage of an underbelly semi-conformal nuclear weapon. Some sources claim that the original chin intake caused a shock wave that interfered in launching this weapon, but no such testing was actually carried out. The implications this design choice had for the survivability of the pilot during ejection were troubling. The intake also severely limited <b>rear</b> <b>visibility.</b> Nonetheless this was not considered terribly important for a tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, and furthermore it was assumed {{at the time that}} air combat would be via guided missile exchanges outside visual range.|$|E
50|$|In {{a review}} {{made by the}} Italian {{magazine}} Al Volante, the Haval H6 was appreciated for the comfortable and spacious interior, the rich endowment with features and its low price against the European, Korean and Japanese rivals. It was criticized for its relatively sluggish gearbox, the lack of power from the diesel engine at low revs, the <b>rear</b> window <b>visibility</b> and the rigid plastic used in the dashboard.|$|R
50|$|Many high-wing {{training}} gliders {{with two}} seats in tandem have slightly forward-swept wings {{in order to}} enable the wing root to be located further aft to prevent the wing from obscuring the <b>rear</b> occupant's lateral <b>visibility.</b> Typical examples are the Schleicher ASK 13 and the Let Kunovice LET L-13 Blaník.|$|R
5000|$|Gunners {{using both}} the FN-20 and 120 removed perspex and armour from the turret to improve visibility, but trials by the RAF {{showed that a}} Mosquito night fighter {{was still able to}} get within a very short {{distance}} of the tail gunner without being spotted, confirming what the Luftwaffe had already realised. The Rose turret attempted to improve on the FN turrets by being completely open to the <b>rear</b> (improving <b>visibility</b> and allowing easier emergency egress) and by being fitted with two [...]50 inch machine guns and was installed in a small number of Lancasters but never became common.|$|R
25|$|The doors, {{most often}} {{credited}} as a Lamborghini trademark, were a remarkable design feature for the Countach. They {{first appeared on}} the Alfa Romeo 33 'Carabo' concept car in 1968, an earlier design accomplishment, also by the talented Gandini. The doors {{have come to be}} known as scissor doors: hinged at the front with horizontal hinges, so that they lifted up and tilted forwards. The main reason is the car's tubular spaceframe chassis results in very high and wide door sills. It was also partly for style, and partly because the width of the car made conventional doors impossible to use in even slightly confined space. Care needed to be taken, though, in opening the doors with a low roof overhead. The car's poor <b>rear</b> <b>visibility</b> and wide sills led to drivers adopting a method of reversing the car for parking by opening the door, sitting on the sill, and reversing while looking over the back of the car from outside.|$|E
500|$|For the AV-8B, McDonnell Douglas {{redesigned}} {{the entire}} airframe of the Harrier, incorporating numerous structural and aerodynamic changes. To improve visibility and better accommodate {{the crew and}} avionics hardware, McDonnell Douglas elevated the cockpit by [...] and redesigned the canopy. This improved the forward (17° down), side (60°), and <b>rear</b> <b>visibility.</b> The front fuselage is composed of a molded skin with an epoxy-based core sandwiched between two carbon-fiber sheets. To compensate for {{the changes in the}} front fuselage, the rear fuselage was extended by , and the taller vertical stabilizer of the Sea Harrier was used. The tail assembly is made up of composites to reduce weight.|$|E
2500|$|Engineers used {{advanced}} {{weight saving}} techniques {{to bring the}} total kerb weight down to under [...] The use of aluminium for the bonnet and the roof, and composite plastics for the one-piece tailgate helped produce a vehicle weighing [...] less than the Freelander. The Evoque can be equipped with five exterior cameras to give the driver added visibility for off road maneuvers and compensate for the sloping roofline design with limited <b>rear</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The TVR Griffith Series 400 is a 2-door coupe {{sports car}} {{produced}} by Griffith Motor Company in Plainview,New York ( [...] a Ford Dealer in Plainview/Hicksville NY, Long Island [...] ), between 1964 and 1967. It is {{the successor to}} the TVR Griffith 200, featuring improved cooling via a larger radiator with twin electric fans, redesigned rear suspension, and a redesigned <b>rear</b> with better <b>visibility</b> and the round taillights sourced from the Ford Cortina Mark I.|$|R
40|$|Predicting the {{accumulation}} of material on the rear surfaces of square-backed cars is important to vehicle manufacturers, as this progressively compromises <b>rear</b> vision, vehicle <b>visibility</b> and aesthetics. It also reduces the effectiveness of rear mounted cameras. Here, this problem is represented by a simple bluff body with a single sprayer mounted centrally under its rear trailing edge. A Very Large Eddy Simulation (VLES) solver is used to simulate both the aerodynamics {{of the body and}} deposition of contaminant. Aerodynamic drag and lift coefficients were predicted to within + 1. 3...|$|R
50|$|The five door {{hatchback}} Civic for European {{market was}} unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2011. Strong {{identity of the}} previous generation European Civic led Honda to refine the current package instead of radical changes. Basic look and proportions of previous car are retained as the futuristic design was welcomed by customers. Aerodynamics, <b>rear</b> and side <b>visibility</b> are all improved. It is {{claimed to be the}} most aerodynamic car in its class, with a coefficient of 0.27. The wheelbase is 30mm shorter without a decrease of interior space. Retaining the compact torsion beam rear suspension and the centrally mounted fuel tank help contribute to a boot capacity of 470 litres. More than 20,000 miles of testing was carried out on British roads for better handling and ride quality. The rear beam axle is completely redesigned for higher stiffness, and new fluid-filled bushing is used to improve stability and cornering ability, as well as ride quality. There are more standard equipment and higher interior quality.|$|R
2500|$|The SD50F was a Canadian cowl unit version {{equipped}} with a [...] "Draper taper" [...] (inset section aft of cab for limited <b>rear</b> <b>visibility).</b> 60 were built for the Canadian National Railway as road numbers 5400-5459.

2500|$|The {{main feature}} was the Marlin's {{fastback}} roof with [...] "stylish elliptical C-pillars that ended [...] "between two stubby, squared-off fins" [...] in the rear. The decklid {{was the same}} as on the previous model, but now without the large round insignia. A bigger back window improved <b>rear</b> <b>visibility.</b> New taillights were similar to those on the first-generation car. The rear bumper was slightly different from the one used on the Ambassador and Rebel station wagons, the top edge being a continuous horizontal line that fits up against the body.|$|E
2500|$|Early reviews {{praised the}} Insight's futuristic styling, handling, and price but {{noted that it}} was less powerful, less fuel efficient, and less {{comfortable}} than other more expensive hybrids. The Insight performed well in comparison tests administered by Motor Trend and Car and Driver. In their comparison test against the 2010 Toyota Prius, Car and Driver stated [...] "...the Insight proved more visceral, connected, and agile than the Prius. The Insight represents a lot of engineering bang for the buck, {{and the majority of}} its dynamics are more satisfying than the Prius’s" [...] citing the benefits of the Insight's firm brake feel, accurate steering, and tight suspension (the latter borrowing heavily from the latest Honda Fit). It did not perform as well in Edmunds or Popular Mechanics tests. Despite a high reliability rating in Consumer Reports testing, the Insight was assigned a low score, stating that it fell short in ride quality, handling, interior noise, acceleration, refinement, rear seat access and <b>rear</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Normally, {{the long}} hood is {{the rear of}} the locomotive. For early hood unit models, this was not the case; railroads {{preferred}} to run with the long hood at the front and the cab at the rear (referred to as operating long hood forward or LHF). It is a common misconception that locomotives were run LHF to provide greater protection, although {{it may have been a}} secondary benefit. Southern Railway and Norfolk and Western Railway operated their locomotives bidirectionally to make coal shifting more efficient. By putting the engineer on the right side with the Long Hood Forward, the engineer could see signals down the long hood and around the short hood for operations in both directions. [...] Later, preferences changed to having the short hood at the front and the long hood at the <b>rear</b> for better <b>visibility</b> and with the advent of Wide, or Comfort, cabs. Visibility became a deciding factor when more powerful engines required larger, visibility-obscuring radiator units.|$|R
40|$|This {{analytical}} study {{evaluated the}} performance of 40 first-generation low-beam headlamps that were either visually/optically aimable (VOA) or that met the GTB harmonized beam pattern, by comparing these low beams to conventional U. S., European, and Japanese low beams. The following aspects of headlamp performance were considered: visibility of pedestrians, visibility of pavement delineation, visibility of retroreflective traffic signs, <b>visibility</b> of vehicle <b>rear</b> reflex reflectors, <b>visibility</b> of targets near the road expansion point, glare directed towards oncoming drivers, glare directed towards rearview mirrors of preceding drivers, glare reflected from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, and foreground illumination. For each performance aspect, typical geometric situations (points in space) were specified in terms of longitudinal, lateral, and vertical positions, and the corresponding visual angles {{from each of the}} two headlamps were calculated. The effects of the novel low beams were quantified by calculating the percent changes in luminous intensity directed from both lamps towards the points in space representing the performance aspects. The results are presented separately for the VOA lamps that are aimable on the left side (VOL lamps) and the right side (VOR lamps), {{as well as for the}} harmonized lamps. The present results could be used by lamp designers to maximize the advantages of the future versions of these novel low beams, while minimizing their disadvantages...|$|R
500|$|Further {{aerodynamic}} refinements {{were carried}} out in Exeter {{with the development of}} new body shells which produced further reductions in the vehicle's drag. However, it was felt that something was lacking in the design and a 23-year-old industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, was brought in to refine the shell's appearance. He had won a Sinclair-sponsored electric vehicle design competition at the Royal College of Art and was hired on his graduation to set up an in-house car design studio at Sinclair's Metalab in Cambridge, of which he became the first employee. It was not only Desbarats' first project but, as he later said, [...] "day one of my working life", when he turned up at Sinclair's premises. He was taken aback when he saw the C5 for the first time, as he had been expecting a [...] "proper" [...] electric car. He said later that he thought [...] "the concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality. There were no instruments, nowhere to put anything and no security features." [...] Desbarats told Sinclair that the design would have to be redone from scratch, [...] "asking what we were doing about <b>visibility,</b> <b>rear</b> view mirrors, range indications...". It was far too late for this, however; all the key design decisions had already been made. Desbarats told Sinclair that he would need four months to revisit the design and was given eight weeks instead. He created the styling that was used for the final production model of the C5, with wheel trims and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently. Desbarats was also responsible for the creation of the High-Vis Mast accessory, as he felt uncomfortable being so close to the ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him. He later described his contribution as [...] "convert an ugly pointless device into a prettier, safer, and more usable pointless device".|$|R
2500|$|Two {{areas of}} the German front line, {{on either side of}} the Neuve Chapelle battlefield, were {{attacked}} by the British First Army (General Sir Douglas Haig).

The attack was intended to make two breaches in the German defences [...] apart, after which the infantry were to advance to Aubers Ridge about [...] beyond. The preliminary bombardment began at [...] and at [...] became intense. Ten minutes later, the infantry attacked and surprised the German defenders, artillery fire cutting all the German telephone lines to the <b>rear.</b> <b>Visibility</b> was poor due to smoke and dust and the bombardment proved less effective than assumed; much of the British shell-fire fell short and few of the German machine-guns were destroyed. German machine-gunners and artillery began to fire at the same time and in ten minutes inflicted many casualties on the British infantry as they advanced across no man's land.|$|E
2500|$|The model line-up for 1973 {{increased}} to 11 from the 9 models in 1972. The new top level Torino was the [...] "Gran Torino Brougham", {{available as a}} 2-door hardtop and a 4-door sedan. All other models remained the same. Bench seats for 1973 now featured low backs with separate head rests to increase <b>rear</b> <b>visibility.</b> The high back bucket seats were still available on the two-door models. The hood release was moved to inside, for increased security. Radial tires were also a new option, and offered longer tread life and better road manners. The standard engine remained as the 250 CID inline-six for all models, except the station wagons and Sport which used the 302-2V. Engine options also remained the same, and all engines now had their compression ratio dropped to 8.0:1. Power for all engines was slightly lower than in 1972. The 351 CJ continued {{to be the only}} high-performance engine and only saw a [...] drop from 1972, although performance decreased again due to the weight increase. Police package Torinos had all the engine options of the civilian models while the [...] "Interceptor" [...] package featured a 460-4V new for 1973. All models featured larger [...] rear drum brakes for 1973 to help cope with the extra weight; 1972 models used [...] drums.|$|E
50|$|This {{configuration}} gives a cab or carbody unit poor <b>rear</b> <b>visibility</b> {{compared with}} a hood unit. For that reason, cab or carbody units are mostly used in situations where <b>rear</b> <b>visibility</b> is not important, such as power for through freight and passenger trains. Cab and carbody units are also more aerodynamic than hood units, and pulled many of the streamliner trains.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} determine the level of conspicuity of South Australian commuting cyclists. Roadside observations were undertaken at four sites around the Adelaide CBD with two sites each covering the morning (8 - 9 : 30 am) and afternoon (4 - 6 pm) peak cycling commuting periods. A total of 715 cyclists (78 % male) were observed, the majority of whom (59 %) were estimated to be aged 30 - 59 years. The general level of front and rear conspicuity amongst cyclists observed commuting {{to and from the}} Adelaide CBD is concerning: 38 % of cyclists were observed to have high frontal conspicuity; a small minority (8 %) of cyclists were observed wearing high <b>visibility</b> vests. High <b>rear</b> conspicuity was much less common with 18 % of cyclists observed to have high rear conspicuity. Over half (57 %) of all cyclists observed to have high frontal conspicuity had obscured rear conspicuity, predominantly due to the use of a backpack. Further analysis of conspicuity via binary logistic regression indicated that the type of clothing worn by cyclists predicted high conspicuity (front and <b>rear)</b> and high <b>visibility</b> vest use, while age also predicted the use of a high visibility vest, and sex was also found to predict the level of rear conspicuity, including obscured rear conspicuity. These findings suggest that conspicuity may be associated with the individual characteristics of cyclists and the characteristics of different cyclist groups but further research is necessary to investigate this hypothesis. Several areas for future research addressing cyclist safety are suggested but {{there is a need to}} investigate the role of conspicuity and other cyclist characteristics in cyclist crashes, and to investigate factors contributing to crashes in which the cyclist and other vehicle are travelling in the same direction. While there is a risk that increased conspicuity may lead cyclists to become overconfident in drivers’ ability to detect them, the findings of this study indicate that improving the general level of conspicuity among South Australian cyclists could yield some safety benefits.

It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, a subsidiary of the Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|R

50|$|The C70 {{convertible}} exhibited two {{negative traits}} endemic to convertibles: poor <b>rear</b> <b>visibility</b> and pronounced scuttle shake, a characteristic whereby the structural {{design of the}} bulkhead between engine and passenger compartment of a convertible suffers sufficiently poor rigidity to negatively impact ride and handling, allowing noticeable vibration, shudder or chassis-flexing into the passenger compartment.|$|E
5000|$|Small sets {{of windows}} in the {{dividers}} between the passenger, luggage space and engine compartments, plus louvres providing air for the air-cooled engine, allowed limited <b>rear</b> <b>visibility.</b> Its entire rear segment could be opened, to service the engine.
