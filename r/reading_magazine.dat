60|$|I doubt, indeed, {{whether the}} {{earnings}} of literary men are absolutely as great as they were earlier in the century, {{in any of the}} English-speaking countries; relatively they are nothing like as great. Scott had forty thousand dollars for 'Woodstock,' which was not a very large novel, and was by no means one of his best; and forty thousand dollars then had at least the purchasing power of sixty thousand now. Moore had three thousand guineas for 'Lalla Rookh,' but what publisher would be rash enough to pay fifteen thousand dollars for the masterpiece of a minor poet now? The book, except in very rare instances, makes nothing like the return to the author that the magazine makes, and there are few leading authors who find their account in that form of publication. Those who do, those who sell the most widely in book form, are often not at all desired by editors; with difficulty they get a serial accepted by any principal magazine. On the other hand, there are authors whose books, compared with those of the popular favorites, do not sell, and yet they are eagerly sought for by editors; they are paid the highest prices, and nothing that they offer is refused. These are literary artists; and it ought to be plain from what I am saying that in belles-lettres, at least, most of the best literature now first sees the light in the magazines, and most of the second-best appears first in book form. The old-fashioned people who flatter themselves upon their distinction in not <b>reading</b> <b>magazine</b> fiction or magazine poetry make a great mistake, and simply class themselves with the public whose taste is so crude that they cannot enjoy the best. Of course, this is true mainly, if not merely, of belles-lettres; history, science, politics, metaphysics, in spite of the many excellent articles and papers in these sorts upon {{what used to be called}} various emergent occasions, are still to be found at their best in books. The most monumental example of literature, at once light and good, which has first reached the public in book form is in the different publications of Mark Twain; but Mr. Clemens has of late turned to the magazines too, and now takes their mint-mark before he passes into general circulation. All this may change again, but at present the magazines--we have no longer any reviews form the most direct approach to that part of our reading public which likes the highest things in literary art. Their readers, if we may judge from the quality of the literature they get, are more refined than the book readers in our community; and their taste has no doubt been cultivated by that of the disciplined and experienced editors. So far as I have known these, they are men of aesthetic conscience and of generous sympathy. They have their preferences in the different kinds, and they have their theory of what kind will be most acceptable to their readers; but they exercise their selective function with the wish to give them the best things they can. I do not know one of them--and it has been, my good fortune to know them nearly all--who would print a wholly inferior thing for the sake of an inferior class of readers, though they may sometimes decline a good thing because for one reason or another, they believe it would not be liked. Still, even this does not often happen; they would rather chance the good thing they doubted of than underrate their readers' judgment.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{biomedical}} {{testing and}} genetic counselling is usually framed as something an individual woman chooses, with little consideration {{given to the}} context in which women make these choices. In order to understand something of {{the context in which}} women (35 and over) undergo prenatal diagnostic tests, we have surveyed the contents of 10 major women's magazines. We found that the stories told about the "older" pregnant woman and the risks attached to her pregnancy are highly selective. The dominant rhetoric used in these narratives suggests that women "need" to be informed of the facts of being pregnant when older (through <b>reading</b> <b>magazine</b> articles), that this need incurs a further need to find out the state of the fetus (through biomedical intervention), and that the pregnant woman can meet these needs by "choosing" prenatal diagnosis. These results illustrate how a "need" for prenatal testing gets created and suggest that to "choose" to be tested may be to partake of, not challenge, the mainstream biomedical assumptions about how the "older" pregnant woman will and should behave...|$|E

The number of participants in the study was 795 students: 400 boys and 395 girls. Results All participants have a common behavior in rarely <b>reading</b> <b>magazines,</b> but they spend more than 2 h in watching television or less than 3 h using the internet. However, most of obese/non-obese adolescents, boys or girls, have shown high influence (p < 0. 05) of <b>reading</b> <b>magazines</b> on the subject of dieting to lose weight.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{expectations}} and satisfaction of patients visiting Family Practice Clinics, at the Aga Khan University Hospital, in Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology: A cross sectional survey of 316 patients was carried out. A questionnaire, {{based on the}} study objectives was developed and administered. The participating patient signed a consent form, after assurance of confidentiality was provided. Data on the demographic profile of the patients was collected. Results: The mean age was 33. 81 years, with 105 (33. 2 %) women, and 211 (66. 8 %) men. The majority were married, with education above intermediate level and were in private or government service or were housewives. The median for the patient waiting time was 30 minutes, against an expectation of 12. 69 minutes. Reading newspaper, watching television, <b>reading</b> <b>magazine,</b> reading Quran and listening to music were quoted as ways to lessen the burden of waiting to see a physician. The average consultation time with the physician was 13. 89 minutes, against an expectation of 16. 37 minutes. Patient expectation in terms of listening by the doctor with patience, explanation of the diagnosis and treatment, prescription of medicines, ordering of investigations and specialist referral has been documented. Objections {{to the presence of}} medical student, nursing student, resident doctor, nurse and an observer, in the consultation room have also been documented. Reasons quoted for the objection include issues of privacy/confidentiality, lack of justification, discomfort, and interference with the consultation process. The expected average cost for doctor’s consultation was Pakistani Rs. 124, while 196 (61. 8 %) of the respondents were satisfied with the consultation based on Rs. 70.

40|$|Speakers of Wichita were {{gathered}} for a meal {{and a chance to}} "talk Wichita" with each other for about two hours. This session records the first meeting, in which the Linguist tries to stimulate conversation by asking a number of questions, most of which result in either long discussion in English or no responses. Only the successful questions (those which elicited some Wichita language data) and the resulting discussion are archived. There are some short monologues, and several songs with a discussion about them. 	The following are the topics of conversation as they come up on the video: David tries to get the conversation started by suggesting people talk about experiences at Camp Creek, a former (probably in the 1940 s and 1950 s) summer gathering place for Wichita families to camp and socialize. Those who went to Camp Creek tended not to be churchgoers. Doris refers to a recorded text from the 1960 s that David had played for her earlier that day. The text (BP BP conversations) will also be available in the archive eventually. It was free conversation between two good friends, and included the passages to which Doris refers here. The speakers in the text had begun to discuss a Ghost Dance song, and one of them had complained that the use of “Our Father” and other references to the Christian God was inappropriate (presumably because those singing it were not Christians and it was not a Christian song). Doris asserts that the people who went to Camp Creek were extremely religious, and that the woman speaking on the tape was being inappropriately critical. Doris quotes the ‘our Father’ line in Wichita. 	Myles inquires more about the song, and says he knows it. Pearl also says she knows it, Myles encourages her to sing it but she demurs. With encouragement from Doris, Myles sings it. Pearl then thinks of another one, and sings that one. Doris reverts to her theme that despite what was said on the tape, the Camp Creek attendees were spiritual people. Pearl then goes back and translates the song she sang. Further discussion emphasizes that the songs were always about the Lord. 	David redirects the conversation to Dru, who had told him she had come prepared to tell a little story. It is a joke, told bilingually, first in Wichita and then in English. Then she goes on to describe a “Wichita boogey-man”, someone who regularly “teased” the young women. (“Teasing” is a complex division of relatives into two groups, those whom you can (and must, if possible) insult, and those who must be protected from insults. The relationship is transitive: if someone is insulting someone whom you are supposed to protect, you must protest. The insults are usually very personal and often sexual.) Dru describes(mostly in English) the way this man behaved, and others chime in with more stories about him. 	Dru then recalls another Camp Creek event where her mother arranged to have an old Pawnee woman pray for her daughter (Dru). This creates the opportunity to discuss the difference between the old and new ways of doing things, such as arranging for blessings and giving gifts. Pearl is then inspired to talk about the special properties of “lulu-ing,” performing the women’s war cry, and how that has been diluted in recent times. David interrupts to collect the appropriate vocabulary. Dru is then reminded of another story about her cousin, when a young child, accompanying her grandmother into the wilderness to help with the proper burial of the medicine bundle of a deceased relative, and how a “lulu” was heard to acknowledge the proper completion of the action. 	Myles speaks up with a story about himself as a young boy and a Camp Creek experience. One of his “teasing” relatives was confronted by a “non-teasing” relative over what she was doing to Myles, and their interactions strike everyone as funny. Shirley is then reminded of some behavior among the girls and young women involving <b>reading</b> <b>magazine</b> stories, and others offer parallel remarks. Since many of the stories involved men mistreating women, the speakers use the word “tite’es” about them. That prompts Doris and Pearl to comment on that as the only “cuss word” in the language. 	Pearl starts another topic but is sidetracked almost at once by Mary, the only non-speaker in the group, telling about an occasion when she “lulu”ed in private. Pearl teasingly calls her “Coyote”, though she translates the word as “fox”. A discussion of the term (k’ita:ks) follows, with input from Stuart, concluding that “coyote” is correct. Then Doris asks about another animal name, and they conclude it means ‘panther’. This reminds Dru of another song about an animal that she can’t identify. She sings it, and Pearl asserts that it’s about the buffalo having disappeared. 	David then reminds Myles of a song he has sung before, a children’s song about the mourning doves that supposedly warns against being too noisy. Myles sings it, translates it, and there is some discussion of it. Then Doris asks Gary about the “buzzard” song which everyone uses to tease him. Both Myles and Pearl sing it. 	Gary redirects the conversation to another story by Dru about her aunt and her grandmother. Part of this is hard to hear because people are rattling aluminum foil as they pack up the leftovers from the meal to take home. Eventually the noise subsides and Dru begins the story again, abbreviating the beginning. Dru uses a lot of code switching: the story is in English, but the characters speak Wichita when she quotes them. Even the woman who purports to have stopped understanding and speaking the language is quoted as if she had spoken Wichita, however. 	Shirley changes the subject with a short story about Doris helping her grandmother with the grocery shopping, and Doris adds some comments about the merchants of the time, including a little of the terminology for money...|$|E
