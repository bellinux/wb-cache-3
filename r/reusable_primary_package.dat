Lastly, tertiary packaging is that used to support bulk storage, shipping, and handling of product in the distribution supply chain. Rations are grouped at this level in fibreboard boxes or cases and subsequently palletised as unit loads for ease and efficiency of handling and distribution.|$|R

40|$|Protein {{therapeutics}} {{are often}} stored as lyophilisate {{to guarantee the}} stability over a longer period. To obtain the solution applicable into the patient, the lyophilisate has to be reconsituted. Protein adsorption to <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> {{can lead to a}} loss in protein concentration in solution. The decreasing protein content is an issue for the therapy success {{as well as for the}} pharmaceutical industry. The adsorption of various therapeutic proteins to different kinds of <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> has already been described in literature. Due to different properties of the protein and the surface of the <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> as well as due to various formulation parameters, a prediction of the adsorbed amount could not be made. Using the model protein BSA, in the presented work the following three analytical methods were developed to quantify the adsorbed protein amount to different primary packaging: •	Coomassieblue-Assay •	Micro BCA-Assay •	SE-HPLC method The calibration curves of the Coomassieblue-Assay not only depended on the used <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> but also on the pH value of the incubated solution. For this reason, a new calibration curve would be necessary for every varying <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> or for every differing formulation parameter. Due to the high effort, the Micro BCA-Assay as well as the SE-HPLC method was used to determine the adsorbed BSA amount. Owing to the simultaneous variation of different factors, the statistical tool "'design of experiments"' represents a fast and efficient approach to analyse for example the influence of various factors on the adsorbed amount of BSA. Moreover, the statistical experimental design can identify interactions of factors. This is another advantage compared to the conventional experimental planning, where only one factor is varied at a time. Thus, in the presented work a central composite design was used to identify significant factors and interactions on the adsorbed BSA amount. Furthermore, using the statistical design of experiments, the practicability of the developed methods could be confirmed. The influence of the following factors on the BSA adsorption to <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> was analysed: •	BSA initial concentration •	Ionic strength of the buffer •	Incubation temperature •	Incubation time •	Vial type The adsorbed BSA amount, measured by the Micro BCA Assay as well as the SE-HPLC, was applied as target value. In all experiments the pH value was adjusted to the isoelectric point of BSA to guarantee measureable adsorbed amounts for both methods. The use of statistical experimental design identified the significant influence of the following factors on the adsorbed BSA amount: •	BSA initial concentration •	Ionic strength of the buffer •	Vial type •	Interaction between the ionic strength of the buffer and the vial type The vial type had the biggest impact on the adsorbed value. Summing up, this work presents methods for the fast and cost-effective determination of the protein adsorption to <b>primary</b> <b>packaging.</b> Moreover, the "'design of experiments"' is an effective approach to identify potential influence factors on the protein adsorption...|$|R
50|$|The flight {{instrumentation}} system {{is composed of}} a <b>primary</b> instrumentation <b>package</b> and an auxiliary <b>package.</b> The <b>primary</b> <b>package</b> instrumentation measures those parameters critical to all engine static firings and subsequent vehicle launches. These include some 70 parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds, and valve positions for the engine components, with the capability of transmitting signals to a ground recording system or a telemetry system, or both. The {{instrumentation system}} is designed for use throughout {{the life of the}} engine, from the first static acceptance firing to its ultimate vehicle flight. The auxiliary package is designed for use during early vehicle flights. It may be deleted from the basic engine instrumentation system after the propulsion system has established its reliability during research and development vehicle flights. It contains sufficient flexibility to provide for deletion, substitution, or addition of parameters deemed necessary as a result of additional testing. Eventual deletion of the auxiliary package will not interfere with the measurement capability of the <b>primary</b> <b>package.</b>|$|R

The secondary packaging does not need to carry any product identification notice.In cases where the cosmetic product is only wrapped by one single container, this container needs to carry all the information.|$|R

40|$|In many {{supermarkets}} throughout Europe, it {{has become}} common practice in the fruit and vegetable department to offer options in plastic packaging. Recent trends, however, move towards the removal of packaging. The current study examines whether offering fruit and vegetables without <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> {{increases the likelihood that}} consumers choose these products. This is especially relevant for organic fruit and vegetables, given that plastic may be perceived as contrary to the sustainable nature of these products. A first experiment, using a student sample and an immersive 3 D virtual supermarket environment, shows that choice for organic fruit and vegetables indeed increases when organics are offered without packaging. A second experiment with the virtual supermarket generalizes these findings to a sample of supermarket patrons, additionally showing that unpacked fruit and vegetables are preferred over packed options overall, both for organic and non-organic products. We conclude that removing the <b>primary</b> <b>packaging</b> of organic fruit and vegetables appears to be a promising intervention in attempts to increase organic sales. </p...|$|R
