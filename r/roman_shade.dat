50|$|<b>Roman</b> <b>shades</b> are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} styles. Both Looped <b>Roman</b> <b>Shades</b> and Classic <b>Roman</b> <b>Shades</b> are designed to create depth and dimension. Looped <b>Roman</b> <b>Shades,</b> also known as hobbled shades, have folds that cascade down the face of the shade to help create depth, while Classic <b>Roman</b> <b>Shades</b> offer a pleated design that can be batten front or batten back. <b>Roman</b> <b>shades</b> are also available in a seamless style, which feature a smooth or flat shade face.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Roman</b> <b>shades</b> are a type {{of window}} {{covering}} used {{to block out the}} sun. <b>Roman</b> <b>shades</b> are different from standard window shade in that they stack up evenly when being opened; however, when they are open they are visibly smooth, not bumpy or ribbed like typical vertical shades or blinds.|$|R

50|$|<b>Roman</b> <b>shades</b> are a type {{of window}} blind used {{to block out the}} sun. They are often {{referred}} to as Romans or Roman blinds in the UK. When opened, the Romans stack up evenly; when covering the full window height, they are smooth without overlapping.|$|R
50|$|<b>Roman</b> <b>shades</b> {{are usually}} {{opened with a}} cord mechanism, {{allowing}} the user to adjust {{the height of the}} covered area. In typical construction, cords run vertically on the outdoor side of the blind running through evenly spaced horizontal stiffener rods or eyelets, and attached {{at the bottom of the}} blind. In this case, the opened portion of the blinds remains smooth, while the bottom will be stacked evenly.|$|R

5000|$|Ancient Egyptians {{and later}} the Greeks and Romans used large pieces of fabric to provide shade. The Colosseum in Rome was shaded with large canvas [...] "sails" [...] pulled into place by <b>Roman</b> sailors. Modern <b>shade</b> sails came into wider use with the {{invention}} of a far more durable and relatively inexpensive fabric called shade cloth. Useful versions of shade cloth appeared in the early 1990s especially in Australia and South Africa.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Rhine {{frontier}} of the Roman empire, 70 AD, showing {{the location of}} the Batavi in the Rhine delta region. <b>Roman</b> territory is <b>shaded</b> dark. Their homeland was called the Insula Batavorum by the Romans and corresponded roughly with modern Gelderland province, Neth. Their chief town was Noviomagus (Nijmegen, Neth.), a strategic prominence in an otherwise flat and waterlogged land that became the site of a Roman legionary fortress (housing the legion X Gemina) after the Batavi revolt ended in 70 AD. The name is of Celtic origin, meaning [...] "new market", suggesting that the Germanic Batavi either displaced or subjugated an indigenous Gallic tribe ...|$|R
