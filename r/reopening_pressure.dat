30|$|Why do the {{currently}} available data sets from field hydrofracturing tests {{indicate that the}} measured re-opening pressure lies close to the shut-in pressure far more often than can reasonably be expected? In order to explain such a strange phenomenon, {{it is necessary to}} take into consideration two additional factors, those of (1) a residual aperture of fracture and (2) hydraulic compliance of the test equipment, both of which are ignored in the conventional theory of hydraulic fracturing. The residual aperture causes pressure penetration into the fracture prior to opening, and its effect is to reduce the re-opening pressure by a factor of two from the value expected when the conventional theory is used. The conventional theory implies that the fracture always begins to open at a borehole pressure less than the shut-in pressure. However, due to the effect of large hydraulic compliance, the <b>reopening</b> <b>pressure</b> measured in the conventional manner becomes larger than the true <b>reopening</b> <b>pressure</b> and approaches the shut-in pressure. Contrary to this, the <b>reopening</b> <b>pressure</b> measured using the test equipment with sufficiently small compliance represents a good estimate of the true <b>reopening</b> <b>pressure.</b> This pressure is related to the maximum horizontal stress SH, and its measured value allows us to estimate the value of SH.|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{is suitable}} in principle for in-situ stress measurements at deep depths. However, {{as has been}} pointed out recently, its current testing systems and procedure involve essential problems which have to be solved before putting the principle into practice. The most serious problem {{is associated with the}} hydraulic compliance of fracturing systems. For measuring the <b>reopening</b> <b>pressure,</b> it is necessary to use the fracturing system with sufficiently small compliance. If not, {{there is no way to}} estimate the maximum horizontal stress from the <b>reopening</b> <b>pressure</b> assuming a vertical borehole, even though the maximum horizontal stress is the greatest concern in the stress measurement. This limitation makes it difficult to apply hydraulic fracturing for the stress measurement, because the compliance of the conventional system is so large. Taking into account of these facts, we have proposed recently a new method which will allow us to measure both of the maximum and minimum stresses by in-situ tests of hydraulic fracturing at a depth greater than a few km. We have proceeded to test and verify the concept step by step so far through field and laboratory experiments, and we succeeded in applying it to an in-situ test at a depth of 811 m in a vertical borehole drilled from the ground surface...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} in {{a vertical}} borehole induces fractures {{that will be}} vertical and normal to the minimum horizontal stress Sh (parallel to the maximum horizontal stress SH), {{if there is no}} influence of natural fractures. The induced fractures close with venting and open with re-pressurization. At those times, there appear two kinds of critical borehole pressure, the <b>reopening</b> <b>pressure</b> Pr and the shut-in pressure Ps, which characterize the variation of borehole pressure during the test. The conventional theory tells us that those two pressures are related to the two stress components of SH and Sh as follows (Haimson and Cornet...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{investigate}} the sorption of pulmonary surfactant (Infasurf, Ony, Buffalo, NY) occurring at the air-liquid interface of a semi-infinite finger of air as it oscillates and progresses along a small rigid tube (1 mminner diameter) occluded with a surfactant-doped solution of concentrations C= 0. 1, 0. 05,or 0. 01 mg/mL. This simple experimental model of pulmonary airway reopening {{is designed to}} examine how altering the fluid flow field may lower <b>reopening</b> <b>pressures</b> and lead {{to a reduction in}} airway wall damage that is associated with the mechanical ventilation of an obstructed pulmonary system in airways of the deep lung with depleted endogenous and little exogenous surfactant. We analyzed a range of pulsatile flow scenarios by varying the oscillation frequency (0 ≤f≤ 1 Hz), the oscillation flow waveform, and the steady flow rate (Qsteady= 0. 1 or 0. 01 mL/min). These experimental studies indicate that a high frequency (1 Hz, amplitude = 5 mm), fast-forward oscillation waveform superimposed onto a fast steady flow (0. 1 mL/min) substantially reduces mean <b>reopening</b> <b>pressures</b> (31 %) {{as a consequence of the}} modified flow field and the commensurate increase in surfactant transport and adsorption. This result suggests that imposing high frequency, low amplitude oscillations during airway reopening will help to diminish ventilator-induced lung injury...|$|R
50|$|In June 2014, it was {{revealed}} that Merseyrail are interested in opening 30 new stations, possibly including Maghull North and St. James; although it is unknown whether Tue Brook railway station is being considered, the route is regularly suggested for <b>reopening</b> by <b>pressure</b> groups.|$|R
30|$|Investigations on {{the stress}} {{state in the}} earth’s crust provide {{important}} information on its deformation process because such information obtained from the stress state is independent of that from the strain or the strain rate determined by geodetic and/or geological methods. A variety of methods have been proposed to measure the stress state at a depth using a borehole. These include the stress relief method and the hydraulic fracture test (HFT) that are sometimes regarded as standard methods {{even though they are}} associated with a number of specific defects. For example, it is difficult to apply the stress relief method to a large depth because this method requires precisely co-axial drilling of the hole as well as knowledge of the elastic property of rocks under the in situ stress condition. For the HFT, Ito et al. (1999) pointed out that the <b>reopening</b> <b>pressure</b> which is used to estimate the maximum horizontal compression (SHmax) cannot be read correctly by the ordinal HFT using a hydraulic system with large compliance.|$|E
40|$|Methods of {{measuring}} stress and its variations are briefly reviewed with {{particular interest in}} precise measurements at depth. Stress-relief methods are widely used techniques in the engineering field. Wireless strain-cells indicate the possibility of stress-relief methods for deep wells. However, elastic coupling of [rock mortar strain-meter] must be precisely estimated including thermal stress effects, before application to depth. The hydraulic fracturing method has been widely used in the geophysical field. However, serious suspicions about the interpretation of <b>reopening</b> <b>pressure</b> have also been raised in the past 20 years. As possible answers to these suspicions have been proposed recently, {{it is necessary to}} check past results again and cross-check the results of different methods. Non-hydrofracture methods are free from problems associated with the permeation of pressure fluid into artificial fracture and borehole wall. Furthermore, some non-hydrofracture methods do not need the assumption of principal stresses having a constant direction, which can be an advantage over hydrofracture methods for long-term observations of stress variations. Corebased and borehole-wall-fracture-based methods, unfortunately, cannot now be considered precise measurement methods. However, these methods have the potential to estimate stress, particularly at great depths...|$|E
