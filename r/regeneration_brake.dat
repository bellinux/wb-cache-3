40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} work {{is intended to}} analyse {{the expansion of the}} load range and the implementation of <b>regeneration</b> <b>braking</b> (RB) of the direct current drive by using the supercondenser power storage units. Methodology. To solve the problem, we use the methods of the electric drive theory, impulse electronics and the method of calculation of transient electromagnetic processes in linear electric circuits in the presence of super-condensers therein. Findings. The stiffness of the mechanical and electromechanical characteristics of a series motor is significantly increased, which makes it possible to use a DC drive under load, much smaller than 15 … 20 % of the nominal one. Numerical calculations of the operation process of the supercondenser power storage unit were fulfilled with a sharp decrease in the load of a traction electric motor of a direct current electric locomotive. The possibility of RB of the direct current drive with the series motor is substantiated. The equations of the process of charging and discharging of super-condenser storage unit in RB mode are solved. The authors examined the effect of capacitance on the nature of maintaining the excitation current of an electric motor in the mode of small loads. Originality. The paper developed theoretical approaches for the transformation of soft (mechanical and electromechanical) characteristics into hard ones of DC series motors. For the first time a new, combined method of the series motor RB is proposed and substantiated. Further development obtained the methods for evaluating the storage unit parameters, taking into account the criteria for reliable parallel operation of super-condensers with an electric motor field. Practical value. The proposed and substantiated transformation of soft characteristics into stiff ones allows us to use general-purpose electric drives with series motors and at low loads, and in traction electric drives - to reduce the intensity of electric stockwheel slipping.

In order to achieve a smooth coordinated action between the regenerative and the conventional friction brakes, the brake linings coefficient of friction (BLCF) needs to be monitored. The main contribution of this work lies on the estimation of the BLCF using a tire-model-less approach. In particular, two different observer designs are proposed and compared. Whereas the proposed approach does not rely on any fixed tire modelization, the state estimation is robust against variations in the road friction characteristics and tire uncertainties caused by inflating pressure variations, wear, and aging. The functionality of the developed observers is tested in IPG CarMaker® by employing an experimentally validated EV, equipped with four onboard motors and an EHB system. Braking events are simulated at different deceleration levels on both dry and wet surfaces.

This paper proposes some strategies to optimize the performance of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) implanted with auxiliary power source to construct a proper FCHV hybridization.

40|$|The rising {{concerns}} about the global warming and emissions on one hand, and the limited resources of fossil fuels on the other hand, have made electrification of vehicles a necessary topic among researchers and companies. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), which {{in addition to a}} primary power source, such as internal combustion engine or fuel cell, have an electric motor and an electric energy storage, such as a battery, have proved to decrease the fuel consumption. This is mainly due to <b>regeneration</b> of the <b>braking</b> energy, possibility to turn the engine off at low power demands, and higher efficiency gained from the extra freedom in choosing the engine operating points and downsized engine. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have the additional ability to run on electrical energy charged from the electrical grid due to their large capacity batteries. However, having extra electrical components in these vehicles, which results in higher cost, opens new questions concerning both the energy management and sizing of the components. This thesis further develops the application of convex optimization to simultaneously minimize operational and components costs. This means that besides the optimal component sizes, the optimization gives the optimal energy management strategy. Two different configurations, namely parallel and series PHEVs, are investigated. For a parallel PHEV, the effect of different performance requirement levels and battery prices on the optimal costs and sizes are investigated. For a series PHEV, the effect of driver’s driving and charging behaviors, performance requirements, and pricing scenarios on the optimal component sizes in different configurations are studied. To generate driving cycles that reflect driving patterns of different drivers, a systematic method based on Markov chain is used. Moreover, the impact of reduction in modeling detail is investigated on both computational time and accuracy of the results in the optimal sizing of a fuel cell PHEV.

40|$|Driven by {{the needs}} {{to reduce the}} {{dependence}} of fossil fuels and the emissions of conventional vehicles there has in recent years been an increasing interest in battery-powered electrified vehicles (xEVs). In xEVs, the battery pack, built from many small cells, {{is one of the}} most expensive components in the powertrain. As a result, the battery lifetime is an important factor for the success of xEVs. However, the battery pack lifetime is severely affected by the State-of-Charge (SOC) and thermal imbalance among its cells, which is inevitable in large automotive batteries. Therefore, thermal and SOC balancing is quite important to enhance their life-time. In this thesis, the use of a multi-level converter (MLC) as an integrated cell balancer and motor driver is investigated for application in xEVs. The MLC has a special modular structure which distributes a large battery pack into smaller units, enabling an independent cell-level control of a battery system. This extra degree-of-freedom enables the potential non-uniform use of cells, which along with <b>brake</b> <b>regeneration</b> phases in the drive cycle is exploited by MLC to achieve simultaneous thermal and SOC balancing. An MLC-based optimal control policy (OP) has been formulated, assuming dc machine as a load, which uses each cell in a battery submodule according to its SOC and temperature to achieve thermal and SOC balancing by optimally redistributing the power losses among the cells. Results show that OP reduces temperature and SOC deviations significantly compared with the uniform use of all cells. However, in applications involving three-phase ac machine, the MLC, in addition to its great balancing potential, also poses serious issues of extra battery heating and of extra ampere-hour throughput due to dc-link current ripple. These extra effects may accelerate the battery ageing if not compensated. A simple passive compensation method based on dc-link capacitor has been investigated, but it turns out that the size of the required capacitor is too big for automotive applications. Thus, it is concluded that, from battery's health viewpoint, it is unpromising to promote three-phase MLC as an integrated cell balancer and a motor driver in xEVs, unless some other more advanced active compensation technique is used...|$|R
