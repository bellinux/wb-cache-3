40|$|Acetalization of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) {{carrying}} mostly two terminal aldehyde {{groups was}} studied in aqueous acidic solution at different PVA concentrations. The transition from sol to gel {{or vice versa}} {{took place at the}} temperature, where an equilibrium was reached between acetalization and deacetalization. Using known rate constants for intra- and intermolecular acetalization as well as that for deacetalization, we could evaluate the extent of reaction at the sol-gel transition temperature, i. e., at the gel point. Comparison of the observed with the theoretical extent of reaction at the gel point revealed that contribution of intramolecular acetalization to the overall reaction was too large to be neglected. It was concluded that two types of intramolecular crosslinkings, both ineffective for gelation, were operative, the one producing a small ring and the other a large <b>ring.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: Poly(vinyl alcohol) / Terminal aldehyde groups / Inter-and intramolecular acetalization / Sol-gel transition tem...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{coverage}} path planning {{is to determine}} a path that passes a detector over all points in an environment. This work prescribes a provably complete coverage path planner for robots in unknown spaces. We achieve coverage using Morse decompositions which are exact cellular decompositions whose cells are {{defined in terms of}} critical points of Morse functions. Generically, two critical points define a cell. We encode the topology of the Morse decomposition using a graph that has nodes corresponding to the critical points and edges representing the cells defined by pairs of critical points. The robot simultaneously covers the space while incrementally constructing this graph. To achieve this, the robot must sense all the critical points. Therefore, we first introduce a critical point sensing method that uses range sensors. Then we present a provably complete algorithm which guarantees that the robot will encounter all the critical points, thereby constructing the full graph, i. e., achieving complete coverage.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{orientation}} of TMPA cations on montmorillonite affects the adsorbate-accessible siloxane surface area and determines whether the TMPA phenyl ring can {{interact with other}} aromatic adsorbates by ~r-lr interactions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the {{orientation of}} TMPA ions in the interlayer of normal-charge and reduced-charge Wyoming rnontmorillonite. The orientation of TMPA's phenyl group was investigated using infrared dichroism of selected aromatic ring vibrations. X-ray dif-fraction (XRD) and MacEwan Fourier transforms were used to determine interlayer spacings and to ascertain whether reduced-charge Wyoming montmorillonite is a randomly interstratified mixture of layers with two different d-spacings. For normal-charge montmorillonite, the infrared results howed that the C-N bond axis is neither perpendicular nor parallel to the surface, yet X-ray data suggested that the TMPA phenyl ring is perpendicular o nearly perpendicular tothe siloxane surface. In this orientation, the average adsorbate-accessible space between adjacent TMPA ions is 24 ~ 2, or about 1 / 3 of the total surface. When the phenyl ring of TMPA is perpendicular to the clay surface, aromatic ompounds hould be able to interact with TMPA's aromatic ring by ~r-Tr interactions, while polar compounds such as water can interact with positively charged nitrogen atom. The reduced-charge montmorillonite used in this study is a ran-domly interstratified mixture of about 25 % collapsed layers with no adsorbed cations and 75 % expanded layers that are propped open by TMPA's methyl groups, not by the aromatic ring. The adsorbate-accessible surface area on expanded layers of reduced-charge montmorillonite is 1. 5 to 2 times that on normal-charge TMPA-clay, depending on the orientation of TMPA's aromatic <b>ring.</b> <b>Key</b> Words [...] -Adsorbate, Infrared dichroism, Montmorillonite, Trimethylphenylammonium (TMPA) ...|$|E
