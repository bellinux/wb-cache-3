Much of its Australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks. Off New Guinea, the epaulette shark has been assessed as Near Threatened, as there it faces habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices, and over-exploitation by artisan fishers.|$|E
5|$|The finetooth shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans.

Other than off the southeastern United States, this species is of little commercial importance: it is small and occurs in water too shallow for most commercial and <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries,</b> and is generally too fast-swimming to be caught by shrimp trawlers. Small numbers are taken incidentally by floating longlines and on hook-and-line. This species is susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate, and to habitat degradation due to its inshore habits.|$|E

5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries,</b> by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them for resources.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the short-tail {{stingray}} {{consists of}} invertebrates and bony fishes, including burrowing and midwater species. It tends to remain within a relatively limited area throughout the year, preferring deeper waters during the winter, {{and is not}} known to perform long migrations. Large aggregations of rays form seasonally at certain locations, {{such as in the}} summer at the Poor Knight Islands off New Zealand. Both birthing and mating have been documented within the aggregations at Poor Knights. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother; the litter size is 6–10. The short-tail stingray is not aggressive but is capable of inflicting a potentially lethal wound with its long, venomous sting. It is caught incidentally by commercial and <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> throughout its range, usually surviving to be released. Because its population does not appear threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The pyjama shark is {{primarily}} nocturnal, {{spending most of}} the day lying motionless and hidden in a cave or crevice or among vegetation. It often forms groups, particularly during summer. This species is an opportunistic predator that feeds {{on a wide variety of}} fishes and invertebrates; it favors cephalopods and frequents the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo reynaudi). When threatened, it curls into a circle with its tail covering its head. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying rectangular, dark brown egg cases two at a time year-round. This small and harmless shark adapts well to captivity and is commonly displayed in public aquariums. It is often caught as a bycatch of commercial and <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Many are killed by fishers who regard them as pests. Although there are no data suggesting its numbers have declined, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pyjama shark as Near Threatened because of expanding small shark fishery activities within its limited range.|$|E

5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries</b> in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E

25|$|Around 1900, {{different}} salmon {{were introduced}} as sport fish. Only the king salmon (Chinook) {{adapted to the}} environment.

This paucity of fisheries makes the San Francisco Estuary unique. Nearly all estuaries worldwide support at least remnants of significant fisheries. The San Francisco Estuary at one time supported major fisheries for salmon, anchovies, and Dungeness crabs until the 1950s. The demise of these fisheries was probably due more to habitat loss than overharvesting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. Conservation and {{management}} of North American West Coast fisheries encompass {{a broad array of}} issues including the economic, spatial, and temporal relations between the coastal pelagic species live bait fishery and the highly migratory species <b>recreational</b> <b>fishery.</b> For the better part the century, the live bait fishery has supplied live bait to the commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fleet and private recreational anglers. Live bait consists primarily of small coastal pelagic species such as sardine, anchovy, and squid. The use of live bait in the recreational targeting of high value HMS species, such as albacore tuna, yellowtail tuna, bluefin tuna, marlin, and dolphin fish and the established nature of the live bait fishery's infrastructure differentiate the Southern California saltwater <b>recreational</b> <b>fishery</b> from other fisheries. Given its unique position on the interface between the coastal pelagic and highly migratory species fisheries, the live bait fishery finds itself at the nexus of conservation {{and management}} issues between both fisheries. Resource managers and industry have expressed interest in increasing the understanding and documentation of the fleet and in developing economic measures of the fleet's value and its contribution to the Southern California <b>recreational</b> <b>fishery.</b> This presentation lays the groundwork for economic research through the presentation of brief history and empirical characterization of the live bait fleet and its role in the <b>recreational</b> <b>fishery...</b>|$|R

25|$|Preying on {{demersal}} {{bony fishes}} and crustaceans, the speartooth shark is adapted for hunting in near-complete darkness.

The speartooth shark is threatened by incidental capture in commercial and <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries,</b> {{as well as by}} habitat degradation.

The species is also a target for light tackle saltwater fly fishermen, and can push 6-weight fly tackle to its limits. The blue runner is used extensively as live bait for larger fish, including billfish, cobia and amberjack. It is considered a fairly low-quality table fish, and larger specimens are known to carry the ciguatera toxin in their flesh, with several cases reported from the Virgin Islands.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{population}} {{levels are}} {{of concern in}} the Atlantic and {{in some parts of}} the Pacific. Alaska fishery stocks are still abundant, and catches have been on the rise in recent decades, after the state initiated limitations in 1972. Some of the most important Alaskan salmon sustainable wild fisheries are located near the Kenai River, Copper River, and in Bristol Bay. Fish farming of Pacific salmon is outlawed in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone, however, there is a substantial network of publicly funded hatcheries, and the State of Alaska's fisheries management system is viewed as a leader in the management of wild fish stocks. In Canada, returning Skeena River wild salmon support commercial, subsistence and <b>recreational</b> <b>fisheries,</b> as well as the area's diverse wildlife on the coast and around communities hundreds of miles inland in the watershed. The status of wild salmon in Washington is mixed.
