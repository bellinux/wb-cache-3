5|$|Highway401 {{features}} 19service centres {{controlled by}} the MTO. These service centres were announced in 1961 following public outcry over the lack of rest stops. They provide a place to park, rest, eat and <b>refuel</b> 24 hours a day.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} Saturday afternoon was split into threeparts. The first part ran for 20minutes, and cars that finished the session 16th or lower were eliminated from qualifying. The {{second part of}} qualifying lasted 15minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions11 to 15. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which {{failed to make the}} final session could <b>refuel</b> before the race, so ran lighter in those sessions. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to <b>refuel</b> before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.|$|E
5|$|For {{some species}} of waders, {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. This gives the migrants an opportunity to <b>refuel</b> for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.|$|E

5|$|As {{test flights}} {{conducted}} by No. 617 Squadron proved {{that it was}} not possible to make a return trip to Kaafjord from Scotland, and an evaluation of the main airstrip in the Shetlands determined that it was unsuitable for Lancasters, No. 5 Group's staff officers judged that it would be necessary for the aircraft to <b>refuel</b> in the Soviet Union. Detailed investigation of the airstrips near Murmansk found that they were at best marginal for heavy bombers and had almost no accommodation or aircraft servicing facilities. Moreover, the airstrips were vulnerable to attack from fighters operating from nearby German bases. Instead, it was decided that the attack force should fly over northern Sweden and Finland after raiding Kaafjord and <b>refuel</b> at Yagodnik airstrip, which was located on an island near Arkhangelsk. This plan was accepted by the Air Ministry on 6 September. Soviet Naval Aviation offered to attack German fighter bases at the same time as the British bombers arrived over the target area, but No. 5 Group rejected this proposal and requested that Soviet aircraft not fly near Kaafjord, to avoid alerting the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the wide}} range of tasks which have been {{assigned}} to the aircraft, the RAAF is currently not operating its Globemasters in all the roles of which the type is capable. For instance, in February 2013 the Air Force was reported to be investigating using C-17s to drop special forces boats as well as supplies to warships. Trials to develop the capacity to <b>refuel</b> RAAF Globemasters in flight from the force's Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports began in May 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Aerial <b>refueling,</b> [...] also {{referred}} to as air <b>refueling,</b> in-flight <b>refueling</b> (IFR), air-to-air <b>refueling</b> (AAR), and tanking, is the process of transferring aviation fuel from one military aircraft (the tanker) to another (the receiver) during flight. The two main <b>refueling</b> systems are probe-and-drogue, which is simpler to adapt to existing aircraft, and the flying boom, which offers faster fuel transfer, but requires a dedicated boom operator station.|$|R
50|$|The 305th Air <b>Refueling</b> Wing, Heavy, {{provided}} tanker <b>refueling</b> {{support to}} units {{involved in the}} invasion of Grenada in October 1983. The 931st Air <b>Refueling</b> Group departed Grissom on 1 July 1987. The Air Force Reserve on 1 July 1978 redesignated the 434th Tactical Fighter Wing as the 434th Air <b>Refueling</b> Wing, Heavy, giving it a similar mission {{to that of the}} 305th Air <b>Refueling</b> Wing, Heavy.|$|R

5|$|INS Shakti can <b>refuel</b> four ships at a time, with a {{fuelling}} {{speed of}} 1,500 tonnes per hour while her predecessors had {{a speed of}} 300 per hour. She is also equipped with state-of-the art electronics, medical facilities and storage spaces. According to Admiral Nirmal Verma, Shakti would significantly add to the Indian Navy's ability to conduct and sustain operations distant from the coast.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, Nos.1, 18 and 31 Squadrons {{attacked}} Japanese {{positions in}} Timor, while No.2 Squadron was withdrawn from combat to re-equip with Mitchells. No.79 Wing's light and medium bombers {{suffered from a}} lack of suitable targets as they had few airfields in forward areas from which to <b>refuel.</b> No.2 Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June. That month, No.18 Squadron flew 149 sorties, damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area, but lost its commanding officer to anti-aircraft fire during a raid.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to <b>refuel,</b> others staying for the winter. This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.|$|E
50|$|One of two <b>refueling</b> squadrons {{that the}} Strategic Air Command {{activated}} on 12 Jul 1948, the 43d Air <b>Refueling</b> Squadron, Medium, was the USAFâ€™s first air <b>refueling</b> unit.|$|R
50|$|On 1 October 1993, the NJ ANG 170th Air <b>Refueling</b> Group, combineded {{with the}} 108th Air <b>Refueling</b> Wing. The 108th welcomed the 150th Air <b>Refueling</b> Squadron's 37 years {{experience}} in airlift and air <b>refueling</b> operations, and its 130,454 accident-free flying hours, {{recognized as the}} worlds safest flying record.|$|R
50|$|The <b>refueling</b> {{system of}} larger {{aircraft}} includes a single positive pressure <b>refueling</b> {{point from which}} all tanks can be fueled. How much and to which tanks fuel is fed during <b>refueling</b> operations {{is determined by the}} controls in the <b>refueling</b> panel, usually installed nearby and accessible to ground crews.|$|R
5|$|Of the 108 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree. The initial Japanese attack {{did not succeed in}} neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to <b>refuel</b> and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses would be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1944 he {{collected}} a Mosquito from 21 Squadron and the Australian navigator Don Walsh and then flew to Norfolk to <b>refuel</b> at West Raynham. They {{took off and}} headed to the Danish coast. Out-to-sea he spotted, and was likely seen, by German coastal ships. As they neared land Braham and Walsh noticed a slight whine in the aircraft's radio speakers meaning the Mosquito was being tracked by radar.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 January, the final execute order was issued for a 02:45 launch of two CH-53E Super Stallions {{to arrive at the}} embassy at dawn. The 60 {{soldiers}} selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition. Two Marine Corps KC-130 refueling tankers were mobilized closer to the operation, from Bahrain to Oman, to <b>refuel</b> the helicopters en route to Mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from Trenton to Guam.|$|E

5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and <b>refuel</b> either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 254. An uninhabited area of the southern Pacific Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{terminal}} supplied 30% of Heathrow Airport's fuel, {{and because}} of the fire, the airport had to start rationing fuel. Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an intermediate stop at Stansted Airport or other European airports to <b>refuel,</b> while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow. Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they would normally take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months after the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} operates five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, {{the first}} of which entered service in June 2011. Two more are due for delivery in 2018. The aircraft are crewed by pilots, refuelling operators and flight attendants. Air-to-air refuelling is considered a force multiplier, permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft. The ability to <b>refuel</b> in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance than they might otherwise.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} the first {{to be able to be}} resupplied by the newly {{developed}} unmanned Progress freighters, although they could only dock at the rear port, as the front port lacked the plumbing used to <b>refuel</b> the propulsion system. The freighters docked automatically to the station via the Igla, and were then opened and emptied by the cosmonauts on board, whilst transfer of fuel to the station took place automatically under supervision from the ground.|$|E
5|$|A84-201 {{continued}} and next landed at RAAF Woomera Airfield in South Australia to <b>refuel.</b> Its nose wheel locked up while landing due to ice accretion, {{but this was}} able to be repaired and the aircraft took off at 0:19am, local time. The repairs delayed the aircraft by 83 minutes, however. A84-201 arrived at Harewood Airport in Christchurch at 4:32am local time, and placed second in the race with a flight time of 22hours and 29minutes. The winning aircraft, RAF Canberra WE139, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Monty Burton completed its flight in 22hours and 25minutes. The Â£3,000 prize money awarded to Raw for placing second was later donated to the RAAF Welfare Trust Fund.|$|E
5|$|AJ tankers {{were used}} to <b>refuel</b> John Glenn's Vought F8U-1P Crusader during the Project Bullet transcontinental speed record flight in July 1957; AJ-2s from VAH-6 on the West Coast and AJ-1s from VAH-11 on the East Coast. Beginning in 1957 the Douglas A3D Skywarrior began to replace the Savages in the VAH Squadrons. Their {{refueling}} role was continued by the formation in January 1958 of VAH-15 on East Coast and VAH-16 on the West Coast. Both squadrons were equipped with AJ-2s, but both were short-lived and disbanded early the following year.|$|E
