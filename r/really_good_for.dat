During the recording sessions in Los Angeles, Spector held Johnny at gunpoint, forcing him to repeatedly play a riff. Though it was to be the highest-charting album in the band's history—reaching number 44 in the United States and number 14 in Great Britain—Johnny made clear that he favored the band's more aggressive punk material: [...] "End of the Century was just watered-down Ramones.

[...] This stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny later oversaw, [...] Despite these reservations, Johnny did concede that some of Spector's work with the band had merit, saying [...] "It really worked when he got to a slower song like 'Danny Says'—the production really worked tremendously.

Allan said, [...] "Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show. Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed me with their performances in Hollyoaks Later and I'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly." [...] Loretta was initially paired with Dom and, after ending their relationship, was given links to other characters in the series. To prepare for the role Walton took pole-dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club. After watching girls perform at the club she carried out routines in her underwear.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. In {{a review of}} the PSP version of My Spanish Coach, IGN noted that acquiring mastery points in the minigames lead to [...] "quite a bit of grinding" [...] due to the game's repetitive structure. Nevertheless, IGN accepted that the repetition was an effective way to learn the vocabulary, and noted that [...] "icking up on things like gender and age, emphasis and the breakdowns of the actual language itself and proper/casual ways of conversing are made fairly clear and reinforced regularly". IGN's review of the DS versions of both games commented that neither game taught the future or past tense, calling it one of the [...] "most disappointing" [...] aspects of the game, but praised the effective incorporation of the DS stylus into the minigames. Eurogamer noted that the minigames were [...] "only <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> practicing reading" [...] {{due to a lack of}} games for practicing proper speaking, but GameZone disagreed, noting that the player was able to hear their attempt to speak the French or Spanish words alongside the correct pronunciation during lessons, and praised this aspect as the [...] "most interesting and intriguing feature of [...] ". In {{a review of the}} DS version of My Spanish Coach, Nintendo World Report lamented that many of the minigames [...] "exhibit the same type of unimaginative boringness" [...] and that [...] "it takes ages to unlock new lessons and mini-games"; however, it noted that the minigames were [...] "extremely effective" [...] and [...] "constructed extremely well" [...] in terms of teaching the language. Nintendo World Report's review of the DS version of My French Coach called the game's reference section [...] "a very handy travel dictionary", noting that having a dictionary list and a phrasebook with audio files that could bookmark chosen phrases was [...] "an absurd value".|$|E

500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back but, as we know, when she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks she wants the quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows what makes her tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered it gives him [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, i think he really took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey. Hollyoaks official website said Doctor Browning's motives in killing Lynsey were [...] "presumably to protect Mercedes".|$|E

I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times.

Bell also said he wanted to fire the band's manager Christy Priske, who was also Wolbers' wife, and Herrera and Wolbers refused. Herrera and Wolbers threatened to sign a new record deal without Bell, prompting him to form a new version of Fear Factory without them. In some interviews, Wolbers said Bell had made [...] "growing unacceptable demands", which were declined. He said, [...] "Ray and I wanted what was best for the business and what he [...] was trying to change wasn't <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the business.

[...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy.
