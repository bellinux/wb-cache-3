40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to compare healthcare-related costs of a 5 -day course with {{fludarabine}} phosphate i. v. vs a 5 -day course with oral fludarabine phosphate in Italian patients with chronic leukemia. A cost-minimization analysis was performed from both Italian National Healthcare Service (INHS) and hospital perspectives. Healthcare-related costs were collected from 2 out of a sample of 28 Ematology wards and included those of drug acquisition, drug preparation, drug administration, <b>reception</b> and <b>discharge</b> of patient before and after drug administration; hospital overheads were calculated {{as a percentage of}} the total healthcare-related costs. The reimbursement schemes for acquisition and administration of fludarabine phosphate i. v. were gathered from the whole sample of 28 Ematology wards taken into account. Costs were expressed in euros 2004. When compared to fludarabine phosphate i. v., oral fludarabine phosphate allowed savings ranging from 223, 47 euros (hospital perspective) to 477, 05 euros (INHS perspective) per patient. As far as hospital perspective was concerned, savings associated with oral fludarabine phosphate were due to hospital overheads (115. 1 %), drug preparation (19. 6 %), drug administration (17. 3 %), <b>reception</b> and <b>discharge</b> of patient before and after drug administration (2. 9 %), whereas costs for drug acquisition was higher for oral formulation (- 54. 8 %). When INHS perspective was taken into account, 3 out of 28 Ematology wards (11 %) were reimbursed on a drug-plus-outpatient-drug-administration-basis, whereas 25 out of 28 Ematology wards (89 %) were reimbursed on a day-hospital-stay-basis. Savings associated with oral fludarabine phosphate were due to day-hospital stay (253. 4 %), outpatient drug administration (1. 1 %), whereas cost for drug acquisition were higher for oral formulation (- 154. 5 %). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of basecase results. Savings associated with oral fludarabine phosphate may be of relevant interest for INHS policies aimed at reducing public expenditure for drugs in Italy...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of peak expiratory flow (P. E. F.) {{were done}} on 195 boys {{arriving}} at a detention centre, and again eight weeks later {{at the time of}} their discharge. During this time they took much physical exercise, and cigarette smoking and drug taking were not permitted. At the initial assessment there was an impairment of P. E. F. inversely proportional to the amount of cigarettes smoked which was statistically significant. There was a significant improvement in P. E. F. between <b>reception</b> and <b>discharge</b> in all groups of boys with varying smoking habits, all groups except the heavy smokers achieving near normal results after eight weeks. The heavier smokers improved more than the non-smokers or light smokers, but this difference was not statistically significant. Suggested reasons for this improvement are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Fort Dix {{is named}} for Major General John Adams Dix, {{a veteran of the}} War of 1812 and the Civil War. Construction began in June 1917. Camp Dix, as it was known at the time, was a {{training}} and staging ground for units during World War I. Though the camp was an embarkation camp for the New York Port of Embarkation it did not fall under the direct control of that command with the War Department retaining direct jurisdiction. The camp became a demobilization center after the war. Between the World Wars, Camp Dix was a <b>reception,</b> training and <b>discharge</b> center for the Civilian Conservation Corps. Camp Dix became Fort Dix on March 8, 1939, and the installation became a permanent Army post. During and after World War II the fort served the same purpose as in the first World War. It served as a training and staging ground during the war and a demobilization center after the war.|$|R

SCOPE The data in this report are extracted from the Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW) Offender Integrated Management System (OIMS) and the Juvenile Justice NSW (JJNSW) Client Information Management System (CIMS). The adult custody population figures include only those persons held in gazetted correctional centres managed by CSNSW. This includes: persons managed as forensic patients, persons held after expiry of their sentence awaiting deportation and persons awaiting extradition to another jurisdiction. Persons in the Special Purpose Centre at Long Bay Correctional Centre are not included. In addition to gazetted correctional centres, CSNSW manages a number of police/court cell complexes. This report excludes persons received into and then discharged from a CSNSW-managed 24 hour police/court cell complex without entering a gazetted correctional centre. Adults refused police bail but not held in a gazetted correctional centre are not included...|$|E

40|$|Cortically {{recorded}} evoked potentials {{to various}} peripheral and central stimuli were studied in chloralose anesthetized cats. Summation, blocking interaction, and facilitation were investigated by systematic pairing {{of all possible}} combinations of two stimuli. 1. 1. From the same locus in association cortex responses were recorded to peripheral, photic, auditory, and somesthetic stimulation and to contralateral cortex and mesencephalic reticular formation (MR) stimulation. 2. 2. Distinct differences in amount of convergence for the various stimuli was the rule. Photically initiated input was the strongest, followed in order of strength by the interhemispheric delayed response (IDR), the response to MR stimulation, and the responses, frequently of equal strength, to auditory and somesthetic stimulation. 3. 3. True facilitation was observed in association cortex by activity originating in the MR. 4. 4. Data support an interpretation of association cortex integrative capacity, based upon plastic, dynamic function accompanying <b>reception</b> of neural <b>discharges</b> from peripheral and central systems...|$|R
