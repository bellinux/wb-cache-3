5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the <b>roof,</b> even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the <b>roof</b> had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station <b>roof</b> down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow <b>roof.</b> The curve of the original <b>roof</b> design can still be seen on the interior brickwork.

50|$|The basic {{shapes of}} <b>roofs</b> are flat, mono-pitched, gabled, hipped, butterfly, arched and domed.

Pitched <b>roofs,</b> including gabled, hipped and skillion <b>roofs,</b> make up the greatest number of domestic <b>roofs.</b> Some <b>roofs</b> follow organic shapes, either by architectural design or because a flexible material such as thatch has been used in the construction.|$|R
25|$|After {{the great}} fire of 1601 (Keichō 6), the shogunate {{mandated}} that thatched <b>roofs</b> be modified into shingle <b>roofs.</b> Later, tiled <b>roofs</b> became fashionable among buildings inside luxurious daimyo residences and were also adopted in some chōnin residences. However, after the Great Fire of Meireki, a policy change banned {{the use of}} tiled <b>roofs</b> because the fire-resistant tiles fell from <b>roofs</b> and caused many injuries. Instead, flammable thatched <b>roofs</b> were required to be covered with earth to prevent fire from spreading. In 1661 (Kanbun 1), the use of thatched <b>roofs</b> in new buildings was also banned, making shingle <b>roofs</b> the only permitted choice.|$|R
5|$|A <b>roof</b> was {{restored}} to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a <b>roof</b> to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand <b>roof</b> were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{buildings}} extant {{at the royal}} city {{during the time of}} King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the political capital of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original <b>roof</b> thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid rosewood and topped by a peaked <b>roof</b> that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the <b>roof</b> of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The <b>roof</b> horns (tandrotrano) formed {{at each end of the}} <b>roof</b> peak by the crossing of the gable beams were originally silver-plated, and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle of the <b>roof</b> peak. Silver ornaments were also hung from the corners of the <b>roof</b> in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an exterior wall near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims come here to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to show respect for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.|$|E

50|$|Lead {{has been}} a popular <b>roofing</b> {{material}} for centuries, being used for <b>roofing,</b> flashing, gutters, downspouts, and conductor heads.

Beginning in the 19th century, a <b>roofing</b> material called “terne” or “terneplate” was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin alloy. It is frequently confused with tinplate.|$|R

50|$|Akbari's has {{conducted}} ground-breaking {{research on the}} potential for cool <b>roofing</b> and paving materials to reduce the urban heat islands effect. Cool <b>roofs</b> are effective heat-island mitigation technologies that save cooling energy use and result in a lower ambient temperature. In January 2001, Akbari led a study to modify the California Title 24 (Building Energy Standards) to offer credit for the installation of cool <b>roofs.</b> He continued that work, proposed modifications to adopt cool <b>roofs</b> as a “prescriptive” requirement for low-slope nonresidential buildings in California. The proposal {{was approved by the}} California Energy Commission in November 2003, and the code became effective in October 2005. Akbari worked on similar proposals for the adoption of cool <b>roofs</b> as “prescriptive” requirements for (1) nonresidential steep-slope <b>roofs,</b> (2) residential low-slope <b>roofs,</b> and (3) residential steep-slope <b>roofs.</b> In addition, he provided basis and assistance for the development of cool <b>roofs</b> standards in Florida, Chicago, Georgia, and Atlanta.|$|R
5|$|Between {{the early}} 16th {{and the late}} 17th centuries, an {{original}} tradition of stone tented <b>roof</b> architecture developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European Gothic architecture of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced {{the invention of the}} stone tented <b>roof</b> (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called Petrok Maly may have been an author of the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent tented <b>roof</b> churches.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{buildings}} and structures can range from complete or partial <b>roof</b> collapse to less catastrophic damage of exterior and internal materials. Impacts depend on the thickness of ash, whether it is wet or dry, the <b>roof</b> and building design and how much ash gets inside a building. The specific weight of ash can vary significantly and rain can increase this by 50-100%. Problems associated with ash loading are {{similar to that of}} snow; however, ash is more severe as 1) the load from ash is generally much greater, 2) ash does not melt and 3) ash can clog and damage gutters, especially after rain fall. Impacts for ash loading depend on building design and construction, including <b>roof</b> slope, construction materials, <b>roof</b> span and support system, and age and maintenance of the building. Generally flat roofs are more susceptible to damage and collapse than steeply pitched roofs. Roofs made of smooth materials (sheet metal or glass) are more likely to shed ash than roofs made with rough materials (thatch, asphalt or wood shingles). <b>Roof</b> collapse can lead to widespread injuries and deaths and property damage. For example, the collapse of roofs from ash during the 15 June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption killed about 300 people.|$|E
5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow on the <b>roof</b> and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping <b>roof</b> melts and flows down the <b>roof,</b> under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the <b>roof</b> under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
50|$|Solar {{shingled}} <b>roofs</b> {{tend to have}} a deep, dark, purplish-blue {{or black}} color, and therefore look similar to other <b>roofs</b> in most situations. Tesla Solar has developed shingles in several styles to better match traditional <b>roofs.</b> Homeowners may prefer solar shingles because they avoid having large panels on their <b>roofs.</b>|$|R
