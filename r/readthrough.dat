500|$|Filming began {{two weeks}} after the <b>readthrough,</b> on March 5, 2010, and took over two weeks to shoot. Wiseman's {{direction}} was to film the episode like a [...] "postcard of Hawaii," [...] {{but at the same time}} show its darker side when the team fight the antagonists. Dae Kim's schedule overlapped between the Five-0 pilot and Lost, although at the time his character in the latter show was in the process of being killed off. The first few days of filming was affected due to bad weather conditions, particularly strong winds and sudden sporadic rain showers. The first day was spent in Pearl Harbor, near the USS Missouri (BB-63). Line producer Pat Crowley made an appearance as a helicopter pilot. The second day of filming took place at the North Shore, shooting scenes for Kono's introduction. Before filming began, Park, who had never surfed before, was taught the basics, though the scenes in which Kono surfs were mostly done by a body double. Filming was severely hindered by bad weather, forcing the production team to reschedule. Day three was spent on Kamekona's scenes.|$|E
2500|$|Konishi {{designed}} all the characters, {{making sure}} each main character had a distinctive silhouette for players to identify. Based on input from Atlus staff, Konishing made his character designs more refined. Both Stocke and Eruca were initially {{designed to be}} supporting characters, as {{at the time the}} protagonist was still to be a sword. After consulting with Atlus, the characters were made the main protagonists. Stocke was originally a plain-looking assassin dressed completely in black, described by Konishi as an amalgamation of typical [...] "cool" [...] character traits. When he became the main character, Konishi changed his color to red, reworked his hair so it did not cover his eyes, and made his uniform more militaristic. While it was considered to allow the player to rename Stocke, after multiple <b>readthroughs</b> of the script the team decided against it.|$|R
5000|$|Lee and I {{first met}} in a South London {{rehearsal}} room, where five frantic grinning actors were hurriedly trying to learn their parts in comedy sketches which Lee and I had been commissioned to write independently. The show was called [...] "Words, Words, Words" [...] (or as it became affectionately known, [...] "Worst, Worst, Worst"), the brainchild of Marjorie Sigley, Head of Children's Programmes at Thames TV. She was trying to disguise education-based material as pure light entertainment, which seemed quite an interesting challenge. Other writers were involved too, but somehow Lee and I became the main contributors and so we began {{seeing a lot of}} each other's work at the following <b>readthroughs.</b> I thought Lee's stuff was annoyingly good, and he thought my stuff was irritatingly splendid, so when Lee was later given the go-ahead to develop a comedy-drama which shared similar aspirations to the one-off [...] "Words" [...] series, he rang and asked if I would like to collaborate. Up until this time I had trained and worked mostly as an actor (Glasgow Citizens Theatre, Lyric Hammersmith, Royal Shakespeare Company) but because I also loved writing (and had a tax bill to pay) I immediately said [...] "certainly".|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to the cast seen in the final cut of the film, Bill Pullman, Lukas Haas, and Mickey Rourke also performed but their scenes were eventually cut. Billy Bob Thornton recorded narration that was scrapped. Martin Sheen and Viggo Mortensen participated in <b>readthroughs</b> of the script and are thanked in the end credits. Editor Leslie Jones was on location for five months and rarely saw Malick, who left her to her own devices. After principal photography wrapped, she {{came back with a}} five-hour first cut and spent seven months editing, with Thornton contributing three hours of narrative voice-over material. It was at this point that editor Billy Weber came on board, and they spent 13 months in post-production and the last four months mixing the film, using four Avid machines with a fifth added at one point. Malick edited the footage one reel at a time with the sound off while listening to a Green Day CD. There were no preview screenings but several in-house ones, the largest of which was attended by 15 people for marketing executives. The editors faced the challenge of blending footage of veteran actors with less-experienced ones, integrating the many cameos, and the voice-overs. According to Jones, [...] "Malick removed scenes with dialogue whenever possible, with the final film varying greatly from the original concept". Four months after principal photography, Malick invited Toll to a rough-cut screening of the film. In December 1998, Toll did the first color correction at the lab prior to the film's release in North America.|$|R

50|$|Gag/pol {{translational}} <b>readthrough</b> site (or Retroviral <b>readthrough</b> element) is a cis-regulatory element {{found in}} retroviruses.

5000|$|Stop codon {{suppression}} or translational <b>readthrough</b> {{occurs when}} in translation a stop codon is {{interpreted as a}} sense codon, that is, when a (standard) amino acid is 'encoded' by the stop codon. Mutated tRNAs can {{be the cause of}} <b>readthrough,</b> but also certain nucleotide motifs close to the stop codon. Translational <b>readthrough</b> is very common in viruses and bacteria, and has also been found as a gene regulatory principle in humans, yeasts, bacteria and drosophila. This kind of endogenous translational readthough constitutes a variation of the genetic code, because a stop codon codes for an amino acid. In the case of human malate dehydrogenase, the stop codon is read through with a frequency of about 4%. Amino acids inserted at the stop codon depends of the identity of the stop codon itself: Gln, Tyr and Lys; have been found for UAA and UAG codon, while Cys, Trp, Arg for UGA codon have been identified by mass spectrometry ...|$|E

50|$|This gene encodes a subunit of an ATP-dependent {{chromatin}} remodeling complex, INO80, {{which plays}} a role in DNA and nucleosome-activated ATPase activity and ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding. <b>Readthrough</b> transcription of this gene into the neighboring downstream gene, which encodes WW domain-binding protein 1, generates a non-coding transcript.|$|E
50|$|Termination of {{elongation}} {{depends on}} eukaryotic release factors. The process {{is similar to}} that of prokaryotic termination, but unlike prokaryotic termination, there is a universal release factor, eRF1, that recognizes all three stop codons. Upon Termination, the ribosome is disassembled and the completed polypeptide is released. eRF3 is a ribosome-dependent GTPase that helps eRF1 release the completed polypeptide. The human genome encodes a few genes, whose mRNA stop codon are surprisingly leaky: In these genes, termination of translation is inefficient due to special RNA bases in the vicinity of the stop codon. Leaky termination in these genes leads to translational <b>readthrough</b> of up to 10% of the stop codons of these genes. Some of these genes encode functional protein domains in their <b>readthrough</b> extension so that new protein isoforms can arise. This process has been termed 'functional tranlational readthrough'.|$|E
50|$|A third example {{has been}} seen in yeast. Evolutionary events in which stop codons are lost {{preserve}} the reading frame much more often than would be expected from mutation bias.

5000|$|... eIF3 stimulates {{nearly all}} steps of {{translation}} initiation. [...] eIF3 {{also appears to}} participate in other phases of translation, such as recycling, where it promotes the splitting of post-termination ribosomes. In specialized cases of reinitiation following uORFs, eIF3 may remain bounds to the ribosome through elongation and termination to promote subsequent initiation events.

5000|$|At the {{transcript}} level, {{disruption of the}} EAR motif leads to {{a significant decrease in}} the expression of distally located eps genes (epsF-O) without affecting proximal genes (epsC-E). Consistent with this observation, several potential intrinsic terminator hairpins were found inside the epsF coding region. [...] A wild-type EAR element is capable of promoting transcriptional <b>readthrough</b> of these epsF terminator sites. In contrast, mutational disruption of EAR instead permits termination at the epsF terminators. The EAR element also promotes <b>readthrough</b> of heterologous termination sites. From these data it was hypothesized that the EAR element controls eps expression through a processive antitermination mechanism to ensure the complete synthesis of the 16 kilobase operon. [...] Processive antitermination, as opposed to {{the transcript}}ion attenuation mechanism typically used by other cis-acting regulatory RNAs, is a process wherein the transcription elongation complex is altered by accessory factors to become resistant to pausing and termination signals. So far, EAR is the only processive antitermination system specific for Gram-positive bacteria. Further experiments failed to reconstitute EAR-mediated processive antitermination mechanism in vitro or in a Gram-negative heterologous host (E. coli), suggesting that additional B. subtilis-specific factor(s) may also be required for EAR antitermination.|$|E
50|$|Translational {{regulation}} {{refers to}} {{the control of the}} levels of protein synthesized from its mRNA. The corresponding mechanisms are primarily targeted on the control of ribosome recruitment on the initiation codon, but can also involve modulation of the elongation or termination of protein synthesis.

An example of regulation at the level of initiation is the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2. An example of regulation at the level of termination is functional translational <b>readthrough</b> of the lactate dehydrogenase gene LDHB.|$|E

5000|$|The rapid {{proliferation}} of DNA sequencing technologies {{has led to}} the identification of many apparent pseudogenes using gene prediction techniques. Pseudogenes are often identified by the appearance of a premature stop codon in a predicted mRNA sequence, which would, in theory, prevent synthesis (translation) of the normal protein product of the original gene. There have been some reports of translational <b>readthrough</b> of such premature stop codons in mammals, as reviewed in the [...] "Translational readthrough" [...] section of the stop codon article. As alluded to in the figure above, a small amount of the protein product of such <b>readthrough</b> may still be recognizable and function at some level. If so, the pseudogene can be subject to natural selection. That appears to have happened during the evolution of Drosophila species, as described next.In 2016 it was reported that 4 predicted pseudogenes in multiple Drosophila species actually encode proteins with important biologically functions, [...] "suggesting that such 'pseudo-pseudogenes' could represent a widespread phenomenon". For example, the functional protein (an olfactory receptor) is found only in neurons. This finding of tissue-specific biologically-functional genes that could have been dismissed as pseudogenes by in silico analysis complicates the analysis of sequence data. As of 2012, it appeared that there are approximately 12,000-14,000 pseudogenes in the human genome, almost comparable to the oft-cited approximate value of 20,000 genes in our genome. The current work may also help to explain why we are able to live with 20 to 100 putative homozygous loss of function mutations in our genomes.|$|E

This is the first Doctor Who episode to be shot at the new dedicated Upper Boat studios in Pontypridd; the TARDIS set had previously been housed in former warehouse space in Newport. Although the episode was set during Christmas, filming took place in July, where temperatures reached 30C in Cardiff during filming. Night filming of scenes involving gunfire, explosions and a tank disturbed some Cardiff residents, including one American woman returning home from the conflict in Lebanon.

5000|$|The {{amber codon}} {{is the least}} used codon in Escherichia coli, but {{hijacking}} it results in a substantial loss of fitness. One study in fact {{found that there were}} at least 83 peptides majorly affected by the <b>readthrough</b> Additionally, the labelling was incomplete. As a consequence, several strains have been made to reduce the fitness cost, including the removal of all amber codons from the genome.In most E. coli K-12 strains (viz. Escherichia coli (molecular biology) for strain pedigrees) there are 314 UAG stop codons. Consequently, a gargantuan amount of work has gone into the replacement of these. One approach pioneered by the group of Prof. George Church from Harvard, was dubbed MAGE in CAGE: this relied on a multiplex transformation and subsequent strain recombination to remove all UAG codons—the latter part presented a halting point in a first paper, but was overcome. This resulted in the E. coli strain C321.ΔA, which lacks all UAG codons and RF1.

5000|$|Variations on the {{standard}} code were predicted in the 1970s. The first was discovered in 1979, by researchers studying human mitochondrial genes. Many slight variants were discovered thereafter, including various alternative mitochondrial codes. Small variants such as translation of the codon UGA as tryptophan in Mycoplasma species, and translation of CUG as a serine rather than leucine in yeasts of the [...] "CTG clade" [...] (such as Candida albicans). Because viruses must use the same genetic code as their hosts, modifications to {{the standard}} genetic code could interfere with viral protein synthesis or functioning.

5000|$|Processive antitermination can be {{mediated}} by RNA {{as well as}} proteins. Coliphage HK022, alone among the known lambdoid phages, does not encode an analog to lambda N. Instead, it promotes antitermination of early phage transcription through the direct action of transcribed sequences called put (for polymerase utilization) sites. There are two closely related put sites, one located in the PL operon and the other located in the PR operon, roughly corresponding to {{the positions of the}} nut sequences in lambda and in other lambda relatives. put sites act in cis to promote <b>readthrough</b> of downstream terminators in the absence of all HK022 proteins. The put transcripts are predicted to form two stem-loops separated by a single unpaired nucleotide. This prediction is supported by mutational studies and the pattern of sensitivity of the two RNAs to cleavage with single- and double-strand-specific endoribonucleases. RNA structure is critical to antitermination because mutations that prevent the formation of base pairs in the stems reduce function, and these mutations can be suppressed by additional mutations that restore base pairing. Like lambda N and Q, the PUT sequences suppress polymerase pausing and promote processive antitermination in a purified in vitro transcription system. In contrast to lambda N, no phage or auxiliary bacterial factors are required. The only mutations known to block PUT-mediated antitermination change highly conserved amino acids located in a cysteine-rich amino-proximal domain of the RNAP beta' subunit. Strains carrying these mutations are unable to support lytic growth of HK022 but are normal in all other respects tested, including lytic growth of lambda and other lambda relatives. The phage-restricted phenotypes conferred by these mutations suggest that they alter a domain of RNAP-beta’ that interacts specifically with nascent PUT RNA in the transcription elongation complex, but this idea has not been directly tested. The stability of the putative PUT-RNAP interaction {{and the nature of the}} PUT-induced modification to the elongation complex are unknown.|$|E
