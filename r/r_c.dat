40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of COL 2 A 1 missense mutations are substitutions of obligatory glycine residues in the triple helical domain. Only a few non-glycine missense mutations {{have been reported}} and among these, the arginine to cysteine substitutions predominate. Objective: To investigate in more detail the phenotype resulting from arginine to cysteine mutations in the COL 2 A 1 gene. Methods: The clinical and radiographic phenotype of all patients in whom an arginine to cysteine mutation in the COL 2 A 1 gene was identified in our laboratory, was studied and correlated with the abnormal genotype. The COL 2 A 1 genotyping involved DHPLC analysis with subsequent sequencing of the abnormal fragments. Results: Six different mutations (<b>R</b> 75 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 365 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 519 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 704 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 789 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 1076 <b>C)</b> were found in 11 unrelated probands. Each mutation resulted in a rather constant and site-specific phenotype, but a perinatally lethal disorder was never observed. Spondyloarthropathy with normal stature and no ocular involvement were features of patients with the <b>R</b> 75 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 519 <b>C,</b> or <b>R</b> 1076 <b>C</b> mutation. Short third and/or fourth toes was a distinguishing feature of the <b>R</b> 75 <b>C</b> mutation and brachydactyly with enlarged finger joints a key feature of the <b>R</b> 1076 <b>C</b> substitution. Stickler dysplasia with brachydactyly was observed in patients with the <b>R</b> 704 <b>C</b> mutation. The <b>R</b> 365 <b>C</b> and <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> mutations resulted in classic Stickler dysplasia and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC), respectively. Conclusions: Arginine to cysteine mutations are rather infrequent COL 2 A 1 mutations which cause a spectrum of phenotypes including classic SEDC and Stickler dysplasia, but also some unusual entities {{that have not yet}} been recognised and described as type II collagenopathies.

5|$|Although Saba' was {{previously}} allied with Aksum against Ḥimyar, both Ḥimyarite and Sabaean troops {{were used in}} the attack against Ḥaḑramawt. Immediately following the conquest of Hadramaut, Sha`ir Awtar allied with Ḥimyar against his former ally GDRT. A second Sabaean inscription from the sanctuary 'Awam in Marib during the reign of Sha`ir Awtar's successor, Luha`atht Yarhum, describes events {{in the latter part of}} his predecessor's reign. The inscription tells of a diplomatic mission sent by Sha`ir Awtar to GDRT, the results of which are unknown; however, the text later goes on to describe a war between Saba' and Aksum in the southern highlands of Yemen, implying that the negotiations were futile. Aksum lost a battle as a result of the Saba'-Ḥimyar alliance, allowing the South Arabian forces to expel GDRT's son BYGT and his forces from the Ḥimyarite capital Zafar, which had previously been held by Aksum after the Aksum-Ḥaḑramawt-Qatabān-Saba' alliance. Despite this loss, Aksum still held territory in South Arabia, as evidenced by inscriptions of Luha`atht Yarhum (<b>r.</b> <b>c.</b> 230), which detail at least one known clash with hbšt troops in Yemen after GDRT's reign. Peace may have been established after GDRT's death, but war and Aksumite involvement was renewed under his successors such as `DBH and GRMT, and the whole 3rd century was to be dominated by Ethio-Yemeni conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century Eastern Roman monk {{and former}} {{merchant}} {{who wrote the}} Christian Topography (describing the Indian Ocean trade leading {{all the way to}} China), visited the Aksumite port city of Adulis and included eyewitness accounts of it in his book. He copied a Greek inscription detailing the reign of an early 3rd-century polytheistic ruler of Aksum who sent a naval fleet across the Red Sea to conquer the Sabaeans in what is now Yemen, along with other parts of western Arabia. Ancient Sabaean texts from Yemen confirm that this was the Aksumite ruler Gadara, who made alliances with Sabaean kings, leading to eventual Axumite control over western Yemen that would last until the Himyarite ruler Shammar Yahri'sh (<b>r.</b> <b>c.</b> 265 – c. 287) expelled the Aksumites from southwestern Arabia. It is only from Sabaean and Himyarite inscriptions that we know the names of several Aksumite kings and princes after Gadara, including the monarchs `DBH and DTWNS. Inscriptions of king Ezana mention stone-carved thrones near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum (the platforms of which still exist), and Cosmas described a white-marble throne and stele in Adulis that were both covered in Greek inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|The Kandariya Mahadeva {{temple was}} built {{during the reign}} of Vidyadhara (<b>r.</b> <b>c.</b> 1003-1035 CE). At various periods of the reign of this dynasty many famous temples {{dedicated}} to Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Shakti of the Hindu religion and also for the Thirthankaras of Jain religion were built. Vidhyadhara, also known as Bida in the recordings of the Muslim historian Ibn-al-Athir was a powerful ruler who fought Mahmud of Ghazni in the first offensive launched by the latter in 1019. This battle was not conclusive and Mahmud had to return to Ghazni. Mahmud again waged war against Vidhyadhara in 1022. He attacked the fort of Kalinjar. The siege of the fort was unsuccessful. It was lifted and Mahmud and Vidhyadhara called a truce and parted by exchanging gifts. Vidhyadhara celebrated his success over Mahmud and other rulers by building the Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple, dedicated to his family deity Shiva. Epigraphic inscriptions on a pilaster of the mandapa in the temple mentions the name of the builder of the temple as Virimda, which is interpreted as the pseudonym of Vidhyadhara. Its construction is dated to the period from 1025 and 1050 AD.|$|E

5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of spring steel wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably <b>R.</b> <b>C.</b> Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E

40|$|Collagen II is {{the major}} {{collagen}} present in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, in addition it {{is found in the}} vitreous of the eye and it is also detected during early embryogenesis. Due to the complexity of the biosynthesis, assembly and secretion, collagen II is highly susceptible to mutations leading to disease states which are broadly classified as chondrodysplasias. Most of these mutations are substitutions of glycine in the Gly-X-Y repeats in the triple helical domain resulting in destabilization of the helix. Point mutations leading to arginine to cysteine substitution are interesting since they occur at either X or Y position and cause two different diseases termed Stickler syndrome and congenital spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SEDC) in association with osteoarthritis. The present study aimed at determining the consequences of arginine to cysteine substitutions in either X or the Y position in the Gly-X-Y repeats and at either the N- or the C- terminus of the triple helix. The impact of these mutations on protein trafficking, secretion and cell survival was also analyzed. Biochemical studies revealed great similarities between <b>R</b> 75 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 134 <b>C</b> and <b>R</b> 704 <b>C</b> collagens and the wild type molecules with the exception that electron micrographs of <b>R</b> 75 <b>C</b> collagen displayed kinks in the structure. <b>R</b> 740 <b>C</b> and <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> collagens accumulated in the cells and the <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> protein migrated faster on SDS gels. The <b>R</b> 740 <b>C</b> and <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> proteins were also susceptible to protease digestion and circular dichroism spectra were altered and showed lower Tm values than other collagen II variants. Due to the altered structure, <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> protein was more susceptible to MMP cleavage {{in the vicinity of the}} mutation causing the truncation of the protein. Additionally, electron micrographs revealed only scarce and thin filamentous structures in preparations of <b>R</b> 740 <b>C</b> and <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> protein. The biochemical results indicate that the <b>R</b> 740 <b>C</b> and <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> proteins have unstable triple helices and that this affects the overall protein structure. Protein trafficking was monitored in HT 1080 cells expressing the collagen II variants. Intracellular retention in the ER due to misfolding of the <b>R</b> 740 <b>C</b> and <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> proteins triggered an ER stress response including splicing of XBP- 1 and induction and binding of BiP. Continuous accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER caused apoptosis of the <b>R</b> 740 <b>C</b> and <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> expressing cells. Substitution of arginine to cysteine in the X or Y position towards the C-terminus of the triple helix caused pronounced instability of the triple helix with a deleterious effect on the cells, while <b>R</b> 704 <b>C</b> and more N-terminal mutations did not cause any significant changes irrespective of being in the X or the Y position. The different severities of patient phenotypes are due to a combination of structural factors, which may be synergistically augmented by genetic modifiers, additional unknown mutations and environmental factors...|$|R
