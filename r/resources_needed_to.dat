5|$|Franklin {{points out}} that the {{technological}} nature of war requires states to conscript the <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction. Thus, people opposed to war are forced—through taxation—to pay for war preparations even if it violates their individual conscience.|$|E
5|$|His {{government}} {{was recognized by}} the western Allies. Nonetheless Sikorski's government struggled to get its point of view heard by France and the United Kingdom. The western Allies refused to recognize the Soviet Union as an aggressor, despite the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939. Furthermore, he struggled to secure <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> recreate the Polish Army in exile.|$|E
5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E

5|$|In June 1975, O'Neill led a ten-week {{study of}} {{permanent}} space habitats at NASA Ames. During the study {{he was called}} away to testify on July 23 to the House Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. On January 19, 1976, he also appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Aerospace Technology and National Needs. In a presentation titled Solar Power from Satellites, he laid out his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space. He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing. In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited workers would mine the mineral <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> build space colonies and solar power satellites.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany, {{supported}} by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, {{with the ultimate}} goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> defeat Germany's remaining rivals.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E

50|$|Projects {{are going}} to use common <b>resources.</b> Organizations <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{accommodate}} parallel projects while adhering to the Theory of Constraints concepts. This requires developing a prioritization scheme for the resource to determine the correct order to do work (i.e. proportion of the project buffer remaining). As before, once the scheme has been developed, the <b>resource</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be focused (not multitasking) on completing the task as soon as possible.|$|R

It is named after Andrey Kolmogorov, who first published on the subject in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{sponsored}} the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Law, the nations' first law that deals specifically with human trafficking. This law provided government prosecutors with the <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> prosecute offenders {{as well as}} resources to help victims rebuild their lives. In 2003, a second Smith trafficking law—the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act—took effect. Smith's original trafficking law also reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act.|$|E

25|$|Local {{and state}} {{government}} officials started to understand, after several surveys made during {{the latter part of}} the 19th century, that only action by the federal government could provide water <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> support the development of the West. Starting in 1902, Congress passed a series of acts authorizing the establishment of the United States Bureau of Reclamation to oversee water development projects in seventeen western states.|$|E
25|$|Michael Hammer and James Champy {{felt that}} these <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be restructured. In {{a process that}} they labeled reengineering, firm's reorganized their assets around whole {{processes}} rather than tasks. In this way a team of people saw a project through, from inception to completion. This avoided functional silos where isolated departments seldom talked to each other. It also eliminated waste due to functional overlap and interdepartmental communications.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{in a bid}} {{to enhance}} the {{linguistic}} experience of students, the Ministry of Education strongly encouraged schools to offer Conversational Malay and Chinese to those who do not take either of these languages as their Mother Tongue. By providing the schools with the <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> implement the programme, the Ministry of Education has succeeded in significantly increasing the number of participating schools. More importantly, the programme was also well received by students.|$|E

50|$|However, {{there are}} still some {{obstacles}} for combating corruption. In order to make sure that anti-corruption measures are being implemented effectively, some necessary resources such as human <b>resources</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be increased.

25|$|Freegans also {{advocate}} sharing travel resources. Internet-based ridesharing or hitchhiking reduces {{but does}} not eliminate use of cars and all the related <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> maintain and operate them. Community bicycle programs and collectives facilitate community sharing of bicycles, restore found and broken bikes, and teach people how {{to do their own}} bike repairs. In the process, they aim to build a culture of skill and resource sharing, reuse wasted bikes and bike parts, and create greater access to green transport.|$|E
25|$|The {{recession}} {{economy of}} {{the late twentieth century}} began to take shape. In addition to the war on drugs, were added the atomization of city resources, the lack of continuity in the development plans of the next government, and the lack of human and fiscal <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> implement the mayor plans. All this created a climate of mistrust among the population, industry and regional government. In this environment, the policy of economic openness government by Colombian President Gaviria caught the city poorly prepared.|$|E
25|$|As the {{population}} grew, occupational niches developed, and {{people began to}} specialize in certain skills. There {{was an increase in}} artisans, who worked in pottery, jewelry and textiles. Like the later Inca, the Tiwanaku had few commercial or market institutions. Instead, the culture relied on elite redistribution. That is, the elites of the empire controlled essentially all economic output, but were expected to provide each commoner with all the <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> perform his or her function. Selected occupations include agriculturists, herders, pastoralists, etc. Such separation of occupations was accompanied by hierarchical stratification within the empire.|$|E

25|$|A {{problem is}} {{regarded}} as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> solve them, such as time and storage. Other complexity measures are also used, such {{as the amount of}} communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do.|$|E
25|$|As the below table demonstrates, the {{population}} of Byzantium did not fall {{as a result of}} Seljuq acquisitions; manpower was still as readily available in 1143 as in 1025. In fact, Western Asia Minor and Greece experienced a population growth on an unprecedented scale, thanks in part due to the trade of the Italian city states of Venice and Genoa and also due to the influx of Greek refugees fleeing the Seljuq Turks. Manuel Komnenos' first expedition to Iconium saw the entire Greek population of Philomelion evacuated and settled west. However, the efficiency and <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> raise large armies had dwindled somewhat, as can be seen by John and Manuel's failure to create a national army.|$|E

The Carrera forces had to hide in the mountains. Believing Carrera totally defeated, Morazán and Barrundia marched to Guatemala City, and were welcomed as saviors by state governor Pedro Valenzuela and members of the conservative , who proposed to sponsor one of the liberal battalions, while Valenzuela and Barrundia gave Morazán all the Guatemalan <b>resources</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> solve any financial problem he had.
