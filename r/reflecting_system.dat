Sediment tracers, which can either occur naturally in the soil or be applied to the soil, have been increasingly used to quantify erosion and deposition of sediments.

40|$|For {{situations}} in which the standard point kinetic model does not adequately characterize the kinetic behavior of a <b>reflected</b> <b>system,</b> the Avery-Cohn differential equations can be used. However, these equations require that one determine the coupling parameters between the core and the reflector, f{sub cr} and f{sub rc}. The coupling parameter, f{sub cr}, represents {{the probability that a}} neutron in the core will leak into the reflector, and the coupling parameter, f{sub rc}, represents the probability that a neutron in the reflector will scatter back into the core. As discussed in Reference 3, these two coupling parameters can be calculated from the multiplication factor of the bare core, k{sub c}, the effective multiplication factor of the integral system, k{sub eff}, and the fraction of system neutrons absorbed in the core region, P{sub ca}. The methodology presented in Ref. 3 was described for a fully <b>reflected</b> <b>system,</b> but it is also applicable to some types of partially <b>reflected</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, it is applicable to those systems where neutrons leaving any core surface not contiguous to the reflector have a zero probability of entering the reflector. In other words, these surfaces have a view factor of 0 to all reflector surfaces in the system. However, if the view factor between an unreflected core surface and a reflector surface is not zero, then the aforementioned methodology has to be modified. To calculate f{sub cr}, one must include an estimate of the single-pass probability that a neutron escapes from the core to infinity, f{sub ci}. This is accomplished by including a view factor(s) in the calculations that accounts for the fraction of neutrons that are not traveling on a line intersecting some portion of the reflector.

Two tests of the full system with direct illumination of the heat storage by the sun have been conducted. Temperature measurements were done by thermocouples in the heat storage and on the secondary reflector, and a thermal camera was used to monitor the temperature of the top plate of the heat storage.

Hence, data mining techniques that enable the extraction of hidden and potentially useful information in educational databases have been employed to explore educational data. A new promising area of research called educational data mining (EDM) has emerged. Reflect is a Web-based learning system that supports learning by reflection. Reflection is a process in which individuals explore their experiences in order to gain new understanding and appreciation, and research suggests that reflection improves learning. The <b>Reflect</b> <b>system</b> has been used at the University of Sydney’s School of Information Technology for several years as a source of learning and practice in addition to the classroom teaching. Using the data from a system that promotes reflection for learning (such as the <b>Reflect</b> <b>system),</b> this thesis focuses on the investigation of how reflection helps students in their learning. The main objective is to study students' learning behaviour associated with positive and negative outcomes (in exams) by utilising data mining techniques to search for previously unknown, potentially useful hidden information in the database. The approach in this study was, first, to explore the data by means of statistical analyses. Then, popular data mining algorithms such as the K-means and J 48 algorithms were utilised to cluster and classify students according to their learning behaviours in using Reflect. The Apriori algorithm was also employed to find associations among the data attributes that lead to success. We were able to group and classify students according to their activities in the <b>Reflect</b> <b>system,</b> and identified some activities associated with student performance and learning outcomes (high, moderate or low exam marks). We concluded that the approach resulted in the identification of some learning behaviours that have important impacts on student performance...|$|R
40|$|Several {{research}} efforts are invested to develop stochastic geometry models for cellular networks with multiple antenna transmission and reception (MIMO). On one hand, there are models that target abstract outage probability and ergodic rate for simplicity. On the other hand, there are models that sacrifice simplicity to target more tangible performance metrics {{such as the}} error probability. Both types of models are completely disjoint {{in terms of the}} analytic steps to obtain the performance measures, which makes it challenging to conduct studies that account for different performance metrics. This paper unifies both techniques and proposes a unified stochastic-geometry based mathematical paradigm to account for error probability, outage probability, and ergodic rates in MIMO cellular networks. The proposed model is also unified in terms of the antenna configurations and leads to simpler error probability analysis compared to existing state-of-the-art models. The core part of the analysis is based on abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering signals by assuming Gaussian signaling.

The network performs sequential learning through sliding data window <b>reflecting</b> <b>system</b> dynamic changes, and dynamic growing-and-pruning structure of FNN. The salient characteristics of the AVS-FNN are as follows: (1) Structure-learning and parameters estimation are performed automatically and simultaneously without partitioning input space and selecting initial parameters a priori.

The proposed method effectively generates a fuzzy neural model with a highly accurate and compact structure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AVS-FNN has a self-organizing ability, which can determine the structure and parameters of the FNN automatically. The application of this new approach has been applied successfully in the 3 DOF helicopter systems, showing the effectiveness and potential of the proposed design techniques.

We used a manipulative field experiment combining stable isotope enrichment with compartmental modelling (WinSAAM) and ecological network analysis (EcoNet) to investigate the impacts of organic enrichment on the food web structure and dynamics of an estuarine sandflat, and to evaluate the combined use of structural and process indicators in estuaries. Organic enrichment was achieved by addition of powdered algae to increase organic content (OC) from 0. 8 % (background) to 3, 5 and 10 %. Six dominant compartments including microphytobenthos, meiofauna and soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus) were sampled. Increasing organic content decreased the total abundance of meiofauna and number of meiofaunal taxa. C flow rates and indices <b>reflecting</b> <b>system</b> functioning, however, showed non-linear responses. Carbon flow rates between compartments {{and the proportion of}} carbon cycling within the system both decreased from background to enrichment at 3 and 5 % OC, but then increased at 10 % OC. On these measures the highest OC treatment was most similar to background controls, which could be misinterpreted as a sign of health of highly enriched sites. Additional interpretation of indicators for the 10 % treatment showed, however, that the high proportion of internal cycling was a result of a much reduced number of compartments (i. e. some taxa had been lost).

40|$|Camouflage is {{a method}} by which animals obtain {{concealment}} from other animals by blending in with their environment. Of the cephalopods, the octopods have an extra-ordinary ability to match their surroundings by changing the colour and texture of their skin. Skin patterns of the common octopus, O. vulgaris, are built up hierarchically from elements, units and components. Chronic patterns are longlasting, and are most commonly worn by Octopus; acute patterns last only seconds or minutes. Patterns {{are made up of}} components. Light and dark (chromatic) components can be distinguished, as well as components related to skin texture, or those related to posture and movement of arms, mantle, funnel, head and eyes. Components combined in series with like components and in parallel with unlike components, comprise whole patterns. At close range, Octopus skin is seen to be made up of units; patches surrounded by grooves. Papillae often arise from the centre of patches. each "chromatic unit" is made up of 3 types of elements. Most superficially lie differently coloured chromatophores; underneath these are two types of reflecting elements, reflecting cells and leucophores. Chromatophores can be expanded or retracted by their radial muscle fibres, which are under nervous control. The nervous control system is hierarchical: the paired anterior and posterior chromatophore lobes send nerves to innervate chromatophores of the head, arms and mantle. These lobes receive fibres form the paired lateral lobes which, in turn, receive fibres from the paired optic nerves, the ultimate controllers of chromatophores. Interestingly, O. vulgaris is found to be colour-blind. However, this animal is very capable of discerning differences in brightness, and this information is used to regulate the state of the chromatophores, thereby matching the tone of the surroundings. The reflector cells and leucophores (especially revealed in bright light when chromatophores are contracted) reflect incident wavelengths. The colour-blind Octopus is able to perfectly match its surroundings by actively forming a good intensity match using its chromatophores, thereby incidentally revealing a <b>reflecting</b> <b>system</b> that is able to match the background hues. Thus, if Octopus takes care of the luminance, the colour takes care of itself resulting in perfect camouflage. ...|$|E
