40|$|The {{formation}} of mierotrenehes in polysilicon p lasma etching over thin gate oxides {{has been observed}} and modeled. Microtrenches are small trenches fo rmed in the bot tom of etching features and are caused by the localized breakthrough of the gate oxide and subsequent rapid etching of the underlying silicon. In contrast to previous reports, the mierotrenehes were observed a small distance away f rom the sidewall. Their formation and position were functions of the thickness and angle of the photoresist and polysilicon sidewalls. Simulat ion of ion scattering f rom the sidewalls of the etching features indicated that the flux of ions at the bot tom of the feature was peaked away f rom the sidewall under the process conditions of this study. The position of the peak ion flux predicted by the mode l and the experimentally observed trench varied {{in a similar fashion}} {{as a function of the}} topography of the etched feature. Microtrenching was observed in the p lasma etching of submieron trenches in polysilicon after overetehing. We de-fine a microtrench as a nar <b>row</b> <b>groove</b> etched in the bot tom of the nominal ly rectangular feature.

40|$|The {{formation}} of segmental grooves during mid embryogenesis in the Drosophila epidermis {{depends on the}} specification of a single <b>row</b> of <b>groove</b> cells posteriorly adjacent to cells that express the Hedgehog signal. However, the mechanism of groove formation {{and the role of}} the parasegmental organizer, which consists of adjacent rows of hedgehog- and wingless-expressing cells, are not well understood. We report that although groove cells originate from a population of Odd skipped-expressing cells, this pair-rule transcription factor is not required for their specification. We further find that Hedgehog is sufficient to specify groove fate in cells of different origin as late as stage 10, suggesting that Hedgehog induces groove cell fate rather than maintaining a pre-established state. Wingless activity is continuously required in the posterior part of parasegments to antagonize segmental groove formation. Our data support an instructive role for the Wingless/Hedgehog organizer in cellular patterning...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{earliest}} inventions for keeping track of commercial transactions is the abacus, an instrument that helps a person make arithmetic calculations. Invented over 4500 {{years ago in the}} mid-east, it was further developed by the Egyptians and Chinese into its present form. A variety of different abacus designs exist. The word "abacus " comes from the Greek abax, meaning "counting board. " The device has other names in Asian languages. Cash registers today mechanically implement many of the functions of the abacus. In ancient times the abacus was composed of a <b>row</b> of <b>grooves</b> in sand into which pebbles were placed. Later, the use of a slate or a board made it a portable device, widely used throughout Asia. Today, it is composed of beads strung on parallel wires in a rectangular frame, and is still in use where electricity and batteries are scarce or expensive. For example, a Russian version, the schoty, was still in widespread use within the last decade. The abacus works on the principle of place-value notation: the location of the bead determines its value. In this way, relatively few beads are required to depict large numbers. The beads are counted, or given numerical values, by shifting them in one direction. The Cash Drawer By the middle of the 19 th century, the cash drawer, with its dividers to hold bills and coins, was a common feature of retail establishments all over the world. But as business volume grew under the imputus of the industrial revolution and increasing urbanization, there arose a need for quick and accurate summeries of a daily transactions for each point of sale. Because {{there was no way to}} easily audit transactions, dishonest cashiers frequently augmented their incomes by removing cash when their supervisors were not present...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} {{application}} of grooved type casing treatment for suppression of spike stall {{in an isolated}} axial compressor rotor blade <b>row.</b> The continuous <b>grooved</b> casing treatment covering the whole compressor circumference is of 1. 8 mm in depth and located between 90 % and 108 % chord of the blade tip as measured from leading edge. The method of investigation is based on time-accurate three-dimensional full annulus numerical simulations for cases with and without casing treatment. Discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations {{has been carried out}} based on an upwind second-order scheme and k-ω-SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence modeling has been used for estimation of eddy viscosity. Time-dependent flow structure results for the smooth casing reveal that there are two criteria for spike stall inception known as leading edge spillage and trailing edge backflow, which occur at specific mass flow rates in near-stall conditions. In this case, two dominant stall cells of different sizes could be observed. The larger one is caused by the spike stall covering roughly two blade passages in the circumferential direction and about 25 % span in the radial direction. Spike stall disturbances are accompanied by lower frequencies and higher amplitudes of the pressure signals. Casing treatment causes flow blockages to reduce due to alleviation of backflow regions, which in turn reduces the total pressure loss and increases the axial velocity in the blade tip gap region, as well as tip leakage flow fluctuation at higher frequencies and lower amplitudes. Eventually, it can be concluded that the casing treatment of the stepped tip gap type could increase the stall margin of the compressor. This fact is basically due to retarding the movement of the interface region between incoming and tip leakage flows towards the rotor leading edge plane and suppressing the reversed flow around the blade trailing edge...|$|R
40|$|Being {{particularly}} critical components, the serviceability {{of rolling}} element bearings is usually {{essential for the}} machines operation. They {{have been the subject}} of research for more than a 100 years. The work of this manuscript investigates two aspects of rolling element bearings. Firstly, the dynamic behaviour of a rolling element bearing is analysed. The study emphasises the influence of the lubricant film on the bearing dynamics. Secondly, the lifetime of the bearing is analysed. The study discusses the influence of external dynamic loads on the lubricant film formation and wear of the raceway surfaces. The bearing dynamics and lifetime are experimentally analysed using an innovative and versatile test rig. The first contribution of the current work consists of the development of this test rig. The test rig is designed and constructed in-house and characterised by three unique features. Firstly, the test rig allows easy adjustment to test different types and sizes of rolling element bearings. The test bearing is mounted in a modular structure consisting of an auxiliary shaft and an intermediate sleeve. Secondly, the test rig allows applying a multi-axial static and dynamic load on the test bearing. The bearing load is controlled in both the radial and axial direction and has a static and dynamic component in both directions. Thirdly, the test rig allows simultaneous measurement of the bearing motion, the bearing dynamics and the behaviour of the lubricant film. Relations between the different measurements can be derived experimentally. The radial, axial and tilt motion are measured free from disturbances of the surrounding structure. The bearing dynamics are identified in a frequency range below the resonances of the surrounding structures flexible modes. The behaviour of the lubricant film is analysed based on the electrical resistance through the bearing. In the current study, a single <b>row</b> deep <b>groove</b> ball bearing is used as a test bearing. The bearing motion, the behaviour of the lubricant film and cage slip are analysed for different operational conditions of the bearing. The three properties are derived using techniques which can be applied in most rotating machinery: measurement of the radial bearing displacement and the electrical resistance through the bearing. Clear trends w. r. t. the bearing load, temperature and speed are obtained. Clean analysis of the bearing motion and cage slip further proves precise operation of the test rig. The electrical resistance reveals the formation of the lubricant film during a run-up of the bearing speed. Estimation of the lubricant film thickness based on the electrical resistance is validated using an analytical model. Exploring the possibilities to easily and accurately identify the properties is the second contribution of this work. Accurate knowledge on the bearing dynamic properties is essential during the design of many rotating machinery. They determine the machines critical speeds, the forces acting on the different components, etc. This work investigatestwo dynamic properties of the test bearing: the radial stiffness and damping in the direction of the static load. Variation of the bearing temperature reveals the influence of the lubricants viscosity on the identified stiffness and damping. Variation of the bearing speed reveals the influence of the film formation on the identified stiffness and damping. In the literature, no experimental measurements showing the relations between the behaviour of the lubricant film and the dynamic properties are reported. Revealing these relations is the third contribution of the current study. The results help to evaluate the significance of modelling the lubricant film when numerically analysing the vibrations of a bearing system. Precise prediction of the lifetime of rolling element bearings is a crucial step towards a reliable design of many rotating machines. For bearings subjected to highly varying loads, a strong reduction of the actual bearing lifetime w. r. t. the classically calculated bearing lifetime is observed. This work investigates the effect of external dynamic loads on the lubricant film formation and surface wear of the test bearing. When introducing a radial or axial excitation on the bearing, the lubricant film thickness follows the imposed variations of the load. An increase of metallic contact or breakdown of the lubricant film is not detected. Under axial excitation, sliding motion between asperities of the contacting surfaces in the bearing does occur. Accelerated lifetime tests under high axial dynamic load reveal polishing of the raceway honing structure. This polishing is clearly observed on SEM images of the inner raceway after a test duration of only 0. 5 % of the calculated L 10 life. Analysis of the lubricant film behaviour under dynamic load is not described in the current literature and is considered to be the fourth contribution of this work. Finally, the study promotes further research to analyse surface wear due to external dynamic loads. status: publishe...|$|R
