40|$|Small {{chip and}} Asplund fiber of {{temperate}} hardwood and softwood (beech and red pine respectively) {{as well as}} tropical hardwood (<b>red</b> <b>lauan)</b> were pulped by acidfied chlorite and peracetic acid at laboratory-scale basis. Experimentally holopulp of these three species was made at 5 - 15 % lower yield than theoretical value but obtained in up from 15 - 16 % higher residual pentosan, holopulp of beech and red pine {{was not easy to}} beat as compared with chemical pulps. Nevertheless, <b>red</b> <b>lauan</b> was developed on a contrary trend. The holopulp was higher in color reversion and lower in scattering coefficient and opacity than conventional chemical pulp. Also the former had higher tensile, bursting and folding strengths but lower tearing strength than the corresponding characteristics of the latter. The physical properties of peracetic acid pulp were higher than chlorite pulp. The fact, however, happened only to the case of beech but red pine and <b>red</b> <b>lauan.</b> Limited data suggested that pentosan retention was responsible for all the above optical and physical differences...|$|E
40|$|The size {{effects in}} {{shearing}} strength were investigated {{by means of}} the torsional test in two species of Western hemlock and <b>Red</b> <b>lauan.</b> The torsional tests were carried out by using four kinds of specimens whose size were two times, four times and eight times as long as the smallest specimens respectively. The shearing strength of these specimens was measured. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) It was observed that there was a high negative correlation between logarithms of the shearing strentgh (log Î³max) and logarithms of the volume of the specimens (log V). Preticularly, the regression line in three kinds of specimens, except the smallest one (Type I specimen), was very nearly identical. Accordingly, it was considered that the shearing fracture coincided with the weakest link theory. 2) The constants of the size effect of Western hemlock specimens were 10. 8 (shearing strength in radial section) and 10. 7 (shearing strength in tangential section). The constants of <b>Red</b> <b>lauan</b> specimens were 10. 0 (shearing strength in radial section) and 9. 26 (shearing strength in tagential section) ...|$|E
40|$|Intumescent {{material}} with commercial resin, such as acrylic copolymer resin, {{has been demonstrated}} to be extremely effective in improving the fire performance of wooden materials used for indoor furnishing. This study investigates the enhancement of painted thin <b>red</b> <b>lauan</b> (Parashorea spp.) plywood by using intumescent coating with organo-clays added with different types of Cloisite 30 B, Cloisite 10 A and Cloisite 15 A and different amounts of organo-clays (1, 3, 5 and 10 %). These intumescent formulations significantly enhanced the fire retardancy of painted plywood, exhibiting lower peak heat release rates (PHRR) and extending the time to reach PHRR, as compared with plywood panels coated with intumescent coating with absence of organo-clay. Therefore, the amount of organo-clays added in intumescent is important. In additional, 3 % of Cloisite 30 B and 5 % of Cloisite 10 A further enhanced fire retardancy. The FT-IR, (27) Al and (31) P NMR analyses demonstrated that adding organo-clay extended the survival duration of the phosphor-carbonaceous chars structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Holopulps of {{rice straw}} (Oryza sativa). barley straw (Hordeum vulgare), bagasse (Saccharurn officinarum). and moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel) were {{prepared}} by chlorite and peracetic acid oxidative processes. The chemical, optical, and physical {{properties of the}} resulting holopulps were compared with the corresponding properties of the holopulps prepared from beech (Fagus crenata), red pine (Pinus densifloru), and <b>red</b> <b>lauan</b> (Shorea negrosemis) by the same techniques. The common characteristics of holopulps of both the woody and non-woody plants were that the yield, residual lignin, pentosan retention, beating time, brightness, light scattering coefficient, and handsheet density of the peracetic acid pulps were lower than the corresponding chemical and optical properties of the chlorite pulps prepared from the same plants. Taking the differences by the theoretical yields as a comparison basis, the holopulps of the woody plants would have higher yields {{than those of the}} non-woody plants. In the holopulps of non-woody plants, it was. found that the higher the yield, the lower the brightness, and that the strength properties of peracetic acid pulps were higher than those of chlorite pulps. Such characteristics were not observed in the holopulps prepared from woody plants. Another striking difference between holopulps prepared from the two group plants is that the strength properties of pulps from non-woody plants were lower than those of pulps from woody plants. Holopulps of rice straw, in particular, had the lowest strength properties and highest optical properties...|$|E
40|$|The beating {{behaviour}} of the chlorite and {{peracetic acid}} pulps prepared from beech (temperate hardwood), red pine (temperate softwood), and <b>red</b> <b>lauan</b> (tropical hardwood) was studied. The {{differences in the}} beatability of those pulps lie in the differences amongst fiber morphology of wood species and amongst holopulping conditions. An excess oxidative delignification or a sulfuric acid treatment can improve the pulp beatability. The removal of hemicelluloses and the structural modifications of the external and internal surfaces of the pulp fibers take place simultaneously in those chemical treatments. It is shown that the variation of pulp beatability depends on the structural modifications of pulp fibers {{rather than on the}} quantity of lignin or hemicelluloses or on the kind of hemicelluloses. A decrease in the degree of polymerization of the hemicelluloses can also affect the beatability of pulp fibers. It is inferred that the positive influence on pulp beatability should be attributed to the regions of structural modifications existing in the outside and inside of pulp fibers, which facilitate further their swelling and fibrillation. The presence of hemicelluloses in those regions is preferable for the amelioration of pulp beatability. The action of the excess oxidative delignification and the sulfuric acid treatment is like that of a prebeating process. A new method based on the rate of evaporation of acetone sorbed by pulp fibers has been developed to estimate the internal surface of pulp fibers...|$|E
30|$|Flat-sawn {{specimens}} of eight wood species, albizia (Paraserianthes falkata, 0.23 g/cm 3), Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica, 0.31 g/cm 3), <b>red</b> <b>lauan</b> (Shorea sp., 0.36 g/cm 3), European spruce (Picea abies, 0.44 g/cm 3), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga douglasii, 0.50 g/cm 3), elm (Ulmus sp., 0.51 g/cm 3), Japanese beech (Fagus crenata, 0.64 g/cm 3), and Japanese birch (Betula maximowicziana, 0.71 g/cm 3), were impregnated with {{low molecular weight}} phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin and their compressive deformations were compared. The volume gain (VG) and weight gain due to 20 % resin solution impregnation were different among species. Furthermore, the specific volume gain (VG/specific gravity), indicating the degree of swelling of the cell wall, also varied from 17.7 % for European spruce to 26.4 % for elm. Oven-dried {{specimens of}} each species were compressed using hot plates fixed to an Instron testing machine. The deformation behavior of resin-impregnated wood up to 10 MPa was significantly different among the species. Stress development during cell wall collapse for low density wood was minimal. As a consequence, a significant increment of density occurred up to 2 MPa for low density wood such as albizia and Japanese cedar. When PF resin-impregnated wood was compressed up to 2 MPa and the pressure was kept constant for 30 min, the density of Japanese cedar reached 1.18 g/cm 3, about 30 % higher than the density of compressed Japanese birch, which possesses an original density that is 2.5 times {{higher than that of}} Japanese cedar. The mechanical properties of resin-impregnated wood, especially low density wood, increased with density. Hence, it is manifested that low density wood species have an advantage as raw materials for obtaining high-strength wood at low pressing pressure.|$|E
