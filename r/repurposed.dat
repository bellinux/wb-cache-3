40|$|This paper investigates basic {{research}} issues {{that need to}} be addressed for developing an architecture that enables <b>repurposing</b> of learning objects in a flexible way. Currently, there are a number of Learning Object Content Models (e. g. the SCORM Content Aggregation Model) that define learning objects and their components in a more or less precise way. However, these models do not allow <b>repurposing</b> of fine-grained components (sentences, images…). We developed an ontology-based solution for content <b>repurposing.</b> The ontology is a solid basis for an architecture that will enable on-the-fly access to learning object components and that will facilitate <b>repurposing</b> these components...|$|R

5|$|Copenhagen's urban {{development}} {{in the first half}} of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and <b>repurposed</b> its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen’s spacial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.|$|E

40|$|As {{a society}} {{we are running}} out of {{resources}} and the number of products discarded everyday is no longer sustainable. How can design facilitate a solution to this problem? Design for <b>Repurposing,</b> presents a new strategy for incorporating the concept of <b>repurposing</b> in product design, which aims to extend the longevity of products by intentionally designing features or details that facilitate <b>repurposing.</b> <b>Repurposing</b> is the transformation of products or their components to suit a second purpose after their first has expired. For example, an old truck’s wheel rim is transformed into a grill by welding iron legs onto it. I explored the concept of designing for <b>repurposing</b> by interviewing, photographing and observing how people in developing countries, such as Mexico, transform existing products into different objects for other uses. I translated these observations into a detailed artifact analysis with reflections on what makes certain objects attractive or suitable to those who <b>repurpose</b> them. Design for <b>repurposing</b> converts consumers into engaged users who invest time to transform and customize products, thus easing the amount of waste in landfills and saving energy, money and the environment. The new purposes assigned to products can be classified into three categories: planned, coached and open-ended. These categories share a common goal: to extend the longevity of an object’s use. <b>Repurposing</b> also happens at different scales, such as batch production, and individual level (Do it Yourself: DIY). My thesis contains descriptive information and two checklists for designers, manufacturers and engineers seeking another strategy for sustainable design.

40|$|Serious {{games are}} one of the most content-rich forms of {{educational}} media, often combining high fidelity visual and audio content, novel interaction paradigms, and diverse pedagogic approaches. This article describes exploratory work towards identifying the key issues faced when <b>repurposing</b> serious games in order to enable their use and reuse in the same or different educational contexts. To address these issues, we propose a theoretical framework for the <b>repurposing</b> of serious games in medical education and in education in general.

These case studies demonstrate the ability to <b>repurpose</b> a serious game into new learning objects, covering two different paradigms of content <b>repurposing</b> - language and pedagogy...|$|R
50|$|<b>Repurposing</b> {{refers to}} a {{television}} industry practice in which content providers negotiate deals that allow a series to earn additional revenue during its original run. This is made possible by airing the series multiple times on the broadcast network which licensed it, or airing it concurrently on a cable network. As a result, the window between original run and syndication is shortened dramatically. <b>Repurposing</b> was the first significant adaptation of industry distribution practice {{since the advent of}} cable. <b>Repurposing</b> shortened the window to a matter of days between original run and syndication. Broadcast and cable developed <b>repurposing</b> pacts usually produced by studios also owned by broadcast networks or its conglomerate. Cable programmers hoped to increase audiences and awareness.|$|R
5|$|Following Walt Disney's passing, Wolfgang Reitherman {{continued}} as both producer {{and director of}} the features. The studio began the 1970s with the release of The Aristocats, the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney. In 1971, Roy O. Disney, the studio co-founder, died and Walt Disney Productions was left in the hands of Donn Tatum and Card Walker, who alternated as chairman and CEO in overlapping terms {{for the rest of the}} decade. The next feature, Robin Hood (1973), was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation <b>repurposed</b> from previous features. Both The Aristocats and Robin Hood were minor box office and critical successes.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 {{enjoyed a}} measure of {{popularity}} throughout the Western world during the war, but from 1945 it was rarely performed outside the Soviet Union. It became a point of controversy in the 1980s after Solomon Volkov's Testimony suggested it was a critique not of the Nazis, but of the Soviet government. The veracity of Volkov's account, which he claims is rooted in interviews with Shostakovich, has been debated. Other issues of contention about the symphony include whether it {{was inspired by the}} attack on Leningrad (as Soviet authorities and official accounts had asserted) or planned earlier and <b>repurposed</b> for propaganda, as well as its artistic merit compared to Shostakovich's other works.|$|E

5|$|After the Machtergreifung (NSDAP {{seizure of}} power) in January 1933, the relief fund was <b>repurposed</b> to provide general {{accident}} and property insurance, so Bormann resigned from its administration. He {{applied for a}} transfer and was accepted {{as chief of staff}} in the office of Rudolf Hess, the Deputy Führer, on 1 July 1933. Bormann also served as personal secretary to Hess from 4 July 1933 until May 1941. Hess' department was responsible for settling disputes within the party and acted as an intermediary between the party and the state regarding policy decisions and legislation. Bormann used his position to create an extensive bureaucracy and involve himself in as much of the decision-making as possible. On 10 October 1933 Hitler named Bormann Reichsleiter (national leader – the highest party rank) of the NSDAP, and in November he was named Reichstag deputy. By June 1934, Bormann was gaining acceptance into Hitler's inner circle and accompanied him everywhere, providing briefings and summaries of events and requests.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the revolt, Hananu {{effectively}} created a quasi-independent state between Aleppo and the Mediterranean Sea. Hananu's rebels first began administering captured territory in Armanaz, where the rebels coordinated with that town's municipality to impose taxes on landowners, livestock owners and farmers to fund their operations. From there, Hananu's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages, including Kafr Takharim, and the district centers Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib. The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced, but <b>repurposed</b> to support the financial needs of the rebels and promote their social convictions. Kafr Takharim became the legislative center of rebel territory with a legislative committee in place to collect money and weapons from local sources, and a supreme revolutionary council to oversee judicial matters.|$|E
5|$|Kameo {{is known}} for its {{prolonged}} development cycle, which spanned four Nintendo and Microsoft consoles. It was conceived as a Pokémon-style game of capturing and nurturing monsters, but traded its lighthearted Nintendo overtones for darker themes more befitting of Xbox audiences when Microsoft acquired the developer. In this process, Kameo was <b>repurposed</b> from a fairy to an elf—a transition the game's director later concluded was unsuccessful. While nearly finished for the original Xbox console, the title was delayed to become an exclusive launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Rare used the extra time to improve the game's audiovisuals, including Rare's first orchestral soundtrack, and add a local cooperative multiplayer mode. Kameo released alongside the Xbox 360 launches: November 2005 in North America and several weeks later in Europe.|$|E

5|$|On August3, the United States Weather Bureau {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch for coastal {{areas of the}} Big Island in Kau and Puna districts. As Dot swept by the Hawaiian islands, various gale warnings and small craft warnings shifted westward to reflect the hurricane's predicted path. Due to the storm's sudden northward shift in movement, hurricane warnings were issued for portions of Oahu and the Kauai channel before being issued for only the island of Kauai. All watches and warnings were discontinued on August7 after Dot weakened below hurricane intensity. Disaster workers in Oahu and Kauai were warned by civil defense agencies and the American Red Cross to prepare for emergency. Roughly 400people fled from the beaches of Kauai due {{to the threat of}} storm surge, with an additional 500people being evacuated by authorities as the storm neared the island. After the storm caused flooding in Kauai, nearly 1,000people evacuated out of submerged areas into schools, armories, and public facilities <b>repurposed</b> as emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of European agricultural methods, the shores of San Francisco Bay consisted mostly of tidal marshes. Today, the bay has been significantly altered heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water delivery, shipping, agriculture, and urban development, with side effects including the loss of wetlands and {{the introduction}} of contaminants and invasive species. Approximately 85% of those marshes have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 marshes and marsh fragments remain. Huge tracts of the marshes were originally destroyed by farmers for agricultural purposes, then <b>repurposed</b> to serve as salt evaporation ponds to produce salt for food and other purposes. Today, regulations limit the destruction of tidal marshes, and large portions are currently being rehabilitated to its natural state.|$|E
5|$|When the Phase II {{series was}} in development, {{original}} series designer Matt Jefferies updated the Enterprise design to feature a larger saucer with twin elevators (turbolifts) to the bridge, a wider secondary hull, docking ports, a dedicated photon torpedo weapon assembly {{at the base}} of the ship's neck, and angled struts supporting the nacelles. The nacelles themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes and designed to feature glowing grilles on the sides. Likewise, an orbiting drydock, space office complex, and V'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor. At the time Phase II was cancelled a roughly five foot long model of the Enterprise was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures, and models of the drydock and V'ger were under construction as well. All of these models were abandoned, unfinished (although a Brick Price Enterprise was <b>repurposed</b> as the exploded Enterprise wreck in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock).|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. It was first presented at the 20 th Annual MIT International Conference on Information Quality. <b>Repurposing</b> data is when data is used for a completely different decision/task {{to what it was}} originally intended to be used for. This is often the case in data analytics when data, which has been captured by the business as part of its normal operations, is used by data scientists to derive business insight. However, when data is collected for its primary purpose some consideration is given to ensure that the level of data quality is “fit for purpose”. Data <b>repurposing,</b> by definition, is using data for a different purpose, and therefore the original quality levels may not be suitable for the secondary purpose. Using interviews with various manufacturers, this paper describes examples of <b>repurposing</b> in manufacturing, how manufacturing organisations <b>repurpose</b> data, data quality problems that arise specifically from this, and how the problems are currently addressed. From these results we present a framework which manufacturers can use to help identify and mitigate the issues caused when attempting to <b>repurpose</b> data...|$|R
