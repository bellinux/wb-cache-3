5|$|Cotto {{started out}} {{his career as}} a hard-hitting {{pressure}} fighter, but evolved over the years into a more refined boxer-puncher. In 2010 he moved up another division to light middleweight and won the WBA title from Yuri Foreman. Having been promoted by the WBA to Super champion status, Cotto won a 2011 rematch against Antonio Margarito. In 2012 he lost the WBA (Super) title to Floyd Mayweather Jr., {{in one of the most}} anticipated fights in modern boxing history. The year would end on a further sour note for Cotto, as he suffered an upset defeat to WBA (<b>Regular)</b> <b>light</b> middleweight champion Austin Trout. Two years later, Cotto defeated Sergio Martínez to win the unified WBC, Ring, and lineal middleweight titles. In doing so, he became the first four-weight world champion from Puerto Rico. In 2015, he defended his titles once before losing to Canelo Álvarez.|$|E
50|$|Pet {{owners and}} keepers now usually {{recommended}} a non-direct contact UTH (under-the-tank-heater) or thermal tape which distributes heat through the enclosure’s substrate placed {{in different areas}} of the tank to create a more even heat gradient, making the pet more liable to move throughout its enclosure. Another popular solution is replacing <b>regular</b> <b>lighting</b> with UV-specific basking lights.|$|R

5|$|Other {{remains of}} similar animals were found {{throughout}} the late 19th century and 20th century. Another well-preserved skeleton from the slightly older Horseshoe Canyon Formation, in Alberta, Canada, was named T. warreni by William Parks in 1926. This skeleton had notable differences from T. neglectus, and so Charles M. Sternberg placed it in a new genus, Parksosaurus, in 1937. Sternberg also named an additional species, T. edmontonensis, based on another articulated skeleton, this time including a partial skull (NMC8537), and {{drew attention to the}} genus' heavy build and thick bones. Due to these differences from the <b>regular</b> <b>light</b> hypsilophodont build, he suggested that the genus warranted its own subfamily, Thescelosaurinae. T. edmontonensis has, since Peter Galton's 1974 review, generally been considered a more robust individual (possibly the opposite sex of the type individual) of T. neglectus. However, Boyd and colleagues found that they could not assign it to either of their valid species of Thescelosaurus and regarded the specimen as of uncertain placement within the genus. The other point of contention regarding T. edmontonensis is its ankle, which Galton claimed was damaged and misinterpreted, but which was regarded by William J. Morris (1976) as truly different from T. neglectus.|$|E

25|$|By using {{a minimalist}} design that used <b>regular</b> (<b>light)</b> water for cooling and {{graphite}} for moderation, {{it was possible}} to use natural uranium for fuel (instead of the considerably more expensive enriched uranium). This allowed for an extraordinarily large and powerful reactor that was also cheap enough to be built in large numbers and simple enough to be maintained and operated by local personnel. For example, the RBMK reactors at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania were rated at 1500MWe each, a very large size for the time and even for today.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to studies of Western cultures, research {{in other cultures}} has yielded some opposite findings.

The harm was observed in alcohol users classified as occasional as well as <b>regular</b> <b>light,</b> moderate, and heavy consumers.|$|E

50|$|Internal Waterways: The {{three main}} port areas are fairly poorly {{connected}} by road, requiring rather long detours to transport any cargo or equipment between them. While several {{bridges and tunnels}} directly linking Dongjiang with Beijiang and Nanjiang areas are projected for future development, these are still in early planning stages. To help relieve this internal bottleneck, in April 2010 the Port introduced a lighter route connecting Nanjiang (N-10 berth) and Beijiang (Tianjin Container Terminal), using one heavy barge (7800 DWT, 200 TEU). Another <b>regular</b> <b>lighter</b> route connecting Beijiang with Dongjiang was established on September 2010.|$|R

25|$|The 9th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (9 RAR) was a <b>Regular</b> <b>light</b> {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army. The battalion {{was raised in}} November 1967 and deployed to South Vietnam as part of Australia’s commitment to the Vietnam War in November 1968. 9 RAR served a year-long tour of duty based out of Nui Dat conducting operations mainly in Phuoc Tuy Province {{as part of the}} 1st Australian Task Force. The Battalion returned to Australia in November 1969 and was reformed at Enoggera, Queensland in January 1970 as part of the 6th Task Force, attached to the 1st Division. On 31 November 1973, following the withdrawal of Australian forces from South Vietnam and subsequent reduction of the Australian Army, the battalion was linked with the 8th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (8 RAR) to form the 8th/9th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (8/9 RAR).|$|E
500|$|When {{becoming}} a light infantry regiment in 1803, the uniform accordingly changed. Light infantry dress has {{its origins in}} the American War of Independence, when uniforms were altered to allow ease in the field. [...] "Wings", similar to those worn by grenadiers, {{were added to the}} shoulders and lacing was dispensed with, to make the quick removal of coats possible. At that time, the irregular light infantry also sought less conspicuous dress than the traditional red coat. However, conservatism returned with the new <b>regular</b> <b>light</b> infantry; while the 95th Rifles were permitted to retain the green clothing used by the German regiments, the seconded line regiments were required to retain the red coat, which remained an impediment to their skirmishing duties.|$|E
500|$|Light {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths {{of light to}} an area of skin affected by acne. Both regular and laser light have been used. [...] When <b>regular</b> <b>light</b> is used immediately following {{the application of a}} sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate, the treatment is referred to as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapies. Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light) have been used to treat acne, including those that use infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO2 and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment {{is often referred to as}} laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized. Ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with nonablative lasers, with examples being postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, persistent facial redness, and persistent pain. Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum. [...] As of 2012, evidence for various light therapies was insufficient to recommend them for routine use. Disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost, the need for multiple visits, time required to complete the procedure(s), and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities. [...] Various light therapies appear to provide a short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and for outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse; it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications. Typical side effects include skin peeling, temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E

6000|$|But {{what does}} he say to the Directors? He says, [...] "Upon the whole of these transactions, which to you, who are {{accustomed}} to view business in an official and <b>regular</b> <b>light,</b> may appear unprecedented, if not improper, I have but a few short remarks to suggest to your consideration." [...] He looks upon them and treats them {{as a set of}} low mechanical men, a set of low-born book-keepers, as base souls, who in an account call for explanation and precision. If there is no precision in accounts, there is nothing of worth in them. You see he himself is an eccentric accountant, a Pindaric book-keeper, an arithmetician in the clouds. [...] "I know," [...] he says, [...] "what the Directors desire: but they are mean people; they are not of elevated sentiments; they are modest; they avoid ostentation in taking of bribes: I therefore am playing cups and balls with them, letting them see a little glimpse of the bribes, then carrying them fairly away."
