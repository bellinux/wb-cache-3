A simple methodology for the systematic design of the Ravigneaux-type epicyclic gear transmissions needs to be developed. First, fundamentals and gear-shifting of four-speed and six-speed epicyclic-type automatic transmissions are illustrated to establish the design requirements. Second, based on the kinematic nomographs of the corresponding basic gear ratios, a simple clutching-sequence method is proposed and illustrated. Next, a planar-graph representation is presented to arrange the desired clutches for each possible clutching sequence into the epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Then, with the above methods, the systematic designs of the epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are given for demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methodology. The result of this work shows that the seven-, eight-, and nine-link two-DOF Ravigneaux-type epicyclic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms</b> could reach four-, six-, and eight-forward speeds at most, respectively.

This work in part will attempt to attain the maximum possible velocity ratios for any given epicyclic gear train. A methodology {{for the design of}} two-ring Ravigneaux-type epicyclic gear transmissions for automobiles is presented. First, based on the kinematic nomographs of the corresponding basic gear ratios, clutching-sequences are enumerated.

Next, following the general trend of increased shift stages and a wider range of velocity ratios, new six-, seven- and eight-velocity automatic transmissions are enumerated from the two-ring nine-link Ravigneaux <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The result of this work shows that the nine-link two-DOF Ravigneaux-type epicylic <b>gear</b> <b>mechanisms</b> could reach eight-forward speeds at most.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{technology}} for electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid vehicles (HEV) {{has been focused}} on by the automotive industry to address environmental problems including CO 2 reduction [1]. In particular, in HEV, planetary gears are used to control differential rotation of the motor, engine and generator. For these vehicles, the noise level inside the vehicle is low because the motor is used as the main power source. As a result, further decrease of gear noise is desired compared with the conventional planetary <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism.</b> However, research into the gear noise of the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism</b> is extremely scarce. Therefore, in this study, we focus on the three axes of I/O rotation, and a new method of measuring the meshing force of the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In this report, a gear-driving device, which is able to make 3 -axis differential rotation, was designed for experimentation...|$|R
