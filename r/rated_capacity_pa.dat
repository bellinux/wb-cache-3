40|$|Molecular {{communication}} {{emerges as}} a promising communication paradigm for nanotechnology. However, solid mathematical foundations for information-theoretic analysis of molecular communication {{have not yet been}} built. In particular, no one has ever proven that the channel coding theorem applies for molecular communication, and no relationship between information <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> (maximum mutual information) and code <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> (supremum achievable code rate) has been established. In this paper, we focus on a major subclass of molecular communication - the diffusion-based molecular communication. We provide solid mathematical foundations for information theory in diffusion-based molecular communication by creating a general diffusion-based molecular channel model in measure-theoretic form and prove its channel coding theorems. Various equivalence relationships between statistical and operational definitions of channel capacity are also established, including the most classic information <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> and code <b>rate</b> <b>capacity.</b> As byproducts, we have shown that the diffusion-based molecular channel is with "asymptotically decreasing input memory and anticipation" and "d-continuous". Other properties of diffusion-based molecular channel such as stationarity or ergodicity are also proven...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of generalized channel inversion (GCI) technique for a multiuser MIMO system operating under antenna mutual coupling conditions is investigated. The investigation is performed via theoretical derivations and computer simulations. The theoretical derivations show {{that the presence of}} mutual coupling may result in an increased performance in terms of sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity.</b> The simulation experiments confirm the theoretical findings in examples of three groups of numerical results. These results show that the existence of mutual coupling in an array antenna at base station (BS) results in an increased sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> when antenna interelement spacing at BS is smaller than 0. 55 [*]λ. Also it is shown that the presence of mutual coupling at mobile user (MS) terminals results in an increased sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> when antenna inter-element spacing at MSs is smaller than 0. 4 [*]λ. When mutual coupling is considered at both BS and MSs, the system configuration with antenna inter-element spacing equal to 0. 45 [*]λ at BS and 0. 4 [*]λ at MSs leads to the highest sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The C-rate is {{a measure}} of the rate at which a battery is being {{discharge}}d. It is defined as the discharge current divided by the theoretical current draw under which the battery would deliver its nominal <b>rated</b> <b>capacity</b> in one hour. A 1C discharge rate would deliver the battery's <b>rated</b> <b>capacity</b> in 1 hour. [...] A 2C discharge rate means it will discharge twice as fast (30 minutes). A 1C discharge rate on a 1.6 Ah battery means a discharge current of 1.6 A. A 2C rate would mean a discharge current of 3.2 A. Standards for rechargeable batteries generally <b>rate</b> the <b>capacity</b> over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate <b>rated</b> <b>capacity</b> in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer uninterruptible power supply, may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In a {{broadcast}} channel with random packet arrival and transmission queues, {{the stability of}} the system is achieved by maximizing a weighted sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> with suitable weights that depend on the queue size. The weighted sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> using Dirty Paper Coding (DPC) and Zero Forcing (ZF) is asymptotically equivalent to the weighted sum capacity over parallel single-channels. In this paper, we study the Diversity Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) of the fading broadcast channel under a fixed weighted sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> constraint. The DMT of both identical and different parallel weighted MISO channels is first derived. Finally, we deduce the DMT of {{a broadcast}} channel using DPC and ZF precoders. I.
