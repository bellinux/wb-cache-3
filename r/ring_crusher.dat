The reaction was mediated {{in the presence}} of laccase by one of the following polyphenols {{in the presence of}} air: gallic acid (GA), vanillic acid (VA) and catechol (1, 2 –DHB). Enzyme was added at constant loading (24 kg ton− 1), 1 % pulp consistency, 0. 005 % CMC, pH = 6. 3 ± 0. 5 and 2 mM of mediator. CPX content was assessed at two levels (0 % and 0. 005 %). Treated pulps were analyzed by different mechanical tests (<b>ring</b> <b>crush,</b> mullen, corrugating medium test (CMT) flat crush of corrugating medium test and tension). An improvement in these parameters was obtained by biopolymer coupling and selected mediator. When using GA, three parameters increased more than 40 %, while <b>ring</b> <b>crush</b> increased 120 %. For the case of VA, properties were enhanced from 74 % to 88 % when CPX was added. For 1, 2 –DHB, there was not found a statistically significant difference between the results in the presence of CPX. Scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, FTIR and 13 C NMR were used in all papers in order to evaluate grafting.

5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match.

He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the <b>ring,</b> <b>Crush</b> tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|R

The Cowper-Symonds relation was used to predict the dynamic yield stress of the rings and this was included in the FE material model.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the property recovery capability of handsheets formed from secondary fibers by combining different techniques. To attain that, pulps derived from post-consumer cardboard scrap {{were subjected to}} various refining intensities respectively in a PFI mill (0, 400, 800 and 1200 revolutions) and ultrasound (0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes), followed by enzymatic treatments with enzymes Cellulase, Hemicellulase, Mixture 1 and Mixture 2 (both mixtures composed of cellulase and hemicellulase). The papermaking potential of the pulps was evaluated by means of physical and mechanical tests on the resulting paper after the relevant treatments. It was found that both the combination of PFI mill refining with enzymatic treatments and the combination of ultrasound with enzymatic treatments were effective in improving paper properties. It was also found that interfiber bonding properties such as tensile index and <b>ring</b> <b>crush</b> strength had greater increases, {{in relation to the}} initial pulp, in pulps derived from the combined PFI mill refining with enzymatic treatments.

40|$|The {{compression}} strength and creep responses of corrugated fibreboard boxes after exposure to high and cyclic relative humidity conditions were studied and compared between boxes made from virgin and recycled liners and mediums {{which had the}} same <b>ring</b> <b>crush</b> values. The effect of moisture absorption rate by materials on the creep rate was investigated also. The results revealed that exposure to the high and cyclic relative humidity conditions {{used in this study}} caused significant reduction in {{compression strength}} for both box types. The cyclic condition was more detrimental. Recycled boxes experienced greater losses in compression strength than virgin boxes. Significant differences in final compression strength also existed between virgin and recycled boxes for three different humidities. The final compression strength was not only related to moisture content, but also related to the moisture content history of the boxes. It was found that there were significant differences in creep rate and survival time between virgin and recycled boxes. The cyclic conditions did not cause either a higher creep rate nor an earlier failure for either box type within the testing range...|$|R

The rheological measurement indicated that PSBM emulsions exhibited shear-thinning behavior, and the phenomena became more pronounced with increasing silica sol concentration. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) demonstrated that the stronger interfacial interaction between silica sol and polymer matrix, but microphase separation took place with excess silica sol. Thereby the tensile strength and thermal stability of emulsion films were increased with desirable silica sol concentration, and when silica sol concentration was greater than 6 wt%, the tensile strength leveled off and the decomposition temperature decreased from 351. 19 ℃ to 331. 63 ℃. The degree of crystallinity increased from 5. 12 % to 10. 98 % with 4 % silica sol addition, resulting in enhanced rigidity of films. Furthermore, the interaction between polymer and fiber was improved with certain amount of silica sol, resulting in improved sizing degree, <b>ring</b> <b>crush</b> strength, surface strength and folding strength.

A preliminary economic analysis was performed in which an impulse dryer would increase press dryness by 4 points and would allow the basis weight to be reduced by 10 %. The economic model showed that the 4 points in dryness would translate to a 17 % tonnage increase. Applying the 10 % basis weight reduction resulted in an increase in productivity, on an area basis, of 30 %. The pulp cost savings was found to outweigh any additional electric power costs...|$|R

Fiber length, diameter, lumen and cell wall thickness of rapeseed residue fibers were examined as 0. 96 ± 0. 18 mm, 24. 21 ± 6. 07 µ, 15. 47 ± 5. 23 µ and 4. 37 ± 1. 97 µ. Three pulping durations of 20, 30 and 40 min and 3 chemical charges of 10 %, 15 % and 20 % chemical charge was used for NSSC paper industry. Cooking temperature at 170 °C, Na 2 SO 3 to Na 2 CO 3 ratio of 2. 91 : 1 and liquor to residue ratio of 10 : 1 were kept constant. The highest yield (82 %) was obtained applying the treatment combination of 40 min pulping time and 10 % chemical charge and the lowest yield (63. 67 %) was observed with 30 min pulping time and 15 %- 2 chemical. After the Pulping, The pulp prepared to be refined up to 400 ± 50 ml CSF and 127 gm hand sheets were prepared.

This study has found that Nopcobond 1213 significantly increases strength for handsheets made from both type of pulp and 5 mg/g is the optimum addition rate. In addition, light basis weight, about 0. 2 - 0. 35 kg/m 3 paper products are able to made from the TMP reject stream with desirable tensile strength (dry tensile index about 10 - 25 Nm/g, wet tensile index about 1 - 7 Nm/g). Handsheet were made and tested for physical properties and opacity properties including bulk, tensile strength, bending stiffness, fibre strength and formation, <b>ring</b> <b>crush</b> compressive strength, light scattering coefficient and opacity. Due to the long fibre and small amount of fines loss in the shive-free pulp, test samples showed relatively lower tensile strength compared to the whole pulp. Moreover, the shive-free handsheets did not completely dry in the drying process (due to wrinkles formation of high temperature), freely dried shive-free handsheets had worse formation than handsheets made from the whole pulp (as they are totally dried in drying section), therefore polymer in the shive-free handsheets reduced its performance in imparting paper strength. The whole pulp handsheets with better formation and more long fibres in the pulp showed good strength but relatively lower light scattering coefficient and opacity. The coarse and large fibres made handsheets from the whole pulp less sensitive to the different levels of pressing...|$|R
