5|$|On 5 February 2015, Network Rail's tracklaying machine <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line at Tweedbank {{station where}} {{a large crowd}} had gathered. As {{there was not enough}} track for the train to {{complete}} tracklaying into the second platform, it had to return the next day. The formal completion took place on 12 February when Keith Brown clipped the final length of rail into place. During the period of construction, more than 1,000 rails were laid across 90,000 sleepers. With the infrastructure complete, attention was turned to the installation of signalling and communications equipment as well as finalising the stations. A GSM-R system controlled from the IECC next to Edinburgh Waverley was in place by April 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons. Stephen Meek served as the train's paid guide. Meek left the group at Fort Hall to lead {{some of the members}} on the Meek Cutoff. The remaining parts of the wagon train <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River, and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids, Palmer's party joined Sam Barlow's party in a quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood. Palmer climbed to the 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and the scant protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E

25|$|UFC 8 – Time limits {{changed to}} 10 {{minutes in the}} first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would {{continually}} change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner.

25|$|Cattle drives had {{to strike}} a balance between speed and the weight of the cattle. While cattle could be driven as far as 25 miles in a single day, they would lose so much weight that they would be hard to sell when they <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trail. Usually they were taken shorter {{distances}} each day, allowed periods to rest and graze both at midday and at night. On average, a herd could maintain a healthy weight moving about 15 miles per day. Such a pace meant that it would take as long as two months to travel from a home ranch to a railhead. The Chisholm trail, for example, was 1,000 miles long.|$|E
25|$|The oxide {{particles}} then agglomerate to form {{large particle}} chains, which subsequently deposit {{on the walls}} of the tube as soot. The deposition is due to the large difference in temperature between the gas core and the wall causing the gas to push the particles outwards (this is known as thermophoresis). The torch is then traversed up and down the length of the tube to deposit the material evenly. After the torch has <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube, it is then brought back to the beginning of the tube and the deposited particles are then melted to form a solid layer. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of material has been deposited. For each layer the composition can be modified by varying the gas composition, resulting in precise control of the finished fiber's optical properties.|$|E

However, {{by the time the}} Russians forced the Guard cavalry to retire, Charpentier's division reached the field and easily captured the Quatre Heures Woods. They were soon followed by Curial's division. By 2:30 pm, Charpentier's troops linked up with Nansouty's horsemen on the French left and together they began to force back the Russian right flank. Nansouty <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paissy valley before being turned back by cannon fire. By this time Ney had brought Meunier's division onto the ridge and the Guard artillery moved forward.

25|$|Sons and Daughters {{has also}} had three repeat runs on other TV {{channels}} in the UK. First, in 1987, it was shown twice daily at 8am and 12.30pm on Superchannel; the channel could also be seen across Europe, but the re-runs ended in 1989 before the serial had concluded. The whole series was aired on UK Gold from 1 November 1992 to 23 July 1996 at 8am and repeated at 12 noon. Finally, Channel 5 also aired the entire series. Episodes 1 - 212 were shown on Channel 5 at 1.30pm Monday to Friday between 2 March and 24 December 1998, after which time it was dropped for a while. It did however return to Channel 5 in January 2002 (from episode 213) in a late night slot at around 4am every Friday and Saturday night where two episodes were shown back to back until they <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series on 6 November 2005. The series gained {{a new level of}} UK fans in this early morning slot as the Aussie cult classic Prisoner Cell Block H had previously aired in the same time slot and when that ended, Sons and Daughters eventually replaced it a few months later.|$|E
25|$|An {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt on}} the life of the king was made on 15 November 1620. It occurred on Sunday, at 9 am, when the monarch was to attend Mass in St. John's Archcathedral in Warsaw. Sigismund was to arrive by walking on a wooden bridge-looking construction that connected the Royal Castle with the temple. When the royal procession already <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge, hidden in a nearby window was nobleman Michał Piekarski. The assassin previously killed a Hungarian mercenary that was protecting the post. When the monarch reached the final steps, Piekarski instantly jumped out and threw himself on the king, stabbing him twice, firstly in the back and then in the cheek, and striking him in the arm. However, the assassin was not able to cause any deadly harm because of the royal guards that were initially standing {{to the right of the}} king as Piekarski attacked from the left. Shortly after the attack, Sigismund fell flat on the ground, pale and lifeless, and from the church Priest Kobierzycki started to groan and shout – he had seen the attack from the temple's stained glass window or from the belfry. A group of local civilians and citizens surrounded the procession, the king quickly fainted, and his clothes were stained in blood. The guards were able to revive the monarch, and after medical examinations the wounds proved to be harmless. A few minutes later, panic erupted in the crowd and the air filled with the atmosphere of terror. Most of the people gathered in the church, who had arrived before the royal procession, believed that the king was already dead. Initially it was thought that the capital was invaded by the Muslim Tatars or, at least, by their spies.|$|E

500|$|A {{month after}} release, the {{developers}} worked {{to make the}} game less difficult, in response to criticism from reviewers. In a postmortem released alongside a set of updates, TumbleSeed designer Greg Wohlwend credited the game's slow sales to the title's tepid critical reception and stigma of high difficulty. Critics, he wrote, considered the game unfair and unforgivingly hard, as reflected in lukewarm scores from major gaming websites. Players were expected to withstand an overwhelming amount of simultaneous elements and as such, few <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. The [...] "4 Peaks Update" [...] added four new areas and abilities to simplify the game, such as reducing incoming damage or increasing stealth near enemies. The game was unlikely to recoup its costs, Wohlwend wrote, and the update was doubtful to change that course, but he felt proud of their development effort and considered the update to be therapy. The June 2017 update was released for Windows and was anticipated for consoles soon after.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} music video, {{directed by}} Alek Keshishian, was filmed in June 1992 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and Malibu Beach. It premiered on MTV on June 30, 1992, {{a day before}} the release of A League of Their Own. The video shows a man viewing a photo album, as Madonna sings in different settings from within the various pictures. Scenes from A League of Their Own also appear on the album during the song's instrumental break. As the video ends, the man having <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album, then scrolls backwards through the previous pages. The video was commercially released in 2004 as a bonus feature on the 2-disc special edition DVD of A League of Their Own. According to Rettenmund, unlike most music videos related to film soundtracks, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] did not give emphasis on having shots from the film in the video itself. Instead Keshishian and Madonna chose introspection as the theme, with simple images to portray them. Rettenmund notes, [...] "At the end, {{the man who has}} been looking back at his scrapbook of Madonna lays his head down, sealing the video with the perfect bit of sadness to resonate with Madonna's ennui." ...|$|E
