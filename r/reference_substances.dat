25|$|Referencing the {{inherent}} qualities {{of a system}} {{in place of a}} reference state environment is the most direct way that ecologists determine the exergy of a natural resource. Specifically, it is easiest to examine the thermodynamic properties of a system, and the <b>reference</b> <b>substances</b> that are acceptable within the reference environment. This determination allows for the assumption of qualities in a natural state: deviation from these levels may indicate a change in the environment caused by outside sources. There are three kinds of <b>reference</b> <b>substances</b> that are acceptable, due to their proliferation on the planet: gases within the atmosphere, solids within the Earth’s crust, and molecules or ions in seawater. By understanding these basic models, it’s possible to determine the exergy of multiple earth systems interacting, like the effects of solar radiation on plant life. These basic categories are utilized as the main components of a reference environment when examining how exergy can be defined through natural resources.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} taken into {{consideration}} that the actual operating conditions and the wastewater itself at the waste water plant, from which the digester sludge has been taken, does influence the sludge activity and the actual adaptation capability of the sludge.

50|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{coupled to}} mass spectrometry (MS) {{is one of}} the most widespread routine technologies applied to the large scale screening and discovery of novel biomarkers in metabolomics. However, the majority of MSTs currently measured in plant metabolomic profiling experiments remains unidentified due to the lack of authenticated pure <b>reference</b> <b>substances</b> and the expensive and time-consuming effort to maintain mass spectral RI libraries required for compound identification by GC-MS.As the communication of analytical results and other approach-related details such as mass spectral and RI reference information within the scientific community is becoming increasingly popular, open access platforms for information exchange, such as the GMD, are obligatory.Due to the lack of mandatory standards it remains difficult to compare individual mass spectrums. While the different mass detector technologies, namely quadrupole, ion trap and time of flight, can be deemed irrelevant, the chromatography settings such as temperature programming, type of capillary column and choice of column manufacturer heavily affect the empirically determined RI properties. Procedures for the transfer of RI properties between chromatography variants are, therefore, highly relevant for a shared library use. The GMD assesses the accuracy of RI transfer between chromatography variants and implements means to transfer empirically determined RI properties.Aiming at the classification and identification of un-identified MSTs, the GMD accesses the information on available reference compounds. These compounds serve as training set of data to apply decision trees (DT) as a supervised machine learning approach. Structural feature extraction was applied to classify the metabolite space of the GMD prior to DT training. DT-based predictions of the most frequent substructures classify low resolution GC-MS mass spectra of the linked (potentially unknown) metabolite with respect to the presence or absence of the chemical moieties.The web-based frontend supports conventional mass spectral and RI comparison by ranked hit lists as well as advanced DT supported substructure prediction. Batch processing is enabled via Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based web services while web-based data access services expose particular data base entities adapting Representational State Transfer (ReST) principles and mass spectral standards such as NIST-MSP and JCAMP-DX.The GMD visualise quantitative metabolite pool size changes data.|$|E

50|$|Specific {{gravity is}} {{the ratio of}} the density of a {{substance}} to the density of a reference substance; equivalently, it is {{the ratio of the}} mass of a substance to the mass of a <b>reference</b> <b>substance</b> for the same given volume. Apparent specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the <b>reference</b> <b>substance.</b> The <b>reference</b> <b>substance</b> is nearly always water at its densest (4°C) for liquids; for gases it is air at room temperature (21°C). Nonetheless, the temperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 atm (101.325 kPa). Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British beer brewing, the practice for specific gravity as specified above is to multiply it by 1000. Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as brines, hydrocarbons, sugar solutions (syrups, juices, honeys, brewers wort, must etc.) and acids.|$|R

ICCVAM recently recommended performance standards for the BG 1 Luc estrogen receptor (ER) transactivation (TA) test method. The performance standards were based on results from an international interlaboratory validation study, and include essential test method components, <b>reference</b> <b>substances,</b> and standards for accuracy and reliability. Essential components include: a cell line that endogenously expresses human ERs and is stably transfected with a reporter gene, use of a solvent miscible with cell culture media, a defined concentration limit for agonist (1 mM) or antagonist (10 µM) testing, evaluation of cytotoxicity, a reference estrogen, anti-estrogen, and positive and solvent controls.

The <b>reference</b> <b>substance</b> 3, 5 -DCP caused substantial inhibition of the respiration rate with a mean 3 -h EC 50 value estimated to be 2.6  mg/L. The percent inhibition for 3, 5 -DCP at 3.2, 10, 32 and 100  mg/L were 53.9, 76.1, 90.2 and 93.3, respectively. This was within the expected range of 2 – 25  mg/L, which indicated the sludge was responding accordingly and confirmed {{the viability of the}} sludge microflora [12]. The respiration rates in all the control flasks were within 15  % of each other.
