However, this has not come to fruition. A recent Employment Land Survey has revealed that there is no immediate need for further industrial land in this location. As there are no deliverable proposals identified, and to accommodate the wishes of Friends of Black Patch Park to retain the Park area, these allocations have been removed. The land will therefore form a green focal point for any development which takes place on the adjoining sites. The Preferred Option for land adjacent to Soho Foundry has been allocated for Mixed Used which can incorporate industrial and offices, and possibly leisure, community and educational facilities associated to the Foundry once a suitable re-use has been identified.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of the infinitesimal {{deformations}} of all real, simple, finite-dimensional Filippov (or n-Lie) algebras, considered as a class of n-Leibniz algebras characterized by having an n-bracket skewsymmetric in its n- 1 first arguments. We prove that all n> 3 simple finite-dimensional Filippov algebras are rigid as n-Leibniz algebras of this class. This rigidity also holds for the Leibniz deformations of the semisimple n= 2 Filippov (i. e., Lie) algebras. The n= 3 simple FAs, however, admit a non-trivial one-parameter infinitesimal 3 -Leibniz algebra deformation. We also show that the n≥ 3 simple Filippov algebras do not admit non-trivial central extensions as n-Leibniz algebras of the above class. Comment: 19 pages, 30 <b>refs.,</b> <b>no</b> figures.

Itersonilia perplexans is reported to cause disease in several plants in the families Apiaceae, Compositae and others (Channon 1963). Symptoms may include leaf blight, petal blight and root canker. In Australia, I. perplexans is commonly recorded on parsnip (herbarium <b>ref.</b> <b>no’s.</b> : DPI NSW Plant Pathology Herbarium (DAR) 6523; DPI Victoria Plant Pathology Herbarium (VPRI) 32440; and 40636), and has also been recorded on gerbera (VPRI 17542), endive (VPRI 17984), cineraria (VPRI 18267), coriander (VPRI 18403), umbrella tree (DAR 5016) and rananculus (DAR 24806 and 43046).

40|$|A {{method to}} form and {{manipulate}} the properties of nanometer-size liquid bridges by an external electric field is discussed. The properties of bridges are shown {{to be the result}} of an interplay among the field-induced polarization of the water layer adsorbed on the surface, the surface energy, and the water condensation from the humid air. For a given tip-sample separation, a simple model predicts the existence of a threshold voltage Vth to form the bridge in full agreement with experiments. We would like to thank J. Colchero, L.

40|$|Vortex {{nucleation}} in a Bose-Einstein condensate {{subject to}} a stirring potential is studied numerically using the zero-temperature, two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. It is found that this theory is able to describe the creation of vortices, but not the crystallization of a vortex lattice. In {{the case of a}} rotating, slightly anisotropic harmonic potential, the numerical results reproduce experimental findings, thereby showing that finite temperatures are not necessary for vortex excitation below the quadrupole frequency. In the case of a condensate subject to stirring by a narrow rotating potential, the process of vortex excitation is described by a classical model that treats the multitude of vortices created by the stirrer as a continuously distributed vorticity {{at the center of the}} cloud, but retains a potential flow pattern at large distances from the center.
