40|$|Despite a {{large and}} rapidly growing Hispanic {{population}} in the United States, few researchers have attempted to examine what happens to Hispanic offend-ers once they have been released from criminal justice control. The present study helps fill this gap by examining differences in the likelihood of recidi-vism between White, Black, and Hispanic prison <b>releasees</b> using three differ-ent recidivism measures: rearrest, reconviction, and reincarceration. The authors use Bureau of Justice Statistics data that track a cohort of offenders for 3 years after their release in 1994 from state and federal prisons. Overall, the study findings show that White <b>releasees</b> have the lowest levels of recidivism and Black <b>releasees</b> have {{the highest levels of}} recidivism, net of important legal factors associated with recidivism risk; Hispanic recidivism levels are between those of White and Black <b>releasees.</b> any conclusions drawn about the relative recidivism risk of Hispanic <b>releasees</b> vis-à-vis Black and White <b>releasees</b> must, however, consider how recidivism is measured. The study finds that Hispanic rearrest and reconviction levels more closely mirror those of Whites, but Hispanic reincarceration levels are more similar to those of Blacks. The authors discuss these findings in light of {{a growing body of research}} suggesting that Hispanic defendants may face more punitive outcomes relative to similarly situated White (and even Black) defendants at various stages of the criminal case process because they are perceived as more blameworthy and a greater threat to public safety than other defendants...|$|R

By 1993, the rate had dropped to 42 percent, with about 69 percent of those revoked for technical reasons.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the furlough program as a correctional device, an analysis of rates of recidivism for individuals released from Massachusetts ’ state cor-rectional institutions in the years 1973 and 1974 was conducted. The following research question was addressed: are inmates who experience one or more furloughs during the term of their incarceration less likely to be reincarcerated within one year of their eventual release from prison than are similar types of inmates who do not participate in the fur-lough program during the period of their incarceration? Selection factors were controlled via the use of Base Expectancy Tables. Analysis of the data indicated that the participa-tion in the Home Furlough Program led to a significant reduction in recidivism rates. The data were interpreted as providing preliminary evidence that the use of furlough programs during the period of incarceration provides a positive reintegrative function. It was concluded that programmatic contributions to the process of societal reintegration can be effective devices for reducing the repeated criminal behavior of the prison <b>releasee.</b> uring recent years an increasing number of county, state, and federal correctional institutions have begun the exten...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} prison peer effects {{in an adult}} prison population in the United States using a unique dataset assembled from the administrative databases of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. The members of a first-time prison release cohort were identified and matched {{to each of the}} cellmates with whom they shared a double cell. These data were then linked to arrest history data from the Pennsylvania State Police. Criminological theories of social influence expect unobserved and difficult to quantify factors, such as criminality, to affect criminal behavior both independently and through intermediate decisions, including the choice to maintain prison peer associations. Those theories, therefore, implicitly assume the presence of essential heterogeneity, which helps to account for the response heterogeneity observed in studies of social influence. This study introduces the concept of essential heterogeneity to criminology and is the first to apply a method to address it, local instrumental variables, to estimate causal social interaction effects. The analyses presented in this study demonstrate that there is considerable response heterogeneity in prison peer effects. That response heterogeneity is attributable to essential heterogeneity, as implicitly expected by criminological learning theories. However, the null average effects estimated do not accord with the predictions of criminological learning theories, including differential association, balance, and prisonization theories, each of which expects peers who are, on average, more criminally experienced to exert criminogenic effects. The presence of essential heterogeneity indicates that estimating average prison peer effects does little to adequately characterize the relationship between social interactions with cellmates and <b>releasee</b> reoffending behaviors. Within the null average prison peer effect estimates lies tremendous variation in marginal prison peer effects. Some marginal prison peer effects are significantly criminogenic, while others are significantly crimino-suppressive. That substantial variation in the measured effect of prison peers on reoffending persists despite rigorous analysis and the inclusion of robust theoretically relevant controls suggests that future work should focus on creating constructs more appropriate to the task of determining who is harmed and who is helped as a result of interactions with prison peers...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{behavioral}} health conditions, such as psychiatric {{and substance}} use disorders, affect {{at least half of}} all arrestees, with two-thirds suffering from at least one chronic medical disorder. These conditions contribute to their criminal behaviors and propensities to recycle through the criminal justice system (Binswanger et al. Journal of Urban Health 89 : 183 - 190, 2012). Despite their limited resources, jails have nonetheless become de facto settings for the delivery of healthcare services. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, jail <b>releasees</b> will become eligible for government-subsidized healthcare coverage in 2014. The widespread availability of integrated healthcare services for the released jail population is likely to reduce criminal behavior, which is often associated with psychiatric {{and substance use}} disorders and their co-occurrence. This article provides an overview of behavioral healthcare services available to jail <b>releasees.</b> We discuss the evolving landscape of substance use and mental health interventions under healthcare reform, including anticipated changes in funding infrastructures and streams for treatment services.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in prisoner reentry. This is due to a change in many of the factors surrounding the release of prisoners and their reentry to the community. These changes include a modification of sentencing from the use of parole to determinate release with fewer ex-offenders having supervision in the commu-nity, an increased emphasis on surveillance rather than assistance for those under super-vision, less community stability and availability of community social service support, and dramatically larger numbers returning to the community. More <b>releasees</b> are being violated and returned to the community than ever before. Therefore, it is important to identify prisoner reentry programs that work. We define reentry, categorize reentry pro-grams, and use the Maryland Scale of Scientific Method to determine the effectiveness of program categories.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{reports the}} first phase of a two-part {{exploratory}} study that sought to understand the challenges of navigating the health care system from the perspectives of post-incarcerated individuals. Phase 1 focus groups sought to understand the experience of <b>releasees</b> and their efforts to self-manage their health care. Three groups of adult men and women, 23 participants in total, with an incarceration history participated in Phase 1 focus groups. Barriers to access identified included: lack of computer access and/or computer literacy; poor health instruction and limited health system comprehension; lack of navigation skills; memory difficulties; homelessness and poverty; poor insurance and perceived bias of providers. Generally, the groups lacked the ability to problem-solve and blamed others for their difficulties while expressing an interest in providing self-care- they simply lacked the knowledge and skills to do so. Natural leaders emerged from the group, and were found to be informal helpers to those being released to the community. Keywords: healthcare; post-incarceration; barriers; qualitative...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{differences}} in self-reported experiences of fifteen boys and girls who were released from correctional schools from June 24, 1965, to May 16, 1967, into the community of Ketchikan, Alaska, from a control group of nineteen who had not been in correctional institutions, who were matched by sex, age and race. Between the dates of July 16, 1967, to September 13, 1967, I interviewed and administered a questionnaire to each respondent in both groups. The respondents, ranging in age from 14 years to 20 years, were seen in the welfare office, the person 2 ̆ 7 s home or foster home, the jail, other institutions and other settings. The items that I chose for the questionnaire were those from the Seattle Atlantic Street Center’s Student Opinion Survey with regard to the following six classifications: 1. Report of delinquent behavior. 2. Attitude toward community norms. 3. Delinquent friends. 4. Perception of community reaction to deviance. 5. Integration in neighborhood. 6. Activities and companions in activities. The significance of the difference of the responses of the two groups was determined by the chi - square test of significance at the 5 per cent level of confidence. Because of the smallness of the two groups and because of the lack of random sampling in the selection of the second group, the findings could not be considered conclusions applicable to a larger population. However, generalizations as speculations to suggest further research and principles for action were made. There were both similarities and differences in the two groups.
