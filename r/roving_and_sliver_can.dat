On the one hand, achieve the <b>sliver</b> color’s order <b>can</b> be matched at will, <b>and</b> every single <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> be changed about the color and length, and the length of changeover portion can be designed easily, so that the final product color can be achieved in a color from deep to shallow gradients, and also can be two colors that is one of them becomes shallow gradually while another color deepened gradually; on the other hand, achieve the ratio of the colored sliver is adjustable without basal sliver feeding. In the other words, on the premise of output sliver thickness to maintain constant, the cross-section’s color of the sliver is ensured to be any independent color of the four feeding <b>sliver</b> colors, you <b>can</b> also have two or more color combinations. Using this {{new technology}} to produce the gradient product has been very popular in foreign countries, but is still rare in the domestic market. So this new technology will have positive effect on textile field, it can provide more new opportunities to the textile enterprises...|$|R
40|$|Designing of lifting, {{pushing and}} pulling {{activities}} {{based on the}} physical and physiological capabilities of the operators is essential. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze manual material handling (MMH) working posture of the operators using 3 D Static Strength Prediction Program (3 DSSPP) software and to identify major areas causing long last injury of operators. The research has investigated the fit between the demands of tasks and the capabilities of operators. At the existing situations, the actual capabilities of operators have been computed with the help of 3 DSSPP software and compared with NIOSH standards. Accordingly, operators' working posture is at an unacceptable position that exposes them for musculoskeletal disorders. Then, after the improvement of the design of MMH device (cart's roller), the result showed that the forces required by the operators to push <b>and</b> pull the <b>sliver</b> <b>cans</b> have been reduced from 931. 77 Newton to 194. 23 Newton. Furthermore, improvement of MMH cart's roller has reduced the awkward posture of operators and the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The improved manual material handling design also saves about 1828. 40 ETB per month for the company...|$|R
50|$|In general, combing is done {{to filter}} or sieve out any short length fibers (for example, fibers shorter than 21 mm). Combing or carding is a primary process, {{followed}} by the gilling process, which removes hooks and involves three separate machines. Combing is then followed by two gillings to remove irregularity in the <b>sliver</b> <b>and</b> randomize fiber ends. This post-combing process is required if spinning is to follow. It is known that a <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> be spun to a yarn of only 21 fibers with a suitable average length of 150 mm.|$|R
40|$|Sliver {{cells are}} thin, {{single-crystal}} silicon solar cells fabricated using standard fabrication technology. Sliver modules, composed {{of several thousand}} individual <b>Sliver</b> cells, <b>can</b> be efficient, low-cost, bifacial, transparent, flexible, shadow tolerant, and lightweight. Compared with current PV technology, mature Sliver technology will need 10 % of the pure silicon and fewer than 5 % of the wafer starts per MW of factory output. This paper deals with two distinct challenges related to <b>Sliver</b> cell <b>and</b> <b>Sliver</b> module production: providing a mature <b>and</b> robust <b>Sliver</b> cell fabrication method which produces a high yield of highly efficient <b>Sliver</b> cells, <b>and</b> which is suitable for transfer to industry; and, handling, electrically interconnecting, and encapsulating billions of sliver cells at low cost. Sliver cells with efficiencies of 20 % have been fabricated at ANU using a reliable, optimised processing sequence, while low-cost encapsulation methods have been demonstrated using a submodule technique...|$|R
40|$|What are Bamboo Splits <b>and</b> <b>Slivers?</b> Bamboo splits <b>and</b> <b>slivers</b> are {{longitudinal}} sections of a bamboo pole (culm). Splits are the full {{thickness of the}} culm wall and have the green outer layer still attached. Slivers are thin, narrow sections of bamboo wood. They are the primary materials used for weaving {{a wide range of}} products. On a small scale they may be used for handicraft items and objects of daily use. On a large scale, one of the most useful products they can be woven into are the mats that are used to produce bamboo matboard. How are they produced? Splits <b>and</b> <b>slivers</b> may be produced by hand splitting or mechanical splitting. Hand splitting is suitable for small-scale production and there is a wide range of tools available, both traditional and modern. Automated splitting machines are more suitable for large-scale production of slivers. Fresh bamboo culms are passed through a series of machines that produce splits of successively smaller sizes until the desired size is reached. What is the market for bamboo splits <b>and</b> <b>slivers?</b> The market for bamboo splits is limited, because they are of limited use. However, bamboo slivers are the primary raw material for mat making and the demand for mats is closely related to the demand for matboard. Matboard is a versatile type of plywood and its markets are increasing rapidly. Often the splitting <b>and</b> <b>slivering</b> unit is established with very close linkages to the matboard factories and weaving facilities and weaving staff may be included in the unit. In some instances the splitting <b>and</b> <b>slivering</b> unit may be a subsidiary part of the matboard factory. What is the role of a bamboo splitting <b>and</b> <b>slivering</b> unit in rural development? The unit requires considerable supplies of raw bamboos, the management and harvesting of which increases employment opportunities for farmers and foresters. Establishing new plantations will benefit the environment and substituting bamboo for wood in products will help conserve natural forests. The unit offers employment opportunities for unskilled, semi-skilled and technically trained personnel for its operation and management. A large unit established with mat-weaving facilities included can provide employment for up to 400 people. How do I establish a bamboo splitting <b>and</b> <b>slivering</b> unit? A regular supply of raw bamboos, labour, electricity and an established market for the slivers, or the mats if mat weaving is included in the unit, is required. A large bamboo splitting <b>and</b> <b>slivering</b> unit with a production capacity of 1300 mats, 1. 2 x 2. 4 m per day, can be established for approximately US $ 300, 000. Smaller facilities can be established for considerably less, depending on their size and intended production rates. Bamboo splits <b>and</b> <b>slivers</b> are the primary materials used for weaving a wide range of product...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the experiments, the initial and final {{fracture}} behaviors in glass <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> glass cloth composites were investigated. After the production of two types of composite panels with the hand lay-up method, tensile and three-point bending tests on composites were conducted. Acoustic emission (AE) and optical microscopy (cross-sectional observation) analyses based on the various strain rates in bending tests were performed to see the fracture initiation and propagation in composites. The initial fractures were transverse cracks in the glass roving composites; these were delaminations in glass cloth composites. The final fractures were transverse cracks, delaminations, and fiber breakages in glass <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> glass cloth composites. In this study, the fracture process and mechanisms of glass <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> glass cloth composites were successfully identified by AE characteristics and cross-sectional observations...|$|R

50|$|In {{early days}} large {{machines}} were equipped with less distance between rotors (gauge of machine). This led to creeling of very small cans, which required frequent can changes. Each can change requires {{a break in}} the yarn. All major manufacturers currently allow cans up to 18” diameter leading to less breakage, less joining of yarn, hence better quality and higher productivity. Originally round cans were used. Rectangular cans are used because they double sliver capacity in the same <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> footprint.|$|R
