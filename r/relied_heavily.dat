5|$|Putnam {{has contributed}} to {{scientific}} fields {{not directly related to}} his work in philosophy. As a mathematician, Putnam contributed to the resolution of Hilbert's tenth problem in mathematics. This problem was settled by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970, with a proof that <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on previous research by Putnam, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota's early economy <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on the soil, {{minerals}} and {{ecology of the}} area, as {{nearly all of the}} earliest white settlers in the area were farmers, miners, or trappers. Although other economic sectors have risen in prominence in recent years, early dependence on the land laid the foundation for the future economic activity of the state.|$|E
5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan {{played a central role}} in the drafting of the Marshall Plan.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had named Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and he was being referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, and so the title was purely honorary. In selecting the officers and seamen, Hall <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on whalers with experience in the Arctic. This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E
5|$|Keating reaped {{benefits}} from the move to Arizona, a wide-open territory in both a physical and business sense that allowed someone a fresh start. He turned the now-renamed American Continental Corporation around, adding various operations and divisions in a structure somewhat reminiscent of American Financial. As chairman and controlling stockholder, Keating <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> upon family members, employing his son and four of his sons-in-law in prominent positions. Charles Keating III had a fast career rise within the company.|$|E
5|$|The match {{record for}} the British Isles is {{considered}} complete, however the match record of the Victorian Rules and Association football matches in the Australian leg of the tour {{is a matter of}} some debate. The list of Victorian Rules matches was compiled by historian Greg Ryan and <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on coverage of the matches in the Melbourne press. The frequency of matches suggests the list is complete.|$|E

5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E
5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on following the aircraft in front.|$|E
5|$|Arulpragasam's early {{compositions}} <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on the Roland MC-505 music sequencer {{and drum}} machine. Her later work marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics and unusual sound samples. Critics have acclaimed a distinctive style to her music. Lyrically incorporating {{a range of}} political, social, philosophical and cultural references that have defied existing pop music conventions, Arulpragasam {{was one of the}} first acts to come to public attention through the internet. She posted many of her songs and videos from 2002 onwards on platforms such as MySpace.|$|E

5|$|During his reign, Michael <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on {{the loyalty}} {{and support of}} a group of Oltenian lords, the most {{important}} of whom were Buzescu Brothers (Romanian: Fraţii Buzeşti) and his own relatives on his mother's side, the Cantacuzinos. He consequently protected their interests throughout his reign; for example, he passed a law binding serfs to lands owned by aristocrats. From the standpoint of religious jurisdiction, the Treaty of Alba Iulia had another important consequence: it placed all the Eastern Orthodox bishops in Transylvania {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Metropolitan Seat of Târgovişte.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{became a}} {{province}} of the Roman Empire in 30BC, following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. The Romans <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on grain shipments from Egypt, and the Roman army, {{under the control of}} a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period. Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he <b>relied</b> <b>heavily,</b> became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{vulnerability}} to blockade was studied. Using information {{supplied by the}} Board of Trade and the naval attaché in Tokyo, the planners estimated that the British Empire accounted for around 27 per cent of Japan's imports. In most cases these imports could be replaced from sources in China and the United States. However, certain critical materials for which Japan <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber, {{and many of the}} best sources of these were under British control. Japan's access to neutral shipping could be restricted by refusing insurance to ships trading with Japan, and chartering ships to reduce the number available.|$|E
5|$|League {{football}} {{was suspended for}} the rest of the war, with Leeds City playing in regional competitions. With many players away fighting or having left the game due to a drop in wages, Leeds <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on guest players during these matches. Chapman, meanwhile, had decided to help the war effort by taking up a position as manager of a munitions factory at Barnbow, near Cross Gates in 1916. For the next two years, City's assistant manager, George Cripps stood in for Chapman on the administrative side, while chairman Joe Connor and another director took charge of the team.|$|E
5|$|Living in Bendigo and {{studying}} at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel {{three times a}} year to train with Froelich, so she <b>relied</b> <b>heavily</b> on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door. When she was 12, she covered 110 yards in 1 minute (min) 7.1 seconds, setting an unofficial world record for her age group. This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, so she could train with Froelich on a regular basis. Leech moved there with her mother, while her father stayed in Bendigo to look after the family's jewellery business.|$|E
