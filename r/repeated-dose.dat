40|$|Background: The {{present study}} was aimed to explore the effects of {{ritonavir}} and primaquine combination given as a singledose or <b>repeated-dose</b> compared to ritonavir alone on ritonavir plasma concentration in the rats. Methods: In single-dose study, 30 male Spraque Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive ritonavir 20 mg/kg BW or ritonavir 20 mg/kg BW + primaquine 1. 2 mg/kg BW or ritonavir 20 mg/kg BW + ketokonazole 10 mg/kg BW. Ketokonazole was used as positive control of ritonavir metabolism inhibitor. In the <b>repeated-dose</b> study, thirty Spraque Dawley male rats were randomly allocated to receive ritonavir 20 mg/kg BW/day or ritonavir 20 mg/kg BW/day + primaquine 1. 2 mg/kg BW/day or ritonavir 20 mg/kg BW/day + rifampicin 100 mg/kg BW/day. Rifampicin {{was used as a}} positive control of ritonavir metabolism inducer. Results: In the single-dose study, ketokonazole increased the area under the plasma concentration (AUC) of ritonavir (↑ 114. 8 %, p 0. 05). <b>Repeated-dose</b> study showed that rifampicin decreases the AUC of ritonavir (↓ 42. 8 %, p Conclusion: Concomitant administration of primaquine and ritonavir decreases the AUC of ritonavir.

40|$|Short-chain mono-alkylphenols {{provide an}} example of where a category-approach to {{read-across}} {{may be used to}} estimate the <b>repeated-dose</b> endpoint for a number of derivatives. Specifically, the NOAELs of 50 mg/kg bw/d for mono-methylphenols based on a LOAEL of very low systemic toxicity can be read across with confidence to untested mono-alkylphenols in the category. These simple alkylphenols are non-reactive and exhibit an unspecific, reversible polar narcosis mode of toxic action. Briefly, polar narcotics act via unspecific, reversible interactions with biological membranes {{in a manner similar to}} cataleptic anaesthetics. The read-across premise includes rapid and complete absorption via the gastrointestinal tract, distribution in the circulatory system, first-pass Phase 2 metabolism in the liver, and elimination of sulphates and glucuronides in the urine. Thus, toxicokinetic parameters are considered to be similar and have the same toxicological significance. Five analogues have high quality experimental oral <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity data (i. e., OECD TG 408 or OECD TG 422). These <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity test results exhibit qualitative consistency in symptoms. Typical findings include decreased body weight and slightly increased liver and kidney weights which are generally without concurrent histopathological effects. The sub-chronic findings are quantitatively consistent with the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of ≥ 50 mg/kg bw/d. Chemical similarity between the analogues is readily defined, and data uncertainty associated with the similarities in toxicokinetic properties, as well as toxicodynamic properties, are low. Uncertainty associated with mechanistic relevance and completeness of the read-across is low-to-moderate, largely because there is no adverse outcome pathway or intermediate event data. Uncertainty associated with mechanistic relevance and completeness of the read-across is reduced by the concordance of in vivo, in vitro, USEPA toxicity forecaster (ToxCast) results, as well as the in silico data.

40|$|Chronic <b>repeated-dose</b> {{toxicity}} studies are still {{carried out on}} animals and often do not correlate with the effects in human beings mainly due to species-specific differences in biotransformation. The human hepatoma cell line HepaRG {{has been used for}} human relevant toxicity assessment. However, HepaRG cells are commonly maintained in serum containing medium which limits their use in 'omics'-based toxicology. In this study, we compared the maintenance of HepaRG cells in standard serum-supplemented and serum-free conditions. Viability and Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) activity during long-term cultivation were assessed. Liver-specific albumin and urea production was measured. The extracellular metabolome (amino acids, glucose, lactate and pyruvate) was measured to compare different cultivation conditions using metabolic flux analysis. Although metabolic flux analysis reveals differences in certain parts of the metabolism, e. g. production of urea, the overall metabolism of serum-free and serum-supplemented cultured HepaRG cells is similar. We conclude that HepaRG cells can be maintained in optimized serum-free conditions for 30 days without viability change and with high CYP activity. We also tested the acute (24 h) and long-term <b>repeated-dose</b> (7 doses, every second day) toxicity of valproic acid. We calculated an EC 50 value of 1. 4 mM after repeated exposure which is close to the cmax value for valproic acid.

30|$|The most {{commonly}} used chitosan derivatives used in drug delivery are the water-soluble lobster chitosan acid salts (Cervera et al. 2011).

Apart from being stable for extended periods (1  year), the toxicity levels of lobster chitosan acid salts are negligible. This was indicated by a study investigating the single- and <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity of chitosan and its salts (lactate and acetate) on rats. At oral doses of 2000  mg/kg, no fatalities or changes in the general behavior of the rats in both the acute- and <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity studies were observed (Lagarto et al. 2015).

40|$|Long-term <b>repeated-dose</b> {{toxicity}} {{is mainly}} assessed in animals despite poor concordance of animal data with human toxicity. Nowadays advanced human in vitro systems, eg, metabolically competent HepaRG cells, {{are used for}} toxicity screening. Extrapolation of in vitro toxicity to in vivo effects is possible by reverse dosimetry using pharmacokinetic modeling. We assessed long-term <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity of bosentan and valproic acid (VPA) in HepaRG cells under serum-free conditions. Upon 28 -day exposure, the EC 50 values for bosentan and VPA decreased by 21 - and 33 -fold, respectively. Using EC(10) as lowest threshold of toxicity in vitro, we estimated the oral equivalent doses for both test compounds using a simplified pharmacokinetic model for the extrapolation of in vitro toxicity to in vivo effect. The model predicts that bosentan is safe at the considered dose under the assumed conditions upon 4 weeks exposure. For VPA, hepatotoxicity is predicted for 4 % and 47 % of the virtual population at the maximum recommended daily dose after 3 and 4 weeks of exposure, respectively. We also investigated {{the changes in the}} central carbon metabolism of HepaRG cells exposed to orally bioavailable concentrations of both drugs. These concentrations are below the 28 -day EC(10) and induce significant changes especially in glucose metabolism and urea production. These metabolic changes may have a pronounced impact in susceptible patients such as those with compromised liver function and urea cycle deficiency leading to idiosyncratic toxicity.

40|$|In the FP 6 European project OSIRIS, Integrated Testing Strategies (ITSs) for {{relevant}} toxicological endpoints {{were developed}} to avoid new animal testing and thus to reduce time and costs. The present paper describes {{the development of an}} ITS for <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity called RepDose ITS which evaluates the conditions under which in vivo non-guideline studies are reliable. In a tiered approach three aspects of these "non-guideline" studies are assessed: the documentation of the study (reliability), the quality of the study design (adequacy) and the scope of examination (validity). The reliability is addressed by the method "Knock-out criteria", which consists of four essential criteria for <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity studies. A second tool, termed QUANTOS (Quality Assessment of Non-guideline Toxicity Studies), evaluates and weights the adequacy of the study by using intra-criterion and inter-criteria weighting.

40|$|Background: A single subanesthetic (intravenous) IV dose of {{ketamine}} {{might have}} rapid but transient antidepressant effects {{in patients with}} treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Here we tested the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of <b>repeated-dose</b> open-label IV ketamine (six infusions over 12 days) in 10 medication-free symptomatic patients with TRD who had previously shown a meaningful antidepressant response to a single dose. Methods: On day 1, patients received a 40 -min IV infusion of ketamine (. 5 mg/kg) in an inpatient setting with continuous vital-sign monitoring. Psychotomimetic effects and adverse events were recorded repeatedly. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score. If patients showed a >= 50 % reduction in MADRS scores on day 2, they received five additional infusions on an outpatient basis (days 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12). Follow-up visits were conducted twice-weekly for >= 4 weeks or until relapse. Results: Ketamine elicited minimal positive psychotic symptoms. Three patients experienced significant but transient dissociative symptoms. Side effects during and after each ketamine infusion were generally mild. The response criterion was met by nine patients after the first infusion as well as after the sixth infusion. The mean (SD) reduction in MADRS scores after the sixth infusion was 85 % (12 %). Postketamine, eight of nine patients relapsed, on average, 19 days after the sixth infusion (range 6 days- 45 days). One patient remained antidepressant-free with minimal depressive symptoms for > 3 months.

Gray {{has been}} {{commonly}} used in folk medicine to treat abscesses, microbiological infections, snake bites, malaria and diabetes. Both anti-inflammatory and anti-malarial properties have been identified using appropriate assays, but the effective doses have demonstrated toxic effects for the experimental animals. Most of the pharmacological activities {{have been attributed to}} sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) and some chlorogenic acid derivatives (CAs) in the leaves of this species. This work aimed to evaluate the <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity of an aqueous extract (AE) from Tithonia diversifolia leaves and to compare the results with an extract rich in STLs (LRE) and a polar extract (PE) without STLs but rich in CAs. The purpose of this work was to provide insights into the identity of the compounds responsible for the toxic effects of Tithonia diversifolia. Materials and methodsThe major classes of compounds were confirmed in each extract by IR spectra and HPLC-UV-DAD profiling using previously isolated or standard compounds. The toxicity of each extract was evaluated in a <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity study in Wistar rats for 90 days. ResultsThe AE is composed of both STLs and CAs, the LRE is rich in STLs, and the PE is rich in CAs. The AE caused alterations in haematological parameters but few alterations in biochemical parameters and was relatively safe at doses lower than 100 mg/kg. However, the PE and LRE demonstrated several adverse effects by damaging the liver and kidneys, respectively.

Two types of gas oils were tested for <b>repeated-dose</b> and developmental toxicity following repeated dermal administration. A blend of commercial diesel fuels contain-ing 26 % aromatics, primarily single-ring compounds, did not cause either target organ or developmental effects at levels up to 600 mg/kg/d. ‘‘Cracked’ ’ gas oils containing higher levels of aromatic constituents were also tested.

The safety of aloe fermentation products were examined in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were orally administered the three aloe fermentation products at dose levels of 1, 2 or 5 g/kg for single-dose toxicity test and 0. 5, 1, or 2 g/kg for <b>repeated-dose</b> toxicity test.

The application of the Cramer decision tree to datasets of <b>repeated-dose</b> studies with inhalation exposure resulted in very low thresholds compared to oral TTC values.

40|$|There are no in vivo <b>repeated-dose</b> {{data for}} the vast {{majority}} of β-olefinic alcohols. However, there are robust and consistent ex vivo data suggesting many of these chemicals are metabolically transformed, especially in the liver, to reactive electrophilic toxicants which react in a mechanistically similar manner to acrolein, the reactive metabolite of 2 -propen- 1 -ol. Hence, an evaluation was conducted to determine suitability of 2 -propen- 1 -ol as a read-across analogue for other β-olefinic alcohols. The pivotal issue to applying read-across to the proposed category is the confirmation of the biotransformation to metabolites having the same mechanism of electrophilic reactivity, via the same metabolic pathway, with a rate of transformation sufficient to induce the same in vivo outcome. The applicability domain for this case study was limited to small (C 3 to C 6) primary and secondary β-olefinic alcohols. Mechanistically, these β-unsaturated alcohols are considered to be readily metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase to polarised α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. These metabolites are able to react via the Michael addition reaction mechanism with thiol groups in proteins resulting in cellular apoptosis and/or necrosis. The addition of the non-animal in chemico reactivity data (50 % depletion of free glutathione) reduced the uncertainty so the read-across prediction for the straight-chain olefinic β-unsaturated alcohols is deemed equivalent to a standard test. Specifically, the rat oral 90 -day <b>repeated-dose</b> No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for 2 -propen- 1 -ol of 6 mg/kg body weight (bw) /d in males based on increase in relative weight of liver and 25 mg/kg bw/d in females based on bile duct hyperplasia and periportal hepatocyte hypertrophy in the liver, is read across to fill data gaps for the straight-chained analogues...|$|E

The stud-ies employed powdered L-valyl-L-prolyl-L-proline (VPP) - and L-isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L-proline (IPP) -containing test articles, in-cluding (1) powdered Lactobacillus helveticus–fermented milk (FM), (2) pasteurized casein hydrolysate (CH) generated by Aspergillus oryzae protease, and (3) synthesized VPP. All test arti-cles were administered by oral gavage to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Specific goals of the single-dose and <b>repeated-dose</b> studies were to (1) identify doses that produce evidence of systemic and/or local (i. e., gastrointestinal) toxicity (e. g., lowest-observable-effect level [LOEL]); (2) estimate the maximally tolerated oral dose (MTD); and (3) identify specific target organs for toxicity of these tripeptides. Single doses of CH (2000 mg/kg), powdered FM (2000 or 4000 mg/kg), or VPP (40, 200, or 400 mg/kg) were adminis...|$|E

All rats administered Î³-oryzanol survived throughout the study period. Both male and female rats showed no toxicologically significant changes of the general signs, examination findings, body weight, food consumption, functional observational battery results, ophthalmological findings, urinalysis, hematology tests, clinical chemistry tests, organ weights, and necropsy findings. Moreover, there were no histopathological changes related to administration of Î³-oryzanol in males and females from the 2000 Â mg/kg body weight/day group. In conclusion, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of Î³-oryzanol exceeded 2000 Â mg/kg body weight/day for {{both male and female}} rats under the conditions of this study.

40|$|The basic {{conclusions}} {{in almost all}} reports on new drug applications and in all publications in toxicology are based on statistical methods. However, serious contradictions exist in practice: designs with small samples sizes but use of asymptotic methods (i. e. constructed for larger sample sizes), statistically significant findings without biological relevance (and vice versa), proof of hazard vs. proof of safety, testing (e. g. no observed effect level) vs. estimation (e. g. benchmark dose), available statistical theory vs. related user-friendly software. In this review the biostatistical developments since about the year 2000 onwards are discussed, mainly structured for <b>repeated-dose</b> studies, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and ecotoxicological assays. A critical discussion is included on the unnecessarily conservative evaluation proposed in guidelines, the inadequate but almost always used proof of hazard approach, and the limitation of data-dependent decision-tree approaches...|$|E

Groups of 20 male and 20 female rats were fed powdered diets containing sufficient VPP to afford daily doses of 0, 2, 8, or 16 mg/kg body weight (BW) /day. Groups of five male and five female dogs were administered 0, 2, 8, or 16 mg/kg BW/day in hard gelatin capsules. Antemortem evaluative parameters for both species included grossly observable clinical signs, body weight and food consumption, clinical pathology (hematology, clinical chem-istry, urinalysis), and ophthalmological examinations.

40|$|Liposomal aminoglycosides {{have been}} shown to have {{activity}} against intracellular infections, such as those caused by Mycobacterium avium. Amikacin in small, low-clearance liposomes (MiKasome) also has curative and prophylactic efficacies against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To develop appropriate dosing regimens for low-clearance liposomal amikacin, we studied the pharmacokinetics of liposomal amikacin in plasma, the level of exposure of plasma to free amikacin, and urinary excretion of amikacin after the administration of single-dose (20 mg/kg of body weight) and <b>repeated-dose</b> (20 mg/kg eight times at 48 -h intervals) regimens in rhesus monkeys. The clearance of liposomal amikacin (single-dose regimen, 0. 023 ± 0. 003 ml min− 1 kg− 1; <b>repeated-dose</b> regimen, 0. 014 ± 0. 001 ml min− 1 kg− 1) was over 100 -fold lower than the creatinine clearance (an estimate of conventional amikacin clearance). Half-lives in plasma were longer than those reported for other amikacin formulations and declined during the elimination phase following administration of the last dose (from 81. 7 ± 27 to 30. 5 ± 5 h). Peak and trough (48 h) levels after repeated dosing reached 728 ± 72 and 418 ± 60 μg/ml, respectively. The levels in plasma remained > 180 μg/ml for 6 days after the administration of the last dose. The free amikacin concentration in plasma never exceeded 17. 4 ± 1 μg/ml and fell rapidly (half-life, 1. 47 to 1. 85 h) after the administration of each dose of liposomal amikacin. This and the low volume of distribution (45 ml/kg) indicate that the amikacin in plasma largely remained sequestered in long-circulating liposomes. Less than half the amikacin was recovered in the urine, suggesting that the level of renal exposure to filtered free amikacin was reduced, possibly as a result of intracellular uptake or the metabolism of liposomal amikacin. Thus, low-clearance liposomal amikacin could be administered at prolonged (2 - to 7 -day) intervals to achieve high levels of exposure to liposomal amikacin with minimal exposure to free amikacin...|$|E

40|$|Anti-diabetic {{activity}} guided {{studies were}} performed on the leaves of Syzygium polyanthum, a popular traditional medicinal herb in north Sumatera, Indonesia. The anti-diabetic activity was evaluated by determining whether the extracts lowered the blood glucose levels (BGL) of normal rats (hypoglycaemic test), inhibited the rise of BGL of intraperitoneally glucose- loaded rats (glucose tolerance test) and lowered BGL of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Dried powdered S. polyanthum leaves were extracted serially with petroleum ether (PEE), chloroform (CE), methanol (ME) and water (WE). In diabetic rats, single-dose administration of the extracts showed that only ME reduced BGL. However, upon <b>repeated-dose</b> administration for 6 days both PEE and ME reduced BGL significantly. Therefore, liquid-liquid partition was used to fractionate ME into the following fractions: chloroform (CF), ethyl acetate (EAF), n-butanol (n-BF) and water (WF). Repeated administration of CF and WF decreased BGL of diabetic rats. CF was shaken with n-hexane to yield an undissolved fraction (SF- 1) and a dissolved fraction (SF- 2) ...|$|E
