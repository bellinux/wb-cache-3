The tori in {{equilibrium}} were perturbed with uniform sub-sonic velocity fields: vertical, <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>diagonal</b> respectively, <b>and</b> {{allowed to}} evolve in time.

40|$|In the {{submitted}} thesis a role {{is examined}} {{of the concept}} of impredicativity in solu- tion suggestions for epistemological and logical paradoxes. We focus on the develo- pment of this concept in the way Russell and Poincaré contributed to it in the first stage. An introduction is given to Russell's theory of types based on the exclusion of impredicative principles and definitions, problems are mentioned related with this theory. We continue by offering Ramsey's modification of the theory of types sup- posed to solve the given problems. Connection is examined between impredicativity <b>and</b> <b>diagonal</b> <b>construction</b> <b>and</b> attention is paid to determination of conditions under which <b>diagonal</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>and</b> impredicative definitions are vicious, i. e. leading to contradictions. For this purpose a distinction is offered between out-picking and potentially constructing principles. In the conclusion the axiomatic set theory is mentioned which neutralizes the distinction between predicative and impredicative principles, and whose acceptance lead to disinterest in impredicativity...|$|R
5000|$|Tuxen [...] "enjoyed {{success with}} {{conventional}} forms of design {{but he was}} also open to persuasion" [...] and new ideas. [...] His differing approaches to design and planning are evident in his 1914 [...] "right-angled subdivision design in Bittern, Victoria". The Bittern design was based on a grid system plan. In contrast, his design for the ‘Hill Top’ development in Mont Albert, a suburb of Melbourne, incorporated [...] "unusual size and shape, with an irregular streetscape". This example demonstrated Tuxen's movement away from the grid system, to the contemporary design approach of the early twentieth century. This new design embraced curved, <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> <b>diagonal</b> streets; the environment was celebrated through open spaces and parks, and civic buildings were placed in the centre of town.|$|R
40|$|We {{simulate}} an oscillating purely hydrodynamical torus {{with constant}} specific angular mo- mentum around a Schwarzschild black hole. The {{goal is to}} search for quasi-periodic oscil- lations (QPOs) in the light curve of the torus. The initial torus setup is subjected to <b>radial,</b> vertical <b>and</b> <b>diagonal</b> (combination of <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> vertical) velocity perturbations. The hydro- dynamical simulations are performed using the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code Cosmos++ and ray-traced using the GYOTO code. We found that a horizontal velocity perturbation triggers the <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> plus modes, while a vertical velocity perturbation trig- gers the vertical and X modes. The diagonal perturbation gives {{a combination of the}} modes triggered in the <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> vertical perturbations. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, submitted in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} axisymmetric hydrodynamical {{simulations of}} oscillating tori orbiting a non-rotating black hole. The tori in equilibrium were constructed with a constant distribution of angular momentum in a pseudo-Newtonian potential (Kluźniak-Lee). Motions of the torus were triggered by adding sub-sonic velocity fields: <b>radial,</b> vertical <b>and</b> <b>diagonal</b> to the tori in equilibrium. As the perturbed tori evolved in time, we measured L_ 2 norm of density and obtained the power spectrum of L_ 2 norm which manifested eigenfrequencies of tori modes. The most prominent modes of oscillation excited in the torus by a quasi-random perturbation are the breathing mode <b>and</b> the <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> vertical epicyclic modes. The <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> the plus modes, {{as well as}} the vertical and the breathing modes will have frequencies in an approximate 3 : 2 ratio if the torus is several Schwarzschild radii away from the innermost stable circular orbit. Results of our simulations may be of interest in the context of high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed in stellar-mass black hole binaries, as well as in supermassive black holes.

In addition to modes with amplitude over the whole sample, some low-frequency modes, localized at the center, corners, <b>and</b> <b>diagonals</b> of the square, are also found. In analogy with the modes found in a circular vortex, the nonlocalized modes can be broadly classified into radiallike and azimuthal-like modes, and their frequencies can be understood qualitatively {{in terms of the}} dispersion relation of spin wave modes of an unconfined film.

40|$|The idea of {{a garden}} city, which was formed {{near the end of}} the 19 th century England, also {{affected}} the building of 'The Professors' colony' in the former northeast Belgrade. The constructions started in 1926, and they were completed during the initial months of the following year. Our intention was to consider the urban and social influence of the garden cities idea to the Belgrade 'colony', through critical contents. The fact we support in the text, is that the primary plan of Ebenezer Howard's had been realized here, only it resembled Hempsted (near London) more than the garden cities soon to come. The professors' colony, build to match the ideas of the garden cities, contained formal elements: <b>radial,</b> <b>diagonal</b> <b>and</b> arched streets, semi and full circled squares, as well as irregular parcels and blocks. Primarily conceived as London suburbs that are now those of Belgrade, today they are blended in with the environment, and represent elite neighborhoods with a wealthy population. There are differences between the two examples that are reflected in Hempstead's keeping its autonomy as a whole, with all its needful contents, while 'the colony' is just a settlement, still dependent on the city to tend to its needs. Also, in our work, we keep track of individual edifices, built in the spirit of modern architecture in the Professor's colony...|$|R

40|$|Some recent {{results for}} a three [...] dimensional, semi [...] classical, tight [...] binding model for DNA {{show that there}} are two types of polarons, named <b>radial</b> <b>and</b> twist polarons, that can {{transport}} charge along the DNA molecule. However, the existence of two types of base pairs in real DNA, makes it crucial to find out if charge transport also exist in DNA chains with different base pairs. In this paper we address this problem in its simple case, an homogeneous chain except for a single different base pair, what we call a base-pair inhomogeneity, and its effect on charge transport. Radial polarons experience either reflection or trapping. However, twist polarons are good candidates for charge transport along real DNA. This transport is also very robust with respect to weak parametric <b>and</b> <b>diagonal</b> disorder. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
