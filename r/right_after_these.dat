Among 11 histidine residues conserved in subunit I of 3 mammalian and 2 fungal cytochrome oxidases the sequence around His- 233 (human) is the most conserved and shows remarkable similarity to the sequence of the oxygen binding site in globins. Furthermore, the gene coding for subunit I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the gene for leghemoglobin in soybean are both split by introns <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>these</b> similar histidine sequences. The predicted distal histidine sequence of subunit I provides for heme a 3 and Cua 3 binding and has an extraordinarily high content of aromatic residues. These aromatic groups may serve as a molecular electron capacitor. Transmembrane sequences and electron transfer sequences are proposed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} salt iodization in Switzerland in the 1920 s and 1930 s on schooling outcomes. Iodine deficiency in utero causes mental retardation, and correcting the deficiency {{is expected to increase}} the productivity of a population by increasing its cognitive ability. The exogenous increase in cognitive ability brought about by the iodization program is also useful in the context of disentangling the effects of innate ability and education in later-life outcomes. I identify the impact of iodization in three ways: first, in a differences-in-differences framework, I exploit geographic variation in iodine deficiency, as well as the fact that the nationwide campaign to decrease iodine deficiency began in 1922. Second, I use spatial and temporal variation in the introduction of iodized salt across Swiss cantons, and examine whether the level of iodized salt sales at the time of one’s birth affected one’s educational attainment. Third, I employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design and use jumps in sales of iodized salt across Swiss cantons to identify the effect of iodization, by comparing outcomes for those born right before and <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>these</b> sudden changes in the treatment environment. These approaches indicate that the eradication of iodine deficiency in previously deficient areas increased the schooling of the population significantly. The effects are larger for females than for males, which is consistent with medical evidence showing that {{women are more likely to}} be affected by iodine deficiency disorders than men...|$|E

5000|$|There are {{different}} ways to signal participants when to take notes in their journal or fill-out a questionnaire, like using preprogrammed stopwatches. An observer can have an identically programmed stopwatch, so the observer can record specific events as the participants are recording their feelings or other behaviors. It is best to avoid letting subjects know in advance when they will record their feelings, so they can't anticipate the event, and will just be [...] "acting naturally" [...] when they stop and take notes on their current condition. Conversely, some statistical techniques require roughly equidistant time intervals, which has the limitation that assessments can be anticipated. Validity in these studies comes from repetition, so you can look for patterns, like participants reporting greater happiness <b>right</b> <b>after</b> meals. <b>These</b> correlations can then be tested by other means for cause and effect, such as vector autoregression, since ESM just shows correlation.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Corneal {{thinning}} disorders {{weaken the}} mechanical strength of affected corneas, suggesting that photorefractive procedures may be contraindicated in keratoconus. Few {{cases have been}} reported to confirm this hypothesis. METHODS: A 45 -year-old man had two laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) procedures and one photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) performed on his left eye, and three LASIK procedures on his <b>right</b> eye. <b>After</b> <b>these</b> surgeries, a dramatic corneal ectasia and grade III haze occurred in both eyes, with a clinical diagnosis of keratoconus. The changes in his corneas were followed with videokeratography and slit-lamp microscopy. RESULTS: Preoperative videokeratograph of both eyes suggested keratoconus. After multiple refractive procedures, the best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was as low as 20 / 1200 bilaterally. Both eyes displayed dramatic corneal protrusion with corneal scarring. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the need for preoperative corneal thickness measureme [...] ...|$|R

40|$|How {{do people}} protect their {{physical}} and mental well-being when their assets and health are continually threatened by river flooding? How can we understand their practices in anticipation of, during, or <b>right</b> <b>after</b> floods? <b>These</b> are the main questions {{that have led to}} my anthropological PhD-research on the ways in which residents of a severely flood-prone neighbourhood in Jakarta (Indonesia) live with - and protect themselves against- frequent floods. Between 2009 and 2011 I have conducted fieldwork and lived in a neighbourhood that I call ‘Bantaran Kali’ in this dissertation: a slum that is built on the banks of a river and that is flooded several times a year. During my fieldwork in Bantaran Kali, I participated in the daily lives of my informants and experienced some of the risks that are inherent to it. For example, their houses and in-house shops flooded three times during the period in which my fieldwork took place. Many residents fell ill due to the polluted floodwater, and most of them experienced huge economic losses {{as a result of these}} floods. Some lost all their savings, while others saw their furniture and work assets damaged. Through the methods of participant observation, focus group discussions, risk mapping and in-depth interviewing; and by recording life-histories and conducting psychological and socio-economical surveys, I tried to gain insights in the many different ways in which the inhabitants of Bantaran Kali act and deal with the flood-risks described above...|$|R
40|$|The {{pulmonary}} thromboembolism is a potentially fatal disorder, {{known as the}} most serious consequence of deep vein thrombosis.

There are many risk factors that predispose to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism such as age, prolonged immobilization, orthopedic surgery and trauma, which should be considered for a correct diagnosis and an effective prophylaxis. Although its incidence has suffered a small decrease, the pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis are an important public health problem...|$|R
40|$|The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg {{model on}} the dodecahedron {{possesses}} {{a number of}} ground state magnetization discontinuities in a field at the classical and quantum level, even though it lacks magnetic anisotropy. Here the model is considered for two dodecahedra coupled antiferromagnetically along one of their faces, {{as a first step}} to determine the magnetic response of collections of fullerene molecules. The magnetic response is determined from the competition among the intra-, interdodecahedra exchange and magnetic field energies. At the classical level the discontinuities of the isolated dodecahedron are renormalized by the interdodecahedral coupling, while new ones show up, with the maximum number of ground state discontinuities being six for a specific range of the coupling. In the full quantum limit where the individual spin magnitude s= 1 / 2, there are two ground state discontinuities originating in the single discontinuity of the isolated dodecahedron, and another one due to the intermolecular coupling, generating a total of three discontinuities which come one <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the other. <b>These</b> results show that the magnetic response of more than one dodecahedra interacting together is quite richer than the one of a single dodecahedron.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{highlight}} effective sight-singing techniques used by successful choral directors in the state of Kentucky. The method used for this study was a non-experimental survey sent to thirty-four high school choral directors. Directors were selected to participate based on distinguished assessment scores received over the last five years (2011 - 2015). They were asked questions about their techniques, background in education, and placement of sight-singing in the curriculum. With a response rate of 65 % the results indicated that the majority of directors had received or earned at least a master’s degree, had taught for at least six or more years, and received most of their sight-singing instruction from their undergraduate degree. The techniques of sight-singing used were movable-do (95. 45 %) for pitch and count singing (81. 82 %) for rhythm. Finally, the majority of the directors only spent 5 - 10 minutes of class time on sight-singing and 90. 91 % placed sight-singing at the beginning, during, or <b>right</b> <b>after</b> warmups. With <b>these</b> results, a sight-singing method model was created using vocal and choral warmups to assist in a sight-singing example. Suggestions for further research and studies are given...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between general self-efficacy postpartum mothers and their interaction with their babies during nursing. Our goal was to find more effective nursing support to help new mothers to continue to interact with their new born baby. The subjects were 34 primiparas who were planning to deliver their babies in a particular hospital in Prefecture A. They were asked to fill out a survey form to answer questions regarding general self-efficacy and other psychological traits. The interaction with their babies was videotaped three different times. The results were graded using a time sampling method and later analyzed. We found a relation between the general selfefficacy of the mother who had a high general self-efficacy at the end of her pregnancy, and how she interacted with her baby <b>right</b> <b>after</b> child birth. <b>These</b> mothers interacted more with their children than did others. The new mothers were able to learn interaction skills, so that they could continue interacting with their babies. Nurses need to understand that a high general self-efficacy helps greatly for firsttime mothers in dealing with their new circumstances of having a child. Knowing that, nurses can provide better personal care for their patients, even before child birth...|$|R
