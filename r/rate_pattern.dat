40|$|Two <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> {{exist in}} the user × item rating matrix and {{influence}} each other: the personal <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> are hidden in each user 2 ̆ 7 s entire rating history, while the global <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> are hidden in the entire user × item rating matrix. In this paper, a <b>Rating</b> <b>Pattern</b> Subspace is proposed to model both of the <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> simultaneously by iteratively refining each other with an EM-like algorithm. Firstly, a low-rank subspace is built up to model the global <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> from the whole user × item rating matrix, then, the projection for each user on the subspace is refined individually based on his/her own entire rating history. After that, the refined user projections on the subspace are used to improve the modelling of the global <b>rating</b> <b>patterns.</b> Iteratively, we can obtain a well-trained low-rank <b>Rating</b> <b>Pattern</b> Subspace, which is capable of modelling both the personal and the global <b>rating</b> <b>patterns.</b> Based on this subspace, we propose a RapSVD algorithm to generate Top-N recommendations, and the experiment {{results show that the}} proposed method can significantly outperform the other state-of-the-art Top-N recommendation methods in terms of accuracy, especially on long tail item recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Because {{physical}} fitness and health are related to physical activity, {{it is important to}} gain an insight into the physical activity levels of persons with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine heart <b>rate</b> <b>patterns</b> to measure the activity levels of persons with PIMD and to analyze these heart <b>rate</b> <b>patterns</b> according to participant characteristics, observed level of activity, days, and time of day. The heart <b>rate</b> <b>patterns</b> of 24 participants with PIMD were measured continuously using a heart rate monitor for 8 h · d for a period of 6 days. Physical activity levels were measured with questionnaires. Data were analyzed using multilevel analysis. The results indicate that the participants use only 32 % of their heart rate reserve over 6 days. The intensity of heart rate reserve ranged from 1 to 62 %. On a given day, wide ranges in heart rates between participants and within persons were observed. Between days, only small ranges in the heart rate were found. The participants could be grouped into 4 classes according to their heart rate. In addition, factors such as time of day, physical activity, and age are significantly related to heart <b>rate</b> <b>patterns.</b> In conclusion, this study is an important first step in exploring activity patterns based on heart <b>rate</b> <b>patterns</b> in persons with PIMD. The participants used relatively small fractions of their heart rate reserves. Time of day and age appear to have a considerable influence on heart <b>rate</b> <b>patterns.</b> The observed classes in heart <b>rate</b> <b>patterns</b> suggest that other probably more personal and psychosocial factors have significant influences on heart <b>rate</b> <b>patterns,</b> as well...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{tackle the}} incompleteness of user rating {{history in the}} context of {{collaborative}} filtering for Top-N recommendations. Previous research ignore a fact that two <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> exist in the user × item rating matrix and influence each other. More importantly, their interactive influence characterizes the development of each other, which can consequently be exploited to improve the modelling of <b>rating</b> <b>patterns,</b> especially when the user × item rating matrix is highly incomplete due to the well-known data sparsity issue. This paper proposes a <b>Rating</b> <b>Pattern</b> Subspace to iteratively re-optimize the missing values in each user&# 039;s rating history by modelling both the global and the personal <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> simultaneously. The basic idea is to project the user × item rating matrix on a low-rank subspace to capture the global <b>rating</b> <b>patterns.</b> Then, the projection of each individual user on the subspace is further optimized according to his/her own rating history and the captured global <b>rating</b> <b>patterns.</b> Finally, the optimized user projections are used to improve the modelling of the global <b>rating</b> <b>patterns.</b> Based on this subspace, we propose a RapSVD-L algorithm for Top-N recommendations. In the experiments, the performance of the proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art Top-N recommendation methods on two real datasets under various data sparsity levels. The experimental results show that RapSVD-L outperforms the compared algorithms not only on the all items recommendations but also on the long tail item recommendations in terms of accuracy...|$|R

5000|$|The {{spiking neuron}} model by Nossenson & Messer [...] {{produces}} {{the probability of}} the neuron to fire a spike {{as a function of}} either an external or pharmacological stimulus. The model consists of a cascade of a receptor layer model and a spiking neuron model, as shown in Fig 4. The connection between the external stimulus to the spiking probability is made in two steps: First, a receptor cell model translates the raw external stimulus to neurotransmitter concentration, then, a spiking neuron model connects between neurotransmitter concentration to the firing rate (spiking probability). Thus, the spiking neuron model by itself depends on neurotransmitter concentration at the input stage.An important feature of this model is the prediction for neurons firing <b>rate</b> <b>pattern</b> which captures, using a low number of free parameters, the characteristic edge emphasized response of neurons to a stimulus pulse, as shown in Fig. 5.

40|$|Abstract. Recommender systems always aim {{to provide}} {{recommendations}} for a user based on historical ratings collected {{from a single}} domain (e. g., movies or books) only, which may suffer from the data sparsity problem. Recently, several recommendation models have been proposed to transfer knowledge by pooling together the rating data from multiple domains to alleviate the sparsity problem, which typically assume that multiple domains share a latent common <b>rating</b> <b>pattern</b> based on the user-item co-clustering. In practice, however, the related domains do not necessarily share such a common <b>rating</b> <b>pattern,</b> and diversity among the related domains might outweigh the advantages of such common pattern, which may result in performance degradations. In this paper, we propose a novel cluster-level based latent factor model to enhance the cross-domain recommendation, which can not only learn the common <b>rating</b> <b>pattern</b> shared across domains with the flexibility in controlling the optimal level of sharing, but also learn the domain-specific <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> of users in each domain that involve the discriminative information propitious to performance improvement. To this end, the proposed model is formulated as an optimization problem based on joint nonnegative matrix tri-factorization and an efficient alternating minimization algorithm is developed with convergence guarantee. Extensive experiments on several real world datasets suggest that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the cross-domain recommendation task. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{effects of}} two {{antihypertensive}} drugs, methyldopa and isradipine, on fetal heart <b>rate</b> <b>pattern</b> {{were analyzed by}} computerized cardiotocography. STUDY DESIGN: The {{first part of the}} study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of 19 women with preeclampsia in the third trimester given 2. 5 mg of oral slow-release isradipine twice a day or 250 mg of methyldopa three times a day. In a second part of the study 23 women with preeclampsia in the third trimester given 5 mg of oral slow-release isradipine twice a day were compared with 23 matched controls without medication. Main outcome measures were maternal blood pressure and mean baseline fetal heart rate, fetal movements, number of accelerations, periods of high and low baseline variability, and mean baseline heart rate variability. RESULTS: Compared with the pretreatment value, the mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly in all drug treatment groups. Fetal heart rate characteristics were not significantly changed during drug treatment or bed rest.

40|$|The {{sparsity}} {{problem in}} collaborative filtering (CF) {{is a major}} bottleneck for most CF methods. In this paper, we consider a novel approach for alleviating the sparsity problem in CF by transferring useritem <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> from a dense auxiliary rating matrix in other domains (e. g., a popular movie rating website) to a sparse rating matrix in a target domain (e. g., a new book rating website). We do not require that the users and items in the two domains be identical or even overlap. Based on the limited ratings in the target matrix, we establish {{a bridge between the}} two rating matrices at a clusterlevel of user-item <b>rating</b> <b>patterns</b> in order to transfer more useful knowledge from the auxiliary task domain. We first compress the ratings in the auxiliary rating matrix into an informative and yet compact cluster-level <b>rating</b> <b>pattern</b> representation referred to as a codebook. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for reconstructing the target rating matrix by expanding the codebook. We perform extensive empirical tests to show that our method is effective in addressing the data sparsity problem by transferring the useful knowledge from the auxiliary tasks, as compared to many state-of-the-art CF methods. ...|$|R

The clinical benefit of using the tcPco measurement is the better specificity of detecting fetal distress when compared with the use of cardiotocography alone. Furthermore the tcPco technique has the advantage of providing continuous information about one bio-chemical parameter and of avoiding the necess ity of repeated incisions of the scalp, as compared with the technique of fetal blood analysis.

Among the major developments was the surveillance of the fetus by fetal scalp blood sampling, relating fetal scalp blood pH to fetal well-being in labor. Another significant development was the concentration of interest in intrapartum monitoring of the fetal heart rate by electronic means. An extensive literature on the significance of fetal heart rate patterns in association with uterine contractions in labor now exists. Such patterns are interpreted for the diagnosis fetal distress, and are combined with the biochemical data obtained by fetal scalp blood sampling. Ominous fetal heart rate patterns and low fetal scalp blood pH have been shown to correlate with poor perinatal outcome. In the United States, the accepted procedure is to obtain serial fetal scalp blood pH readings whenever a suspicious fetal heart <b>rate</b> <b>pattern</b> is found. Fetal acidosis is considered to confirm the fetal jeopardy suggested by the abnormal heart <b>rate</b> <b>pattern.</b> The pathophysiology of fetal acidosis is based on maternal-fetal exchange through the placenta. Given normal maternal acid-base balance, fetal acidosis is the result of severe feto-placental hypoxia.
