40|$|It is {{now well}} known that the Sharpe ratio and other related reward-to-risk {{measures}} may be manipulated with option-like strategies. In this paper we derive the general conditions for achieving the maximum expected Sharpe ratio. We derive static rules for achieving the maximum Sharpe ratio with two or more options, {{as well as a}} continuum of derivative contracts. The optimal strategy has a truncated right tail and a fat left tail. We also derive dynamic rules for increasing the Sharpe ratio. Our results have implications for performance measurement in any setting in which managers may use derivative contracts. In a performance measurement setting, we suggest that the distribution of high Sharpe ratio managers should be compared with that of the optimal Sharpe ratio strategy. This has particular application in the hedge fund industry where use of derivatives is unconstrained and manager compensation itself induces a non-linear payoff. The shape of the optimal Sharpe ratio leads to further conjectures. Expected returns being held constant, high Sharpe ratio strategies are, by definition, strategies that generate regular modest profits punctuated by occasional crashes. Our evidence suggests that the "peso problem" may be ubiquitous in any investment management industry that rewards high Sharpe ratio managers.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} unwinding of leveraged positions {{can trigger}} financial market turbulence. Although balance-sheet measures of leverage are available, {{it is useful}} to construct a measure of leverage that incorporates both on- and off-balance-sheet activities. This paper provides measures of leverage implicit in derivative contracts by decomposing the contracts into cash market equivalent components. A leverage ratio can then be calculated for this replicating portfolio, which consists of own funds (equity) and borrowed funds equivalents (debt). Methods for aggregating leverage by institution and by markets are presented. The interaction between leverage and risk is discussed, and a modified capital adequacy ratio is calculated, which captures off-balance-sheet exposure.

In contrast to mutual funds and hedge funds, CTAs trade a limited number of futures contracts and option. This feature enables a clean test for market timing ability in this group of managers. We propose new factors for popular market timing models to overcome the difficulty that traditional models provide poor explanatory power for CTA returns. With a multi-market version of both Trenor and Mazuy (1966), Henriksson and Merton (1981) models, we confirm that CTAs have both return and volatility timing ability in multiple markets. We are also able to identify the markets in which different categories of CTAs have timing ability. ^ We explore the managerial incentives and risk-taking behavior for hedge funds and funds of funds in essay three. We find evidence that hedge funds shift their risk-taking in response to the high-water mark and to relative performance. Our findings disclose the underlying managerial incentives due to career concern as well as asymmetric payoff structure. We also compare the managerial incentive of junior vs more seasoned FOF managers in terms of diversification level and risk exposures.

Results from the hog complex find that <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> estimated by local polynomial kernel regression outperform naïve and GARCH models. Because of the potential assumption violations associated with the estimation and implementation of <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> by GARCH models, LPK is a reasonable alternative for estimating <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> to manage price risks.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} hedging {{effectiveness}} of the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 stock index futures contract using weekly settlement prices for the period July 3 rd, 1992 to June 30 th, 2002. Particularly, it focuses on three areas of interest: {{the determination of the}} appropriate model for estimating a <b>hedge</b> <b>ratio</b> that minimizes the variance of returns; the hedging effectiveness and the stability of optimal <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> through time; an in-sample forecasting analysis in order to examine the hedging performance of different econometric methods. The hedging performance of this contract is examined considering alternative methods, both constant and time-varying, for computing more effective <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios.</b> The results suggest the optimal <b>hedge</b> <b>ratio</b> that incorporates nonstationarity, long run equilibrium relationship and short run dynamics is reliable and useful for hedgers. Comparisons of the hedging effectiveness and in-sample hedging performance of each model imply that the error correction model (ECM) is superior to the other models employed in terms of risk reduction. Finally, the results for testing the stability of the optimal <b>hedge</b> <b>ratio</b> obtained from the ECM suggest that it remains stable over time.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} and contrast the risk mitigating effectiveness from optimal multiproduct time-varying <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios,</b> applied to the margin of a cattle feedlot operation, over single commodity time-varying and naive <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A parsimonious regime-switching dynamic correlations (RSDC) model is estimated in two-stages, where the dynamic correlations among prices of numerous commodities vary proportionally between two different regimes/levels. This property simplifies estimation methods for a large number of parameters involved. Findings – There is significant evidence that resulting simultaneous correlations among the prices (spot and futures) for each commodity attain different levels along the time-series. Second, for in and out-of-sample data there is a substantial reduction in the operation’s margin variance provided from both multiproduct and single time-varying optimal <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> over naive <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios.</b> Lastly, risk mitigation is attained at a lower cost given that average optimal multiproduct and single time-varying <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> obtained for corn, feeder cattle and live cattle are significantly below the naive full <b>hedge</b> <b>ratio.</b> Research limitations/implications – The application studied is limited in that once a hedge position has been set at a particular period, it is not possible to modify or update at a subsequent period. Practical implications – Agricultural producers, specifically cattle feeders, may profit from a tool using improved techniques to determine <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> by considering a larger amount of up-to-date information. Moreover, these agents may apply <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> significantly lower than one and thus mitigate risk at lower costs. Originality/value – Feedlot operators will benefit from the potential implementation of this parsimonious RSDC model for their hedging operations, as it provides average optimal <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> significantly lower than one and sizeable advantages in margin risk mitigation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the hedging {{effectiveness of the}} FTSE- 100 stock index futures contract over the period 1984 - 92. Previous studies have examined this issue using ex post <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios,</b> resulting in an overestimation of hedging performance. This study utilizes ex ante <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> which are determined {{on the basis of}} historical information. It is shown that while <b>hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> vary through time, nonetheless it is possible to use this futures contract to achieve very substantial risk reduction as compared to an unhedged position. <b>Hedge</b> <b>ratios</b> estimated over longer periods are shown to provide greater risk reduction when applied in subsequent periods. ...|$|R
