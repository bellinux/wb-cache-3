40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how {{variation in}} trade credit standards {{play a role}} in firm maturation. In Chapter 1, I survey existing research in trade credit. Following this, I identify lifecycle trends in supplier trade credit policy in Chapter 2. Young suppliers assume greater risks in trade credit provision early in their lifecycles in order to advance growth and product market agendas. There is a peak around a supplier's IPO in the riskiness of trade credit supplied, measured by <b>doubtful</b> <b>receivables</b> and the length of credit provided (receivables length). I find that young firms in industries where customer-supplier relationships are more significant have higher <b>doubtful</b> <b>receivables,</b> consistent with suppliers varying trade credit standards to build relationships. Additionally, young suppliers with more complex products (as measured by R&D intensity) offer longer duration loans compared to suppliers of similar age. Offering riskier trade credit terms affects economic outcomes. In Chapter 3, I study if varying trade credit standards for the purpose of relationship building is a viable strategy for all firm maturities. I use the incidence of a major free trade agreement to study firm responses to a major disruption in existing supplier-customer relationships. Chapter 3 posits both supplier driven as well as customer driven explanations for the observed responses, finding evidence consistent with older suppliers have a reduced incentive as well as capacity to engage in relationship building.

40|$|The article {{examines}} the need in analytical support and management of accounts payable as forming factors of liquidity. It deals with the state and tendencies in formation of types of debt by the example of milk processing enterprises. The comparative analysis of the debt ratios at the company is carried out. It includes the settlements with debtors and creditors related to incoming and outgoing financial flows. The status of such calculations significantly affect the financial results {{of the company and}} its development. Therefore, the research of types of debt as the important factor in increasing the efficiency of the enterprise is of particular relevance. Economic relations between economic entities create the conditions where they can act both as sellers and buyers causing the objective of various types of debt. The presence of debt types is caused by various reasons, for instance, the incompliance of finished goods shipment, performance of works or services, receipt of commodity-material values, accrual payments to the moment of payment. Accounts receivable have a significant share in the composition of current assets. Therefore, the important place is given to the analysis of receivables when the company analyzes the turnover of its working capital. The source of the analysis is an enterprise balance sheet, the data of analytical accounting are used for the internal analysis. The detailed analysis of accounts receivable is carried out in order to take current management decisions on their reduction, and use timely actions for recovering <b>doubtful</b> <b>receivables.</b> In managing receivables and payables one should regularly monitor their ratio level, turnover rates and the period of maturity. In addition to these quantitative indicators one should also calculate quality indicators, in particular, to identify the groups of products, which account for the largest share in debt. The imbalance between the types of debt leads to uncontrolled growth in debt, deteriorating financial condition of businesses, devastating economic consequences, therefore, the objective need is to develop the system of its monitoring. The studies performed by the author prove the main directions in debt type management to optimize financial flows...|$|R

The views I have taken of the definite action of electricity in decomposing bodies (783.), and the identity of the power so used with the power to be overcome (855.), founded not on a mere opinion or general notion, but on facts which, being altogether new, were to my mind precise and conclusive, gave me, as I conceived, the power of examining the question with advantages not before possessed by any, and which might compensate, on my part, for the superior clearness and extent of intellect on theirs.

Such knowledge is the early morning light of every advancing science, and is essential to its development; but the man who is engaged in dispelling that which is deceptive in it, and revealing more clearly that which is true, is as useful in his place, and as necessary to the general progress of the science, as he who first broke through the intellectual darkness, and opened a path into knowledge before unknown to man.|$|R

30|$|It is {{said that}} the end of the World War 2 brought the {{collapse}} of fascism globally. But whether Japan’s surrender made Japan truly democratic country, or whether ‘fascist’ components of East - Asian countries were <b>removed</b> seemed <b>doubtful.</b> In contrast with the West European countries, the U.S. - led post-World War 2 politics in East - Asia failed to remove the old fascist or imperialist forces in Japan, which was typically demonstrated in the amnesty on the war criminals Tokyo tribunal. Eventually in Japan and South Korea, old fascists or extreme rightists, who led and supported the totalitarian regime after the Sino-Japanese war, reentered the power bloc under the cover of ‘post-war’ democracy (Bix 2001). The U.S. planned to make Japan its semi-colony in containing Soviet Union and China in East - Asia on which exoneration of war criminals and to build anticommunist system were needed. 11 As the fascist rule in Nazi’s Germany and Imperial Japan before 1945 stood firmly on anticommunism, 12 the U.S. support Japan’s Tenno system and pardoning war criminals after World War 2 in East - Asia meant the continuation of past anticommunism in East - Asia.|$|R

Pringle {{had been}} in the Upper Fifth himself a year before, and he remembered that every summer term there descended upon that form a Bad Time {{in the shape of a}} poetry prize.

Entrance was compulsory. The wily authorities knew very well that if it had not been, the entries for the prize would have been somewhat small. Why the Upper Fifth were so favoured in preference to the Sixth or <b>Remove</b> is <b>doubtful.</b> Possibly it was felt that, what with the Jones History, the Smith Latin Verse, the Robinson Latin Prose, and the De Vere Crespigny Greek Verse, and other trophies open only to members of the Remove and Sixth, those two forms had enough to keep them occupied as it was. At any rate, to the Upper Fifth the prize was given, and every year, three weeks after the commencement of the summer term, the Bad Time arrived.|$|R
40|$|Two {{new species}} of laophontid harpacticoids are {{described}} from deep-sea hydrothermal vents near the Azores in the Atlantic and north of Easter Island in the Pacific. Both species are placed in a new genus Bathylaophonte {{on account of the}} complex dorsal reticulation pattern on the cephalothorax and free body somites, the distinctive sexual dimorphism on both rami of P 2 -P 4, and the relatively primitive setal formula of the swimming legs. The northwest European Laophonte faroensis T. Scott, currently considered as species incerta in the family (Lang, 1948), is <b>removed</b> from its <b>doubtful</b> status and transferred to Bathylaophonte. The genus Paronychocamptus Lang is identified as a polyphyletic taxon, comprising five lineages. Under the revised concept the genus is exclusively boreal, including only two European species, P. curticaudatus (Boeck) and P. nanus (Sars), and two North American species, P. huntsmani (Willey) and P. wilsoni Coull. The other species P. exiguus (Sars), P. leuke Por, P. proprius Lang, P. connexus Pallares and P. anomalus Ranga Reddy are reallocated to Onychocamptus Daday and three new genera. Paronychocamptu is tentatively regarded as the most likely sistergroup of Bathylaophonte. The brackish water species P. anomalus from Andhra Pradesh (India) is transferred to the genus Onychocamptus. O. besnardi Jakobi from Brazil and O. vitiospinulosa (Shen & Tai) from China are removed from the synonymy of O. mohammed (Blanchard & Richard) and reinstated as valid species. The primitive position of the genus and its relationship with Folioquinpes Fiers & Rutledge are discussed [...] P. proprius from California, is placed in a new genus Psammoplatypus together with Klieonychocamptus discipes Noodt which occupied an isolated position in the genus Klieonychocamptus Noodt. Psammoplatypus is placed in the genus group comprising Coullia Hamond, Phycolaophonte Pallares, Hemilaophonte Jakubisiak and Robustunguis Fiers. The exiguus -group of Paronychocamptus, including P. exiguus from the Chatham Islands and P. connexus from Tierra del Fuego, is upgraded to generic level as Heteronychocamptus gen. nov. It is considered as most closely related to Pilifera Noodt, Pseudonychocamptus Lang and Weddellaophonte Willen {{on the basis of the}} sexually dimorphic setation of P 3 -P 4 enp- 1. There is an undeniable relationship between P. leuke and the species described by Griga (1963) as Laophonte brevifurca Sars. Both species (the latter renamed P. grigae sp. nov.) are placed in a new genus Pontophonte which is most closely related to the newly defined nordgaardi -group of Laophonte Philippi [...] Species keys are given for Paronychocamptus, Onychocamptus and Bathylaophonte gen. nov. The radiation of the family Laophontidae into deepwater habitats is reviewed. Re-examination of previous reports of 8 -segmented antennules in female Laophontidae has proven these to be incorrect...|$|R
