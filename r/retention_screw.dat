40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} {{the maintenance of}} tightening torque in different <b>retention</b> <b>screw</b> types of implant-supported crowns. Materials and Methods: Twelve metallic crowns in UCLA abutments cast with cobalt-chromium alloy were attached to external hexagon osseointegrated implants with different retention screws: group A: titanium alloy retention screw; group B: gold alloy <b>retention</b> <b>screw</b> with gold coating; group C: titanium alloy <b>retention</b> <b>screw</b> with diamond-like carbon film coating; and group D: titanium alloy <b>retention</b> <b>screw</b> with aluminum titanium nitride coating. Three detorque measurements were obtained after torque insertion in each replica. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's test (P < 0. 05), and t test (P < 0. 05). Results: Detorque value reduced in all groups (P < 0. 05). Group A retained {{the highest percentage of}} torque in comparison with the other groups (P < 0. 05). Groups B and D retained the lowest percentage of torque without statistically significant difference between them (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: All screw types exhibited reduction in the detorque value. The titanium screw maintained the highest percentage of torque whereas the gold-coated screw and the titanium screw with aluminum titanium nitride coating retained the lowest percentage.

50|$|The primary {{characteristic}} that often distinguishes duty holsters {{from all other}} holster designs is retention. Modern law enforcement duty holsters are available with varying levels of retention security (i.e. Level I, Level II, Level II+, Level III, etc.; some security features are passive (such as <b>retention</b> <b>screws,</b> decoy straps, or hood guards), while others are active and require deliberate manipulation by the officer during the draw (such as traditional thumbreak snaps). While {{a higher level of}} retention will {{make it more difficult for}} a suspect to snatch a holstered handgun away from an officer, it may also reduce the speed and ease with which an officer may draw his handgun (especially if the security features are active and not passive). Therefore, when selecting a duty holster, an officer may be forced to find a compromise of speed and retention that he/she is comfortable with.|$|R
40|$|The {{longevity}} of implant-supported prosthetic rehabilitation {{depends largely on}} how the masticatory forces are transferred to the implants and surrounding bone. Anatomical conditions, bone morphology and aesthetics usually dictate implant placement in less than ideal positions for prosthetic rehabilitation and sometimes {{it is possible to}} find them with different inclinations. The purpose of this paper was to compare, through photoelastic analysis, the stress distribution in a fixed prosthesis with 3 parallel implants, to the stress distribution in the same prosthesis in the existence of an angled central implant. Two photoelastic resin models were made and a polariscope was used in the visualization of isochromatic fringes formed in the models when axial loads of 2 kg, 5 kg and 10 kg were applied to a unique central point of the prosthesis. The presence of inducted tensions (preloads) was observed in the models after applying torque to the <b>retention</b> <b>screws.</b> Preloads were intensified with the incidence of occlusal forces. In the parallel implants, the force dissipation followed the long axis. The angled implant had a smaller quantity of fringes and the stresses were located mostly around the apical region of the lateral implants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} implantoplasty on different bone insertion levels of exposed implants. A model of the Bone Level Tapered implant (Straumann Institute, Waldenburg, Switzerland) was created through the Rhinoceros software (version 5. 0 SR 8, McNeel North America, Seattle, WA, USA). The abutment was fixed to the implant through a <b>retention</b> <b>screw</b> and a monolithic crown was modeled over a cementation line. Six models were created with increasing portions of the implant threads exposed: C 1 (1 mm), C 2 (2 mm), C 3 (3 mm), C 4 (4 mm), C 5 (5 mm) and C 6 (6 mm). The models were made in duplicates and one of each pair was used to simulate implantoplasty, by removing the threads (I 1, I 2, I 3, I 4, I 5 and I 6). The final geometry was exported in STEP format to ANSYS (ANSYS 15. 0, ANSYS Inc., Houston, USA) and all materials were considered homogeneous, isotropic and linearly elastic. To assess distribution of stress forces, an axial load (300 N) was applied on the cusp. For the periodontal insert, the strains increased in the peri-implant region according {{to the size of}} the exposed portion and independent of the threads’ presence. The difference between groups with and without implantoplasty was less than 10 %. Critical values were found when the inserted portion was smaller than the exposed portion. In the exposed implants, the stress generated on the implant and <b>retention</b> <b>screw</b> was higher in the models that received implantoplasty. For the bone tissue, exposure of the implant’s thread was a damaging factor, independent of implantoplasty. Implantoplasty treatment can be safely used to control peri-implantitis if at least half of the implant is still inserted in bone...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of the implants inclination on the accuracy of the working cast obtained by two different pouring techniques. A metallic matrix containing two implants, positioned at 90 and 65 degrees in relation to the alveolar ridge, was submitted to the direct transfer impression technique. In CP group (conventional pouring - n= 10), the impressions were poured with dental stone type IV using the conventional technique. In EP group (experimental pouring - n= 10), the analogs were embraced with latex tubes before the first pouring. After sixty minutes, these tubes were removed and the space was filled with the dental stone. The metallic matrix (control group) and the replicas were evaluated regarding the implant/analog inclination and the vertical misfit between a framework and the implants/analogs. The data were tabulated and analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test at the 0. 05 level of significance. Regarding the analog inclination, both experimental groups differed statistically (p< 0. 05) from the control group only in relation to the leaning analogs. Results demonstrated significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the control group and the experimental groups when the reading of the vertical misfit was accomplished in the perpendicular implant/analog with the <b>retention</b> <b>screw</b> in the leaning implant/analog and between the control group and the EP group in the opposite situation.

30|$|Equal {{number of}} {{comparator}} implants (size 3.5  mm[*]×[*] 8  mm) were {{inserted in the}} other tibia/femur head of the animals after doing the osteotomy according to the manufacturer’s protocol as follows. After mobilizing the mucoperiosteal flap, the 3 -mm center punch was used to register a guide for the twist drill. The twist drill was used to establish the axial alignment of the implant and {{to assist in the}} guidance of the depth drill. The depth drills were sequentially used to create osteotomy to the subcrestal axial depth of 0.5  mm. The conical reamer was used to develop the conical shape of the implant body and to check the osteotomy depth. A counter-clockwise rotation was used to compress the bone in soft bone. The tap or thread cutter was used for dense bone to create the threads in the osteotomy. The thread cutter’s diameter corresponds to the implant diameter. To engage the implant into the implant placement tool, the square faces on the implant fixture mount were aligned with those on the implant placement tool, then pushed together. Using the handle (finger wheel), the implant was pulled out of inner vial and the plastic collar was discarded. The implant placement assembly was transferred to the osteotomy and the implant was secured into the osteotomy site. The implant placement was started with the handle and finally placed using the hand-ratchet. If excessive force was experienced, the osteotomy was rinsed out and the depth was checked by retapping. To disengage fixture mount from implant, the open-ended spanner was used to break the retention force of the fixture mount <b>retention</b> <b>screw.</b> The knurled top of the implant placement tool was turned by hand to fully disengage the fixture mount with the implant. Pushing down on the knurled top of the implant placement tool disengaged the fixture mount.|$|E

Methods: Fifty three patients, of whom 26 were women and 27 men, aged between 25 and 82 years. Results: With partial (54. 43 %) and total (45. 57 %) implant-supported dentures, of the Cone Morse, external and internal hexagon types (Neodent®, Curitiba, Brazil), totaling 237 fixations, were analyzed. The resin cements used were Panavia® (21. 94 %), EnForce® (58. 23 %) and Rely X® (19. 83 %) and the components were used {{in accordance with the}} Laboratory Immediate Loading - Neodent® sequence. The period of time of denture use ranged between 1 and 5 years. The results reported that 5 (2. 1 %) cylinders were loosened from metal structure (both belonging to Rely X group), 2 (0. 48 %) implants were lost after the first year of use, 16 (6. 75 %) denture <b>retention</b> <b>screws</b> wereloosened and 31 (13. 08 %) abutment screws were unloosened. Conclusion: The reasons for these failures probably are: metal structure internal retention failure, occlusal pattern, cementation technique and loading conditions.

40|$|When a {{cylinder}} {{is connected to}} an abutment {{it is expected that}} abutment and cylinder will be subjected to compression forces throughout their periphery because of the clamping force exerted by the screw. The deformation resultant of this compression should be measurable and uniform along the periphery of the abutment. Considering that multiple retainers connected to each other can affect the fit of a framework, as well as the use of different alloys, it is expected that the abutments will present different levels of deformation as a result of framework connection. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the deformation of implant abutments after frameworks, cast either in cobalt-chromium (CoCr) or silver-palladium (AgPd) alloys, were connected. Samples (n = 5) simulating a typical mandibular cantilevered implant-supported prosthesis framework were fabricated in cobalt-chromium and silver-palladium alloys and screwed onto standard abutments positioned on a master-cast containing 5 implant replicas. Two linear strain gauges were fixed on the mesial and distal aspects of each abutment to capture deformation as the <b>retention</b> <b>screws</b> were tightened. A combination of compressive and tensile forces was observed on the abutments for both CoCr and AgPd frameworks. There was no evidence of significant differences in median abutment deformation levels for 9 of the 10 abutment aspects. Visually well-fit frameworks do not necessarily transmit load uniformly to abutments. The use of CoCr alloy for implant-supported prostheses frameworks may be as clinically acceptable as AgPd alloy.

40|$|Introduction: Passive fit {{has been}} {{considered}} an important requirement for the longevity of implant-supported prostheses. Among the different steps of prostheses construction, casting is a feature that can influence the precision of fit and consequently the uniformity of possible deformation among abutments upon the framework connection. Purpose: This study aimed at evaluating the deformation of abutments after the connection of frameworks either cast in one piece or after soldering. Materials and Methods: A master model was used to simulate a human mandible with 5 implants. Ten frameworks were fabricated on cast models and divided into 2 groups. Strain gauges were attached to the mesial and distal sides of the abutments to capture their deformation after the framework’s <b>screw</b> <b>retentions</b> were tightened to the abutments. Results: The mean values of deformation were submitted to a 3 -way analysis of variance that revealed significant differences between procedures and the abutment side. The results showed {{that none of the}} frameworks presented a complete passive fit. Conclusion: The soldering procedure led to a better although uneven distribution of compression strains on the abutments. FAPESP # 01 / 025751 -...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE To {{identify}} {{the influence of}} fixed prosthesis type on biologic and technical complication rates {{in the context of}} <b>screw</b> versus cement <b>retention.</b> Furthermore, a multivariate analysis was conducted to determine which factors, when considered together, influence the complication and failure rates of fixed implant-supported prostheses. MATERIALS AND METHODS Electronic searches of MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were conducted. Selected inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to limit the search. Data were analyzed statistically with simple and multivariate random-effects Poisson regressions. RESULTS Seventy-three articles qualified for inclusion in the study. Screw-retained prostheses showed a tendency toward and significantly more technical complications than cemented prostheses with single crowns and fixed partial prostheses, respectively. Resin chipping and ceramic veneer chipping had high mean event rates, at 10. 04 and 8. 95 per 100 years, respectively, for full-arch screwed prostheses. For "all fixed prostheses" (prosthesis type not reported or not known), significantly fewer biologic and technical complications were seen with <b>screw</b> <b>retention.</b> Multivariate analysis revealed a significantly greater incidence of technical complications with cemented prostheses. Full-arch prostheses, cantilevered prostheses, and "all fixed prostheses" had significantly higher complication rates than single crowns. A significantly greater incidence of technical and biologic complications was seen with cemented prostheses. CONCLUSION Screw-retained fixed partial prostheses demonstrated a significantly higher rate of technical complications and screw-retained full-arch prostheses demonstrated a notably high rate of veneer chipping. When "all fixed prostheses" were considered, significantly higher rates of technical and biologic complications were seen for cement-retained prostheses. Multivariate Poisson regression analysis failed to show a significant difference between screw- and cement-retained prostheses with respect to the incidence of failure but demonstrated a higher rate of technical and biologic complications for cement-retained prostheses.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{marginal}} fit of crowns on the Straumann (ITI) ® Dental Implant System with special consideration of different casting dental materials. Material and methods: Sixty porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns were fabricated: 18 crowns on standard cone abutments with an impression cylinder, partially prefabricated analogs, no coping and screw-retained (A); 18 crowns on solid abutments without an impression device, no analogs, no coping and cemented (B); and 18 crowns on solid abutments using an impression transfer cap, an analog with a shoulder, no coping and cemented (C). In each group, six crowns were made on epoxy mastercasts (Bluestar®), six on synthetic plaster (Moldasynt ®) and six on super hard stone (Fujirock®). Six additional crowns were fabricated with the transversal <b>screw</b> <b>retention</b> system onto the Octa® system with impression transfer caps, metal analogs, gold copings and screw-retained (D). Impregum® was used as impression material. Crowns of B and C were cemented with KetacCem ®. Crowns of A and D were fixed with an occlusal screw torqued at 15 N cm. Crowns were embedded, cut and polished. Under a light microscope using a magnification of × 100, the distance between the crown margin (CM) and the shoulder (marginal gap, MG) and the distance between the CM and the end of the shoulder (crown length, CL) was measured. Results: MGs were 15. 4 ± 13. 2 μm (A), 21. 2 ± 23. 1 μm (B), 11 ± 12. 1 μm (C) and 10. 4 ± 9. 3 μm (D). No statistically significantly differences using either of the casting materials were observed. CLs were - 21. 3 ± 24. 8 μm (A), 3 ± 28. 9 μm (B), 0. 5 ± 22 μm (C) and 0. 1 ± 15. 8 μm (D). Crowns were shorter on synthetic casting materials compared with stone casts (P< 0. 005).

40|$|The use of osseointegrated {{titanium}} implants {{has become}} a widely accepted method to obtain retention for prosthetic reconstructions of partially dentate and edentulous patients. A range of c 1 inical long-term {{studies have been conducted}} to collect information on the numbers of surviving and/or successful implants for different implant systems. Overall implant success rates for several implant systems have thus repeatedly been reported to be as high as 95 % over 5 years and 90 % over 10 years (Adell et al. 1981; Babbush et al. 1986; Albrektsson et al. 1988; Jemt et al. 1989; Adell et al. 1990; van Steenberghe et al. 1990; Henry et al. 1992; Mericske-Stern et al. 1994; Buser et al. 1997). A review of the above mentioned studies show that there are both common and system specific technical and biological complications and failures in implant prosthodontics. In the technical sector, a common observation has been that for almost all implant systems rigid connections between implants as well as between implants and teeth {{have turned out to be}} more favourable than non-rigid such connections. For the great majority of modern implant systems, rigid connections also seem to be associated with similar technical risk levels. The group of associated background factors inc 1 ude e. g. design features such as the extensions and dimensions of the restorations and patient specific factors such as bruxism (Aeschlimann et al. 1998; Brägger et al. 2001). Bruxing patients are at increased risk for complications in all restorative procedures. However, bruxism per se is not an absolute contraindication for dental implant therapy. Preventive measures such as the use of a habit appliance and protective nightguard should be considered. Certain specific material characteristics have also been noted. Especially over longer periods of time it has thus been reported that ceramic implants seem to be associated with high frequencies of severe mechanical complications such as fractures (Lill et al 1993). As has recently been pointed out by Brägger et al. (2001) in addition to common complications a range of system specific ones can also frequently be observed. Screw retained implant systems are thus associated with a higher frequency of loss of retention than cemented ones, although this may be balanced by possible lower frequencies for other types of technical failures. The cemented approach has the potential for being more passive than <b>screw</b> <b>retention.</b> Solid scientific and evidence-based data are missing within this field of dentistry (Nilner & Lundgren 1999). The question of whether a poorly fitting prosthesis can cause failure of osseointegrated dental implants has not been answered (Carr et al. 1996). Mollersten et al. (1997) experimentally evaluated how different joint designs influence the strength and the failure mode of dental implant systems. The strength tests focussed on the system as a whole (implant and connected abutments). Seven implant systems with different joint design were evaluated. Strength and failure mode varied significantly between the implant systems. Deep intemal joints, in contrast to shallow internal joints, favoured resistance to bending moments. A deep joint is one in which the screw takes little load and provides intimate contact with the implant walls to resist micromovement, resulting in a strong stable interface. Thus Mollersten et al. (1997) c 1 early demonstrated the strength advantage of an internal connection. They conc 1 uded that joint depth should be taken into consideration in construction of implant systems. Biological complications in the form of soft tissue reactions (periimplantitis) have been reported comparatively frequently in the field of implant prosthodontics, hut at present it is not certain if there exist any system specific risks (Wennström & Palmer 1999) ...|$|R
