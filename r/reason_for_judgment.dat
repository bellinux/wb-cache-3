40|$|The thesis {{questions}} {{the ways in}} which architecture might embody the notion of modernity in different cultures and regions yet achieve appropriateness relative to place. In the early twentieth century in the industrialized world, the issue of modernity in architecture was identified with the notions of abstraction and rationalization that colored the development of the modern movement. The second generation of the modern movement queried the roles of human experiences and urban and architectural contexts in architectural design. With the spread of the modern movement {{to the rest of the}} world, the issue of context in architecture grew stronger. Following this line of thought, this dissertation examines the tension between modernist abstractionism and urban and architectural contexts in place in which the presence and the role of local knowledge and traditions in architecture remained influential. It investigates modernity in architecture through a specific Asian reading and through an analysis of the work of Geoffrey Bawa of Sri Lanka. Selected works of Geoffrey Bawa are chosen because the significance of his oeuvre is often contested by interpreters who see it as reflecting various contemporary approaches, including regionalism and vernacularism. Thus, in an effort to refute such simplistic explanations of his work, this thesis examines selected works of Bawa, analyzing their spatial organization, formal arrangement, materials, techniques, and building details. In particular, it attempts to highlight {{the ways in which}} Bawa articulated the notions of experience and memory in his architecture. These analyses are then placed within the framework of the social and cultural situations that his architecture confronted in Sri Lanka. It is within this framework that we might determine the ways in which modernity and locality were embodied in Bawa's work. Interpretations of his work take into account the understanding of modernity as a cultural practice and an attitude. Modernity as an attitude relates to a specific modernist subject who is able to use <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>judgment</b> in addressing context. In this dissertation, a reading on the work of Walter Benjamin on modernity, the pasts, and traditions frames this understanding of this modernist subjectivity. In architecture, modernity as an attitude means that is not a style but a way of thinking and formulating design intent. This inquiry is then used as a framework within which this dissertation will interpret the relationship between modernity and local identity. The conclusions of the dissertation contribute to an understanding of the achievement of modernity in architecture in tight relationship to context. On a more focused level, it also hopes to contribute to an appreciation of the extant works of Geoffrey Bawa, which the author of this dissertation deems exemplary of what modern architecture might achieve in Asia.

However, the Court also noted that the exercise of providing <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>judgment</b> is contextual and the standard of what is acceptable <b>for</b> a <b>judgment</b> will vary depending on the circumstances. The court appears to propose that the ultimate requirement is the court explaining, in some way, why it has made the decision in question.|$|R

[...] Determining whether <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>judgment</b> are adequate is a contextual exercise that may call for different information or depth of reasoning based on the circumstances of the case. In general, Canadian courts are expected to provide <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>judgment</b> as a duty to the public at large, to demonstrate that the judge or judges have engaged with the parties' pleadings, to explain why the parties won or lost, and to allow for meaningful appellate review (in the event that the case may be appealed).|$|R

5000|$|In legal usage, {{the court}} noted, the word [...] "judgment" [...] {{has at least}} two meanings: a general meaning and a {{technical}} meaning.

40|$|This redaction-critical study {{interprets the}} <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>judgment</b> in Amos 2. 6 - 16 in the {{literary}} context {{of each of the}} redactional compositions which, I argue, underlie the Amos-text. It is proposed that the Amos-text is both a theological work and a tractate of social criticism. In the earlier redactional compositions the dominant <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>judgment</b> concern mistreatment of the weak. In the later redactional compositions these are overshadowed, in terms of length of text, by more theological <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> judgment; however, these strengthen, rather than weaken, the force of the older <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>judgment.</b> After an introductory first chapter, Chapter 2 describes and defends the methodology employed, and establishes the terminology of “composition” and “redactional composition”. Chapter 3 makes proposals concerning the compositional history of the Amos-text, attributing each unit to one of four redactional compositions. This chapter builds on the significant works of Hans W Wolff and Jörg Jeremias, following one or both of them at many points. Chapter 4 then describes the structural, linguistic and thematic coherence of each redactional composition in order to confirm the likelihood of its existence, and to note perspectives or significant themes relevant to the interpretation of the whole composition, including 2. 6 - 16. Chapter 5 addresses two issues pertinent to the interpretation of Amos 2. 6 - 16. Firstly, the relationship of Amos 2. 8 to verses in the so-called Book of the Covenant is explored in the light of current scholarly views concerning its dating; its relationship to verses in Deuteronomy 24 is also considered. Secondly, the question of whether 2. 10 - 12 exhibits Deuteronomistic influence is examined. Chapter 6 then conducts an exegesis of Amos 2. 6 - 16 in each of the redactional compositions underlying the Amos-text, with particular attention paid to the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>judgment.</b> The final chapter summarises the argument, draws conclusions, and notes possible areas of future study...|$|R
