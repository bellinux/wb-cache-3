40|$|Fractures of the tibia and femoral {{diaphysis}} {{are commonly}} repaired by intra-medullary (IM) nailing. Currently IM nails {{are available in}} either electropolished stainless steel (SS) or in Titanium-Aluminium-Niobium (TAN). After healing, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the nails still is common but <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> TAN IM nails often has complications whereas SS IM nails of the same design are less often associated with problems. We believe the differences in removal are due {{to the ability of}} TAN to promote strong bone on-growth. We have previously shown in vivo that polishing cortical screws reduces removal torque and the percentage of bone-implant contact. Therefore, we postulate that bony on-growth onto IM nails can be reduced by means of surface polishing, for ease <b>of</b> <b>removal.</b>  Here we aim to compare the pull-out forces for <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> TAN (TAN-S) compared to experimental paste polished TAN (TAN-PP) IM nails from a bilateral non-fracture sheep tibia model after 12 months implantation. Histological analysis was also performed to assess tissue on-growth to the nails. We show that polishing significantly reduces (p= 0. 05) the extraction force required for TAN IM nail removal. This effect in part is attributable to the distinct tissue-material reaction produced. For TAN-S nails direct bone contact was observed while for TAN-PP nails a fibrous tissue interface was noted. Since TAN is preferred over SS for IM nailing due to superior biocompatibility and mechanical properties, we believe these findings could be used to recommend changes to current surface technologies of intramedullary nails to reduce complications seen with nail removal especially in rapidly growing bone in children...|$|R

This study was aimed to examine Synthesis and the antibacterial effect of NanoPolyamidoamine-G 7 (NPAMAM-G 7) dendrimer on Escherichia Coli, Proteus Mirabilis, Salmonella Typhi, Bacillus Subtilis and Staphylococcus Aureus. Methods: In this experimental study that has been conducted in June 2015 in the Laboratory of Microbiology, Iran University of Medical Science, NPAMAM-G 7 dendrimers was synthesized by Tomalia’s divergent growth approach. The antibacterial effects of NPAMAM-G 7 dendrimer were studied by disc diffusion and micro-dilution method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. Standard discs were prepared using different concentrations of dendrimer on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. Results: Zone of inhibition in concentration 25 μg/ml of NPAMAM-G 7 dendrimers for Escherichia Coli, Proteus Mirabilis, Salmonella Typhi, Bacillus Subtilis and Staphylococcus Aureus were 26, 38, 36, 22 and 25 mm, respectively. Regarding the zone of inhibition in gram negative bacteria with gram positive ones was P= 0. 16 and was not significant difference. The MIC for Salmonella Typhi was 0. 025, for Proteus Mirabilis, Bacillus Subtilis, Staphylococcus Aureus and Escherichia Coli was 0. 25 μg/ml. The MBC for Salmonella Typhi was 25 μg/ml, for Proteus Mirabilis and Bacillus Subtilis was 50 μg/ml and for Escherichia Coli and Staphylococcus Aureus was 100 μg/ml.

Field strength was assessed in the tumor regions before and after virtual <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> bone areas of varying shape and size (10 to 100 mm) immediately above the tumor.

For the superficial tumor, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> a <b>standard</b> craniotomy bone flap increased the electrical field strength by 60 - 70 % in the tumor.

Median field strengths in tumor tissue increased with increasing craniectomy diameter up to 50 - 70 mm. Multiple smaller burr holes were more efficient than single craniectomies of equivalent area. Craniectomy caused no significant field enhancement in the deeply seated tumor, but rather a focal enhancement in the brain tissue underlying the skull defect.
