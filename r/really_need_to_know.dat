But it's more complicated than that, especially as you see Mýa and her girls engaged in their own energetic calisthenics, then (apparently) commanding their male admirers to hit the ground and perform push-ups, constructing a kind of reciprocal relationship that, for instance, Christina Aguilera's video for [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] cannot do, in its celebration of the most excellent boyfriend {{whose job is to}} be endlessly appreciative of his girlfriend's super-gloriousness (see also, Christina's video for Genie in a Bottle," [...] in which she also dances seductively with a group of girls for a group of boys). Director Diane Martel has done her share of conventionally alluring Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera videos, but here the terms have shifted. Mýa and her girls—in moves recalling Janet's—don't pretend to be charming or enticing. Instead, they present themselves as young women with demands and desires, proudly hard-bodied and self-possessed.Mýa can rock the midriff tops like any other pop star, but as always, she remains slightly offbeat, neither apologetic nor solicitous. Sexy and self-assured without being coy, she knows who she is and what she wants, and says it outright: [...] "What'cha gonna do / When you can't say no / And your feelings start to show? / Boy I <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> / And how you gonna act?" [...] In Mýa's world, it's not the girl who turns emotional and unsure of herself when a question of integrity arises, but the more fragile, less stable boy. She warns,"There's no need to / Reminisce about the past, / Obviously, 'cause that shit did not last." [...] The video's imagery underlines her admonition, as the camera shoots up at her looking unafraid and austere, backed by her crew as the dust flies from their work-out: [...] "She don't know me / She's about to know me / I'm in your life / That's how it's gon' be." [...] And if you want to mess around, you're free to choose, but it will cost: [...] "If you want her back / You can take her back. / Cause game recognize game. / I could do the same thing." [...] And she does. At the end of the [...] video, Mýa and her dancers exit, leaving their audience dusty and on their own.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} drawback of {{this technique}} is that the depth of field is extremely short, requiring many ‘cuts’ on a given specimen to detect very small particles or filaments.

In a Fall 2000 opinion piece in the Mathematical Intelligencer [1] I made the assertion that the underlying principle behind the second law of thermodynam-ics is that natural forces do not do extremely improbable things.

40|$|Background : Jazan {{province}} {{is located}} in the south-west of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The province is offlicted with a wide spectrum of diseases and therefore have a special need for more health services. The Faculty of Medicine at Jazan has been following the traditional curriculum since its inception in 2001. The traditional curriculum has been criticized because of the students inability to relate what they learned in the basic sciences to medicine, thus stifling their motivation. It was felt that much of what was presented in preclinical courses was irrelevant to what the doctor <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> for his practice. The College therefore, decided to change to an integrated curriculum. Design: The study was conducted in 2004 - 2005 in the Faculty of Medicine, Jazan University. It began with a literature survey/search for relevant information and a series of meetings with experts from various institutions. A Curriculum Committee was formed and a set of guiding principles was prepared to help develop the new curriculum. A standard curriculum writing format was adopted for each module. It was decided that an independent evaluation of the new curriculum was to be done by experts in medical education before submission for official approval. There were several difficulties in the course of designing the curriculum, such as: provision of vertical integration, the lack of preparedness of faculty to teach an integrated curriculum, and difficulties inherent in setting a truly integrated examination. Curriculum: The program designed is for 6 years and in 3 phases; pre-med (year 1), organ/system (years 2 and 3), and clinical clerkship (years 4, 5, and 6). This is to be followed by a year of Internship. The pre-med phase aims at improving the students′ English language and prepare them for the succeeding phases. The organ/ system phase includes the integrated systems and the introductory modules. The curriculum includes elective modules, early clinical training, behavioral sciences, medical ethics, biostatistics, computer practice, and research methods. The curriculum provides active methods of instruction that include: small group discussion/ tutorials, problem-based learning (PBL), case-study/ clinical presentations, seminars, skills practice (clinical skill lab), practical, demonstration, and student independent learning. Methods of evaluating students include continuous and summative assessment. Conclusion: The new curriculum adopted by the Jazan Faculty of Medicine is an integrated, organ/ system based, community-oriented, with early clinical skills, elective modules, and innovative methods of instructions...|$|R

Solomon also founded and coordinated UCSC’s prestigious Summer Dance Theater Institute from 1972 until 1980. In 1953 Solomon entered Bard College’s dance program, where Jean Erdman became her teacher and major mentor. While still at Bard, she joined the Jean Erdman Dance Theater and danced with Erdman’s company until 1970. Erdman was ultimately to recommend Solomon as the right person to found a new dance program at UC Santa Cruz. At Bard College, Ruth met her future husband, John Solomon. She worked with many well-known composers such as John Cage and Lou Harrison. Her oral history captures the milieu of the dance world in New York City in the mid-twentieth century. In 1960, Ruth and John married; John joined the army and the pair moved to Puerto Rico, where Ruth started a dance program on the military bases on the island. After a couple of years they moved to Hawaii, where Ruth began a dance program at East-West Center in Hawaii and formed a dance company. In 1967, Solomon and Jean Erdman established a dance program at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts (then called the School of the Arts), where Solomon served as assistant director until she was recruited by UC Santa Cruz in 1970.  In about 1980, Solomon widened her interests to include dance medicine. “I <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what we were doing in class that could cause the damage we were seeing. Why were dancers having hip replacements? Why did they have knee problems? Why did they have back problems?” Solomon reflected. Since that time, Solomon has completed annual three-month “residencies” under the direction of Dr. Lyle Micheli at the Division of Sports Medicine, Harvard Medical Center, Boston. She tenaciously attended night school at Cabrillo College after a full day of teaching dance at UCSC, and became a certified medical assistant. After her retirement from UCSC, dance medicine grew into a major focus of her career, although she continued to choreograph productions in a diversity of locations.     Ruth and John edit the Journal of Dance Medicine and Science and she has served {{on the board of the}} International Association of Dance Medicine and Science since its inception. She conducts dance medicine studies utilizing the dancers of the Boston Ballet as participants, teaches workshops in dance technique and injury prevention, and produced a popular video on the subject. In 2010 she was named Honorary Fellow of the Division of Sports Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical Center. Solomon has also published broadly.

It also provides some ideas on methodological strategies {{that can be used in}} the classroom with the use of ICT. To achieve the main objectives of this work, a questionnaire was used to conduct the research from a descriptive point of view, field work, through a qualitative approach. The interpretive/qualitative paradigm, also called phenomenological, naturalist, humanist or ethnographic, was used since it focuses on understanding and interpreting people`s reality, meanings and intention in order to build knowledge. The study takes place in a real context and a questionnaire was applied to 21 ELCL language teachers. The findings revealed that language teachers incorporate technological tools in a few activities in their classrooms; they do not take advantage of their applicability in all class activities. Besides, they <b>really</b> <b>need</b> more training <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> learn, and incorporate these tools in their curriculum, so they will develop an effective teaching and an active learning. This directed researchers to provide a list of recommendations about teaching techniques that will help language teachers improve their skills and incorporate these tools into their teaching strategies.

Además, aporta algunas ideas sobre estrategias metodológicas que se pueden utilizar en el salón de clase con el uso de TIC. Se realizó una investigación descriptiva, de campo, con un enfoque cualitativo. Se recurrió al paradigma cualitativo interpretativo, también llamado fenomenológico, naturalista, humanista o etnográfico, porque se centra en comprender e interpretar la realidad, los significados y las intenciones de las personas, con el fin de construir conocimiento. El estudio se lleva a cabo en un contexto real; se utilizó un cuestionario que fue aplicado a 21 profesores de lengua de la ELCL. Los resultados obtenidos evidenciaron el poco uso de estas herramientas tecnológicas por parte de los docentes en sus salones de clase. Además, se mostró la necesidad de una mayor capacitación para conocer, aprender e incorporar estas herramientas en el currículo, lo cual permite que se desarrolle un proceso de enseñanza y aprendizaje activo y efectivo.
