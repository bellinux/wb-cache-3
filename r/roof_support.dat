25|$|The Greyhounds won {{the first}} game on May 11 in Shawinigan versus the home team, by a score 4-3, in front of 3,276 fans. Televising games from the Aréna Jacques Plante in Shawinigan proved {{difficult}} due to <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> pillars around the ice surface. After two games in Shawinigan, {{the remainder of the}} tournament was played in the Centre Marcel Dionne in Drummondville, Quebec.|$|E
2500|$|The stope, {{which is}} the {{workshop}} of the mine, is the excavation from which the ore is extracted. Two methods of stope mining are commonly used. In the [...] "cut and fill" [...] or open stoping method, the space remaining following removal of ore after blasting is filled with waste rock and cement. In the [...] "shrinkage" [...] method, only sufficient broken ore is removed via the chutes below to allow miners working {{from the top of}} the pile to drill and blast the next layer to be broken off, eventually leaving a large hole. Another method, known as room and pillar, is used for thinner, flatter ore bodies. In this method the ore body is first divided into blocks by intersecting drives, removing ore while so doing, and then systematically removing the blocks, leaving enough ore for <b>roof</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern pillar {{sections}} use remote-controlled equipment, including large hydraulic mobile roof-supports, {{which can}} prevent cave-ins until the miners and their equipment {{have left a}} work area. The mobile <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> are similar to a large dining-room table, but with hydraulic jacks for legs. After the large pillars of coal have been mined away, the mobile <b>roof</b> <b>support's</b> legs shorten and it is withdrawn to a safe area. The mine roof typically collapses once the mobile <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> leave an area.|$|R

2500|$|The hangar was {{supplied}} as a kit {{of parts}} that could be easily erected, dismantled, transported and re-erected at another location. [...] The principal material of the framework was wood, joined by wooden plates, steel brackets, and steel bolts. [...] Vertical stanchions supported roof trusses, with extensively triangulated ties and beams. [...] Bays (units) of stanchions and trusses were built up and connected to each other, with each hangar assembled with six, nine, or twelve bays to achieve different hangar lengths. [...] Wooden flying buttresses were applied to the sides and rear, to ensure rigidity, and ropes were used to tie down the whole structure onto steel pickets driven into the ground. [...] Snow poles were attached to the underside of selected trusses, and hinged {{to allow them to}} be lowered for extra <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> in the event of heavy snow or high winds. [...] The tailored canvas covering was tied to the framework with ropes.|$|E
2500|$|The Black Swan {{served as}} the festival's third theatre from 1977 to 2001. The building, {{originally}} an automobile dealership, was bought in 1969 as a second-floor scene shop and first-floor rehearsal hall. Company members began using it to stage [...] "midnight" [...] readings for one another. They invited friends who brought other friends. Artistic Director Jerry Turner recognized {{the opportunity to take}} risks with unconventional staging and subjects, and called for its development as a third OSF theatre. Fitting a theatre into the existing building was challenging. It could hold only 138 seats, all within five rows of the stage. There had to be, as designer Richard Hay put it, a [...] "certain amount of tucking and squeezing." [...] Each director had {{to solve the problem of}} an immovable <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> in the middle of the stage. In one scene, with a horizontal piece added, it became a painting of a crucifixion. [...] The theatre reverted to its earlier roles in 2002 when it was replaced by the New Theater, now renamed the Thomas Theatre. [...] Among those roles are rehearsal space, meeting and audition rooms, classes, and since 2011 as a home for the Black Swan Lab (see above).|$|E
