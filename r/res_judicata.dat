They had two sons, one of whom, Frankie (1889-1935) was later a journalist and critic and associated with the Bloomsbury Group. Birrell found success as a writer {{with the publication of}} a volume of essays entitled Obiter Dicta in 1884. This was followed by a second series of Obiter Dicta in 1887 and <b>Res</b> <b>Judicatae</b> in 1892. These, despite their titles, were not concerned with law, but he also wrote books on copyright and on trusts.

5000|$|In the U.S. People v Huey Newton (1970) 8 CA3d 359 {{holds that}} unconsciousness, when not {{self-induced}} say, as by voluntary intoxication, {{is a complete}} defence to a criminal act even though the defendant's acts seem very goal-oriented. The medical evidence was that [...] "a gunshot wound which penetrates in a body cavity, the abdominal cavity or the thoracic cavity is very likely to produce a profound reflex shock reaction, that {{is quite different from}} a gunshot wound which penetrates only skin and muscle and {{it is not at all}} uncommon for a person shot in the abdomen to lose consciousness and go into this reflex shock condition for short periods of time up to half an hour or so." [...] But the reflexive activity or unconsciousness need not cause physical collapse: it can exist where the subject physically acts in fact, but is not at the time conscious of acting (cf some European continental jurisdictions classify conduct resulting from automatism under the rubric of unconsciousness). In R. v. Cogdon (1950) unreported but noted in Morris, Somnambulistic Homicide: Ghosts, Spiders and North Koreans (1951) 5 <b>Res</b> <b>Judicatae</b> 29, the defendant struck her daughter on the head with an axe while sleepwalking and dreaming about North Koreans.

Lee, and other promoters of the covenants, sued to prevent Hansberry's family from {{living in the}} neighborhood. [...] This led to the Hansberry v. Lee, [...] case. Defendants argued that the stipulation made previously in Burke v. Kleiman that more than 95% of the owners had signed the covenant was false and the case should be reajudicated. Plaintiffs, while admitting to the fact, contended that the principle of <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> barred courts from rehearing the old arguments. The Illinois courts {{ruled in favor of}} plaintiffs. However the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People decided to represent the buyer in the United States Supreme Court. The case caught the attention of national real estate magazines and African American newspapers. The U. S. Supreme Court eventually reversed that ruling stating the application of <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> in this case would violate Fourteenth Amendment. [...] The play Raisin in the Sun was inspired by Lorraine Hansberry's time in the neighborhood after her father won the repeal of restrictive covenants.|$|E

2500|$|Coffin and Bownes {{were again}} on the panel, this time joined by Juan R. Torruella.

It had declared bankruptcy before the Supreme Court's certiorari grant, so at all times since then it was aware of the issue.|$|E
2500|$|Foster v. Chatman, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that the state law {{doctrine}} of <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> does not preclude a Batson challenge against peremptory challenges if new evidence has emerged. The Court held the state courts' Batson analysis was subject to federal jurisdiction because [...] "hen application of a state law bar 'depends on a federal constitutional ruling, the state-law prong of the court’s holding is not independent of federal law, and our jurisdiction is not precluded,'" [...] under Ake v. Oklahoma.|$|E
2500|$|The {{civil law}} use of issue {{estoppel}} or <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> (literally translated as [...] "the fact has been decided") is relatively uncontroversial. It expresses a general public interest {{that the same}} issue should not be litigated more than once even when the parties are different. The criminal law application, called double jeopardy provides that a person should not be tried twice for the same offence. A notable case occurred {{as a result of}} the Birmingham Six case where the House of Lords ruled in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police that issue estoppel applied. Lord Diplock said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Extinguishment can be {{accomplished}} through <b>res</b> <b>judicata.</b> [...] Extinguishment may also be effected through collateral estoppel following a final decision by a Court of Claims. Even before a final ICC judgement, if a tribe claims compensation {{on the theory that}} its lands were extinguished, it cannot later attempt to claim valid title to those lands. An ICC judgement acts as a bar to future claims, and an ICC payment conclusively establishes extinguishment (although, for timing purposes, the ICC has not jurisdiction to extinguish). Even though ICCA settlements are binding, the scope of the settlement may be up for debate. The United States is bound by prior determinations as well.|$|E
2500|$|The dispute took {{a public}} turn on February 7, 1604, when Willem Bastingius in his disputation De divina praedestinatione defended {{a number of}} Arminius's theses, Arminius himself presiding. This event led Gomarus to have Samuel Gruterus argue an {{opposite}} position to these theses on October 14, 1604, {{but not on the}} official schedule. Gomarus ascribed the positions he disliked to Calvin's adversary Sebastian Castellio and his follower, Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert. While Arminius pointed to the Bible to defend his positions, the Calvinist views set forth by [...] "the Genevan patriarchs gradually acquired the force of <b>Res</b> <b>judicata,</b> so that resistance against it was no longer tolerated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williamson County's [...] "state procedures" [...] {{ripeness}} requirement {{has proven}} to be highly controversial. It has been complained that the Court decided this question without adequate briefing, the requirement of pursuing compensation from the state is not logically inherent in the text of the Fifth Amendment, the rule derives from procedural due process considerations that are inapplicable to takings claims, and that principles of <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> and collateral estoppel may bar a plaintiff's claim from federal court after complying with Williamson County's procedures to [...] "ripen" [...] the claim. The latter problem became known as the [...] "Williamson Trap" [...] among attorneys for aggrieved property owners, although it was defended as a straightforward application of principles of preclusion by government advocates. However, in an earlier landmark takings case, Euclid v. Ambler (1926), the Court held it unnecessary to seek a local permit before challenging a land-use regulation as unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{this new}} evidence, {{the state court}} {{rejected}} Foster's habeas petition stating that the new evidence did not present [...] "purposeful discrimination" [...] and so did not provide sufficient reason to go against the doctrine of <b>res</b> <b>judicata.</b> The Georgia Supreme Court denied a [...] "Certificate of Probable Cause" [...] necessary, under state law, to appeal the habeas decision, determining that the case had no [...] "arguable merit" [...] The Georgia Supreme Court's decision in its entirety said: [...] "Upon the consideration of the Application for Certificate of Probable Cause to appeal the denial of habeas corpus, it is ordered that it be hereby denied. All the Justices concur, except Benham, J., who dissents." [...] Since the petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court was appealing the Georgia Supreme Court's order, {{it was unclear whether}} the order [...] "rests on an adequate and independent state law ground," [...] which would preclude the U.S. Supreme Court's jurisdiction over Foster's federal claim.|$|E
2500|$|... "We are unpersuaded by Soler's argument," [...] Coffin responded, [...] "and {{view this}} {{latest round of}} {{litigation}} as yet another episode in Soler's long series of misguided efforts to avoid arbitration with Mitsubishi at all costs." [...] The dealership had cited no legal basis for why {{it could not have}} added the bankruptcy to its record before the Supreme Court, and Coffin could not find anywhere in the record where it had brought it up. As for remand, while it was not uncommon for parties to raise new issues there, [...] "but Soler was content to remain silent and await a second bite at the apple before the bankruptcy court. Soler has offered no compelling argument to justify its silence {{at this stage of the}} proceedings, nor can we even conceive of one."

6000|$|Nov. 19, 1890.—Your appeal as to your {{meeting of}} to-morrow gives [...] matter for thought.

5000|$|United States v. Utah Construction & Mining Company, 384 U.S. 394 (1966), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that [...] "(w)hen an {{administrative}} agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate, the courts have not hesitated to apply <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> to enforce repose." [...] Utah Construction established a two-part test to determine whether <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> effect should be given to an administrative determination. First, the agency proceeding must be examined to determine whether the agency was [...] "acting in a judicial capacity" [...] and whether the parties had [...] "an adequate opportunity to litigate" [...] the issues before the agency. Second, the general rules of <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> must be applied to the case. Not all administrative adjudications, and not all judicial determinations, are entitled to <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> effect. For the principles of <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> to apply, administrative determinations, like court judgments, must be valid, final and on the merits.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} a second suit to be {{dismissed}} on a motion of <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> in a civilian jurisdiction, the trial must be identical to the first trial in the following manner: (1) identical parties, (2) identical theories of recovery, and (3) identical demands in both trials. In other words, the issue preclusion or collateral estoppel found in the common law doctrine of <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> is not present in the civilian doctrine. In addition if all else is equal between the two cases, minus the relief sought, {{there will be no}} dismissal based on <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> in a civil law jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>res</b> <b>judicata</b> {{is a method}} of preventing injustice to the parties of a case supposedly finished, but perhaps also or mostly a way of avoiding unnecessary waste of resources in the court system. <b>Res</b> <b>judicata</b> does not merely prevent future judgments from contradicting earlier ones, but also prevents litigants from multiplying judgments, and confusion.|$|E
