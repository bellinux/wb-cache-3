40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of various geometries of on ice edge was carried out. The analysis showed that high tensile stresses were generated at interior corners which would lead to tensile failure of the ice at those locations before compressive failure under the indentor. Suggestions were made on the positioning of a stress <b>relief</b> <b>slot</b> to encourage compressive failure of the ice under the indentor. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|A {{flat head}} and a tape {{transport}} arrangement impart a wrap angle to the tape at the upstream corner of the head. The wrap angle, corner sharpness and tape stiffness are sufficient to cause a moving tape to form a hollow bump at the upstream corner, thereby creating a hollow into which entrained air can expand, causing a subambient pressure within and downstream of the bump. This pressure keeps the tape {{in contact with the}} head. It is created without the need for a groove or complex pressure <b>relief</b> <b>slot(s).</b> No contact pressure arises at the signal exchange site due to media wrap. The highest contact pressures are developed at a wrapped upstream corner. For a tape drive, traveling in both forward and reverse, the wrap can be at both the upstream and downstream (which is the reverse upstream) corners. Heads that are not flat can also be used, if the wrap angle relative to a main surface is sufficient and not too large. The wrapped head can also be used with rotating media, such as disks (floppy and hard) and rotating heads, such as helical wound heads for video recording. Multiple flat tape bearing surfaces can be separated by grooves and/or angles. Each flat can carry heads along one or more gap lines. Multiple adjacent narrow tracks can thus be written for extreme high track density recording...|$|R
40|$|Serious floor heave in gob-side entry {{retaining}} (GER) with fully-mechanized gangue backfilling mining {{affects the}} transportation and ventilation {{safety of the}} mine. A theoretical mechanical model for the floor of gob-backfilled GER was established. The effects of the mechanical properties of floor strata, the granular compaction of backfilling area (BFA), the vertical support of roadside support body (RSB), and the stress concentration of the solid coal on the floor heave of the gob-backfilled GER were studied. The {{results show that the}} floor heave increases with the increase of the coal seam buried depth, and decreases with the increase of the floor rock elastic modulus. The development depth of the plastic zone decreases with the increase of the c and φ value of the floor rock, and increases with the increase of the stress concentration factor of the solid coal. The development depth of the plastic zone in the test mine reached 2. 68 m. The field test and monitoring results indicate that the comprehensive control scheme of adjusting backfilling pressure, deep grouting reinforcement, shallow opening stress <b>relief</b> <b>slots,</b> and surface pouring can effectively control the floor heave. The roof-floor displacement is reduced by 73. 8 % compared to that with the original support scheme. The roadway section meets the design and application requirements when the deformation stabilizes, demonstrating the rationality of the mechanical model. The research results overcome the technical bottleneck of floor heave control of fully-mechanized backfilling GER, providing a reliable basis for the design of a floor heave control scheme...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{data were}} {{obtained}} in two wind tunnels for 13 models over a Mach number range from 0. 70 to 1. 02. Effects of increasing test-section blockage ratio in the transonic region near a Mach number of 1. 0 included change {{in the shape of}} the drag curves, premature drag creep, delayed drag divergence, and a positive increment of pressures on the model afterbodies. Effects of wall interference were apparent in the data even for a change in blockage ratio from a very low 0. 000343 to an even lower 0. 000170. Therefore, models having values of blockage ratio of 0. 0003 - an order of magnitude below the previously considered safe value of 0. 0050 - had significant errors in the drag-coefficient values obtained at speeds near a Mach number of 1. 0. Furthermore, the flow <b>relief</b> afforded by <b>slots</b> or perforations in test-section walls - designed according to previously accepted criteria for interference-free subsonic flow - does not appear to be sufficient to avoid significant interference of the walls with the model flow field for Mach numbers very close to 1. 0.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the effects of volcanism, river incision, epeirogenic uplift, and {{faulting}} on the landscape evolution of the Grand Canyon region. In the first chapter the migration of increasingly asthenospheric basaltic volcanism is used to constrain lithospheric modification of the Colorado Plateau margins. Buoyancy modification of the upper mantle, driven by the upwelling, is a likely driver for recent uplift of the area. In the second chapter, correlation between oversteepened rivers and areas of high-velocity upper mantle is used to show that recent and ongoing mantle-driven uplift is modulating the surface along the western margin of the Colorado Plateau. Differential oversteepening of rivers in the Zion National Park area can’t be explained by climatic or bedrock-hardness differences and are best explained by localized uplift of the area, which explains the area’s high <b>relief</b> and dramatic <b>slot</b> canyons. In the third chapter, new geochronology and geochemistry are used to reconstruct the timing, sequence, and structure of Grand Canyon’s lava dams. Associated gravel deposits, internal cooling structures, and a general lack of lacustrine deposits suggests that the dams were removed in multiple stages and probably did not last {{for more than a few}} hundred to thousand years. Perched gravels under lava dams show steady incision rates indicating that the blockages were ephemeral and did not significantly affect long-term bedrock incision. In the final chapter, new Grand Canyon incision rates are used to quantify the spatial and temporal variations in incision. Results show temporally steady incision at any one location and a spatial pattern of increasing incision towards the east. This spatial pattern is most consistent with differential uplift of the area. Temporally steady incision suggests a lack of transient incision most consistent with sustained uplift. These studies suggest at the landscape of the region is young and actively being modified by deep forcing. Recent mantle-driven uplift associated with the convective modification of the lithosphere has steepened rivers and driven incision of deep canyons. Repeated lava damming of the Colorado River by comparison had a much smaller effect on the geomorphology or incision history of Grand Canyon.
