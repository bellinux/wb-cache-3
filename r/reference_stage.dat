40|$|AbstractThe Mirror System Hypothesis (MSH) and {{investigations}} of birdsong are reviewed {{in relation to}} the significance for the development of human symbolic and language capacity, in terms of three fundamental forms of cognitive reference: iconic, indexical, and symbolic. Mirror systems are initially iconic but can progress to indexal reference when produced without the need for concurrent stimuli. Developmental stages in birdsong are also explored with reference to juvenile subsong vs complex stereotyped adult syllables, as an analogy with human language development. While birdsong remains at an indexal <b>reference</b> <b>stage,</b> human language benefits from the capacity for symbolic reference. During a pre-linguistic ‘babbling’ stage, recognition of native phonemic categories is established, allowing further development of a subsequent prefrontal and linguistic circuits for sequential language capacity...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{present a}} new alert system to inform drivers {{of a risk}} of grip loss. The {{assessment}} {{was carried out by}} comparing drivers’ speed during three steps: a <b>reference</b> <b>stage,</b> a general alert and a individual alert. It was shown that the first sign has a positive effect. This effect is reflected by lower driving speeds (more important in the situation "wet road") during which the sign is activated. Thus, it appears that the speed reduction during this phase is increased by 5 km/h compared with the same conditions of the reference phase. This observation is made for all points of speed measurements. Assessing the impact of individual alert message did not demonstrate a significant reduction in driving speeds for the part of drivers who has been warned against that which has not been. A complementary study on vehicles driving within platoons showed that it could not be attributed any noticeable effect of the speed alert system on the rear-end collision risk indicator...|$|E

During the stages of image training and after performance, α-waves　of expert practitioner's EEG increased remarkably, even if their eyes were kept open. The above phenomena had a clear contrast to α-attenuation of the beginner's EEG in the both stages. An expert practitioner of Yohshiki-Taikyokuken exhibited a significant decrease of α-waves and the amplitude diminution after the performance. Although some investigators have previously reported EEG patterns during concentrated relaxation (e. g. Raj Yoga, Zen, transcendental meditation), most of them have demonstrated EEG changes between the meditative state and the awake-reference state with out motion. Augmented alpha activity could also be seen in the expert practitioner of Kanka-Taikyokuken as well as the autogenic training, which seems to indicate that the autohypnosis has something in common with these states...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies utilising {{changes in}} mode shape or {{curvature}} to locate damage {{rely on the}} fact that the greatest change occurs around the defect. However, in concrete beams this fact is undermined due to the nature of the defect as distributed multi-site cracks. In addition, differences in mode shape and curvature as ways to locate the damage is unstable because of occurrence of modal nodes and inflection points. In this paper, one interesting solution to this problem is being tested by establishing a new non-dimensional expression designated the 'Curvature Difference Ratio (CDR) '. This parameter exploits the ratio of differences in curvature of a specific mode shape for a damaged stage and another <b>reference</b> <b>stage.</b> The expression CDR is reasonably used to locate the damage and estimate the dynamic bending stiffness in a successively loaded 6 m concrete beam. Results obtained by the proposed technique are tested and validated with a case study results done by Ren and De Roeck [1] also by Maeck and De Roeck [2]. Another contribution of this work is that relating changes in vibration properties to the design bending moment at beam sections as defined in Eurocode 2 specifications [3].

40|$|Success in the {{development}} of cross-disciplinary connections between psychology and pedagogy in today’s Russia depends on many factors, including understanding the historical traditions of theoretical comprehension of educational innovations. To identify the specific influence of psychology on didactic terminology from the early 18 th century through {{the first half of the}} 20 th century. The study was designed based on historiographic, diachronic, and synchronic methods, and context and content analysis of 129 texts (105 words with general usage frequency of 81, 397 units were analyzed). It was found reasonable to split {{the development}} of psychological-didactic terminology into two stages: the instrumental stage (early 18 th century — first half of 19 th century) and the <b>reference</b> <b>stage</b> (second half of 19 th century — first half of 20 th century). The first stage was found to be characterized by psychological terms performing predominantly an instrumental function, that is, describing psychological factors that affect the effectiveness of training. The second stage featured the growing significance of psychological knowledge, not only in solving educational tasks, but also in explaining didactic patterns. During the first stage of development of psychological-didactic terminology, teachers frequently used the psychological terms “teaching”, “ability”, and “diligence”; during the second stage — “teaching”, “senses”, and “development”. Statistical methods were used to prove stable conceptual and terminological connections between psychology and pedagogy...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} an experimental {{investigation of a}} compact aero engine centrifugal compressor stage with pipe-diffuser and tandem deswirler in which the vanes of the first deswirl row are immerged into the diffuser channel. This geometrical arrangement eliminates a vaneless space between diffuser and deswirler, which is present in current conventional centrifugal compressor stages and can result into much lower outer stage diameters. In addition to the nominal centered alignment of the first deswirl row vanes within the diffuser channel, {{a variation of the}} circumferential positioning of the deswirler towards diffuser suction and pressure side was conducted. Furthermore, a bleed extraction between impeller and diffuser was varied. For a comparison of the compact compressor stage to conventional stage designs, additionally three compressor stages with vaneless space between diffuser and deswirler were experimentally investigated, whereas each stage contained a different deswirl system. Impeller and diffuser inlet geometry of all four stages were the same. The study demonstrates that the compact centrifugal compressor stage reaches similar performance values in terms of pressure build-up and efficiency as the stages with decoupled deswirlers. In comparison to a conventional stage with simple one row prismatic deswirl vanes, the compact stage even shows a significant increase in performance. However, the compact stage looses surge margin compared to all three reference stages. Also, a shift of the characteristics of the different stage components was detected. The impeller of the compact stage shows a slightly higher pressure build-up and slightly lower work input. Furthermore, the diffuser inlet shows a significant increase in pressure build-up which is linked to the loss in surge margin. Within the diffuser channel the pressure build-up is lower due to the lower dynamic head at the channel inlet. This results from the increased diffusion at the diffuser inlet. The three-dimensionally designed deswirlers of the compact stage and of two reference stages are showing equal characteristics, whereas the pressure build-up of the deswirler of the last <b>reference</b> <b>stage</b> with prismatic vanes is significantly decreased and the total pressure loss increased. With a total-to-static stage balancing, a variation of the circumferential positioning of the deswirler to the diffuser of the compact compressor stage shows very small changes in pressure build-up and efficiency. However, the surge margin increases from suction to pressure sided positioning of the deswirler relative to the diffuser. With a total-to-total balancing of the stage, the pressure sided positioning of the deswirler relative to the diffuser shows the smallest losses but also the highest Mach-numbers at the stage exit...|$|E
