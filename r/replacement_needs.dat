25|$|The {{ignition}} system {{used in the}} Model T was an unusual trembler coil system to drive the spark plugs, as used for stationary gas engines, rather than the expensive magnetos that were used on other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The need for a starting battery and also Ford's use of an unusual AC alternator located inside the flywheel housing encouraged the adoption of electric lighting (standard fitment as of 1915), rather than oil or acetylene lamps, but it also delayed the adoption of electric starting, which was not offered until 1919. The Model T engine was produced for <b>replacement</b> <b>needs,</b> as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. It was also utilized in the drivetrain of the Fordson tractor, which was produced in the US until 1928, and in Ireland until 1964.|$|E

50|$|Term life {{insurance}} can be contrasted to permanent {{life insurance}} such as whole life, universal life, and variable universal life, which guarantee coverage at fixed premiums for {{the lifetime of}} the covered individual unless the policy is allowed to lapse. Term insurance is not generally used for estate planning needs or charitable giving strategies but is used for pure income <b>replacement</b> <b>needs</b> for an individual. Term insurance functions {{in a manner similar}} to most other types of insurance in that it satisfies claims against what is insured if the premiums are up to date and the contract has not expired and does not provide for a return of premium dollars if no claims are filed. As an example, auto insurance will satisfy claims against the insured in the event of an accident and a homeowner policy will satisfy claims against the home if it is damaged or destroyed, for example, by fire. Whether or not these events will occur is uncertain. If the policyholder discontinues coverage because he or she has sold the insured car or home, the insurance company will not refund the full premium.|$|E

5000|$|In 2000, {{the company}} entered another mode, concentrating on {{improving}} operating efficiency and enhancing profitability in its existing locations {{instead of focusing}} on growth through acquisitions. It announced that it would eliminate some product lines that were not selling well or that had poor profit margins. [...] Watsco also implemented several initiatives including the closure of certain underperforming locations (25 locations closed in 2000 and 7 closed in 2001) and the integration of operating subsidiaries, which resulted in a more simplified operating structure. The company looked for other ways to cut costs too. It restructured the business it had bought from Kaufman Supply, which sold heating and cooling to mobile homes and other manufactured housing. Watsco also invested in new technology in the early 2000s by introducing ACDoctor.com, a consumer-friendly website that provides consumers a resource for heating and air conditioning, including information on energy efficiency, product comparisons and tax and utility credits, as well as a way to find a licensed HVAC contractor to service their repair and <b>replacement</b> <b>needs.</b> Watsco reported sales of US$1.3 billion in 2000, up slightly from the previous year.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on both the}} magnitude and determinants of unfilled positions for information technology workers using cross-sectional data on 4150 German firms. Vacancies are defined as unfilled positions excluding those created by <b>replacement</b> <b>needs</b> {{during the first half}} of the year 2000. The share of unfilled positions created by <b>replacement</b> <b>needs</b> is only about 20 percent, indicating that high turnover rates are not the main reason for high vacancy rates. The adjusted job vacancy rate for ICT workers varies between 5. 7 percent in the ICT sector and 6. 7 percent in the non-ICT sector. The results of a generalized tobit model show that the adjusted vacancy rate mainly depends on the firm size, the share of ICT workers and actions taken in the past to solve the ICT worker shortage but not on the diffusion of ICT. In the ICT sector, the decision made in the past to train apprentices in the new ICT occupations seems to have reduced the current vacancy rate. In the non-ICT sector, a successful strategy to solve the ICT worker shortage appears to be increased internal training. Finally, in the non-ICT sector, the common practice of completely outsourcing software programming significantly reduces the probability of unfilled positions...|$|E

40|$|The {{drinking}} water distribution network represents a major {{proportion of the}} investments and capital assets of a water utility. Consequently, qualified insight into future <b>replacement</b> <b>needs</b> provides water utilities with a foundation for financial planning. This insight would allow responsible engineers to choose the right projects (pipes and pipe systems) for replacement. Currently, support for the correct project choice is through sophisticated methods and models. However, utilities (especially smaller) need simpler procedures as they often lack both input data and competence for advanced infrastructure asset management models, {{as well as the}} experience of using such models. The aim of this thesis has been to provide new knowledge and useful, simple and transparent tools for the assessment and evaluation of long-term needs and prioritization of {{drinking water}} pipe replacement. An assessment of the future long-term <b>replacement</b> <b>needs</b> for drinking water distribution networks can be made through a combination of lifetime distribution functions and current network age data. Reliable lifetime predictions are limited by a lack of understanding of deterioration processes for different pipe materials under varying conditions. However, in this thesis a method was applied to calculate national investment needs and the results provided a basis for estimates for Swedish utilities where there is a scarcity of data. An alternative approach, employed successfully in this thesis, was the use of real historical data for replacement over an extended time series. The verified data provided a good fit to commonly used lifetime distribution curves. Further, reasonable projections of <b>replacement</b> <b>needs</b> into an uncertain future could be made. CBA (Cost-benefit analysis) can be used to evaluate the replacement strategy for utilities’ water distribution networks. CBA was applied to evaluate how first, pipe failure data and second, leakage strategies, might be used in pipe prioritization strategies. CBA was applied to pipe failure data replacement priorities, and here the cost of replacement was compared to the benefits of fewer pipe failures. The method enabled the selection of prioritised pipe sections for replacement without the need for a range of parameters and advanced methods that are difficult to interpret. Scenario analysis showed that health aspects {{have a significant impact on}} the result, and a method for evaluating the health risk was developed. For the CBA application to leakage management, the benefits of leakage reduction were compared to the cost of alternative management options to determine which was the most cost-effective. In the case study distribution system it was demonstrated that it is significantly more cost-effective to reduce leakage volumes by reactively repairing broken pipes than to proactively replace them, despite large leakage losses...|$|E

40|$|Background Leading sports {{nutrition}} {{experts recommend}} customised fluid and electrolyte replacement strategies for optimal rehydration. Inadequate replacement of sodium can impair performance and health, but <b>replacement</b> <b>needs</b> {{are unique to}} an individuals ’ sweat sodium loss (SSL) - a product of sweat sodium concentration ([Na+]sweat) and sweat volume (or rate). Estimating [Na +]sweat requires laboratory analysis of an individuals ’ sweat sample, and therefore the sports nutrition practitioner (SNP) can struggle to provide professional sports teams with customised sodium replacement advice in the field setting. Therefore research identifying groups prone to higher [Na+]sweat than others (‘saltier sweaters’) may help the SNP to do so. Ethnicity may be a practical approach to identifying ‘saltier sweaters ’ within sports teams. Small field studies in the US suggest that ‘White ’ male athletes may incur higher SSL than their ‘Black ’ counterparts. No such {{research has been conducted}} i...|$|E

Low cost but appropriate techniques for upgrading these roads cost-effectively to sealed standards have been implemented in many countries recently.
