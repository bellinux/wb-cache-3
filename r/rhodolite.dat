25|$|The {{quality of}} a ruby is {{determined}} by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with carat weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like rutile inclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional birthstone for July and is usually more pink than garnet, although some <b>rhodolite</b> garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world's most expensive ruby is the Sunrise Ruby.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} pyrope from Macon County, North Carolina is a violet-red shade {{and has been}} called <b>rhodolite,</b> Greek for [...] "rose". In {{chemical}} composition it may be considered as essentially an isomorphous mixture of pyrope and almandine, {{in the proportion of}} two parts pyrope to one part almandine. Pyrope has tradenames some of which are misnomers; Cape ruby, Arizona ruby, California ruby, Rocky Mountain ruby, and Bohemian garnet from the Czech Republic. Another intriguing find is the blue color-changing garnets from Madagascar, a pyrope-spessartine mix. The color of these blue garnets is not like sapphire blue in subdued daylight but more reminiscent of the grayish blues and greenish blues sometimes seen in spinel. However, in white LED light, the color is equal to the best cornflower blue sapphire, or Dblock tanzanite; {{this is due to the}} blue garnet's ability to absorb the yellow component of the emitted light.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rhodolite</b> is a varietal {{name for}} rose-pink to red mineral pyrope, a {{species in the}} garnet group. It is found in Cowee Valley, Macon County, North Carolina. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek for [...] "rose-like", in common with many pink mineral types (e.g. rhodochrosite, rhodonite). <b>Rhodolite</b> itself is not officially {{recognized}} as a mineralogical term. This coloration, and the commonly inclusion-free nature of garnet from this locality, has led to <b>rhodolite</b> being used as a semi-precious gemstone.|$|E
50|$|The {{color of}} <b>rhodolites,</b> {{combined}} with their brilliance, durability, and {{the accessibility of}} stones with no visible inclusions have brought about some demand for the stone in the jewelry industry. <b>Rhodolites</b> used in jewelry are generally faceted to {{make good use of}} their brilliance, though they also exist in cabochon form.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>rhodolites</b> {{will change}} color from purplish to a {{hessonite}} brown when heated to {{a temperature of}} 600 °C. This process cannot be reversed.|$|R
40|$|At the {{windward}} (NE) side of Curaçao {{at least}} two well-developed submarine terraces occur. A first, rocky, terrace, 100 to 150 m wide at depths of 5 m inshore to 12 - 15 m at the drop off, is densely covered with Sargassum. A second, sandy, terrace, approximately 50 to 100 m wide at depths of 32 to 40 m, is sparsely covered with corals, sponges, <b>rhodolites</b> and gastropods of the genus Strombus. The slope {{between the first and}} the second terrace is covered with hermatypic corals and fleshy algae. At several locations a fossil bench occurs {{at the lower end of}} this slope. The upper surface of the bench is consistently at 32 m below sealevel. At two localities the bench has an indentation at 34 - 38 m below sealevel, which possibly is a fossil sealevel notch. The features are regarded as essentially pre-Holocene, markedly different from the situation at the leeward side where the terraces, if present, have been buried underneath Holocene reef accumulations...|$|R
50|$|Deposits of <b>rhodolite</b> garnet {{have been}} found in Brazil, Greenland, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Norway, Sri Lanka, and the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rhodolite</b> garnets {{appear as}} {{transparent}} red gemstones. The color may vary from a rose-pink, a purple-pink, a purple-red, to a raspberry-red.|$|E
50|$|Chemically, the <b>rhodolite</b> {{is a mix}} of pyrope and {{almandine}} garnets, part of the pyrope-almandine solid-solution series, with {{an approximate}} garnet composition of Py70Al30.|$|E
40|$|Sessile encrusters with mineralised skeletons in {{the fossil}} record {{generally}} retain their original spatial relationships to the substrate and each other. Being short living and not significantly time averaged, communities on shelly substrates represent excellent systems to study such relationships. Bryozoan and serpuloidean skeletobionts on molluscs and <b>rhodolites</b> from Lower Pleistocene localities in Sicily have been studied. Species composition and specimen sizes testify to a short exposure of the shells on the sea floor. Skeletobiont community structure is characterised by the dominance of a few species (5 bryozoans out of 87 and 3 serpuloideans out of 17). Substrate coverage is usually low (< 5 %), rarely reaching 50 - 60 % or more. On bivalves, skeletobiont distribution does not exhibit a clear trend for inner/outer sides or left/right valves. Oriented growths, differential patterns in microenvironment utilisation of the substrate and spatial competition have been analysed. Several of the recorded overgrowths resulted from superimposition of specimens growing on skeletons of previous, already dead encrusters. True competitive interactions mainly involved bryozoans {{and only a few}} serpuloideans. Within bryozoans interspecific encounters usually led to overgrowth or abutment whereas intraspecific encounters commonly resulted in standoffs and growth side by side in cheilostomes, and to fusion of colonies in some cyclostome species...|$|R
40|$|The Middle Miocene sediments {{outcropping}} between Szydłów and Brzeziny {{are represented}} by the Pińczów Beds and the Chmielnik Beds. The Pińczów Beds are developed as the Heterostegina sands with intercalations of red algal limestones. These sediments contain numerous fossils of foraminifera, bryozoans, bivalves, ostracods, echinoids, crustaceans and corallinacean red algae. Foraminifera (Amphistegina, Heterostegina, Orbulina suturalis) point to the early Badenian age of the Pińczów Beds. The Chmielnik Beds contain mainly organodetritical limestones, which are composed mainly of grains eroded from the Badenian red algal limestones. The organodetritical limestones contain pebbles and blocks of microbial-serpulid limestones, Abra limestones, marls and rare lenses of quartz sands. Numerous pectenids, other small bivalves, gastropods, foraminifera and <b>rhodolites</b> occur here. The fossils point to mainly Anomalinoides dividens Zone. New literature data show that this zone, commonly accepted as diagnostic {{for the beginning of}} Sarmatian, is diachronic. Therefore, the Badenian-early Sarmatian age is suggested for the Chmielnik Beds. The presence or absence of normal-marine biota as an age criterium for the Badenian-Sarmatian boundary, the commonly accepted idea for the brackish Sarmatian basin of the central Paratethys has been challenged recently. Both Badenian (not redeposited) and Sarmatian fossils occur in the Chmielnik Beds. Therefore, part of deposits in the Szydłów area assumed so far to be of Sarmatian age, can in fact represent late Badenian age...|$|R
50|$|It {{was first}} found as tiny {{crystals}} found with <b>rhodolite</b> garnet and corundum during alluvial gem mining in streams draining Mason Mountain, Macon County, North Carolina (Hidden 1898). Sperrylite {{has been identified}} in Finland from sulfide deposits generally associated with layered mafic-ultramafic complexes.|$|E
50|$|L. williamsis {{tropical}} forest habitat is also shrinking and fragmenting. Neither of the Catchment Forest Reserves where it occurs is well-protected. The forest is seriously threatened by pet collectors, clearing for farmland, illegal logging, increasingly frequent fires, mining of rubies, tourmaline, <b>rhodolite,</b> gold and dolomite and limestone from outcrops {{on which the}} screwpines grow. Invasive trees such as Cedrela are also a threat. There is little forest left unaffected.|$|E
50|$|The {{composition}} of pure pyrope is Mg3Al2(SiO4)3, although typically other elements {{are present in}} at least minor proportions—these other elements include Ca, Cr, Fe and Mn. Pyrope forms a solid solution series with almandine and spessartine, which are collectively known as the pyralspite garnets (pyrope, almandine, spessartine). Iron and manganese substitute for the magnesium in the pyrope structure. The resultant, mixed composition garnets are defined according to their pyrope-almandine ratio. The semi-precious stone <b>rhodolite</b> is a garnet of ~70% pyrope composition.|$|E
50|$|Sinkankas {{graduated}} from the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, in 1937, as US Navy Aviator #5390. Before and during World War II, Sinkankas was employed in flying patrol seaplanes engaged in convoy work and anti-submarine warfare in numerous places. Fortunately, he was never shot at. During {{the course of the}} war he had an opportunity to fly Colonel Bernt Balchen around Greenland where they visited various colonies along the western coast, including Ivigtut. There Sinkankas collected several flats of specimens from the famous cryolite deposit and elsewhere found <b>rhodolite</b> garnet.|$|E

40|$|Both <b>rhodolite</b> and {{almandine}} garnets {{occur in}} Umba. The rhodolites have no special properties {{by which they}} can be distinguished from other garnets in the pyrope-almandine series, except their rose-red colour. Hence a distinctive name is unnecessary. Rutile {{appears to be the}} most frequent mineral inclusion in <b>rhodolite,</b> whereas in almandine both apatite and rutile are common. Corundums of different colours occur. Green corundums owe their colour to iron, while blue corundums have a high Ti and a low Cr content. Common inclusions are rutile, pyrrhotite and apatite, whereas graphite especially is found in deep violet corundums. The inclusions in both the garnets and the corundums are not characteristic of this locality. The properties of emerald green and orange-brown tourmalines are given, {{as well as those of}} brownish orthopyroxenes, a light green clinopyroxene, yellow scapolite, reddish brown zircon and turquoise...|$|E
40|$|The {{coastline}} of the Salento Peninsula (Apulia region, Southern Italy) {{is characterized}} by a rocky shore with spectacular cliffs where the investigated fringing reef complex, the so called Castro Limestone, spectacularly outcrops for at least 40 km. As reconstructed from several measured sections, the Castro Limestone, which is Middle Chattian in age from our own data, disconformably mantles a tectonically deformed falaise of Cretaceous-Eocene rocks and is overlain by a remarkable erosional surface characterized by a very peculiar <b>rhodolite</b> rudstone. The Castro Limestone unit can be considered as a classic unconformity bounded depositional sequence representing, most probably, a shelf margin prograding complex, related to the major Middle Oligocene sea level lowstand. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic features, together with paleontological characters, allow recognition of a virtually complete range of reef environments across the reef profile. Several geomorphic zones and associated facies are described, from the most landward reef area (‘back reef’) across the reef flat and reef from downward to the fore reef slope, contributing to a better knowledge of the evolution of Oligocene reefs and reef communities in Italy and in the Mediterranean area...|$|E
