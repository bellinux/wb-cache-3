50|$|<b>Roxindole</b> (EMD-49,980) is a dopaminergic and serotonergic drug {{which was}} {{originally}} {{developed for the}} treatment of schizophrenia. In clinical trials its antipsychotic efficacy was only modest but it was unexpectedly found to produce potent and rapid antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. As a result, <b>roxindole</b> was further researched {{for the treatment of}} depression instead. It has also been investigated as a therapy for Parkinson's disease and prolactinoma.|$|E

50|$|At D2 and {{possibly}} D3 receptors <b>roxindole</b> is a partial agonist with preferential actions at autoreceptors {{and has been}} touted as a 'selective' autoreceptor agonist, hence the justification of its application as an antipsychotic. Weaker activity at the serotonin 1B and 1D receptors has been seen. It is also a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = 1.4 nM) and {{has been reported to}} act as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist as well.|$|E
40|$|The putative, {{selective}} dopamine (DA) dopamine- 2 autorecep-tor agonist <b>roxindole,</b> {{which also}} exhibits serotonin- 1 A-agonis-tic and 5 -hydroxytryptamine reuptake-inhibiting properties, was examined for its behavioral effects in rats and mice. Rox-indole inhibited apomorphine-induced climbing in mice and stereotyped behavior in rats with ED 50 values of 1. 4 mg/kg s. c. and 0. 65 mg/kg s. c., respectively, and inhibited conditioned avoidance response in rats (ED 50 = 1. 5 mg/kg s. c.). Thus <b>roxindole</b> showed a profile resembling {{those of the}} classical antipsychotic haloperidol and the atypical neuroleptic clozap-me but differing {{from that of the}} DA autoreceptor agonist tali-pexole, which did not prevent apomorphine-induced behaviors. Unlike haloperidol, <b>roxindole</b> did not induce catalepsy in rats and mice. Investigations directed to the DA autoreceptor prop...|$|E
40|$|The {{accompanying}} {{multivariate analysis}} of the binding profiles of antiparkinson agents revealed contrasting patterns of affinities at diverse classes of monoaminergic receptor. Herein, we charac-terized efficacies at human (h) D 2 SHORT(S), hD 2 LONG(L), hD 3, and hD 4. 4 receptors and at h 2 A-, h 2 B-, h 2 C-, and h 1 A-adrenocep-tors (ARs). As determined by guanosine 5 -O-(3 -[35 S]thio) triphos-phate ([35 S]GTPS) binding, no ligand displayed “full ” efficacy relative to dopamine (100 %) at all “D 2 -like ” sites. However, at hD 2 S receptors quinpirole, pramipexole, ropinirole, quinerolane, pergolide, and cabergoline were as efficacious as dopamine (Emax 100 %); TL 99, talipexole, and apomorphine were highly ef-ficacious (79 – 92 %); piribedil, lisuride, bromocriptine, and ter-guride showed intermediate efficacy (40 – 55 %); and <b>roxindole</b> dis-played low efficacy (11 %). For all drugs, efficacies were lower a...|$|E
