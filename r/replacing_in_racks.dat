50|$|The {{broadcast}} band receiver {{in all of}} these command sets is intended to host a homing adapter for the Navy ZB/YE homing system. The homing adapter demodulates a signal near 246 MHz that is modulated with a {{broadcast band}} carrier. The output is sent to the broadcast band receiver tuned to the modulating frequency to further demodulate the carrier for voice messages or for a Morse code letter indicating to the pilot his bearing from the homing transmitter. All broadcast band receivers came with a power adapter to supply power to the homing adapter. The adapter under the Navy nomenclature system is the ZB-series. The identical unit under JAN nomenclature is the AN/ARR-1. This system was used by both the Navy extensively and the Army much less so. To put the system into operation on the aircraft, the beacon band receiver would be <b>replaced</b> <b>in</b> the <b>rack</b> by the broadcast band receiver. The antenna post is connected to the output of the homing adapter, and a power cable is connected from the homing adapter to the broadcast band receiver. The normal control that had been used for the beacon band receiver also serves this homing system without further reconfiguration.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background RACK 1 is a {{versatile}} scaffold protein in mammals, regulating diverse developmental processes. Unlike in non-plant organisms where RACK 1 is encoded {{by a single}} gene, Arabidopsis genome contains three RACK 1 homologous genes, designated as RACK 1 A, RACK 1 B and RACK 1 C, respectively. Previous studies indicated that the loss-of-function alleles of RACK 1 A displayed multiple defects in plant development. However, the functions of RACK 1 B and RACK 1 C remain elusive. Further, the relationships between three RACK 1 homologous genes are unknown. Results We isolated mutant alleles with loss-of-function mutations <b>in</b> <b>RACK</b> 1 B and RACK 1 C, and examined {{the impact of these}} mutations on plant development. We found that unlike <b>in</b> <b>RACK</b> 1 A, loss-of-function mutations <b>in</b> <b>RACK</b> 1 B or RACK 1 C do not confer apparent defects in plant development, including rosette leaf production and root development. Analyses of rack 1 a, rack 1 b and rack 1 c double and triple mutants, however, revealed that rack 1 b and rack 1 c can enhance the rack 1 a mutant's developmental defects, and an extreme developmental defect and lethality were observed <b>in</b> <b>rack</b> 1 a rack 1 b rack 1 c triple mutant. Complementation studies indicated that RACK 1 B and RACK 1 C are in principle functionally equivalent to RACK 1 A. Gene expression studies indicated that three RACK 1 genes display similar expression patterns but are expressed at different levels. Further, RACK 1 genes positively regulate each other's expression. Conclusion These results suggested that RACK 1 genes are critical regulators of plant development and that RACK 1 genes function in an unequally redundant manner. Both the difference <b>in</b> <b>RACK</b> 1 gene expression level and the cross-regulation are likely the molecular determinants of their unequal genetic redundancy. </p...|$|R

40|$|In a {{realistic}} distributed storage environment, storage nodes are usually placed <b>in</b> <b>racks,</b> a metallic support {{designed to accommodate}} electronic equipment. It is known that the communication (bandwidth) cost between nodes which are <b>in</b> the same <b>rack</b> is much lower than between nodes which are <b>in</b> different <b>racks.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, a new model, where the storage nodes are placed <b>in</b> two <b>racks,</b> is proposed and analyzed. Moreover, the two-rack model is generalized to any number of <b>racks.</b> <b>In</b> this model, the storage nodes have different repair costs depending on the rack where they are placed. A threshold function, which minimizes the amount of stored data per node and the bandwidth needed to regenerate a failed node, is shown. This threshold function generalizes the ones given for previous distributed storage models. The tradeoff curve obtained from this threshold function is compared with the ones obtained from the previous models, and it is shown that this new model outperforms the previous ones in terms of repair cost.

40|$|Protein kinase C (PKC) {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathophysiology}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The levels of particular isoforms and the activation of PKC are reduced in postmortem brain cortex of AD subjects. Receptors for activated C kinase (RACK) are a family of proteins involved in anchoring activated PKCs to relevant subcellular compartments. Recent evidence has indicated that the impaired activation (translocation) of PKC in the aging brain {{is associated with a}} deficit <b>in</b> <b>RACK</b> 1, the most well-characterized member of this family. The present study was conducted to determine whether alterations <b>in</b> <b>RACK</b> 1 occurred <b>in</b> cortical areas where an impaired translocation of PKC has been demonstrated in AD. Here we report the presence of <b>RACK</b> 1 immunoreactivity <b>in</b> human brain frontal cortex {{for the first time and}} demonstrate a decrease <b>in</b> <b>RACK</b> 1 content <b>in</b> cytosol and membrane extracts in AD when compared with non-AD controls. By comparison, the levels of the RACK 1 -related PKC beta II were not modified in the same membrane extracts. These observations add a new perspective in understanding the disease-associated defective PKC signal transduction and indicate that a decrease in an anchoring protein for PKC is an additional determinant of this deficit.
