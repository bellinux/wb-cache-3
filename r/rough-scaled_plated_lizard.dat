40|$|The endemic <b>plated</b> <b>lizards</b> (Gerrhosauridae) of Madagascar {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse groups of lizards on the island (19 species) and are found in all ecoregions. On an island that {{presents}} so many interesting biological questions, <b>plated</b> <b>lizards</b> are an ideal group for examining patterns of diversification due to their high (but tractable) diversity and wide distribution. To resolve the taxonomy and evolutionary relationships of Malagasy <b>plated</b> <b>lizards,</b> and to explore their biogeographic history, we have generated a molecular phylogeny based on > 2 kb of both mitochondrial (cob, 1142 bp) and nuclear (NT- 3, 419 bp; c-mos, 542 bp) DNA sequences. Phylogenetic relationships and divergence-time estimates indicate Zonosaurinae are monophyletic, arising from a single colonization event, likely from Africa to Madagascar in the Paleogene (Paleocene/early Eocene), with subsequent radiation. Furthermore, our results reveal widespread mischaracterization of species delimitation and assignment based on phenotypic characteristics. Paraphyly of a number of zonosaurine species was strongly supported by our dataset, revealing not only instances of likely cryptic species (phenotypic conservatism) but also phenotypic/genotypic discordance in the delimitation of species (phenotypic variability). These results clearly demonstrate the complex history of biotic diversification on Madagascar and provide novel insight into biogeographic patterns on the island...|$|R

Of the 18 loci reported here, more than half (10) work in closely related zonosaurines although only one successfully amplified a homologous fragment in the distantly related iguanid (Oplurus).

40|$|Termites ecologically {{engineer}} {{their environment}} by producing termitaria (mounds) {{used by many}} other species as dens, lookouts or food sources. The role of termite mounds in biological communities is relatively unknown, despite their ubiquitous nature. I investigated their impact on vertebrates in the Tsavo region of Kenya. Through the characterization of mounds, trapping, direct observation, and collecting microclimate data, I was able to determine the importance of mounds to vertebrates. I found uniform dispersion of mounds, that soil type is correlated {{with the size of}} mounds, and that vertebrate activity increases with mound size. I also found no significant differences in overall numbers of animals and species between mound and non-mound areas. Reptiles were found at mound sites significantly more than at non-mound sites, especially the great <b>plated</b> <b>lizard</b> and short-necked skink. I determined that mounds’ microclimate is less variable than that of the ambient. More work is needed to further our understanding of termite mounds 2 ̆ 7 impacts on vertebrates.

However, the population {{on the island}} most likely originated from colonization by ancestors [...] "rafting" [...] from the African Mainland. Within the Island of Madagascar, the Malagasy <b>Plated</b> <b>Lizards</b> are denoted by two individual genera of Gerrhosauridae: 1. Tracheloptychus, which consists of 2 separate species that occupy the subarid south and south-west regions of the Island 2. Zonosaurus, which consists of 17 species occupy {{the majority of the}} biomes distributed throughout the Island.Originally, scientists concluded, based on morphological data, that the Zonosaurus was a sister to the Tracheloptychus genera.In order to determine the evolutionary line of the species of Gerrhosauridae on the Island, specimens representing the species that inhabited the Island were acquired and tissue samples were taken and DNA samples were taken and underwent PCR. From the information, the tree for the evolution pathway was then [...] "inferred per gene and per type of gene," [...] resulting in the following lineage as described by the below link containing a photo: http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1055790313002534-gr2.jpg.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the phylogenetic relationships of the Malagasy <b>plated</b> <b>lizards</b> {{in the family}} Gerrhosauridae based on DNA sequence fragments of four mitochondrial and five nuclear genes. Various clades were strongly supported by the concatenated data set and also recovered by separate analyses of mtDNA and nucDNA. In particular, two clades here named the Z. rufipes group (containing Z. bemaraha, Z. brygooi, Z. rufipes, Z. subunicolor, Z. tsingy and an undescribed candidate species from northern Madagascar) and the Z. ornatus group (containing Z. anelanelany, Z. laticaudatus, Z. karsteni, Z. ornatus, Z. quadrilineaus, and Z. trilineatus) were resolved with strong support. A third clade named the Z. madagascariensis group contains Z. madagascariensis with a nested Z. haraldmeieri; the status of that species requires further investigation. Tentatively we also include Z. aeneus in this species group although its phylogenetic relationships were poorly resolved. A fourth clade with less support included Z. boettgeri and Z. maximus. The phylogenetic position of the genus Tracheloptychus remains uncertain: whereas in the species tree it was recovered as the sister group to Zonosaurus, other methods indicated that it was nested within Zonosaurus, albeit alternative topologies were rejected with only marginal statistical support...|$|R
40|$|The {{phylogeny}} of reptilian herpesviruses (HVs) {{relative to}} mammalian and avian HVs was investigated by using available gene sequences and by alignment of encoded amino acid sequences and derivation of trees by maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. Phylogenetic loci {{were obtained for}} green turtle HV (GTHV) primarily {{on the basis of}} DNA polymerase (POL) and DNA binding protein sequences, and for lung-eye-trachea disease-associated HV (LETV) primarily from its glycoprotein B sequence; both have nodes on the branch leading to recognized species in the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and should be regarded as new members of that subfamily. A similar but less well defined locus was obtained for an iguanid HV based on a partial POL sequence. On the basis of short POL sequences (around 60 amino acid residues), it appeared likely that GTHV and LETV belong to a private clade and that three HVs of gerrhosaurs (<b>plated</b> <b>lizards)</b> are associated with the iguanid HV. Based on phylogenetic branching patterns for mammalian HV lineages that mirror those of host lineages, we estimated a date for the HV tree’s root of around 400 million years ago. Estimated dates for branching events in the development of reptilian, avian, and mammalian Alphaherpesviri-nae lineages could plausibly be accounted for in part but not completely by ancient coevolution of these virus lines with reptilian lineages and with the development of birds and mammals from reptilian progenitors. Herpesviruses (HVs) have a characteristic virion architec...|$|R

Classification keys are {{available}} only for the males of the species since male and female nematodes in copula were not observed in this study {{as well as the}} similarity of the females, {{it was not possible to}} identify the females to the species level. Thelandros schusteri, Thelandros boomkeri and Thelandros luciusi were provisionally paired with female Type E, Tachygonetria bainae with female Type C, Tachygonetria chabaudi with female Type A and Tachygonetria petterae with female Type D. Female Types B and F could not be paired. The richness and composition of species of the Pharyngodonidae of Gerrhosaurus validus validus is close to that of tortoises and differs from the pharyngodonid fauna of the insectivorous lizards that have been studied. In the latter, only the genera Spauligodon, Skrjabinodon and Parapharyngodon were recovered. The pharyngodonid fauna of Gerrhosaurus validus validus seems to have originated by capture from local herbivorous reptiles. The three Tachygonetria spp. most closely resemble forms in South African tortoises. The three Thelandros spp. redescribed here not only show strong similarities to those of herbivorous Agama spp. but also to those parasitic in tortoises and could have been acquired from either.
