2500|$|In essence, {{a limited}} amount of oxygen or air is {{introduced}} into the reactor to allow some of the organic material to be [...] "burned" [...] to produce carbon dioxide and energy, which drives a second reaction that converts further organic material to hydrogen and additional carbon dioxide. Further reactions occur when the formed carbon monoxide and residual water from the organic material react to form methane and excess carbon dioxide (...) [...] This third reaction occurs more abundantly in reactors that increase the residence time of the reactive gases and organic materials, as well as heat and pressure. Catalysts are used in more sophisticated reactors to improve reaction rates, thus moving the system closer to the <b>reaction</b> <b>equilibrium</b> [...] for a fixed residence time.|$|E

The Shell higher olefin process (SHOP process) uses ethenolysis on an industrial scale. The SHOP α-olefin mixtures are separated by distillation, the higher {{molecular weight}} fractions are isomerized by alkaline alumina catalysts in the liquid phase. The resulting internal olefins are reacted with ethylene to regenerate α-olefins. The large excess of ethylene moves the <b>reaction</b> <b>equilibrium</b> to the terminal α-olefins.

50|$|The pH {{dependence}} {{is given}} by the factor −0.059m/n per pH unit, where m relates {{to the number of}} protons in the equation, and n the number of electrons exchanged. Electrons are always exchanged in electrochemistry, but not necessarily protons. If there is no proton exchange in the <b>reaction</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> the reaction is said to be pH-independent. This means that the values for the electrochemical potential rendered in a redox half-reaction, whereby the elements in question change oxidation states are the same whatever the pH conditions under which the procedure is carried out.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} Claus process {{described above}} {{is limited in}} its conversion due to the <b>reaction</b> <b>equilibrium</b> being reached. Like all exothermic reactions, greater conversion can be achieved at lower temperatures, however as mentioned the Claus reactor must be operated above the sulfur dew point (120-150 °C) to avoid liquid sulfur physically deactivating the catalyst. To overcome this problem, the sub dew point Clauss reactors are oriented in parallel, with one operating and one spare. When one reactor has become saturated with adsorbed sulfur, the process flow is diverted to the standby reactor. The reactor is then regenerated by sending process gas that has been heated to 300-350 °C to vaporize the sulfur. This stream is sent to a condenser to recover the sulfur.|$|E
