40|$|Citing the {{inability}} of conventional human rights thinking to address the ‘strong’ questions raised by our times, this article pursues a twofold objective: to identify the major challenges that the rise of political theologies {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth-first century posed to human rights; and second, to select within a broad landscape of theological analysis the types of reflections and practices that might contribute to expand and deepen the canon of human rights politics. In order to achieve this double goal the article uses complexity as its main analytical guideline making distinctions from which significant consequences were drawn: on one side, distinctions among different types of political theologies (pluralist versus revelationist, traditionalist versus progressive); and, on the other, between two contrasting discourses and practices of human rights politics (hegemonic versus counter-hegemonic). Depending on the circumstances, even conventional or hegemonic human rights struggles may be a progressive tool against social practices and norms derived from traditionalist and revelationist theologies. Pluralist and progressive theologies, in turn, may be a source of <b>radical</b> <b>energy</b> toward more ambitious, counter-hegemonic human rights struggles...|$|E

The paradigm is given by the stock markets that have become more volatile after the financial crisis of 2007 – with impacts on all economical spheres. In recent years, a rather high volatility can also be observed in political processes, at least in democratic states. Furthermore, PR departments and marketing experts complain about a more erratic behaviour of consumers, quickly shifting demands and preferences. It seems obvious to regard increased connectivity and (social) media at least {{as one of the}} main catalysts of volatility. From systems theory we know that the volatility of system parameters increases when it approaches a tipping point [28]. Interestingly, energy markets are also affected by an important volatility, caused in parts by new technologies, but also by lifestyle changes.

40|$|Detailed {{mechanisms}} {{for the formation}} of hydroxyl or alkoxyl radicals in the reactions between tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCBQ) and organic hydroperoxides are crucial for better understanding the potential carcinogenicity of polyhalogenated quinones. Herein, the mechanism of the reaction between TCBQ and H 2 O 2 has been systematically investigated at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G** level of theory in the presence of different numbers of water molecules. We report that the whole reaction can easily take place with the assistance of explicit water molecules. Namely, an initial intermediate is formed first. After that, a nucleophilic attack of H 2 O 2 onto TCBQ occurs, which results in the formation of a second intermediate that contains an OOH group. Subsequently, this second intermediate decomposes homolytically through cleavage of the O-O bond to produce a hydroxyl <b>radical.</b> <b>Energy</b> analyses suggest that the nucleophilic attack is the rate-determining step in the whole reaction. The participation of explicit water molecules promotes the reaction significantly, which can be used to explain the experimental phenomena. In addition, the effects of F, Br, and CH 3 substituents on this reaction have also been studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{performances}} {{of a number}} of theoretical methods in the calculation of N-H bond dissociation <b>energies</b> and <b>radical</b> stabilization <b>energies</b> associated with the X-NH ¥ radicals were examined. It was found that the UHF, UMP 2, and UMP 4 methods were not reliable for the nitrogen radicals because of the spin contamination suffered by them. Surprisingly, the ROHF, ROMP 2, and ROB 3 LYP methods were not found to be reliable for the nitrogen radicals either, because they could lead to unrealistic spin-localization of the radical. This unrealistic spin-localization was even seen with the UCCSD(T) method. The only credible modest-level method for the nitrogen radical was found to be UB 3 LYP, which could provide at least qualitatively correct <b>radical</b> stabilization <b>energies</b> for the nitrogen radicals. The basis set effect on the UB 3 LYP calculation was also found to be very small. Nevertheless, G 3 and CBS-Q methods were found to be able to provide fairly accurate bond dissociation <b>energies</b> and <b>radical</b> stabilization <b>energies</b> for the substituted nitrogen radicals. According to G 3 and CBS-Q results, CH 3, NH 2, OH, F, Cl, and CN were assigned to be stabilizing substituents for the nitrogen radical, as these groups could effectively delocalize the odd electron on the nitrogen radical. By contrast, COCH 3, CONH 2, COOH, and CHO were assigned to be destabilizing substituents for the nitrogen radical, although these groups could also delocalize the odd electron on the nitrogen radical. The origin of the destabilization effect was found to be the loss of the conjugation between the NH 2 lone-pair electrons and the substituent from the neutral X-NH 2 molecule to the X-NH ¥ radical. 1...|$|R

(eds) London: Zed Books, pp 226 + xiii, pb, 2002 ISBN 1842771582] The {{focus of}} this book is the {{engagement}} and enmeshment of women's organisations inspired by contemporary feminism with state institutions and at the international level. The book attests to the phases of this process: global transmissions of radical social movement impulses; growth of supra-national networks of women's advocacy organisations; the pivotal importance of the five yearly UN Conferences on Women; and the growing 'entrism' of feminist NGOs to mainstream international organisations. Feminists and feminist NGOs have found themselves granted consultative status, appointed as insiders, successful in shaping policy documents and winning contracts. The question posed is one of impact. Has the process of engagement been 'transformative', {{in the sense of}} radically changing power relations between men and women via mainstream institutional practices?

40|$|The {{notion of}} ’fuel poverty’, {{referring}} to affordable warmth, underpins established {{research and policy}} agendas in the UK and has been extremely influential worldwide. In this context, British researchers, official policymaking bodies and NGOs have put forward the notion of ’transport poverty’, building on an implicit analogy between (recognised) fuel poverty and (neglected) transport affordability issues. However, the conceptual {{similarities and differences between}} ’fuel’ and ’transport’ poverty remain largely unaddressed in the UK. This paper systematically compares and contrasts the two concepts, examining critically the assumption of a simple equivalence between them. We illustrate similarities and differences under four headings: (i) negative consequences of lack of warmth and lack of access; (ii) drivers of fuel and transport poverty; (iii) definition and measurement; (iv) policy interventions. Our review suggests that there are important conceptual and practical differences between transport and domestic energy consumption, with crucial consequences for how affordability problems amongst households are to be conceptualised and addressed. In a context where transport and energy exhibit two parallel policy worlds, the analysis in the paper and these conclusions reinforce how and why these differences matter. As we embark on an ever closer union between our domestic energy and transport energy systems the importance of these contradictions will become increasingly evident and problematic. This work contributes to the long-term debate about how best to manage these issues in a <b>radical</b> <b>energy</b> transition that properly pays attention to issues of equity and affordability...|$|E

Only by switching to sustainable energy concepts and <b>radical</b> <b>energy</b> savings can realize the climate-friendly means of transportation. To achieve these goals new approaches to storage and conversion of electrical energy are needed. The ElectroGraph project follows an integrated, technology driven approach in development of novel materials and components for realization of optimized supercapacitators. Supercapacitators are considered one of the newest innovations in the field of electrical energy storage. In electrical vehicles, supercapacitators can bie coupled with batteries to deliver high power needed during acceleration as well as to recover the available energy during regenerative braking.

Development of production processes for materials, components and devices is an integral part of the project. At the end the performance of materials and components is to be demonstrated on the functional model. Together with the technological development, the experience-based understanding of appropriate practices for the safe production, processing and recycling of graphene nanomaterials is being generated, and will facilitate the development of guidance on risk management and best available techniques to minimize and control any health risks to manufacturers, downstream users and the environment...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of modern}} {{technology}} {{in the study of}} classic problems in chemistry has afforded researchers the opportunity to understand the dynamics of reactions on a molecular level. This thesis represents one such instance, where the combination of pulsed lasers and molecular beams has made the study of ultrafast reactions of isolated molecules possible. The optical technique is, in essence, a two pulse pump-probe method. One of the pulses resonantly excites the molecule to be studied, while the second one, delayed in time, measures the population in either the excited parent state or some quantum state of the product. The sample is cooled in a supersonic expansion and observed under collisionless conditions. Atomic and molecular species may be detected by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) or resonantly-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI), followed by mass-selective detection. The temporal evolution of the state being probed is mapped out as the delay between the pulses is varied. The resolution of this method is determined by the temporal widths of the two pulses, typically ~ 8 picoseconds in the studies presented here. The technique, termed Time-Resolved Photofragment Spectroscopy (TRPS), has been used to study a number of unimolecular reactions under collisionless conditions. Microcanonical rates of the reaction NCNO -> CN + NO have been measured for excitation energies near threshold. The rates are compared with predictions of various statistical theories, including a recently proposed variational method. State-selected studies of the production of iodine atoms in the UV photodissociation of 1, 2 — diiodotetrafluoroethane indicate the existence of a bound intermediate, the iodoperfluoroethyl <b>radical.</b> <b>Energy</b> dependent rates show that the amount of internal energy in the intermediate may be varied by changing excitation conditions, thereby affecting the rate of its decomposition.

40|$|Since {{historic}} buildings constitute 25 % of the European built environment {{they have a}} role to play in delivering CO 2 emissions reduction targets along with the rest of the domestic stock. However, {{historic buildings}} have significant cultural value and were built with technologies and materials that promote fabric breathability. This demands solutions that will deliver enduring and <b>radical</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency savings and emissions reduction, which while maintaining their heritage value are also capable of district wide replication. Before embarking on wide scale retrofit adaptations, affordable and accurate procedures to assess the potential for such measures to reduce CO 2 emissions are of primary importance. Some measures will have an impact on both fabric and aesthetics. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the reductions in CO 2 emissions from a set of proposed alterations are significantly higher than any actual or perceived reduction in loss of built heritage. This paper demonstrates the use of the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) modelling tool to assess the potential for retrofit adaptation measures in three terrace dwellings in Bath, England. It compares modelled against delivered energy use and then models energy and emission reduction following the introduction of a suite of retrofit adaptations. Results indicate that PHPP can assess total electrical energy consumption but requires the use of a reduction factor to reflect accurately intermittent occupancy/heating patterns. The modelled results suggest retrofit adaptations in historic buildings could deliver energy savings and CO 2 emissions savings between 55 % and 83 %, but only when the thermal fabric is significantly improved and the use of PV is included. PHPP provided assessments of the benefits of retrofit adaptations in historic buildings that can facilitate decision making on retrofit methodology in historic buildings that affect fabric and/or aesthetics...|$|E
40|$|Hart Crane's Queer Modernist Aesthetic' {{contends that}} to {{properly}} examine Crane's work, queerness and modernism, which are frequently {{thought to be}} contrary sites, must be considered together. The areas of experience which modernist writers sought to destabilise, such as the visual world, space, time, and the material world, were also destabilised by Crane's queerness. The <b>radical</b> <b>energy</b> of Crane's work is derived therefore from this dual aesthetic, and also from the conflicts that Crane generated within it, whether in terms of modernism (his adversarial approach to T. S. Eliot, or his continuing allegiance to Decadence and Walter Pater), or in queer terms, as Crane resisted the dominant heteronormative modernism by employing a queer negativity which asserted his own sexual identity against heteronormative futurity. Whilst acknowledging {{his reputation as a}} 'difficult' or 'obscure' poet, the thesis argues that a key component of Crane's queer aesthetic is his attempt to produce a relational poetics, as he seeks to make a connection with his reader. Chapter One, 'Visuality, American Decadence, and the Evolution of Crane's Style', examines the influence upon Crane of two queer antecedents, Oscar Wilde and Walter Pater. Chapter Two, 'Spatiality, Movement, and the Logic of Metaphor', employs the philosophical work of Henri Lefebvre, Gaston Bachelard, and Michel de Certeau to show how Crane uses various forms of spatial practice and production to challenge heteronormativity. Chapter Three, 'Temporality, Futurity, and Self- Consciousness', pays particular attention to the 'Voyages' sequence and The Bridge in order to discuss ways in which Crane's poetry challenges normative, linear time, especially futurity. Finally, Chapter Four, 'Materiality, Experience, and Knowledge', explores Crane's queer theories of knowledge and experience, which are frequently represented in his prose and poetry as a relationship between materiality and immateriality. In analysing Crane's work the thesis draws upon a range of unpublished archival material, examines in detail Crane's visual influences for the first time, and offers a genetic reading of one particular sequence of poems. In its consideration of the various dimensions of Crane's aesthetic, the thesis seeks to provide a thorough examination of Crane's experience as it is presented in his poetry from his earliest juvenilia in the 1910 s through to his final published poem in 1932.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of Cl atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol {{have been studied}} by calculation of quasi-classical trajectories, with computation of potential energies and gradients only at the geometries through which the trajectories pass. Trajectories were started from the transition state, with 2 kcal mol − 1 of energy given to the mode with an imaginary frequency (representing the reaction coordinate at the transition state) and inclusion of zero-point energy in {{some or all of}} the remaining vibrational modes. The trajectories were propagated as far as separated products, with the majority of potential energy calculations performed at the HF/ 6 - 31 G level of theory. The rotational quantum state population distributions of the HCl products from the reactions of Cl atoms with methane, ethane and methanol peaked at J′ = 1, 2, and 6, respectively. The calculations thereby exhibit somewhat greater rotational excitation than is found experimentally, but correctly describe the trend of increasing HCl product rotation for the three respective reactions. In agreement with previous observations, only 4 % of the energy available to the products of the reaction of Cl atoms with methane was channeled into CH 3 <b>radical</b> internal <b>energy,</b> and 1 % into HCl rotation, with 92 % ending up as translational energy. For the reaction of Cl atoms with ethane and with methanol, the corresponding values for <b>radical</b> internal <b>energy,</b> HCl rotation and product translation are 21, 3, and 78 %, and 46, 13, and 42 %, respectively. For the latter two reactions, the <b>radical</b> internal <b>energy</b> is mostly accounted for by rotational motion. The clear increase in rotational excitation of the HCl products from the Cl atom reaction with methanol is explained in terms of a dipole-dipole interaction between the departing polar fragments. A smaller set of more computationally expensive trajectory calculations using potentials and gradients from the MP 2 / 6 - 311 G(d,p) level of theory were performed for reactions of Cl atoms with methanol, and give results in better agreement with experimentally measured HCl rotational excitation, consistent with the model of dipole-induced product rotation because the MP 2 / 6 - 311 G(d,p) calculations give smaller dipole moments for both products than the HF/ 6 - 31 G calculations.

40|$|The bond {{dissociation}} <b>energies</b> (BDEs) and <b>radical</b> stabilization <b>energies</b> (RSEs) which {{result from}} 166 reactions {{that lead to}} carbon-centered radicals of the type ˙CH₂X, ˙CHXY and ˙CXYZ, where X, Y and Z are any of the fourteen substituents H, F, Cl, NH₂, OH, SH, CH=CH₂, C≡CH, BH₂, CHO, COOH, CN, CH₃, and CF₃, were calculated using spin-restricted and -unrestricted variants of the double-hybrid B 2 -PLYP method with the 6 - 311 +G(3 df, 2 p) basis set. The interactions of substituents X, Y, and Z in both the radicals (˙CXYZ) and in the precursor closed-shell molecules (CHXYZ), {{as well as the}} extent of additivity of such interactions, were investigated by calculating <b>radical</b> interaction <b>energies</b> (RIEs), molecule interaction energies (MIEs), and deviations from additivity of RSEs (DARSEs) for a set of 152 reactions that lead to di- (˙CHXY) and tri- (˙CXYZ) substituted carbon-centered radicals. The pairwise quantities describing the effects of pairs of substituents in trisubstituted systems, namely pairwise MIEs (PMIEs), pairwise RIEs (PRIEs) and deviations from pairwise additivity of RSEs (DPARSEs), were also calculated for the set of 61 reactions that lead to trisubstituted radicals (˙CXYZ). Both ROB 2 -PLYP and UB 2 -PLYP were found to perform quite well in predicting the quantities related to the stabilities of carbon-centered radicals when compared with available experimental data and with the results obtained from the high-level composite method G 3 X(MP 2) -RAD. Particular selections of substituents or combinations of substituents from the current test set were found to lead to specially stable radicals, increasing the RSEs to a maximum of + 68. 2 kJ mol⁻¹ for monosubstituted radicals ˙CH₂X (X = CH≡CH₂), + 131. 7 kJ mol⁻¹ for disubstituted radicals ˙CHXY (X = NH₂, Y = CHO), and + 177. 1 kJ mol⁻¹ for trisubstituted radicals ˙CXYZ (X = NH 2, Y = Z = CHO) ...|$|R
40|$|A zero-field {{electron}} spin resonance spectrometer is described for measuring the spectra of spin-correlated radical ion pairs in solution in the frequency range 1 - 80 MHz. The radical ions are created by continuous optical irradiation and rapidly recombine to form an exciplex whose fluorescence is monitored as the radiofrequency is swept, also continuously. The probability of recombination depends upon the singlet character of the radical pair {{at the time that}} the radicals re-encounter after an initial separation in the formation step. This is affected directly by resonant state mixing induced within the <b>radical</b> pair <b>energy</b> manifold by the applied radiofrequency field. The method yields the spectrum of the radical pair and also allows direct observation of the effects of radiofrequency radiation on the yields of products formed from radical combination reactions...|$|R
40|$|Single {{crystals}} of 2 -(triphenylphosphoranylidene) {{succinic anhydride}} have been X-irradiated and studied by electron paramagnetic resonance/electron nuclear double resonance (EPR/ENDOR) spectroscopy after determination of their crystal structure. The trapped radical {{results from the}} departure of a hydrogen atom bound to a carbon located to both a CP and a CO bond. The resulting hyperfine coupling tensors are compared with those obtained from ab initio calculations on H 3 PCH—H—CHO (1) and are interpreted in terms of spin delocalization on the succinic anhydride ring. The <b>radical</b> stabilization <b>energies</b> have been calculated for H 3 PCH—H—CHO and H 2 P—CH 2 —H—CHO; they agree {{with the presence of}} a captodative effect. Owing to the charge separation caused by the contribution of the mesomeric phosphonium–enolate structure, this effect is more pronounced for the phosphoranylidene compound...|$|R
