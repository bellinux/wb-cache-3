Nine beams {{strengthened}} with helical <b>rib</b> steel <b>wire</b> near-surface mounted(NSM) in {{the concrete}} cover under monotonous loads are tested, and cyclic loading, security, delay and bending deformation of reinforced concrete beams are systematically studied. Test results indicate that NSM helical <b>rib</b> steel <b>wire</b> can overcome the peeling of the strengthening material from externally bonded FRP laminates. Compared with non-strengthened beam. The strengthened beams can significantly improve its ultimate capacity, and the increase could {{be as much as}} 130. 92 %.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{research on}} 13 beams with nonprestressed and prestressed helical <b>rib</b> steel <b>wire</b> bonded in sawed grooves {{in the concrete}} cover under monotonous loads based {{on the lack of}} old strengthening methods. The prestressing, stressing process, first-crack load, steel-yielding load, ultimate load at failure and deformation are systematically studied. The results from the tests show that this new strengthening technique using helical <b>rib</b> steel <b>wire</b> bonding in the concrete cover is an efficient method, which can overcome the problems with peeling of the strengthening material when the surface bonded FRP laminates, also overcome the shortages of nonprestressed beams. The prestressed beams exhibited higher first-crack load, higher steel-yielding load, as well as a larger deformation capacity as compared to nonprestressed strengthened beams, which is important for a construction s lifetime; the fatigue behavior will improve and as a consequence the crack widths will be smaller, which can result in increased durability, which should indicate a more advantageous behavior in the service limit state (SLS). However, the ultimate load at failure is as high as nonprestressed beams, but in relation not as large as for the cracking and yielding. The ultimate load at failure is also higher as compared to non strengthened beams. The results provide a reference for engineering application...|$|R

5000|$|In South Africa, a potjie , {{directly}} translated [...] "pottle {{or little}} pot" [...] from Afrikaans or Dutch, is unlike most other Dutch ovens, {{in that it}} is round bottomed. Traditionally, it is a single cast, cast-iron pot, reinforced with external double or triple circumscribing <b>ribs,</b> a <b>wire</b> handle for suspending the pot, and three short legs for resting the pot. It is similar in appearance to a cauldron. It has a cast-iron lid with a recessed convex contour to allow for hot coals to lie on top, so that the pot may also be heated from above, and a handle. When the vessel is to be stored long term, care must be taken to avoid rust forming, this is accomplished by coating it in a non-toxic oil, such as cooking oil. This act ensures that the vessel remains in a seasoned state. [...] "Potjie" [...] can also refer to the technique of cooking potjiekos. Among the recipes which require a potjie, there is one for a type of bread called [...] "potbrood", which literally means [...] "pot bread".|$|R
50|$|While the Sakasa Kebari tends {{toward a}} simplistic tying {{approach}} {{there are many}} variants that are more complex. Some {{use a combination of}} silk, pheasant tail fibers, <b>wire</b> <b>ribbing,</b> and other materials to construct the body. While most are unweighted, bead heads and lead wrapping can be used to apply weight so the fly can be fished deeper than otherwise possible. While the Sakasa Kebari is usually associated with being a wet fly (a fly that is fished beneath the surface) it can also be fished dry (on the surface) simply by modifying technique, applying floatant, or even using a dry fly hackle instead of the standard wet fly hackle.|$|R
2500|$|The thick wings {{were based}} on a pair of spruce I-section spars with spruce <b>ribs</b> and {{internal}} <b>wire</b> bracing. [...] The inner section and interplane struts were of streamlined steel tube; ailerons were carried on upper and lower wings. [...] The Lympne aircraft were aimed at the private owner, for whom transport and storage might be an important issue, so the Gannet's wings were hinged at the rear spar so they could be folded back along the fuselage. [...] Both wing centre section trailing edges folded to permit the wing-folding; the upper section was also folded up to aid access to the cockpit. [...] The 2 imp. gallon (9.1 litre) fuel tank was in the upper centre section.|$|R
2500|$|Around this time, various French {{manufacturers}} like Voisin and Farman {{were hoping}} to improve the stability of aircraft against gusts by using wings that were partly flexible like those of birds and the Caudron Types M and N also included this feature. Each wing had two steel tube, wood filled spars, one {{at the leading edge}} and the other [...] aft, a little behind one third chord, with ash <b>ribs</b> and <b>wire</b> bracing. The number of ribs varied between 10, 11 and 12 and they were conventionally rigid between the spars. Behind the rear spar the upper part of each rib was also rigid, ending at about 70% chord; the lower part was completed by a thin, flexible extension strip for about 60% of the chord. The wing was then fabric covered, though the flexible portion was only covered on the upper side. The wings were supported from above by landing wires from a four-legged pylon above the fuselage and by lifting wires from another below, shorter on the Type N than on the Type M. On the latter the tip of the lower pylon was braced by a horizontal, longitudinal strut to the centre of the undercarriage frame. Lateral control was by wing warping.|$|R

A 3 -dimensional CFD analysis {{has been carried out}} to study heat transfer and fluid flow behavior in a rectangular duct of a solar air heater with one roughened wall having combination of circularand square transverse <b>wire</b> <b>rib</b> roughness. The effect of Reynolds number, roughness height, roughness pitch, relative roughness pitch and relative roughness height on the heat transfer coefficient and friction factor have been studied. In order to validate the present numerical model, results have been compared with available experimental results under similar flow conditions. CFD Investigation has been carried out in medium Reynolds number flow (Re ¼ 3800 e 18, 000). Average Nusselt number increases with an increase of Reynolds number. The maximum value of average Nusselt number is found to be 43. 577 for relative roughness pitch of 5 and for relative roughness height of 0. 06 at a higher Reynolds number, 10, 000.
