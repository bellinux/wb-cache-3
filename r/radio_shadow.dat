40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of cognitive radio systems will depend critically {{on the ability}} of the secondary user to relinquish borrowed spectrum when it’s interference level at the primary user exceeds a certain threshold. Hence, in this paper we investigate the temporal behaviour of this interference power. In particular, we derive the level crossing rate (LCR) of the power. This gives the rate at which a cognitive radio’s interference level increases above the acceptable threshold. The LCR is derived for the case of lognormal shadow fading and two different mobility models. The results cater for temporal variations in both shadowing and distance. The basic nature of the LCR appears to be insensitive to the mobility model and suggests that a simple Gaussian LCR {{can be used as a}} good approximation in a broad range of cases.

40|$|AbstractEven {{though the}} {{potential}} for an accident in nuclear power plants is very low, multiple emergency plans are necessary because the impact of such an accident to the public is enormous. One of these emergency plans involves a robotic system for investigating accidents under conditions of high radiation and contaminated air. To develop a robot suitable for operation in a nuclear power plant, we focused on eliminating the three major obstacles that challenge robots in such conditions: the disconnection of radio communication, falling on uneven floors, and loss of localization. To solve the radio problem, a Wi-Fi extender was used in <b>radio</b> <b>shadow</b> areas. To reinforce the walking, we developed two- and four-leg convertible walking, a floor adaptive foot, a roly-poly defensive falling design, and automatic standing recovery after falling methods were developed. To allow the robot to determine its location in the containment building, a bar code landmark reading method was chosen. When a severe accident occurs, this robot will be useful for accident condition monitoring. We also anticipate the robot {{can serve as a}} workman aid in a high radiation area during normal operations...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for data in mobile applications {{has created a}} need for better communications systems. To satisfy this growing data demand next generation wireless systems are planned to use millimetre wave carrier frequencies. At these frequencies, <b>radio</b> <b>shadowing</b> is severe. To compensate for shadowing, incoming data flows must therefore be split and sent over several radio interfaces, that may have different delay properties. This paper analyses the stability properties of a MIMO data splitter that controls the delay skew between the data paths. The stability analysis is performed using IQC stability theory...|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce costs and {{increase}} revenues at mines, there is a strong incentive to develop high-resolution techniques both for near-mine exploration and for delineation of known orebodies To investigate the potential of high-frequency EM techniques for exploration and delineation of massive sulfide orebodies, radio frequency electromagnetic (RFEM) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were conducted in boreholes through the McConnell massive nickel-copper sulfide body near Sudbury, Ontario, from 1993 - 1996. Crosshole RFEM data were acquired with a JW- 4 electric dipole system between two boreholes on section 2720 W. Ten frequencies between 0. 5 and 5. 0 MHz were recorded. Radio signals propagated through the Sudbury Breccia over ranges of at least 150 m at all frequencies. The resulting radio absorption tomogram clearly imaged the McConnell deposit over 110 m downdip. Signal was extinguished when either antenna entered the sulfide body. However, the expected <b>radio</b> <b>shadow</b> did not eventuate when transmitter and receiver were {{on opposite sides of the}} deposit. Two-dimensional modeling suggested that diffraction around the edges of the sulfide body could not account for the observed held amplitudes. It was concluded at the time that the sulfide body is discontinuous; according to modeling, a gap as small as 5 m could have explained the observations. Subsequent investigations by INCO established that pick-up in the metal-cored downhole cables was actually responsible for the elevated signal levels. Both single-hole reflection profiles and crosshole measurements were acquired using RAMAC borehole radar systems, operating at 60 MHz. Detection of radar reflections from the sulfide contact was problematic. One coherent reflection was observed from the hanging-wall contact in single-hole reflection mode. This reflection could be traced about 25 m uphole from the contact. In addition to unfavorable survey geometry, factors which may have suppressed reflections included host rock heterogeneity, disseminated sulfides, and contact irregularity. Velocity and absorption tomograms were generated in the Sudbury Breccia host rock from the crosshole radar. Radar velocity was variable, averaging 125 m/mus, while absorption was typically 0. 8 dB/m at 60 MHz. Kirchhoff-style 2 -D migration of later arrivals in the crosshole radargrams defined reflective zones that roughly parallel the inferred edge of the sulfide body. The McConnell high-frequency EM surveys established that radio tomography and simple radio shadowing are potentially valuable for near- and in-mine exploration and orebody delineation in the Sudbury Breccia. The effectiveness of borehole radar in this particular environment is less certain...|$|E

40|$|NGC 4261 (3 C 270) is a low-luminosity {{radio galaxy}} with two {{symmetric}} kiloparsec-scale jets. Earlier Hubble Space Telescope observations indicated {{the presence of}} a hundred-parsec scale disk of cool dust and gas surrounding a central, supermassive (∼ 4. 9 × 10 8 M⊙) black hole.

40|$|Abstract — In {{an effort}} to better {{understand}} connectivity and capacity in wireless networks, the log-normal <b>shadowing</b> <b>radio</b> propagation model is used to capture radio irregularities and obstacles in the transmission path. Existing results indicate that lognormal shadowing results in higher connectivity and interference levels as shadowing (i. e., the radio irregularity) increases. In this paper we demonstrate that such a behavior is mainly caused by an unnatural bias of the log-normal <b>shadowing</b> <b>radio</b> propagation model that results in a larger transmission range as shadowing increases. To avoid this effect, we analyze connectivity and interference under log-normal shadowing using a normalization that compensates for the enlarged radio transmission range. Our analysis shows that log-normal shadowing still improves the connectivity of a wireless network and even reduces interference. We explain this behavior by studying in detail what network parameters are affected by shadowing. Our results indicate that, {{when it comes to}} connectivity and interference, an analysis based on a circular transmission range leads to worst case results. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{promotion}} {{paper is}} dedicated to the development of optimal frequency supervision methods suitable for the territory of Latvia for wireless communication systems. Already existing technical and economical methods of frequency supervision are studied in the paper. Criteria for the evaluation of radiofrequency spectrum utilization efficiency have been raised and coefficients for the improvement of radio wave propagation models have been found experimentally. Based on experiments carried out within the promotion paper and study results, methods for optimal frequency planning, the evaluation of frequency spectrum utilization efficiency and the evaluation of loss of wireless communication system channel capacity have been developed. The Okumura - Hata and Walfish - Ikegami models have been chosen and adapted as being the most suitable for the region of Latvia. A method for the calculation of <b>radio</b> <b>shadows</b> has been developed in order to improve the precision of calculus in densely built-up areas. The determined propagation models were analysed and recommendations were established for choosing the values of reflection and diffraction coefficients characterizing Latvian regional architecture. Economical methods were developed for charging mobile communications operators for the use of spectrum. The technical and economical methods developed in the promotion paper are the first of their kind in the field of radio frequency supervision in Latvia. Implementation {{of the results of the}} work will facilitate radio frequency spectrum utilization effectiveness in Latvia, the development of mobile radio communication systems, and improve work of the Telecommunication Administration.
