5|$|Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} fungi. Serious {{pathogens}} of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the <b>rice</b> <b>blast</b> fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut blight, and plant pathogens in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., <b>rice</b> <b>blast</b> disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E

40|$|The {{integrated}} management of <b>rice</b> leaf <b>blast</b> (Magnaporthe oryzae) {{is carried out}} mainly with the adoption of chemical control. However, the search for alternative practices has grown in recent years. Thus, the variability of 28 Sarocladium oryzae isolates was evaluated for the cerulenin production, {{as well as its}} potential for reducing the severity of <b>rice</b> leaf <b>blast,</b> quantifying the activity of enzymes linked to the plant defense mechanisms. More than 55 % of the S. oryzae isolates were antagonistic to the pathogens M. oryzae, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, Thanatephorus cucumeris and Monographella albescens, and 60 % of the isolates produced cerulenin at detectable levels. Both BRM 6461 (296. 0 µg mL- 1) and BRM 6493 (undetectable cerulenin) inhibited the formation of M. oryzae appressoria in 89. 5 % and 85 %, respectively. The BRM 6461 isolate, applied as conidial suspension and filtered, reduced the severity of <b>rice</b> leaf <b>blast</b> in 68. 8 % and 75. 5 %, respectively. The enzymatic activity in the presence of M. oryzae was higher for lipoxygenase at 5 h (filtered) and at 24 h and 72 h (conidial suspension) after the pathogen inoculation. For phenylalanine ammonia lyase, the highest expression was at 5 h (filtered) and 72 h (conidial suspension). The enzymes chitinase, β- 1, 3 -glucanase and peroxidase and the salicylic acid phytohormone presented no differences, in relation to the controls (water and M. oryzae). The filtered from the BRM 6461 isolate, basically constituted by cerulenin, reduced the severity of <b>rice</b> leaf <b>blast</b> and possibly activated the defense mechanisms of the rice plants against M. oryzae...|$|R

Here, backcrossing is carried out until a desired level of recombination has occurred and genetic markers are used to detect desired recombinant chromosome substitution lines in the target region, which can be fixed by doubled haploidy.

30|$|Numerous {{genes in}} rice plants are rapidly or {{strongly}} activated {{at the transcriptional level}} by various pathogen attacks. Some of these genes are vital {{in the perception}} of pathogen infection (Nasir et al. 2017). Some other genes can be induced by plant hormones that include SA, JA, ET and brassinosteroid (Shigenaga and Argueso 2016; Yang et al. 2013). These plant hormones have been demonstrated as secondary signals after pathogen attack. Some genes are implicated in different primary and secondary metabolic pathways (Cho and Lee 2015). Another group of genes, named pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, has often been found to be induced in defense against pathogens (van Loon et al. 2006). Some genes, including transcription factor genes and PR genes, in other species, were observed to be strongly activated after inoculation with pathogens (Zander et al. 2014; Sohn et al. 2006; Meng et al. 2013).
