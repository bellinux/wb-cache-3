The mathematical model represents a linear elasticity system with a fading Gassman tensor as the crack grows, that is coupled with a variational inequality for the phase field variable containing an entropy inequality. We introduce a novel incremental approximation that decouples displacement and phase field problems. We establish convergence to a solution of the quasistatic problem, including <b>Rice's</b> <b>condition,</b> when the time discretization step goes to zero.

Yield forecasts {{are based on the}} eco-physiological process of rice growth given measurable rice crop characteristics and weather data at intermediate times in the growing season of the rice crop. The ORYZA 1 model is used to simulate a database containing rice yields and <b>rice</b> crop <b>conditions</b> at specified times during the growing season. The model was ran on 32 years of historical weather data (1959 - 1990) from the meteorological station at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Los Baños(121 15 E Latitude: 14 11 N Altitude: 21. 0 m), Laguna, Philippines. As input to the model, the study adopted the parameters on one of the representative yield potential field experiments at IRRI during the 1992 dry season for the IR 72 variety planted on a 15 x 15 m 2 plot. Based on the output of ORYZA 1, a Markov Chain (matrix of transition probabilities) was constructed to provide forecast distributions of rice yield for various <b>rice</b> <b>condition</b> classes at different rice phenological stages prior to harvest. This Markov Chain can provide several statistics of interests. This ranges from mean, percentile (median) and standard error of the forecasts to probability interval forecasts and predicted probabilities of exceeding (or falling bellow) target yields. The simulated rice yield obtained from ORYZA 1 model for 32 years ranged from 8. 33 to 10. 88 ton ha- 1 with an average of 9. 57 ton ha- 1 and a standard deviation of 0. 60 ton ha- 1. Forecasted yields from the matrix of transition probabilities ranged from 8. 58 to 9. 45 ton ha- 1 and standard deviations ranging from 0. 39 to 0. 60 ton ha- 1.

A ﬁeld study {{was carried out}} in an intermittent ﬂooded rice ﬁeld at central Portugal to investigate if global warming under Mediterranean conditions, elevated soil temperature (þ 2 $C) and atmospheric [CO 2] (550 ppm), could lead to signiﬁcant effects in CH 4 and N 2 O emissions. The experimental design consisted of three treatments arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. To assess the effects of ambient temperature and actual atmospheric [CO 2] (375 ppm), plots were laid under open-ﬁeld <b>rice</b> <b>conditions.</b> Using open-top chambers, two other treatments were established: one to assess the effect of elevated temperature and actual atmospheric [CO 2] and a third treatment to evaluate the combined effect of elevated temperature and atmospheric [CO 2]. Measurements of CH 4 and N 2 O ﬂuxes were made throughout two consecutive growing seasons in the ﬁeld using the closed chamber technique. Elevation of temperature with or without elevated atmospheric [CO 2] increased CH 4 emissions by 50 %, but this increase was not signiﬁcant compared to the open-ﬁeld condition. As for N 2 O, elevated temperature alone or combined with elevated atmospheric [CO 2] had no signiﬁcant effect on emissions relative to the open-ﬁeld treatment. The estimated seasonal CH 4 EF for the Portuguese ﬂooded rice ﬁelds was 10. 0 g CH 4 m" 2, while the EF for N 2 O emissions was 1. 4 % of N input.

40|$|The value {{chains of}} rice {{has created a}} {{significant}} impact in the domestic rice price {{as well as in}} Indonesia. As we know from many literatures that providing rice product in time and at different places in the market is very important, especially in Indonesia. The facts that import rice is cheaper than domestic rice price has give a negative impact to the farmers. Thus, the performance of a value chains of rice is related to its structure and strategies of the actors operating these chains or channels are important to be considered by government. Value chain analysis is the sequence analysis of related business activities (functions) from specific inputs for a particular product to primary production, transformation, marketing and up to final consumption. In other words, we can say that value chains is perfoming several functions i. e start from producer (rice producer or farmers), processors (farmer or trader), traders (retailer or wholesaler) and transporter (transportation and storage are important functions in the rice channel distributuion system). Reffering to the description of the rice market in Indonesia, we would like to emphasize that there is some room for value chains based on informal collaboration concering exchange information and financial arrangement between farmers and rice traders and rice traders to others.

30|$|Asian {{cultivated}} rice, Oryza sativa, {{is thought}} to have originated from the Asian wild rice Oryza rufipogon only about 10, 000 years ago, although the place and time of its domestication are still debated [8, 18, 22, 28]. All wild Oryza species are distributed in the tropics and subtropics, whereas O. sativa has spread worldwide between 53 °N and 40 °S, and this wide range must have resulted from adaptive selection following its domestication [26]. Oryza comprises two cultivated and 22 wild species, with ten distinct genome types (AA, BB, BBCC, CC, CCDD, EE, FF, GG, HHJJ, and HHKK), which provide a good system for analyzing the mechanisms of evolution, speciation, and domestication by means of comparative genomics [1, 11]. Two major factors associated with climate change across the range of <b>rice</b> cultivation <b>conditions</b> (day length and temperature) are believed to have {{played a critical role in}} the spread of rice cultivation based on adaptation of the species to different areas and cropping seasons. Cultivated rice, known as a short-day plant in its original provenance in low-latitude areas, differentiates its panicle largely based on its photoperiod sensitivity. Heading of rice is promoted by short days and delayed by long days. In contrast with rice grown in the tropics and subtropics under warm <b>conditions,</b> <b>rice</b> grown at higher latitudes must respond to long-day conditions for its flowering during the summer because low autumn temperatures could greatly affect its pollen fertility. This indicates that early heading and weak or absent photoperiod sensitivity are essential for rice cultivars to be able to adapt to the climate changes that occur in northern areas of China and Japan. It is thereafter both agriculturally important and scientifically interesting to understand the control of genes involved in the flowering time of rice and its underlying evolutionary mechanisms.|$|R
