40|$|The paper {{aimed to}} study the {{influence}} of two cultivars: Crisby and Karistan, with a different maturation length, upon economic efficiency in watermelon growing in an experiment <b>running</b> on <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> at SC Casa Pepenilor Verzi SRLDabuleni, Dolj County, Romania in the year 2011. The experience was organized on 1. 25 ha divided into 2 plots: V 1 -cultivated with Crisby F 1 cultivar, an extra-early type and V 2 -cultivated with Karistan cultivar, a tardy type. The main economic indicators followed in the experiment have been the following ones: watermelon yield, production cost, income, profit, profit rate and gross margin. Crisby cultivar produced 30 t fruit per ha, starting from the 1 st part of June when the selling price was Lei 1. 2 /kg and assured Lei 22, 611 profit/ha. Karistan cultivar generated 70 t fruit per surface unit beginning from the 2 nd part of July when the selling price was Lei 0. 3 /kg and produced Lei 6, 051 profit per ha. As a conclusion, {{the use of an}} extra-early cultivar could assure a more efficient watermelon growing because fruit could be delivered earlier in the market covering in a better way consumer’s demand and increasing producers’ income and profit...|$|R

To improve the fertility of <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> as media growth for Jatropha curcas, clay and organic matter may have important role when they are incorporated to the <b>sandy</b> <b>soil.</b> This study investigated the effect of irrigation interval and incorporation of clay together with organic matter to <b>sandy</b> <b>soil</b> on soil organic C, N, and K and growth of J. curcas.

The sandy materials in the central coastal Vietnam originate from mostly in situ weathering of granite although aeolian sediments are parent materials for <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> also. <b>Sandy</b> <b>soils</b> have {{a wide range of}} limiting factors for agricultural production, including nutrient deficiencies, acidity, low water holding capacity and wind erosion risk (on coastal dunal sands).

Developing integrated nutrient management practices are needed to improve soil physical, chemical and biological fertilities of <b>sandy</b> <b>soils.</b> For example, systematic use of farmyard manures, crop residues, green manures, and alley cropping need to be considered. Developing integrated nutrient management practices also need to address environmental considerations by matching nutrient applications to crop needs and amending soils to minimise nutrient losses to water.

40|$|<b>Sandy</b> <b>soils</b> {{are often}} {{considered}} as soils with physical properties that are easily defined, however {{they are far}} from being simple. This is particularly the case for <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> in the tropics where they are subjected to a cycle of wetting and drying associated with seasonality. In this respect small changes in composition lead to significant differences of physical properties. One of the major soil characteristics {{to be taken into}} account is the size distribution of the sand grains. If fine sand induces greater porosity, water retention and resistance to penetration than coarse sand, they exhibit lower permeability. Porosity decreases when the heterogeneity of the sand grain distribution increases leading to an increase in resistance to penetration and decreases in permeability. The presence of silt particles leads to similar consequences. Thus, silty sands are more compact than <b>sandy</b> <b>soils,</b> most silt particles occupying the voids between sand grains thereby reducing porosity and consequently permeability. Size distribution and mineralogy of silt and clay sized particles that are associated with sand grains are also responsible for variations in physical properties of tropical <b>sandy</b> <b>soils.</b> Under tropical environments, <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> undergo significant weathering to depth thus resulting in a mineralogy where quartz the dominant mineral in the sand and silt fraction and forms a significant proportion of the clay sized fraction. On the other hand, <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> can be present in the lower part of the landscape where clays or salts form during the dry season. As a consequence, <b>sandy</b> <b>soils</b> with similar particle size distribution but due to differences in mineralogy of the clay sized fraction that represents not more than a few percent of th...|$|R
