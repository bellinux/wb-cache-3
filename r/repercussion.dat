5|$|Bakshi's frustrations {{with his}} failing {{marriage}} {{and the state of}} the planet further drove his need to animate. In 1959, he moved his desk to join the rest of the animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: a hat floating on water and Deputy Dawg, the lead character of one of Terrytoons' syndicated television series, running. Despite threats of <b>repercussion</b> from the animators' union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E
5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} {{erupted in the}} wake of the Great Recession around late 2009, and was {{characterized}} by an environment of overly high government structural deficits and accelerating debt levels. When, as a negative <b>repercussion</b> of the Great Recession, the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses, most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans, because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy. As of January 2009, a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a bailout. At the time, the European Commission released a forecast of a 1.8% decline in EU economic output for 2009, making the outlook for the banks even worse. The many public funded bank recapitalizations were one reason behind the sharply deteriorated debt-to-GDP ratios experienced by several European governments {{in the wake of}} the Great Recession. The main root causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in Europe were reportedly a mix of: weak actual and potential growth; competitive weakness; liquidation of banks and sovereigns; large pre-existing debt-to-GDP ratios; and considerable liability stocks (government, private, and non-private sector).|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} receives several surgical {{residents from}} Mercy West {{as they enter}} Seattle Grace, a <b>repercussion</b> of the recent merger. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is recovering from her liver transplantation surgery, after donating a portion of it to her father. In the residents' lounge, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) tries to explain to Mercy West resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner) that she should not use a certain locker, due to it formerly belonging to the deceased Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). Adamson ignores her wishes, and uses the locker, leading Stevens to threatening to fight her. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are working in the emergency room, when Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) embarrasses Yang by taking Mercy West resident Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams)' side in a disagreement. Despite her mindset that all Mercy West residents would act {{in the manner of}} Adamson, Stevens develops a friendship with Dr. Charles Percy (Robert Baker). After months of the two not speaking, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez)'s father, Carlos (Héctor Elizondo), shows up to the hospital with a priest, trying to condemn Torres for her concurrence in homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>repercussion,</b> {{the power of}} animal metamorphosis, or of sending out a familiar, real or spiritual, as a messenger, and the supernormal powers conferred by association with such a familiar, are also attributed to the magician, male and female, all the world over; and witch superstitions are closely parallel to, if not identical with, lycanthropic beliefs, the occasional involuntary character of lycanthropy being almost the sole distinguishing feature. In another direction the {{phenomenon of}} <b>repercussion</b> is asserted to manifest itself {{in connection with the}} bush-soul of the West African and the nagual of Central America; but though there is no line of demarcation to be drawn on logical grounds, the assumed power of the magician and the intimate association of the bush-soul or the nagual with a human being are not termed lycanthropy. Nevertheless, it will be well to touch on both these beliefs here.|$|E

25|$|Eunuchs {{supposedly}} did {{not generally}} have loyalties to the military, the aristocracy, or {{to a family}} of their own (having neither offspring nor in-laws, at the very least), and were thus seen as more trustworthy and less interested in establishing a private 'dynasty'.

25|$|The beliefs classed {{together}} under lycanthropy {{are far from}} uniform, and the term is somewhat capriciously applied. The transformation may be temporary or permanent; the were-animal may be the man himself metamorphosed; may be his double whose activity leaves the real man to all appearance unchanged; may be his soul, which goes forth seeking whomever it may devour, leaving its body {{in a state of}} trance; or it may be no more than the messenger of the human being, a real animal or a familiar spirit, whose intimate connection with its owner is shown by the fact that any injury to it is believed, by a phenomenon known as <b>repercussion,</b> to cause a corresponding injury to the human being.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the oral}} {{teaching}} tradition of Gregorian chant, modern reconstruction of intended rhythm from the written notation of Gregorian chant {{has always been}} a source of debate among modern scholars. To complicate matters further, many ornamental neumes used in the earliest manuscripts pose difficulties on the interpretation of rhythm. Certain neumes such as the pressus, pes quassus, strophic neumes may indicate repeated notes, lengthening by <b>repercussion,</b> in some cases with added ornaments. By the 13th century, with the widespread use of square notation, most chant was sung with an approximately equal duration allotted to each note, although Jerome of Moravia cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened.|$|E

25|$|In Overwatchs Asia servers, {{there were}} {{problems}} with numerous players using hacks tied to {{the growing number of}} younger players using PC bangs in South Korea that allow them to play Overwatch on an inexpensive hourly rate rather than purchasing the game.

Blizzard continues to block these accounts at a rate of thousands per day, but {{have not been able to}} find a more permanent solution. Subsequently, Blizzard announced that players from South Korea will be required to log into a Battle.net account to play the game from February 2017 onward, which requires a difficult-to-spoof resident registration number among other unique information, which Blizzard believes will help to alleviate the problem.|$|E
25|$|In Washington, President Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{decided that}} the defeat of Jackson was an {{immediate}} priority (even though Jackson's orders were solely to keep Union forces occupied away from Richmond).

The immediate <b>repercussion</b> of this move was to abort McDowell's coordinated attack with McClellan on Richmond. Starting on May 29, while two columns of Union forces pursued him, Jackson started pushing his army in a forced march southward to escape the pincer movements, marching forty miles in thirty-six hours.

After Colvert was injured during a struggle over the gun, Starkweather killed him with a shot to the head. He immediately confessed to Fugate that he had only robbed Colvert but that someone else had killed him. Fugate later told police that she did not believe Starkweather's story, but pretended to go along out of fear.

25|$|Born in Frumușica, {{a village}} of Botoșani County, the future writer belonged to the Jewish Romanian community. His father was a cattle trader, and Ornea often helped in the family {{business}} by tending to the animals (an experience which left him with fond memories). He was a cousin of Romanian-born Israeli writer Mariana Juster, who later left details on their early life. According to her account, Ornea spent the years before World War II in his native village, until all Jews in the nation's rural areas were expelled with the acquiescence of the antisemitic regime of Conducător Ion Antonescu, and thereafter forced to wear the yellow badge (see Holocaust in Romania). He subsequently settled in the ghetto of Botoșani city, where he lived in poverty and isolation, spending {{some of the money}} he had left on adventure novels, and ultimately set up a small clandestine business dealing in humming tops. The Police representative shut down the enterprise, on the basis of legislation which prevented Jews from owning firms, and Ornea is said to have narrowly escaped further <b>repercussion</b> by bribing him with tobacco.|$|E
25|$|Most of Pachelbel's free fugues are {{in three}} or four voices, with the notable {{exception}} of two bicinia pieces that were probably intended for teaching purposes. Pachelbel frequently used <b>repercussion</b> subjects of different kinds, with note repetition sometimes extended to span a whole measure (such as in the subject of a G minor fugue, see illustration). Some of the fugues employ textures more suited for the harpsichord, particularly those with broken chord figuration. The three ricercars Pachelbel composed, that are more akin to his fugues than to ricercars by Frescobaldi or Froberger, are perhaps more technically interesting. In the original sources, all three use white notation and are marked alla breve. The polythematic C minor ricercar is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded. It is built on two contrasting themes (a slow chromatic pattern and a lively simplistic motif) which appear in their normal and inverted forms and concludes with both themes appearing simultaneously. The F-sharp minor ricercar uses the same concept and is slightly more interesting musically: the key of F-sharp minor requires a more flexible tuning than the standard meantone temperament of the Baroque era and was therefore rarely used by contemporary composers. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, mostly in three voices and employing the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below).|$|E
