5|$|The {{popularity}} of batik in Indonesia has varied. Historically, {{it was essential}} for ceremonial costumes and it was worn {{as part of a}} kebaya dress, commonly worn every day. The use of batik was already recorded in the 12th century, and the textile has become a strong source of identity for Indonesians crossing religious, <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> boundaries. It is also believed the motif made the batik famous.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{existence}} of distinct <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians.|$|E

25|$|The {{incorporation}} of ancient concepts and <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> assumptions into modern imperial ideology bolstered colonial claims to supremacy and right to colonize non-Europeans. Because of these numerous ramifications between ancient representations and modern colonial rhetoric, 19th century’s colonialist discourse acquires a “multi-layered” or “palimpsestic” structure. It forms a “historical, ideological and narcissistic continuum,” in which modern theories of domination feed upon and blend with “ancient myths of supremacy and grandeur”.|$|E

25|$|Even as the Arab {{governors}} {{adopted the}} more sophisticated Iranian methods of governmental administration, non-Arabs were still prevented from holding such positions. Non-Arabs were not even allowed to wear Arabian style clothing, so strong were the feelings of Arab racial superiority cultivated by the Umayyads. Much of the discontent this caused led to the Shu'ubiyya movement, an assertion of non-Arab <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> equality with Arabs. The movement gained support among Egyptians, Arameans and Berber people, though this movement was most pronounced among Iranian people.|$|E
25|$|In the Pulitzer Prize winning Guns, Germs, and Steel (1999), author Jared Diamond {{points to}} {{geography}} {{as the answer}} to why certain states were able to grow and develop faster and stronger than others.

Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} of the trial—which had many aspects of guerrilla theater—was covered on the nightly news and made Kunstler the best-known lawyer in the country, and something of a folk hero. After much deadlock, the jury acquitted all seven on the conspiracy charge, but convicted five of violating the anti-riot provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The Seventh Circuit overturned all the convictions on November 21, 1972 due to Hoffman's refusal to let defense lawyers question the prospective jurors on <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> biases; the Justice Department did not retry the case.|$|E

Barker borrows heavily from Shakespearean comedy, as can be seen most blatantly in the gender disguises employed by the characters of Kate and Geraldine. The use of verse writing for higher class characters and prose for those of lesser status also borrows from the Shakespearean tradition. It is of note that Pocahontas switches from prose to verse after falling in love with Rolfe.|$|E

According to Danforth, this is why Greeks generally refer to Ethnic Macedonians as [...] "Skopians", a practice comparable to calling Greeks [...] "Athenians".

He has harnessed {{a wide range of}} media during his career, including printmaking, drawing, painting and sculpture utilising wood, glass, steel and ceramics, as well as a range of more unorthodox materials, as his 2007 Indigenous Art Triennial entry demonstrated. Reflecting on that sculpture, Artlink Magazines reviewer, Daniel Thomas, remarked on how the work signified [...] "how colonisers always get things wrong; how Europeans looking for China, and its fine porcelain manufactures, stumbled instead upon the land of the kangaroo, and traded and planted ideas of <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> superiority".|$|E
500|$|In December 1908 Eva, then 41, married Houston Stewart Chamberlain, a British-born {{historian}} who had adopted as his personal creed a fanatical form of German nationalism based on principles of extreme <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> purity. He had known Cosima since 1888, though his affinity with Wagner extended back to 1882, {{when he had}} attended the premiere of Parsifal. He had successively courted Blandina and then Isolde, before settling on Eva. Cosima had considerable empathy with his theories; according to Carr [...] "she came to love him as her son—perhaps even more". Chamberlain became the dominant figure within the Wagner circle, and was {{largely responsible for the}} increasing alienation of the Beidlers. Cosima may have been unaware of Isolde's attempts at rapprochement, because Eva and Chamberlain withheld Isolde's letters. In 1913 Isolde was effectively disinherited when she sought to confirm her rights as a co-heir to the considerable Wagner fortunes in a court case, which she lost. [...] After this she withdrew, and to the time of her death in 1919 never again saw or communicated directly with Cosima.|$|E
