40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{involvement}} of verbal and visuo-spatial working memory during the processing of spatial texts via a dual-task paradigm. Subjects were presented with three texts describing locations from a route perspective, and had either to imagine themselves moving along a route in surroundings or to rehearse verbal information. Concurrently they had to perform a spatial tapping task, an articulatory task, or no secondary task. Performance on a verification test {{used to assess the}} product of comprehension showed that the concurrent tapping task impaired performance in the imagery instructions group but not in the <b>repetition</b> <b>instructions</b> group, and caused the beneficial effect of imagery instructions to vanish. This result was not observed with the articulatory task, where interference effects were similar in both instructions groups. Performance on the concurrent tasks confirmed the pattern obtained with the verification test. In addition, results seem partly dependent on the capacity of spatial working memory as measured by the Corsi Blocks Test. We argue that these results clarify the processes of the construction of a spatial mental model, and confirm that the visuo-spatial working memory is involved in mental imagery...|$|R

We attempt to understand the source of this repetitive behavior by categorizing dynamic program instructions into dynamic program slices at both a global level and a local (within function) level. We observe that repeatability is more an artifact of how computation is expressed, and less of program inputs.

40|$|Objective. The Tuck Jump Assessment (TJA), a {{clinical}} plyometric assessment, identifies 10 jumping and landing technique flaws. The study {{objective was to}} investigate TJA interrater and intrarater reliability with raters of different educational and clinical backgrounds. Methods. 40 participants were video recorded performing the TJA using published protocol and instructions. Five raters of varied educational and clinical backgrounds scored the TJA. Each score of the 10 technique flaws was summed for the total TJA score. Approximately one month later, 3 raters scored the videos again. Intraclass correlation coefficients determined interrater (5 and 3 raters for first and second session, resp.) and intrarater (3 raters) reliability. Results. Interrater reliability with 5 raters was poor (ICC = 0. 47; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0. 33 – 0. 62). Interrater reliability between 3 raters who completed 2 scoring sessions improved from 0. 52 (95 % CI 0. 35 – 0. 68) for session one to 0. 69 (95 % CI 0. 55 – 0. 81) for session two. Intrarater reliability was poor to moderate, ranging from 0. 44 (95 % CI 0. 22 – 0. 68) to 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 55 – 0. 84). Conclusion.

Teaching has often {{been described as a}} type of performance whereby teachers are expected to present information to an audience of observers in an effort to share ideas and enrich the lives of the participants. With this paradigm of teaching as performance, I developed a workshop designed to teach theatrically based improvisation techniques to a group of public education teachers. I used a series of pre- and post-workshop surveys as well as a follow-up discussion session to gauge what effect, if any, improvisation training had on the self-efficacy of teachers seeking professional development. The hypothesized result was that following the workshop, teacher confidence would have been enhanced as recorded by the surveys and conversations in the discussion session. The results I obtained from the workshop, the surveys, and the discussion session were coded and analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative measures. Areas of particular interest were classroom management, teacher expectations of what students could achieve, particular activities most appropriate for engaging students, and teachers??? overall confidence in their own abilities. The workshop consisted of 7 -hours of professional development in which improvisation techniques and games were explored. The types of behavior under investigation related to issues of confidence, e. g. : classroom management techniques, <b>repetition</b> of <b>instruction,</b> stuttering, body language, eye contact, responses to questions from students, and any other observable actions/behaviors that gave insight into teacher confidence...|$|R

Aligned with Ericsson’s [3] deliberate practice theory, emphasis on early specialisation has been typical with children encouraged to only practice and perform, from a very young age, in one target sport. To reach a high level of performance, early specialisation typically requires abundant coach-led, ‘deliberate practice’, designed to improve an athlete’s performance through frequent <b>repetitions,</b> use of <b>instructions</b> and frequent corrections, leading to movement reproduction [1, 4]. Early specialisation, however, can provide problems for a young athlete’s overall development, health and wellbeing, which can lead to a restricted range of general motor skills if children are only offered experience in a limited number of sports [5]. Focus on one sport can lead to increased risk of dropout due to lack of enjoyment in practising and competing in a fixed sport from a young age [6].|$|R

OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility, test-retest reliability, and minimal detectable change (MDC) of the GMWT. DESIGN: A repeated-measures design was used. METHODS: Forty-two people with dementia participated in the study. Adherence rate, adverse events, <b>repetition</b> of <b>instructions</b> during test performance, test duration, and number of oversteps were assessed. RESULTS: The adherence rate was excellent, with no adverse events. No repetitive instructions were given during test performance, and test duration was short (mean= 17. 16 seconds) with few oversteps (mean= 1. 94 oversteps). Test-retest reliability for participants without a walking device was excellent for the GMWT time score (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=. 942), with an MDC of 2. 96 seconds. Test-retest reliability for participants with a 4 -wheeled walker (4 WW) was moderate (ICC=. 837), with an MDC of 10. 35 seconds.

40|$|Overgeneral autobiographical {{memory recall}} has been {{associated}} with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but the role of overgenerality in the vulnerability to bipolar disorder remains under-researched. While a previous study suggested that high-risk individuals for bipolar disorder recall emotionally negative memories in specific detail, this is in contrast to memory recall patterns noted in bipolar samples. The Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT) used in previous non-clinical studies has also been criticised for not being sensitive to overgenerality due to its <b>repetition</b> of specificity <b>instructions</b> and practice trials. The traditional AMT format may allow some individuals to override their trait-based tendencies to be overgeneral. The current study used a sentence completion task to assess memory specificity in groups of students at a low and high trait-based vulnerability for bipolar disorder. In contrast to previous research, high-risk individuals recalled fewer specific positive memories and greater numbers of overgeneral negative memories than low-risk individuals. These results support the notion that the vulnerability for bipolar disorder might be associated with similar recall biases as demonstrated in bipolar samples, and that the AMT might not be sufficiently sensitive to detect overgenerality in non-clinical groups.

We have examined the Potential confounding effect of levator co-activation at the time of a Valsalva maneuver and the impact of <b>repetition</b> with biofeedback <b>instruction.</b> Methods Fifty nulliparous women at 36 - 38 weeks' gestation received 3 D/ 4 D translabial ultrasound investigation in the dorsal resting position after bladder emptying. Valsalva maneuvers were recorded initially and after repeated attempts with visual biofeedback both during the maneuver and after, with the operator demonstrating findings on the ultrasound monitor, {{in order to}} abolish levator coactivation. Offline analysis was subsequently undertaken. Results Significant differences between first and optimal Valsalva maneuver were found for bladder neck position, bladder neck descent, hiatal sagittal diameter and hiatal area on Valsalva. In a minority of women (22 / 50) we observed a reduction in the sagittal hiatal diameter on first Valsalva maneuver, indicating levator co-activation. A reduction in sagittal diameter was seen in only 11 / 50 after instruction. Levator co-activation was associated with significantly lower bladder neck descent. Conclusion The Valsalva maneuver is frequently accompanied by a pelvic floor muscle contraction. Levator co-activation may be a substantial confounder, reducing pelvic organ descent. Without repetition and digital, auditory or visual biofeedback, women may not perform a correct Valsalva maneuver. Biofeedback markedly reduces the likelihood of levator co-activation but does not abolish it completely. Copyright (c) 2007 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Third year medical {{students}} at UMass. Medical School {{have only a}} brief exposure to dermatology during their first two years, resulting in limited skills in dermatology physical diagnosis. While other skills of the physical exam – e. g. the cardiac exam, the abdominal exam – are taught in the first 2 years and are applied and refined with <b>repetition</b> and <b>instruction</b> during students’ clinical rotations, dermatology remains limited in its exposure and instruction during the third year. This may prevent students from gaining the needed physical diagnosis skills in this important clinical area. Given this scenario, a computer-assisted instruction module was created and beta-tested to improve students’ physical diagnosis skills in dermatology. Method:A computer-based dermatology physical diagnosis presentation was created using Microsoft PowerPoint to instruct third year {{medical students}} in dermatology physical exam skills. Each slide presented students with a dermatology physical exam finding, a brief description, and a picture. In order to test the students’ knowledge of dermatology physical exam findings, a 23 -item multiple-choice exam was created using XCom Exam Composer. 9 questions dealt with knowledge of verbal descriptions of lesions, while 14 questions dealt with the identification of lesions. The test was administered {{both before and after}} the presentation to 15 students taking a required 6 -week Family Medicine clerkship at UMass. Medical School. Results: 13 out of the 15 sampled students completed the curriculum. The average pre-test score was 18. 4 / 23 questions correct (80 %); the average post-test score was 20. 5 / 23 questions correct (89. 1 %) - with an average improvement of 2. 1 points (9. 1 %). These results (i. e., the increase in scores post-test) were statistically significant using both a parametric paired t-test (t = 2. 720; p=. 019) as well as a non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test to take the small sample size into account (z = 2. 508; p=. 012). Discussion: This computer-assisted instruction in dermatology significantly improved students’ physical exam skills, as measured by this multiple-choice exam. Informal comments were positive: students enjoyed the module, and appreciated the increased exposure to dermatology. Future studies are needed to evaluate student experience during this module, as well as their competence and confidence in diagnosing dermatologic lesions. Also, the Family Medicine Clerkship faculty intends to evaluate this module with a larger population of students, including those at different stages of their third year medical training, in order to examine the module’s effects. Furthermore, studies using a larger population are needed to evaluate the benefit and cost-effectiveness of this computer-assisted instruction program versus traditional book-based instruction...|$|R
40|$|To work cooperatively {{with humans}} by using {{language}}, robots {{must not only}} acquire a mapping between language and their behavior but also autonomously utilize the mapping in appropriate contexts of interactive tasks online. To this end, we propose a novel learning method linking language to robot behavior {{by means of a}} recurrent neural network. In this method, the network learns from correct examples of the imposed task that are given not as explicitly separated sets of language and behavior but as sequential data constructed from the actual temporal flow of the task. By doing this, the internal dynamics of the network models both language [...] behavior relationships and the temporal patterns of interaction. Here, ``internal dynamics'' refers to the time development of the system defined on the fixed-dimensional space of the internal states of the context layer. Thus, in the execution phase, by constantly representing where in the interaction context it is as its current state, the network autonomously switches between recognition and generation phases without any explicit signs and utilizes the acquired mapping in appropriate contexts. To evaluate our method, we conducted an experiment in which a robot generates appropriate behavior responding to a human's linguistic instruction. After learning, the network actually formed the attractor structure representing both language [...] behavior relationships and the task's temporal pattern in its internal dynamics. In the dynamics, language [...] behavior mapping was achieved by the branching structure. <b>Repetition</b> of human's <b>instruction</b> and robot's behavioral response was represented as the cyclic structure, and besides, waiting to a subsequent instruction was represented as the fixed-point attractor.
