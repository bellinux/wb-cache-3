40|$|Human {{platelet}} thrombospondin adsorbed on plastic promotes {{attachment and}} spreading of human G 361 melanoma cells. Attachment is rapid, and spreading is maximal by 90 min with 60 - 90 % of the attached cells spread. In contrast, thrombospondin promotes attachment but not spreading of human C 32 melanoma cells, which attach and spread only on laminin substrates. The specificity of these interactions and {{the regions of}} the thrombospondin molecule involved in attachment and spreading were examined using proteolytic fragments of thrombospondin and by inhibition studies. The sulfated fucan, fucoidan, and monoclonal antibody A 2. 5, which is directed against the heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin, selectively inhibit spreading but only weakly inhibit attachment. Monoclonal antibodies against some other domains of thrombospondin, however, are potent inhibitors of attachment. The amino- terminal heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin does not promote attachment. Large fragments lacking the heparin-binding domain support attachment but not spreading of G 361 cells. Attachment activity is lost following removal of the 18 -kD carboxyl-terminal domain. These results suggest {{that at least two}} melanoma ligands are involved in cell attachment and spreading on thrombospondin. The carboxyl-terminal region and perhaps other regions of the molecule bind to receptor(s) on the melanoma surface that promote initial attachment but not cell spreading. Interaction of the heparin-binding domain with sulfated glycoconjugates on melanoma surface proteoglycans and/or sulfated glycolipids mediates spreading. Monoclonal antibodies A 2. 5 and C 6. 7 also <b>reverse</b> <b>spreading</b> of G 361 cells growing on glass culture substrates, suggesting that binding to thrombospondin mediates attachment of these melanoma cells in culture...|$|R

50|$|Spartina anglica was {{at first}} seen as a {{valuable}} new species for coastal erosion control, its dense root systems binding coastal mud and the stems increasing silt deposition, thereby assisting in land reclamation from the sea. As a result, it was widely planted at coastal sites throughout the British Isles, and has colonised large areas of tidal mudflats, becoming an invasive species. New colonies may {{take some time to}} become established, but once they do, vegetative spread by rhizomes is rapid, smothering natural ecosystems and preventing birds like waders from feeding.

40|$|<b>Reversing</b> the <b>spread</b> of {{antibiotic}} multiresistant bacteria is hampered by {{ignorance of the}} natural history of resistance genes, the mobile elements carrying them, and the bacterial hosts harboring them. Using traditional cultivation and cultivation-independent molecular techniques, we quantified antibiotic resistance genes and mobile elements called integrons in poultry house litter from commercial poultry farms. Unexpectedly, the major reservoir for Class 1 integrons in poultry litter is not their previously identified hosts, Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli. Rather, integrons and associated resistance genes abound in several genera of Gram-positive bacteria that constitute > 85 % of the litter community compared with Enterobacteriaceae that comprise < 2 % of this ecosystem.

40|$|The {{phospholipase}} A 2 receptor (PLA 2 R 1) is {{the major}} autoantigen in idiopathic membranous nephropathy. However, the value of anti-PLA 2 R 1 antibody titers in predicting patient outcomes is unknown. Here, we screened serum samples from 50 patients positive for PLA 2 R 1 for immunoreactivity against a series of PLA 2 R 1 deletion mutants covering the extracellular domains. We identified reactive epitopes in the cysteine-rich (CysR), C-type lectin domain 1 (CTLD 1), and C-type lectin domain 7 (CTLD 7) domains and confirmed the reactivity with soluble forms of each domain. We then used ELISAs to stratify 69 patients positive for PLA 2 R 1 by serum reactivity {{to one or more}} of these domains: CysR (n= 23), CysRC 1 (n= 14), and CysRC 1 C 7 (n= 32). Median ELISA titers measured using the full-length PLA 2 R 1 antigens were not statistically different between subgroups. Patients with anti-CysR-restricted activity were younger (P= 0. 008), had less nephrotic range proteinuria (P= 0. 02), and exhibited a higher rate of spontaneous remission (P= 0. 03) and lower rates of renal failure progression (P= 0. 002) and ESRD (P= 0. 01) during follow-up. Overall, 31 of 69 patients had poor renal prognosis (urinary protein/creatinine ratio > 4 g/g or eGFR< 45 ml/min per 1. 73 m(2) at end of follow-up). High anti-PLA 2 R 1 activity and epitope spreading beyond the CysR epitope were independent risk factors of poor renal prognosis in multivariable Cox regression analysis.

Agents of Seed Dispersal proposes that the city is a natural ecosystem within the greater context of earth's environment. The city as an ecosystem challenges the common notion that the urban setting is artificial and the environment outside of its boundaries is the sole representation of nature. The metropolis as an ecosystem requires that earth's occupants address it as a natural system and as an ecosystem it requires environmental thought and action. Through the Agents of Seed Dispersal project the author initiates two separate but corresponding projects, which focus on urban environmental degradation by <b>reversing</b> the <b>spread</b> of the asphalt surface and it's corresponding suffocation of plant life by propagating the distribution and growth of specific plant life within the city. by Lukasz Kamil Lysakowski.

40|$|Transgenic crops {{producing}} insecticidal toxins are {{now widely}} {{used to control}} insect pests. The benefits of this method would be lost if resistance to the toxins spread to {{a significant proportion of}} the pest population. The primary resistance management method, mandatory in the United States, is the high-dose/refuge strategy, requiring toxin-free crops as refuges near the insecticidal crops, and the use of toxin doses sufficiently high to kill insects heterozygous for a resistance allele, thereby rendering resistance functionally recessive. We propose that mass-release of harmless susceptible (toxin-sensitive) insects could substantially delay or even <b>reverse</b> the <b>spread</b> of resistance. Mass-release of such insects {{is an integral part of}} release of insects carrying a dominant lethal (RIDL), a method of pest control related to the sterile insect technique.

This allows us to simultaneously analyze linear and nonlinear effects of covariates as well as spatial variations of one or more latent variables, such as attitude towards multiple partnering, which in turn directly influences the multivariate observable outcomes or indicators. Influence of demographic factors such as age, gender, locality, state of residence, educational attainment, etc., and knowledge about HIV/AIDS on attitude towards multiple partnering is also investigated.

Evidence has emerged {{to suggest that}} thrombi are dynamic structures with distinct areas of differing {{platelet activation}}. It was hypothesised that PGI 2 could <b>reverse</b> platelet <b>spreading</b> by actin cytoskeletal modulation, leading to reduced capability of platelet aggregates to withstand a high shear environment. Our data demonstrates that post-flow of PGI 2 over activated and spread platelets on fibrinogen, identified {{a significant reduction in}} platelet surface area under high shear. Exploration of the molecular mechanisms underpinning this effect revealed that PGI 2 reversed stress fibre formation in adherent platelets, reduced platelet spreading, whilst simultaneously promoting actin nodule formation. The effects of PGI 2 on stress fibres were mimicked by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and prevented by inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA). Stress fibre formation is a RhoA dependent process and we found that treatment of adherent platelets with PGI 2 caused inhibitory phosphorylation of RhoA, reduced RhoA GTP-loading and reversal of myosin light chain phosphorylation. Phospho-RhoA was localised in actin nodules with PKA type II {{and a number of other}} phosphorylated PKA substrates.
