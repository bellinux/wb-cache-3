However, only the latter case represents a true alternative to IEEE 802.11p, by introducing the determinism which {{carrier sense multiple access}} with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) lacks. In vehicle networks the connection set-up phases of a telephone call (<b>reservation</b> <b>request,</b> confirmation, data exchange, tear-down) cannot be applied (it does not hold for broadcast communications, it is hampered by hidden stations, it is not manageable with heavy losses, mobility and varying channel conditions). For these reasons MS-Aloha is connection oriented and continuously refreshes each reservation simply by transmitting each period. MS-Aloha adopts a different approach and subtends the following hypotheses and rules which, basically, define all its main mechanisms.|$|E

This protocol has two main features. First, both the access probability and the bandwidth for <b>reservation</b> <b>requests</b> are varied dynamically to enhance efficiency. Second, by using a request-mini-slot method, UBR traffic can only utilize the residual bandwidth of the other traffic. In this paper, we derive a Markov chain model for analyzing {{the performance of the}} CAR protocol by means of a bi-state traffic source.

50|$|RFC 2638 {{from the}} IETF defines the entity of the Bandwidth Broker (BB) in the {{framework}} of differentiated services (DiffServ). According to RFC 2638, a Bandwidth Broker is an agent that has some knowledge of an organization's priorities and policies and allocates quality of service (QoS) resources with respect to those policies. In order to achieve an end-to-end allocation of resources across separate domains, the Bandwidth Broker managing a domain will have to communicate with its adjacent peers, which allows end-to-end services to be constructed out of purely bilateral agreements. Admission control {{is one of the main}} tasks that a Bandwidth Broker has to perform, in order to decide whether an incoming resource <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> will be accepted or not. Most Bandwidth Brokers use simple admission control modules, although there are also proposals for more sophisticated admission control according to several metrics such as acceptance rate, network utilization, etc. The BB acts as a Policy Decision Point (PDP) in deciding whether to allow or reject a flow, whilst the edge routers acts as Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) to police traffic (allowing and marking packets, or simply dropping them).|$|E

The RRA algorithm hinges on an efficient mechanism to accommodate large number of requests by minimizing the bandwidth wastage. Finally, via numerical results, we show that RRA constructs schedules that accommodate significantly larger number of requests compared to other, seemingly efficient, heuristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Previously {{proposed}} wavelength scheduling algorithms in op-tical burst switching networks process each <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> individ-ually {{and in a}} greedy manner. In {{this paper}} we propose a new family of wavelength scheduling algorithms that process a batch of reservation requests together instead of processing them one by one. When a control burst with a <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> arrives to a free batch scheduler, the scheduler waits for a small amount of time, called the acceptance de-lay, before deciding to accept or reject the <b>reservation</b> <b>request.</b> After the acceptance delay has passed, the scheduler processes all the reservation requests that have arrived during the acceptance delay, then it accepts the requests that will maximize the utilization of the wavelength chan-nels. We describe an optimal batch scheduler that serves as an upper bound on the performance of batch scheduling algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce two heuristic batch scheduling algorithms. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated using a discrete-event simulation model. Simulation results suggest that batch schedulers could decrease the blocking probability by 25 % compared to the best previously known wavelength scheduling algorithm. ...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{resource}} reservation {{has a great}} role {{in maintaining}} QoS of requests. Resource allocation and management to reservation requests for optimal utilization and guarantee of quality of service is challenging effort. When a <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> for a resource type fails although enough free capacity might be available, there is not any chance for resolving conflicts. Inflexibility of <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> in support of replacement on time axis, results in rigid resource utilization and even poor QoS of the system.

30|$|Let us denote by Breq {{the amount}} of {{bandwidth}} to be reserved by a node, which in general will be equal to Bcommitted + Bown. The formats of the reservation-associated messages are shown in Figure 4. If the reservation-requesting node is only one-hop away from the sink, it will need no more verifications than Equation 2 before sending a RSRQ (<b>reservation</b> <b>request)</b> message to the sink asking if {{it is able to}} reserve the necessary bandwidth, and will wait for a response. If, on the other hand, the node is more than one-hop away from the sink, it will only send the <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> to the next node in the selected route if its own available bandwidth is at least equal to Breq, in anticipation of the reservation that the next node in the path will have to make to further forward the traffic. All the nodes that can overhear the message will also check if their available bandwidth is at least equal to Breq; if not, they will send back a response message indicating that the new reservation is not possible. In turn, the node for which the <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> message was addressed will check if its own available bandwidth is at least one, two or three times Breq, depending on whether it is the sink or a node one-hop or at least two-hops away from the sink, respectively, again anticipating the reservations that it itself and the next node in the path will have to make to further forward the traffic; if everything goes well, it will send a positive response as expected and will start over to reserve the next link in the route. If a node that had not heard the original <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> hears the response, it will also verify its available bandwidth and, if it finds that the new reservation represents a problem, it will send a response message to indicate it. When a node sends a negative response, it will include in the Balt field {{the amount of}} bandwidth it has available as a way to help make an alternative reservation.|$|E

40|$|A channel-aware reservation-based MAC {{protocol}} for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is proposed in this work. The proposed scheme allows secondary users (SUs) {{to send out}} <b>reservation</b> <b>requests</b> {{at the beginning of}} each time slot in a distributed fashion according to the sensing outcomes and their local channel state information (CSI). A channel-aware splitting algorithm is used to resolve the collision between the <b>reservation</b> <b>requests</b> of different SUs in a way such that the transmission time slot is always assigned to the SU with the best link quality. By exploiting multiuser diversity with the proposed scheme, we show that significant improvements in throughput can be observed. Furthermore, by modeling the presence and absence of the primary users (PUs) using a continuous time Markov chain, the spectrum sensing error and the reliability of the sensing outcomes across time are considered when designing the MAC policy. The effect of the data transmission and the spectrum sensing periods on the system throughput is studied via numerical simulations.

Research suggests that hotels should drive consumers towards direct channels with lower operating costs {{and away from}} intermediaries, yet few studies have investigated pricing practices across the direct communication channels that hotels control. The results of two surveys of over 100 Swiss hotels illustrate pricing inconsistencies in low- and high-season periods across four communication media under the properties' direct control: telephone, email, static website price lists, and <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> forms on the website. About one out of two hotels offered different rates across these media, despite the requests being on the same date, for the same type room for the same period. Prices via email responses were {{the lowest in the}} low-season survey and website prices were lowest in the high-season survey. Across both surveys, prices were lower via online media - email, static website price lists, and <b>reservation</b> <b>request</b> forms - than via the telephone. Hotel category and number of stars showed a positive relationship with consistent pricing in the low season, and a negative relationship in the high season. Finally, price variations of over 200 % - for the same room at the same date - across a hotel's direct online and offline channels serve as a wake-up call for hoteliers to review their pricing and procedures for communicating this pricing...|$|E

40|$|Advance {{reservations}} (ARs) {{were introduced}} for application-level dynamic scheduling of resources in a Grid infrastructure. Advance reservations of resources {{for a specific}} time in future not only ensure that all resources would be simultaneously available at the execution time of the application but also ensure that the QoS constraints of the Grid applications would be met. Previous research shows that ARs can meet their objectives but at a significant performance cost. In this paper, we argue that laxity in the reservation window of an AR can help improve performance of scheduling with advance reservations. Scheduling ARs with given laxities is an NP-Hard problem and the paper presents a scalable algorithm for scheduling on-demand and advance <b>reservation</b> <b>requests</b> with laxities. The paper then investigates in detail the effect of proportion of advance reservations, laxity and distribution {{of the size of}} tasks on performance through extensive experimentation.
