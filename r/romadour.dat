5|$|Rembrandt was foaled in 1977 by Herbert de Baey. His sire was <b>Romadour</b> II, {{a famous}} Westphalian {{stallion}} during the 1970s, and his dam was Adone, full sister to Ahlerich, a multiple Olympic medal winning dressage horse under German rider Reiner Klimke. Due to his Thoroughbred-like appearance, several riders passed over {{a chance to}} purchase the gelding as a youngster. In 1981, he was purchased by Nicole Uphoff's father, JÃ¼rgen Uphoff, as a mount for his then-14-year-old daughter. Rembrandt {{was too much for}} her, however, and he was sent to train with Klaus Balkenhol, a noted trainer who saw his potential and advised the Uphoffs to keep the horse, despite his spookiness and sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Olympians {{bearing the}} Westphalian brand {{appeared}} during the 1980s. The first was Ahlerich (by Angelo xx) who took individual gold in dressage at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. At the 1988 Seoul Olympics, individual dressage gold was won by Rembrandt (by <b>Romadour</b> II), who with Ahlerich was on the gold-medal German dressage team, while Pikeur Pedro (by Pilot) {{was part of the}} gold-medal German jumping team that year. In 1992 Rembrandt took individual dressage gold again, while teammate Goldstern (by Weinberg) took bronze. The two horses were part of the gold-medal German dressage team in Barcelona. At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Goldstern and Durgo (by Degen) were both part of the gold-medal German dressage team. Most recently, Farbenfroh (by Freudentaenzer) {{was a member of the}} gold-medal German dressage team at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.|$|E
