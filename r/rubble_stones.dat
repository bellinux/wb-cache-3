40|$|Abstract. This paper studied on the {{underwater}} vibrating compaction technology of scattering-filling <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> layer. At HongKong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge project, {{in order to}} satisfy the project time limit, underwater vibrating compaction technology with hydraulic hammer instead of conventional dynamic compaction technology was used to tamp scattering-filling <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> layer with no dead angle in a short time. Owing to the shortage of engineering example, the theoretical analysis was needed before field application. In this paper, the <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> layer and the vibration system were simplified to a mechanical model. Vibration system’s work on <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> was obtained by mathematical derivation, and effects of parameters were analyzed. The result shows that work on scattering-filling <b>rubble</b> <b>stone</b> layer increases with the increase of system quality, equivalent damping, exciting force and angular velocity and decreases with the increase of equivalent stiffness, water stiffness and buoyancy...|$|R

50|$|A {{portion of}} the town wall remains {{to the south of}} Saint Laurence's Gate. North of Laurence's Gate, the wall ran up Palace St/King St where the {{footpath}} is today. The depth of the basements of the houses and the Centre for Continuing Education on King Street suggest the presence of a deep trench outside the wall. Over the centuries, as the walls and gates fell into disrepair, the <b>rubble</b> <b>stones</b> were reused in later buildings. For example, the house and walls at the corner of Laurence Street and Palace Street and stone walls in Francis Street. Older pictures show that a toll booth and gate house remained until the early 19th century. The shop beside Laurence's Gate was a bicycle shop in the early 1900s. The green letter box dates from a time when there was a post office there.|$|E

The out-of-plane bending resistance was significantly increased (almost 5 times) and the mid-span deflection reached considerable values before the wall collapse (from 1 / 200 to 1 / 100 of the wall height). Results of plain specimens permitted the estimation of the flexural strengths of unreinforced masonry.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between the in-plane performances of an unreinforced and a reinforced masonry building is herein presented so to evidence, by means of numerical simulations, {{the effectiveness of a}} strengthening technique, based on the application of a GFRP (glass fiber reinforced polymer) fiber reinforced lime mortar coating, in the reduction of the seismic vulnerability of existing masonry buildings. An almost regular type of two storey building was considered as reference in the study. Three different types of masonry were concerned: solid bricks, <b>rubble</b> <b>stones</b> and cobblestones. The mechanical properties of the reinforced masonry were calibrated on the basis of numerous experimental tests carried out by the authors. Static nonlinear analyses of the structure were carried out using the equivalent frame model; the nonlinear behavior of the wall elements (piers and spandrels) was concentrated in plastic hinges arranged at the extremities of the member (flexural plastic hinges) or at mid-span (shear plastic hinge). The results evidence a significant increase in terms of shear resistance, displacement capacity and total strain energy. The collapse due to bending in the piers of strengthened buildings may in most cases anticipate the shear failure, limiting the displacement capacity of the structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{enhancement}} {{of the wall}} bending resistance is often required in historical masonry buildings especially in upper storeys or in the occurrence of high floors (4 - 5 m). An innovative technique is the application, {{on both sides of}} the wall, of a GFRP mesh reinforced mortar coating. Experimental tests (four point bending tests) performed on 1 x 3 m unreinforced and reinforced masonry walls made of solid brick (250 mm thick), <b>rubble</b> <b>stones</b> (400 mm) and cobblestones (400 mm) specimens proved the effectiveness of the technique. Moreover, for the cobblestone masonry, a hybrid technique, which couples the GFRP reinforced mortar coating, on one face, and a stainless steel reinforced repointing on the other, was also investigated. This paper presents the results of a numerical study, carried out utilising a twodimensional nonlinear model so as to comprehend the mechanisms that intervene in the out-of-plane bending behaviour of reinforced masonry walls. The reliability of the numerical simulations was proved by comparisons with experimental results. A numerical parametric study permitted the investigation of the influence of the mechanical characteristics of the employed materials on the cracking and on the ultimate load...|$|E
40|$|Twenty sponge species (totalling 190 individuals) were {{collected}} during the 1938, 1994 and 2004 / 5 expeditions to the remote island of Clipperton in the East Pacific Ocean. Seven species are widespread Indo-Pacific sponges; nine species comprise sponges new to science; four species were represented only by small thin patches insufficient for proper characterization and could be only determined to genus. The new species may not be necessarily endemic to the island, as several show similarities with species described from elsewhere in the East and West Pacific. Four species: Tethya sarai Desqueyroux-Faúndez & Van Soest (1997), Callyspongia (Callyspongia) roosevelti n. sp., Spongia (Spongia) sweeti (Kirkpatrick, 1900) and Suberea etiennei n. sp. were found commonly occurring in localities around the island in depths between 10 and 55 m, growing on dead corals, under overhangs and <b>rubble</b> <b>stones.</b> The remaining sponges were either rare or were thinly encrusting on coral fragments.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of seismic vulnerability of existing masonry buildings {{through the application}} {{on the walls of}} a mortar coating reinforced with a GFRP (glass fiber reinforced polymer) mesh is studied and discussed. Numerous experimental tests, carried out by the authors, demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique for enhancing the mechanical response of the walls, both subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane actions. In the study, the capacity curves of an existing unreinforced masonry building are compared with those of the same building strengthened with the GFRP reinforced mortar coating technique. An almost regular two storey building is considered in the numerical study and it is analyzed by adopting the method of the equivalent frame. Two different types of masonry are considered in the study: solid bricks and <b>rubble</b> <b>stones.</b> Static nonlinear analyses are carried out and the nonlinearity of the material of the wall elements (piers and spandrels) is considered through the introduction of plastic hinges in the plane of the masonry wall.

The collapse due to bending of piers in most cases of strengthened buildings occurred before than the ultimate shear drift was obtained...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a wide {{experimental}} research programme are presented. The programme was carried out on masonry specimens strengthened with the application on both faces of the wall with a mortar coating reinforced with GFRP meshes, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique. The research concerns both in-plane shear (diagonal compression) and out-of-plane bending (four point bending) tests. The specimens are made with different masonry types (solid brick, <b>rubble</b> <b>stones,</b> cobblestones), various thicknesses (250 - 400 - 700 mm) and using diverse coating mortars in terms of mechanical characteristics (compressive strength 5 - 8 - 12 MPa). Moreover, the coatings were effectively linked together by using GFRP connectors (4 or 6 connectors per square meter). Thirty four diagonal compression tests were carried out to assess the in-plane shear masonry response, so to analyze the influence of the main parameters on the in-plane resistance of the wall. Some unstrengthened specimens were also tested as a reference so as to assess the increase in terms of resistance and ductility due to the application of the considered strengthening technique. Eight bending tests on full scale masonry elements were also carried out to analyze the out-of-plane flexural behavior of the wall. The results demonstrate the significant increase in bending resistance of reinforced walls compared with the unstrengthened ones...|$|E
40|$|Since waves have {{enormous}} power {{the design of}} structures to withstand this power is not easy. The history of breakwaters {{is one of many}} failures and damages. This has lead to continuously improving technology in marine construction. Over the years men made it possible to construct breakwaters with high stability against waves. The vertical breakwater is an ideal solution in deep water and in areas where the use of <b>rubble</b> <b>stones</b> is expensive or environmentally less acceptable. Furthermore a vertical breakwater with smooth vertical walls can be exposed to high wave loads, such as impulsive wave impacts. These impacts are characterised by very high pressure and a short duration time. It is believed that these impacts could well be essential to the failure of vertical breakwaters. The duration time of the wave impact is essential for the (dynamic) response of the caisson. For example if the wave impact duration is about the eigenfrequency of the vertical breakwater the response will reach a maximum, and the vertical breakwater could collapse. The objective of this graduation report is to investigate the assumption that wave impact is important with regard to failure of vertical breakwaters. Research has been carried out to investigate the time impact duration for vertical breakwaters and an analogy has been made of wave impacts with impulsive wave load on ships. Also, in order to investigate the (dynamic) response of vertical breakwater a computer model has been designed. With this model the response to the wave impact loads upon the Genoa Voltri breakwater can be estimated. The results of this graduation study is that wave impact do occur, but that the impact duration is much shorter than assumed in the past. The impact forces during these short duration result in little response of the vertical breakwater, since the impact duration is not in the range of the eigenfrequency of the vertical breakwater. It can therefore be concluded that wave impacts are not important for the stability of the Genoa Voltri breakwater. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
