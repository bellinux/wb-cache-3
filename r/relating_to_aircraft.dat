50|$|Throughout the {{remainder}} of the Second World War, the ROC continued to complement and at times replace the Chain Home defensive radar system by undertaking an inland aircraft tracking and reporting function, while Chain Home provided a predominantly coastal, long-range tracking and reporting system. With the advent of the Cold War, the ROC continued in its primary role of aircraft recognition and reporting, and in 1955 was allocated the additional task of detecting and reporting nuclear explosions and associated fall-out. By 1965, thanks to advances in (radar) technology, most roles and responsibilities <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> <b>aircraft</b> had been withdrawn and the ROC assumed the role of field force for the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation, (UKWMO); a role which the ROC continued until the early 1990s and the cessation of the Cold War.|$|E

50|$|Another {{study by}} Wickens, of the University of Illinois, found that {{workload}} affects spatial awareness, an essential skill in maneuvering an aircraft through a three-dimensional space with hazards. During flight, pilots must monitor and control six variables. Three of them — yaw, pitch, and roll — <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>aircraft</b> axes and {{are known as}} orientation variables. The other three — altitude, position, and lateral deviation — <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> flight path and are known as position variables. Wickens proposes that monitoring and controlling these variables creates a cumulative workload {{that can lead to}} poor spatial awareness.|$|R

40|$|New {{aircraft}} {{come with}} a set of recommended standard operating procedures, in the case of multi-crew aircraft this includes "callouts"-verbalizations of particular flight guidance automation mode changes. In an attempt to reduce the risk for mode confusion some operators have required flight crews to callout all flight guidance automation mode changes as a means of forcing pilots to monitor the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA). Previous research has shown that crews do not spend enough time on the flight mode annunciator, and skip mode call-outs as well as making call-outs in advance of annunciations; there has been no report of any system or regularity in the shedding and adaptation of callouts. One reason could be the contrived empirical simulator settings of such research, which we aimed to augment with natural observations of real cockpit work reported here. With the hope of answering, in more detail, how required verbal coordination of annunciated mode changes gets adapted to real settings we observed 19 line flights with three different airlines from the first observer's seat in the cockpit. We found that many callouts were simply shed in high-workload situations, and found regularity in the kind of callouts being shed. Callouts <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> <b>aircraft</b> automation, such as FMA call-outs, were shed before other required callouts. Our results suggested that FMA callouts were not used as a tool to detect or remember automation mode changes but as a vehicle for coordinating between the pilots themselves, a finding that could serve as a reminder for future design of callout procedures.

40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} in unmanned air vehicles with a largest linear dimension no greater than 6 inches. Micro sized air vehicles (µAV) {{are intended to}} operate close {{to a point of}} interest without detection and provide surveillance teams with critical information in life threatening situations that is currently not available in a rapid-deployment urban-environment mission scenario. This paper studies the importance of aerodynamics, propulsion, and mission requirements on the design of a µAV. A Multi-Disciplinary Optimization method is used to size µAV’s for a baseline mission. Sensitivity studies of the optimized designs identify features that most strongly affect its performance. Electric and internal combustion engine propulsion are compared. Results of these analyses show that large energy density, power density, and maximum lift capability are the most important features of successful µAV’s and that ICE power is superior to electric because of its larger power density. The results also show that increases in parasite drag due to low Reynolds number is of minor importance so long as lift capability is maintained. Maneuverability constraints have the strongest influence on µAV size because smaller turn radii require lower wing loadings and for a fixed weight this implies larger wing area and size. Three radio controlled prototypes of µAV’s were built and test flown based on the design study results. These vehicles are a 9 inch span electric powered fixed-wing, a 6 inch span ICE powered fixed-wing, and a 7 inch diameter ICE powered VTOL design. Each design has been flown successfully as a radio control aircraft and the flight test results revealed several unexpected difficulties <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> <b>aircraft</b> stability, control, and propulsion system integration. Further numerical analysis of the VTOL design shows that the size penalty for VTOL capability is negligible and that a 6 inch tail-sitter µAV can perform all of the mission requirements and operate in VTOL and translational flight modes...|$|E
