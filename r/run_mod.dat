5000|$|The 2004 {{release of}} Croc Shop's double CD {{retrospective}} [...] "S.E.A. (Self-Extracting Archive)" [...] {{coincided with a}} re-release by Pittsburgh's Get Hip Records of the Mod Fun retrospective CD called [...] "Past... Forward." [...] Many of the original members of both bands reunited for a release party for these discs. The positive vibe among Hale, Strete and Collins coupled with the timliness of the Mod Fun CD re-release ultimately led to the reformation of that band for another 6-year <b>run.</b> <b>Mod</b> Fun went on to perform in Nashville, Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia, DC and all over their NYC/NJ home-base. In addition, the reunited Mod Fun released a double CD in June 2007. Entitled [...] "Now...and Again,", which contained 10 new tracks and 10 re-recordings of Mod Fun classics from their 80's vinyl catalogue. In 2010 Mod Fun released another CD entitled [...] "Futurepresent" [...] with 15 new tracks.|$|E

50|$|Since 2005 the Spring Engine {{is being}} {{developed}} by The Spring Community. The project has surpassed its initial goal to have the game <b>run</b> the <b>mods</b> and third-party units from Total Annihilation, and {{has evolved into a}} more general RTS engine. Most of the games running on the engine (as of December 2010) are focused on multiplayer gameplay. There are also currently a number of single player missions, built on frameworks utilizing the engine's Lua scripting abilities. There are also a large number of skirmish artificial intelligences (AIs), allowing for offline play or extra players in an online game.|$|R
5000|$|... bit-tech {{first became}} widely {{known for its}} {{community}} of PC case modders who would re-shape and decorate PC hardware {{into a variety of}} more creative forms. Although the site has since expanded to include hardware and games reviews, it still <b>runs</b> regular <b>modding</b> coverage including the very popular Mod of the Month and Mod of the Year competitions and regular project articles. In 2012, bit-tech launched the Case Mod Index - an ever-growing database of computer mods, sorted by case manufacturers such as Cooler Master or SilverStone. You're able to see all computer mods based on a specific case, as well as browse dozens of completed projects.|$|R
50|$|Alongside the HS/Wolf {{programme}} the <b>MOD</b> <b>ran</b> {{a design}} project {{for a new}} battlefield ambulance vehicle, known as Project Pulse. This was also won by Land Rover with {{a version of the}} ultra-long wheelbase Defender 130. Whilst not officially a 'Wolf' the 130 ambulances (with bodies by Marshall Aerospace) used the same chassis and transmission upgrades, identical drivetrains and the same Defender-based front bodywork.|$|R
50|$|Around November 2011, the mod Forge was released. Rather than {{adding new}} {{gameplay}} features to Minecraft, Forge allowed players {{to be able}} to <b>run</b> several client-side <b>mods</b> simultaneously. Before becoming compatible with Forge, IndustrialCraft and BuildCraft would not run side-by-side, because both of them needed to overwrite the same Minecraft base Java files. Forge ended the necessity to manipulate these files, allowing separate <b>mods</b> to <b>run</b> together without requiring them to touch the base source code.|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} a {{combination}} of country-specific research programs that were run by ARL and MoD respectively. The ARL runs several programs called Collaborative Technology Alliances (CTAs) and the <b>MoD</b> <b>runs</b> equivalent programs, each of which are collaborative research programs involving multiple research institutes and universities. The CTAs programs are run for the duration of 3-5 years, and usually involve a consortium of industrial research laboratories and universities to team together to solve research problems in a specific domain.|$|R

5|$|The {{preservation}} of Gibraltar's fortifications, {{and of its}} architectural heritage in general, has been a problematic issue. The peninsula is extremely short of land; in the early 1980s, nearly half the available land was in military usage, comprising the naval dockyard, {{the whole of the}} southern part of Gibraltar, {{the upper part of the}} Rock and a significant amount of property within the city walls, in addition to the runway and military facilities on the isthmus. Until recently, Gibraltar had no public sea front of its own due to military land usage. As the military presence has been <b>run</b> down, <b>MOD</b> property has been handed over to the Government of Gibraltar but the latter has lacked the resources to look after all of the buildings and land that have been transferred. This has led to the abandonment and severe physical deterioration of significant parts of Gibraltar's military heritage.|$|R
50|$|Having {{developed}} SMCS-NG as {{an internal}} project, BAE Systems independently proposed to the MoD {{that the original}} SMCS equipment be replaced by its own, newer, version. After sea trials in HMS Torbay, the MoD awarded contracts to BAE Systems for refit of SMCS-NG into most RN submarines, including the Vanguard fleet. Although the Defence Minister Adam Ingram told the UK Parliament in October 2004 that no decision had been made about conversion of the Vanguard fleet to <b>run</b> SMCS-NG, the <b>MoD</b> placed the contracts the following month. By December 2008, all of the active Royal Navy submarines had been retrofitted with SMCS-NG.|$|R
50|$|Born in the Mojave Desert as James Forrest Cockerille III, Forrest Gander {{grew up in}} Virginia {{where he}} and his two sisters were raised by their single mother, an {{elementary}} school teacher. The four shared a two-room apartment in Annandale; Gander's estranged father <b>ran</b> The <b>Mod</b> Scene, a bar on Bleecker St. in Greenwich Village, NY. Because his father didn't pay child support, Gander's early life was financially stressful. With his mother and sisters, Gander began to travel extensively on summer road trips around the United States. The traveling, which never stopped, came to inform his interest in landscapes, languages, and cultures. In 1972, Forrest and his two sisters, Karin and Lisa, were adopted by Walter J. Gander soon after Walter Gander's marriage to their mother, the former Ruth Clare Cockerille. Gander earned college degrees in geology, a subject referenced frequently in both his poems and essays, and in English literature. His work has been linked to ecopoetics and ecology. A writer in multiple genres, Gander is noted for his many collaborations with other artists. He is a United States Artists Rockefeller Fellow and the recipient of fellowships from the Library of Congress, the National Endowment for the Arts, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, The Whiting Foundation, and the Howard Foundation. In 2017, he was elected as a Chancellor to the Academy of American Poets.|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} the creation of initial three dimensional geodatabase from planning and designing through the determination of technological and manufacturing processes to practical using of Central Geospatial Database (CGD – official name in Slovak language is Centrálna Priestorová Databáza – CPD) and shortly describes procedures of its revision. CGD ensures proper collection, processing, storing, transferring and displaying of digital geospatial information. CGD is used by Ministry of Defense (MoD) for defense and crisis management tasks and by Integrated rescue system. For military personnel CGD is <b>run</b> on <b>MoD</b> intranet, and for other users outside of MoD is transmutated to ZbGIS (Primary Geodatabase of Slovak Republic) and is run on public web site. CGD is a global set of geo-spatial information. CGD is a vector computer model which completely covers entire territory of Slovakia. Seamless CGD is created by digitizing of real world using of photogrammetric stereoscopic methods and measurements of objects properties. Basic vector model of CGD (from photogrammetric processing) is then taken out to the field for inspection and additional gathering of objects properties in the whole area of mapping. Finally real-world objects are spatially modeled as a entities of three-dimensional database. CGD gives us opportunity, to get know the territory complexly in all the three spatial dimensions. Every entity in CGD has recorded the time of collection, which allows the individual to assess the timeliness of information. CGD can be utilized {{for the purposes of}} geographical analysis, geo-referencing, cartographic purposes as well as various special-purpose mapping and has the ambition to cover the needs not only the MoD, but to become a reference model for the national geographical infrastructure...|$|R
