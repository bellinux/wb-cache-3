40|$|The {{method of}} {{activation}} energy asymptotics {{is used to}} {{study the effects of}} Lewis numbers different from unity on nonadiabatic flamelets in counterflowing streams of reactants and products. A sequence of analyses parallels those reported earlier for such flamelets having Lewis number unity. Thus initial results relate to nearly adiabatic flows with Lewis numbers close to unity. It is found that the effect of nonunity Lewis numbers is accentuated in flamelets subjected to low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> and that Lewis numbers greater than unity tend to promote extinction. Thus abrupt extinction and ignition events can occur even under adiabatic conditions. Next fully nonadiabatic flamelets with Lewis numbers near unity are treated in order to consider cases involving relatively large degrees of product heating and cooling. These results relate to reaction zones as they arise under conditions <b>of</b> low-to-moderate <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> with the customary diffusive-reactive balance. We also treat flamelets subjected to such high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> that the reaction zone is extended and located far into the product stream.

The split Hopkinson {{pressure bar}} (SHPB) {{continues to be}} one of the most common methods of testing materials at high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain.</b> Elevated <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain,</b> such as those found in impact and explosive applications, have been shown to induce phenomena such as strain hardening and phase transitions that can significantly affect the strength of most materials. Due to its relative simplicity and robustness, the SHPB remains one of the preferred platforms for evaluating mechanical properties <b>of</b> materials at <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> approaching 10 4 in/in-s (s - 1). At the National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR), research has been conducted to study the wave shaping techniques of SHPB using finite element analysis. The SHPB consists of two long, slender cylindrical bars, denoted input and output bars that "sandwich" a cylindrical test specimen. Utilizing a high-pressure gas gun, a third cylindrical steel bar, known as the striker bar, is fired at the input bar, causing a compressive stress wave to travel through the input bar to the input bar - test specimen interface. At this interface, a portion of the stress wave propagates through the test specimen while the remainder of the pulse reflects back through the input bar as a tensile stress wave...|$|R

The study {{results show that the}} change <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> dissipated <b>strain</b> energy are essentially the same in compaction and elastic stages, while the change <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> dissipated <b>strain</b> energy in the plastic segment shows a linear increase, so that the maximum sharp point <b>of</b> the change <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> dissipated <b>strain</b> energy is the failure point. The change <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> dissipated <b>strain</b> energy will increase during unloading confining pressure, and a small sharp point <b>of</b> change <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> dissipated <b>strain</b> energy also appears at the unloading point. The damage variable is defined to analyze the change law of failure variable over strain. In the loading test, the damage variable growth rate is first rapid then slow as a gradual process, while in the unloading test, a sudden increase appears in the damage variable before reaching the rock peak strength. According to the deterioration law of damage and the impact of confining pressure on the elastic modulus, a rock damage constitutive model is established, which has a better fitting effect on the data in the {{loading and unloading}} failure processes...|$|R
