50|$|Smelting {{involves}} more than just melting the metal out of its ore. Most ores are a chemical compound of the metal with other elements, such as oxygen (as an oxide), sulfur (as a sulfide) or carbon and oxygen together (as a carbonate). To produce the metal, these compounds have to undergo a chemical reaction. Smelting therefore consists of using suitable <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> that will combine with those oxidizing elements to free the metal.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To explore whether <b>reducing</b> <b>substance</b> misuse {{through a}} brief motivational {{intervention}} also reduces aggression and HIV risk behaviours. Methods: Participants {{were enrolled in}} a randomized controlled trial in primary care if they screened positive for substance misuse. Substance misuse was assessed using the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test; aggression, using {{a modified version of}} the Explicit Aggres-sion Scale; and HIV risk, through a count of common risk behaviours. The intervention was received on the day of the baseline interview, with a 3 -month follow-up. Results: Participants who received the intervention were significantly more likely to reduce their al-cohol use than those who did not; no effect was identified for other substances. In addition, partici-pants who <b>reduced</b> <b>substance</b> misuse (whether as an effect of the intervention or not) also reduced aggression but not HIV risk behaviours.

5000|$|... 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS or DNSA, IUPAC name 2-hydroxy-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid) is an {{aromatic}} compound that reacts with reducing sugars and other reducing molecules to form 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid, which strongly absorbs light at 540 nm. It {{was first introduced}} as a method to detect <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> in urine and has since been widely used, for example, for quantifying carbohydrate levels in blood. It is mainly used in assay of alpha-amylase. However, enzymatic methods are usually preferred due to DNS lack of specificity.|$|E
50|$|Plants for the {{production}} of lead are generally referred to as lead smelters. Primary lead production begins with sintering. Concentrated lead ore is fed into a sintering machine with iron, silica, limestone fluxes, coke, soda ash, pyrite, zinc, caustics or pollution control particulates. Smelting uses suitable <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> that will combine with those oxidizing elements to free the metal. Reduction is the final, high-temperature step in smelting. It is here that the oxide becomes the elemental metal. A reducing environment (often provided by carbon monoxide in an air-starved furnace) pulls the final oxygen atoms from the raw metal.|$|E

50|$|Potentiometric titrations {{were first}} used for redox titrations by Crotogino. He titrated halide ions using {{potassium}} permanganate using a shiny platinum electrode and a calomel electrode.

40|$|Objective: To {{test whether}} a social network {{tailored}} substance abuse prevention program can <b>reduce</b> <b>substance</b> use among high-risk adolescents without creating deviancy training (iatrogenic effects). Methods: A classroom randomized controlled trial comparing control classes with those receiving an evidence-based substance use prevention program [Towards No Drug Abuse (TND) ] and TND Network, a peer-led interactive version of TND. Students (n = 541, mean age 16. 3 years) in 75 classes from 14 alternative high schools completed surveys before and approximately 1 year after curriculum delivery. Past-month use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine were assessed. Results: Overall, TND Network {{was effective in}} <b>reducing</b> <b>substance</b> use. However, the program effect interacted with peer influence and was effective mainly for students who had peer networks that did not use substances. Students with classroom friends who use substances {{were more likely to}} increase their use. Conclusions: A peer-led interactive substance abuse prevention program can accelerate peer influences. For students with a peer environment that supports non-use, the program was effective and <b>reduced</b> <b>substance</b> use.

50|$|Dietary nitrate {{is also an}} {{important}} source of nitric oxide in mammals. Green, leafy vegetables and some root vegetables (such as beetroot) have high concentrations of nitrate. When eaten and absorbed into the bloodstream, nitrate is concentrated in saliva (about 10-fold) and is reduced to nitrite {{on the surface of the}} tongue by a biofilm of commensal facultative anaerobic bacteria. This nitrite is swallowed and reacts with acid and <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> in the stomach (such as ascorbate) to produce high concentrations of nitric oxide.

This study helps fill gaps in knowledge by testing for indirect effects of the Common Sense Parenting® (CSP) program on <b>reduced</b> <b>substance</b> use, conduct problems, and school suspensions through previously identified short-term improvements in parents’ reports of their children’s emotion regulation skills. Over two cohorts, 321 low income families of 8 th graders were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the standard CSP program, an adapted CSP Plus program, or a minimal-contact control condition. Pretest, posttest, 1 -year follow-up, and 2 -year follow-up survey assessments were completed by parents and students with 94 % retention. Intent-to-treat multivariate path analyses were conducted. Neither intervention had statistically significant total effects on the three targeted adolescent outcomes. CSP, but not CSP Plus, had statistically significant indirect effects on <b>reduced</b> <b>substance</b> use and school suspensions at the 1 -year follow-up as well as conduct problems and school suspensions at the 2 -year follow-up through increased child emotion regulation skills at posttest.

With increase in the proportion of <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> to 0, 3 %, the rate is reduced to about twice, with a 80 ° C and found to decrease its rate of growth. Main liming process preceded progressive preliming, not only where the epimerization faster but less stable, and the decomposition of fructose in the composition of the <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> to produce reactive products influencing the alkalinity of the solution and the surface state of microparticles of calcium hydroxide. The presence on the surface OH-groups and the appearance of tumors in the working environment, having in their structures group (= CO), (= O), (- СОН) contributes to the appearance of induced hydrogen bonds and partial reduction of the specific surface of the mass transfer between the solid particles and the components of the solution.

40|$|Purpose Substance use {{prevalence}} varies considerably between schools, but to date, {{whole school}} approaches for <b>reducing</b> <b>substance</b> use {{have only been}} moderately effective. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop a novel multifaceted whole-school approach to <b>reduce</b> <b>substance</b> use primarily among teenagers aged 11 - 14 years. Design/methodology/approach The outlined approach is premised on the proposal that schools can reduce the harms associated with substance use by promoting school connectedness and improving the school-related experiences of weakly connected and disconnected students. The aim of this approach is to develop students’ autonomy so that they may act in their real and long-term interests. This may be attained by promoting the realisation of essential human capacities for: practical reasoning – through valued opportunities for cognitive development and affiliation – through valued opportunities for affective development that advance students sense of acceptance within school. Schools may achieve this, it is proposed, by providing outlined forms of appropriate formal support and formal control that are augmented by particular features of school organisation, curriculum and pedagogic practice, which are also described. Findings A theoretically driven understanding of a whole school approach for <b>reducing</b> teenage <b>substance</b> use is outlined. Originality/value The outlined approach may usefully inform the development of future whole school interventions aiming to <b>reduce</b> problematic <b>substance</b> use among school students.
