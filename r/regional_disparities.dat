Primary schooling expanded throughout the country with national enrolment reaching 34.1%. There were still <b>regional</b> <b>disparities</b> with more resources going to the south than to the north.

25|$|The five-year plans, {{especially}} in the pre-liberalisation era, attempted to reduce <b>regional</b> <b>disparities</b> by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions and distributing industries across states. The results have been discouraging as these measures increased inefficiency and hampered effective industrial growth. The more advanced states have been better placed to benefit from liberalisation, with well-developed infrastructure and an educated and skilled workforce, which attract the manufacturing and service sectors. Governments of less-advanced states have tried to reduce disparities by offering tax holidays and cheap land, and focused on sectors like tourism which can develop faster than other sectors. India's income Gini coefficient is 33.9, according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), indicating overall income distribution to be more uniform than East Asia, Latin America and Africa.|$|E
25|$|In the 1968–73 period, {{personal}} income became more concentrated and <b>regional</b> <b>disparities</b> became greater. Industrial expansion took place more vigorously in the Center-South Region, which had benefited {{most from the}} import substitution industrialization strategy. Its per-capita income considerably exceeded the national average, its infrastructure was more developed, and it had an adequate supply of skilled workers and professionals. The region was therefore {{able to take advantage}} of the opportunities and incentives offered by the military regime. Although a special regional development strategy existed for the Northeast, it promoted a distorted industrialization that benefited only a few of that region's large cities; the Northeast's linkages with the Center-South were stronger than its linkages within the region. The combination of a harsh climate, a highly concentrated land-tenure system, and an elite that consistently resisted meaningful change prevented the Northeast from developing effectively.|$|E

Our study confirms that overall <b>regional</b> <b>disparity</b> declined in the 1980 s but increased in the 1990 s.

This period has been chosen {{not only because it}} reflects the latest trend, but also because it reflects the most intensive effects of globalization and economic liberalization in the Chinese economy.

Further this paper investigates the reasons behind the increasing <b>regional</b> <b>disparity</b> from the aspects of regional development policy, globalization, and economic liberalization. Biased regional policies had some effect, but their role was limited.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{evolution}} of <b>regional</b> socio-economic <b>disparity</b> in China during the period 1998 - 2010. A new composite index of development (CIRD) is developed to capture the five main dimensions of regional development: macroeconomic conditions, science and innovation performance, environmental sustainability, human capital accumulation, and public facilities provision. The investigation benchmarks 30 (out of 31) Chinese regions according to such multidimensional index of development and thus improves the understanding of {{the evolution of}} <b>regional</b> <b>disparity</b> in China in terms of the various dimensions of socio-economic development. Finally, on the basis of stochastic kernel density estimation, the paper reveals the existence of a triple-clubs pattern of convergence in the period under scrutiny, thereby informing both the literature on regional convergence and the current strategy of balancing the uneven process of growth in China.
