40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to explain <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> {{apparent}} acquiescence to the decision extending NATO membership to the Baltic States. Can the acquiescence be explained by internalization of norms stipulating the sovereign rights of the Baltic States in the Russian foreign policy paradigm? If changes in normative structures cannot account for <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> conduct, can rationalist theorizing {{shed light on the}} issue? Analysis of Russian foreign policy paradigm uncovers normative and ideational structures that are not compatible with the internalization of norms defining the sovereign rights of the former Soviet republics. In addition, conditions facilitating internalization of the new norms are absent, making it unlikely that it could account for Russian conduct. Findings of analysis of Russian foreign policy paradigm direct the account towards rationalist theorizing. Norms and ideas constituting Russian identity are found to be consistent with behavioral models specified by institutionalism, indicating that acquiescence {{is more likely to be}} a result of cost and benefit assessment by Russian policy makers, consistent with the calculative, pragmatic approach characterizing <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> foreign policy. A discussion of factors potentially affecting Russian Federation s cost-benefit calculations provides further support to the argument that <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> tacit acceptance of NATO enlargement beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union represents a strategic choice...|$|R

40|$|In December 1991, with {{three-fourths of}} the former USSR s {{territory}} and just over half of its population, Russia started down the road of its post-Soviet existence. As a successor state to the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation {{was faced with a}} multiple of challenges. The re-emergence of Russia as a separate, independent entity compelled the Russian Federation {{to come to terms with}} its revived national identity and to redefine its national interests. <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> relationship with the West lay at the core of its challenge to define what Russia is and how it should relate to the outside world. Opinion divided over whether Russia should rapidly integrate with Europe and return to the civilized community of nations or whether it should seek a strengthening of <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> positions in the East and rather pursue its unique mission as a mediator between the East and West. Against this backdrop I will analyse <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> membership in the Council of Europe and its partial compliance to the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) Protocol No. 6, which refer to the abolishment of the death penalty in peacetime. Employing constructivist insights, I argue that <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> partial compliance to Protocol No. 6 is explained by the lack of a coherent and widely accepted national identity, which is part of a wider, more fundamental identity debate that has lasted for centuries in Russia. Due to the different perceptions of <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> identity among state actors, when these identities collide interests and consequently action will be in a competing and conflictual relationship to each other. Thus, norm compliance is challenged when identities overlap and their norms conflict. This, I argue, is evident in <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> relationship with the European ideational community and the country s dealing with the death penalty issue. The more Russian state actors value the European identity of their state, the more they will seek to comply with norms incumbent upon European states, such as the strong European abolitionist norm. It follows that in the opposite case, actors will be more reluctant to abide by European norms, and thus norm violation is more likely. In my analysis, I explore whether it is right to fully dismiss rational explanations to <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> partial compliance. In this way I bring my case into the midst of the rational-constructivist debate in International Relations theory. Contributing to this debate I investigate whether an either or approach is the most productive way of explaining <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> ideational behaviour or whether rational and constructivist assumptions combined may shed new light on how to understand Russian compliance with international human rights norms or lack of such...|$|R
