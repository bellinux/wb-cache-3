5000|$|The [...] "Stories of the Childhood Stalin", {{was a book}} {{of stories}} {{supposedly}} of Stalin's childhood life. On 16 February 1938, within days of its release on bookshelves, Stalin {{wrote a letter to}} the Central Committee of the All Union Komsomol to tell them of his disdain for the book they promoted:I am absolutely against the publication of [...] "Stories of the childhood of Stalin". The book abounds with a mass <b>of</b> <b>inexactitudes</b> <b>of</b> fact, of alterations, of exaggerations and of unmerited praise. Some amateur writers, scribblers, (perhaps honest scribblers) and some adulators have led the author astray. It is a shame for the author, but a fact remains a fact. But this is not the important thing. The important thing resides in the fact that the book has a tendency to engrave on the minds of Soviet children (and people in general) the personality cult of leaders, of infallible heroes. This is dangerous and detrimental. The theory of [...] "heroes" [...] and the [...] "crowd" [...] is not a Bolshevik, but a Social-Revolutionary theory. The heroes make the people, transform them from a crowd into people, thus say the Social-Revolutionaries. The people make the heroes, thus reply the Bolsheviks to the Social-Revolutionaries. The book carries water to the windmill of the Social-Revolutionaries. No matter which book it is that brings the water to the windmill of the Social-Revolutionaries, this book is going to drown in our common, Bolshevik cause. I suggest we burn this book.|$|R
5000|$|Actually this thermal [...] "thermodynamic force" [...] is {{a manifestation}} of the degree of inexact {{specification}} of the microscopic initial conditions for the system, expressed in the thermodynamic variable known as temperature, [...] Temperature is only one example, and all the thermodynamic macroscopic variables constitute inexact specifications of the initial conditions, and have their respective [...] "thermodynamic forces". These <b>inexactitudes</b> <b>of</b> specification are the source of the apparent fluctuations that drive the generation of dynamical structure, of the very precise but still less than perfect reproducibility of non-equilibrium experiments, and of the place of entropy in thermodynamics. If one did not know <b>of</b> such <b>inexactitude</b> <b>of</b> specification, one might find the origin of the fluctuations mysterious. What is meant here by [...] "inexactitude of specification" [...] is not that the mean values of the macroscopic variables are inexactly specified, but that the use of macroscopic variables to describe processes that actually occur by the motions and interactions of microscopic objects such as molecules is necessarily lacking in the molecular detail of the processes, and is thus inexact. There are many microscopic states compatible with a single macroscopic state, but only the latter is specified, and that is specified exactly {{for the purposes of the}} theory.|$|R

With new approaches rapidly emerging, questions arise as to how to validate and assess the resulting models, as they tend to include at least some level <b>of</b> geometric <b>inexactitude.</b> This paper proposes a set of parameters and procedures for evaluating the usefulness of computational models for structural analysis of historic facades subjected to adjacent construction work. To test the usability of such an approach, three brick buildings were scanned with a terrestrial laser scanner. The data were processed with a recently proposed set of algorithms, and the reliability of the resulting solid models was evaluated by comparing finite-element results from auto-generated solid models versus those based on measured drawings. The proposed validation process considers overall response, as well as local behavior. The results show the importance of using both conventional values and project specific parameters...|$|R
