50|$|Others think {{differently}} on this. According to Anthony Aust, “if {{one or more}} contracting states have objected to the reservation as being prohibited, the <b>reserving</b> <b>state</b> must {{decide whether or not}} it is prepared to be a party without the reservation; and until it has made its position clear it cannot be regarded as a party”.|$|E
5000|$|Reservations are {{essentially}} caveats to a state's {{acceptance of a}} treaty. Reservations are unilateral statements purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation {{and its effects on}} the <b>reserving</b> <b>state.</b> These must be included at the time of signing or ratification, i.e. [...] "a party cannot add a reservation after it has already joined a treaty".|$|E
50|$|When a state limits its treaty {{obligations}} through reservations, other states party to that treaty {{have the option}} to accept those reservations, object to them, or object and oppose them. If the state accepts them (or fails to act at all), both the <b>reserving</b> <b>state</b> and the accepting state are relieved of the reserved legal obligation as concerns their legal obligations to each other (accepting the reservation does not change the accepting state's legal obligations as concerns other parties to the treaty). If the state opposes, the parts of the treaty affected by the reservation drop out completely and no longer create any legal obligations on the reserving and accepting state, again only as concerns each other. Finally, if the state objects and opposes, there are no legal obligations under that treaty between those two state parties whatsoever. The objecting and opposing state essentially refuses to acknowledge the <b>reserving</b> <b>state</b> is a party to the treaty at all.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem with}} {{inadmissible}} reservations happens more often with human rights treaties. Many reservations to these treaties have been made. However not {{many states have}} expressed their objection. When states did make objections, not many have taken {{the position that the}} treaty is not in force between them and the <b>reserving</b> <b>state,</b> in the hope that they can influence the reserving states into eventually accepting all the provisions in the treaty.|$|E
50|$|According to some commentators, {{what happens}} in {{practise}} in the VCLT regime is the third option. What follows from article 20 paragraph 4(b) and article 21 paragraph 3 VCLT {{is that the only}} thing which can happen is, that if an objecting state feels very strongly about a reservation, it will state that the whole treaty is not in effect between the <b>reserving</b> <b>state</b> and itself. This rarely happens, thus the reservation stands, whether it passed the legality test or not.|$|E
50|$|However, when a {{monitoring}} body {{is established}} by {{a human rights}} treaty, it is allowed only to comment on or make recommendations about reservations. The ILC {{did not agree with}} General Comment 24 of the Human Rights Committee. The fact that the monitoring body can comment upon the admissibility of reservations has no effect on the principle of state consent. The Human Rights Committee stated that they themselves can decide what the consequence will be of an inadmissible reservation. The ILC states that only the <b>reserving</b> <b>state</b> can decide what action it will follow. The state can decide to withdraw or change its reservation or decide not to become a party to the treaty in question.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} treaty {{formation}} and reservations to multilateral treaties, enshrined in Articles 19 - 21 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, establishes {{the principle that}} reservations are reciprocal. The treaty will be in force between a <b>reserving</b> <b>state</b> and a non-reserving state as amended by the reservation. Therefore a state that wants to exempt itself from a treaty obligation must let other nations escape that same burden. This paper presents an economic model of treaty formation and considers the effect of reciprocity on treaty ratifications among heterogeneous states. The model reveals that the Vienna Convention creates a strategic advantage for states with high costs and low benefits. ...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (‘CISG’) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{accepted}} and important international private law agreements. It attempts to eliminate written formalities for contracting under it ‘freedom of form’ provisions, yet it simultaneously allows signatory states to take a reservation, and declare that they do not accept the provisions of the CISG which eliminate these formalities. This leaves open a doctrinal puzzle: how should courts rule when there is a dispute over the existence of a valid contract, there has not been an effective choice of law, and one party is from a declaring state? While most courts have approached this problem through the methodology of private international law, this thesis proposes that the better reading of the CISG will ordinarily favour applying the reservation and using the formalities rules of the <b>reserving</b> <b>state...</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the default {{application of the}} 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties reservation rules to reservations to human rights treaties. The contemporary practice of formulating reservations allows states to unilaterally modify their treaty obligations following the conclusion of negotiations. Though multilateral treaties address {{a broad spectrum of}} subjects and are negotiated using a variety of methods, all treaties are governed by the same residual reservation rules of the Vienna Convention when there is not a treaty-specific reservation regime in place. The Vienna Convention system is only engaged if a state seizes the opportunity to determine whether a reservation is valid pursuant to default rules or if a challenge regarding the validity of a reservation is brought before another competent mechanism of review, such as a dispute resolution mechanism. Even when applied, the Vienna Convention rules are ambiguous at best and have been criticised since their inception due to the high degree of flexibility in their application, especially in relation to human rights treaties. In light of the inherent flaws of the Vienna Convention reservation regime and the structural characteristics of human rights treaties, rarely will a <b>reserving</b> <b>state</b> be deprived of the benefit of the reservation even if it is determined to be invalid by another State Party. Though the consequences of an invalidity determination are more concrete when the decision is taken by a dispute resolution mechanism, such as a court, seldom are disputes over the validity of a reservation to a human rights treaty submitted to a competent mechanism. Using the core UN human rights treaties as a case study this research highlights that the past thirty years have revealed a practical impasse in treaty law when the default reservation rules are relied upon to regulate reservations to human rights treaties. Reservations of questionable validity gain the same status as valid reservations because the Vienna Convention rules do not address the consequence for a reservation determined to be invalid outwith the traditional inter se application of the reservation between the reserving and objecting states, which is not logical {{in the context of a}} human rights treaty. Against this background, this thesis examines whether the default reservation rules adequately govern reservations to human rights treaties. The conclusion affirms that the Vienna Convention reservation regime can regulate reservations to human rights treaties but only if there is a clearly defined final view on the validity of a reservation taken by an organ other than the state. Therefore, it is argued that treaty-specific supervisory mechanisms attached to each of the core UN human rights treaties should be invested with the competency to serve a determinative function with respect to evaluating reservations to human rights treaties in order to facilitate a stronger basis for the international human rights system.
