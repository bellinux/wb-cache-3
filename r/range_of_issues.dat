5|$|Equal {{franchise}} {{was eventually}} won {{with the passing}} of the Representation of the People Act 1928. This was not achieved through a matter of course, but through a constant campaign of organised pressure. The NUWSS reorganised into the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), taking on a broader <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> to secure more widespread support.|$|E

The AWSA worked almost exclusively for women's suffrage while the NWSA initially worked on a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> including divorce reform and equal pay for women. The AWSA included both men and women among its leadership while the NWSA was led by women. The AWSA worked for suffrage mostly at the state level while the NWSA worked more at the national level. The AWSA cultivated an image of respectability while the NWSA sometimes used confrontational tactics.|$|E
5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, {{and to the world}} outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E

5|$|Women {{experience}} many unique {{health issues}} related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E
5|$|The {{program had}} some loose ends that {{manifested}} themselves later. Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts. Critics {{noted that the}} refugees had become a special interest group that fostered resentment. The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village, hoping to maintain social continuity. In some cases, Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas. Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps {{on the outskirts of}} the capital, wanting to live an urban lifestyle, and objecting to Diem's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed. On occasions, the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem's residence. Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory. This was efficient in the short run but meant that they would never assimilate into southern society. They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt, sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag. Peter Hansen, an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion, has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present, due to issues of regionalism and local traditions. Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co-religionists, and were more likely to see non-Catholics as a threat. He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more willing to listen to the advice of priests on a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters. These differences and the sense of segregation persist to the current day.|$|E
