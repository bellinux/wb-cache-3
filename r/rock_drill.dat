5|$|Nevinson {{had four}} {{pictures}} {{included in the}} Second Exhibition of the London Group held in March 1915. Nevinson's Futurist painting, Returning to the Trenches, and the sculpture The <b>Rock</b> <b>Drill</b> by Jacob Epstein received the most attention and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances {{that he would not}} be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and fit out new wards. Sometimes he would be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and unload, the hospital trains arriving from France and for a while he worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with acute rheumatic fever.|$|E
25|$|Burbick had {{originally}} planned on using elements {{from the former}} Gougler Industries offices, which were from {{the same time period}} as the hotel. The owner of the former Gougler buildings, Furukawa <b>Rock</b> <b>Drill</b> USA, donated the items in 2011 after the Gougler buildings were torn down. Preservation guildelines, however, prohibited using materials from one old building in the restoration of another, so the woodwork was used to create a permanent display about Gougler Industries in the Acorn Corner building and as part of a conference room in the adjacent Acorn Alley II development.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{huge and}} costly {{inundation}} of the Golden Gate Consols mine in 1898, then the deepest mine on the field, the owners let a contract for £3,000 to Walkers Limited of Maryborough for pumping equipment. The plant was installed by Emslie Limited of Croydon {{in the first six}} weeks of 1899 and commenced operation in February that year. In 1901 the plant incorporated both single and double winding gear, three steam engines of 54hp, six pumps, an air compressor and a <b>rock</b> <b>drill,</b> valued at £7,000. It was by far the most valuable pumping equipment on the goldfield and technically the most up-to-date. The pump also delivered water to the Golden Gate Milling Company mill in 1900. The pumping equipment remained in use until the closure of the mine in 1911.|$|E

2500|$|The tunnel {{construction}} project required excavation of [...] of rock. On March 16, 1853, [...] "Wilson's Patented Stone-Cutting Machine" [...] (a tunnel boring machine) was used; it failed after excavating [...] of rock. Tunnel builders resorted to hand digging, and later used the Burleigh <b>Rock</b> <b>Drill,</b> {{one of the}} first pneumatic drills. Construction also featured the first large-scale commercial use of nitroglycerine and electric blasting caps.|$|E
2500|$|To carve a tunnel, {{one worker}} held a <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> on the granite face while {{one to two}} other workers swung eighteen-pound sledgehammers to {{sequentially}} hit the drill which slowly advanced into the rock. Once the hole was about [...] deep, it would be filled with black powder, a fuse set and then ignited from a safe distance. Nitroglycerin, which had been invented less than two decades before {{the construction of the}} first transcontinental railroad, was used in relatively large quantities during its construction. [...] This was especially true on the Central Pacific Railroad, which owned its own nitroglycerin plant to ensure it had a steady supply of the volatile explosive. This plant was operated by Chinese laborers as they were willing workers even under the most trying and dangerous of conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The summit tunnel (Number 6), , {{was started}} in late 1865, well ahead of the railhead. Through solid granite, the summit tunnel progressed {{at a rate of}} only about [...] per day per face as it was being worked by three eight-hour shifts of workers, hand {{drilling}} holes with a <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> and hammer, filling them with black powder and trying to blast the granite loose. One crew worked drilling holes on the faces and another crew collected and removed the loosened rock after each explosion. The workers were pulled off the summit tunnel and the track grading east of Donner Pass in the winter of 1865–66 as {{there was no way to}} supply them, nor quarters they could have lived in. The crews were transferred to work on bridges and track grading on the Truckee River canyon.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of springy impact interface and of curved drill rods on energy transfer in percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> was studied. Analytical models for pneumatic and hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> were introduced, {{in which the}} springy piston-rod impact interface was taken into account. A nonlinear model for the springy impact interface was also implemented in a computer simulation program for percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> systems. Laboratory tests were performed and the experimental results were compared with the results by three theoretical models. The agreement between theoretical and experimental incident stress waves {{was found to be}} satisfactory. The factors affecting the <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> efficiency were analysed. For the hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> investigated, it was found that a springy impact interface slightly decreases the drilling efficiency. For pneumatic <b>rock</b> <b>drills,</b> however, the analysis showed that an appropriate springy impact interface might increase the drilling efficiency significantly. The reflection and transmission of harmonic stress waves at a constant curvature bend of an ilifinite uniform bar was analysed theoretically. The energy fluxes of the reflected and transmitted extensional and flexural waves were obtained for an incident wave which may be either extensional or flexural. Results are shown in polar radiation diagrams for an incident extensional wave. It was found that for bends of small angles, the radius of curvature has little effect on the transmission of extensional stress waves and a significant amount of extensional wave energy is transmitted through the bends. Furthermore, the efficiency of percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> with a bent drill rod was investigated using a combined approach of FFT and matrix method. In percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> with slightly bent rods (bend angle up to 100), {{it was found that the}} efficiency is practically the same as with straight rods. It was also found that the efficiency can remain high even if the rod is significantly bent (bend angle up to 30 °). Godkänd; 1993; 20070429 (ysko...|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} day, however, confirmations of {{the agreement}} came from Lonmin and unions. Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration commissioner Afzul Soobedaar said: [...] "We have reached an agreement that we have worked tirelessly for" [...] and that the negotiations were an arduour process but congratulated all parties for being committed to reach a solution. National Union of Mineworker's negotiator Eric Gcilitshana said that there would now be stability at Lonmin with the return to work; while President of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Joseph Mathunjwa issued a statement that read: [...] "This {{could have been done}} without losing lives." [...] Lonmin spokesman in South Africa Abbey Kgotle said they were content with the resolution after difficult talks and that the agreement was dedicated to those killed. The final resolution entailed the miner working at the lowest depths earning between R9,611 from the previous R8,164, a winch operator would now earn R9,883 up from R8,931, a <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> operator would earn R11,078 from R9,063 and a production team leader would earn R13,022 from R11,818. The return to work on 20 September coincided with {{the last day of the}} COSATU conference in Midland, Johannesburg. At the same time, it was reported that an unnamed number of strikers left the unions that had previously represented them.|$|E

40|$|This thesis work is {{performed}} at Sandvik Mining Rock Tools, a world leading supplier of <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> tools. The work {{is part of}} developing a new tribological wear test method for cemented carbide drill bit inserts. The test method has earlier been judged successful in mimicking the rotary-percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> process because it gives the same wear mechanisms as have been observed for inserts used in <b>rock</b> <b>drilling.</b> During testing the cemented carbide drill bit insert is pressed against a moving rock surface while water and particles {{are added to the}} contact area. The particles are present to simulate the rock crushings formed during drilling. They are believed to cause abrasive wear of the inserts. In this work the effect of load, particle material and particle size are studied. When adding silica particles, which are softer than the cemented carbide material, no correlation is obtained between wear rate and load or particle size. Cracking of WC grains, added rock material and removal of pieces of carbide material are seen at the worn sample surfaces. These observations are similar to observations described in other works about wear of cemented carbide. Adding alumina particles, which are harder than the sample material, gives high wear rate and ground/striped sample surfaces. The wear rate increases with alumina particle size...|$|R
