30|$|A {{landslide}} inventory map, consisting 595 landslides, {{was prepared}} from field observations and Google earth {{images of the}} study area (Figure  2). Landslides in the area include <b>rock</b> <b>slides,</b> <b>rock</b> falls, debris <b>slide</b> and mudflow. According to Ayalew and Yamagishi (2004) rock falls exist as discernible block topples and wedge failures along the mountains, valley walls and road cuts. Similarly, <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> are also abundant on the ridge sides and valley walls. The intensity of landslides is generally high in the upper catchments of Bechet and Muga valleys and on the road cut near GohaTsiyon town.|$|R

50|$|The sudden, {{rapid release}} of {{material}} found in <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> {{combined with the}} sheer size and weight of the material that is falling is what gives these events the potential to have devastating effects on human life and infrastructure. <b>Rock</b> <b>slides</b> are very common in the over steepened canyons and drainages of Idaho, particularly in those areas like the Salmon River Canyon where more than 5,000 feet of elevation may exist between the ridge tops and the canyon bottoms.|$|R
5|$|The {{prevalent}} {{force of}} Alchemy in Weyard's ancient past enabled {{the development of}} great civilizations. However, this thriving period eventually {{gave way to a}} worldwide conflict that subsided only with the sealing away of Alchemy. The keys to unlocking Alchemy, the four Elemental Stars which hold the pure power of the four elements, are hidden within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which in turn is guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain's base. In the game's prologue, Saturos and Menardi, with help from a raiding party, storm Mt. Aleph with the intention to seize the Elemental Stars for themselves. They fail to solve the riddles guarding the stars and are driven away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and <b>rock</b> <b>slide.</b>|$|E

25|$|Mokattam {{village is}} {{situated}} {{at the foot of}} the Mokattam mountains, which has proven to be a precarious geographic location. In 1993, there was a rockslide from Mokattam Mountain, which fell near the bordering area of the Zabbaleen settlement, resulting in the deaths of 40 people. More recently, in 2008, another <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> from the Mokattam hills killed more than 100 people in El-Duweiqa, another shantytown in the Mokattam district. These rock slides have brought attention to the precarious location of shantytowns located below the Mokattam mountains as well as to the Zabbaleen. Some attribute these frequent rock slides to various development and construction activities on Mokattam Mountain's upper plateau on which the upper middle class residential district of Mokattam City is located.|$|E

25|$|Muviro (Kevin Michael Richardson) - a treacherous Waziri warrior {{and one of}} Basuli's subordinates. Despite serving for Basuli, Muviro holds a {{personal}} hatred and jealousy against the chief's son, and is hostile towards outsiders (mainly Tarzan and his friends). Upon learning that Basuli is planning to get an eagle's feather with Tarzan's help {{as part of the}} customs for Basuli to marry and be future chief, Muviro secretly plotted to dispose of Basuli so that he himself can be the new chief. He caused several incidents during Tarzan and Basuli's journey: such as chopping down a tree into a river they were crossing over, disturbing a herd of rhinos to stampede after the duo and causing a <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> on them in an elephant graveyard near the mountain. After the third attempt fails, Muviro reveals his true colors to both Tarzan and Basuli before engaging into a fight with the latter. Fortunately, Basuli defeats Muviro and banishes him from the tribe for his treachery, and Muviro is last seen walking away into the midst with an angry look on his face, implying that he might return to get revenge.|$|E

2500|$|The {{instrument}} that was {{installed at the}} Pacoima Dam recorded a peak horizontal acceleration of 1.25g, a value that was {{twice as large as}} anything ever seen from an earthquake. The extraordinarily high acceleration was just one part of the picture, considering that duration and frequency of shaking also play a role in how much damage can occur. The accelerometer was mounted on a concrete platform on a granite ridge just above one of the arch dam's abutments. Cracks formed in the rocks and a <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> came within [...] of the apparatus, and the foundation remained undamaged, but a small (half-degree) tilt of the unit was discovered that was apparently responsible for closing the horizontal pendulum contacts. [...] As a result of what was considered a fortunate accident, the machine kept recording for six minutes (until it ran out of paper) and provided scientists with additional data on 30 of the initial aftershocks.|$|E
2500|$|The Gateway to the Narrows Trail, {{also known}} as the Riverside Walk, [...] is a {{relatively}} short nature trail of one mile along the Virgin River. It connects the parking area at the Temple of Sinawava with The Narrows and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The trail uses local materials such as red sandstone to blend with its surroundings, following the tenets of the National Park Service Rustic style. Survey work was carried out in 1928 by National Park Service engineer Guy D. Edwards. Construction began the following year under the supervision of Walter Ruesch. On August 1, 1968 a <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> buried a 250-foot portion of the trail with debris ranging from three to twenty feet deep. Rather than removing the rock, the trail was routed over the slide. The trail was upgraded for accessibility by the handicapped in 1982. The trail and kiosk were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 1987, reference number 86003726.|$|E
2500|$|An area very {{prone to}} rockslides is the Pigeon River Gorge, {{especially}} {{in the vicinity of}} the Tennessee–North Carolina state line. Throughout the 1970s, this stretch of I-40 was repeatedly shut down by rockslides, sometimes for several weeks at a time. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, TDOT dug over [...] of horizontal drains, blasted out large volumes of unstable rocks, and installed massive mesh catchment fences. Nevertheless, rockslides in 1985 and 1997 again forced the closure of I-40 in the Pigeon River Gorge for several weeks. Additional stabilization measures were implemented, including the blasting of loose rock, the installation of rock bolts, and the construction of a better drainage system. In spite of these measures, another massive <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> occurred in the Pigeon River Gorge on October 26, 2009, blocking all lanes just across the border at North Carolina mile 3. The section was closed to traffic in both directions until April 25, 2010. On January 31, 2012, the westbound lanes of I-40 were closed because of a rockslide near the North Carolina border. Traffic was detoured along I-26 and I-81 and reopened a few months later.|$|E
