25|$|This {{reflects}} {{the idea that}} workers {{have a vested interest}} in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|E

We employed two indicators of MH - the K 6 scale of Mental Illness (MI) and an indicator for symptoms of Mania or Delusions (M|D). Instrumental variable (IV) models used measures of social support as instruments for MI. Unadjusted work rates were higher for immigrants (vs US-born adults). Regressions show that MI is associated with lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> among US-born males but not immigrant males and females; M|D is associated lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> among US-born males and females, and among immigrant males. Results did not change using IV models for MI. Most persons with MI work, yet symptom severity reduces labor supply among natives especially. Immigrants' labor supply is less affected by MI.
