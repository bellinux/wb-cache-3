40|$|Abstract: Taking {{greening}} to {{the supply}} chain level (beyond partial, yet often used, <b>reversed</b> <b>logistics)</b> can be based on technological and operational initiatives {{in the sphere of}} design for recycling, disassembly, extended life cycles and future innovations and the related operations. The supply chain dimension is lacking in the most recent state-of-the-art contribution from Reinhardt on greening from a business point of view. In addressing that gap this paper aims to place greening technological and operations initiatives in a supply chain context. In two case studies of automotive companies greening attempts and approaches are assessed in terms of both supply chain practices and relations. It is found that the operations and technological practices in {{the supply chain}} are not yet fully developed to realize the strategic approach of greening. Suggestions for further management and research efforts are developed and the impact of greening technology and operations on supply chain relations and challenges are discussed...|$|R

Based on the initiatives {{collected in the}} literature, 20 experts have extracted key measures expected to be particularly efficient in food waste reduction or valorization. These key measures are the following: 1) Education of public and professionals, 2) More flexible supply chain specifications, 3) Collaborative use of data, flow monitoring and smart sensors, 4) Regulation, taxation and financial tools, 5) Gradual withdrawal of food from market, stock clearance, on-site processing and donations, 6) Breakthrough manufacturing and packaging technologies, 7) Urban practices and urban planning, 8) Biomass valorization and biorefinery, 9) Fair distribution of responsibility between stakeholders. These key measures are analyzed according to a multi-criteria approach {{on the base of}} their expected high impact potential and transferability in many different settings. Numerous research questions addressing the food science community are also discussed; among them the question of downscaling is particularly relevant. This for logistic, where unconventional and short supply chains but also low scale <b>reversed</b> <b>logistics</b> (adapted both for collection of unsold food and of food waste) have to be developed. Dow scaling has also to be considered for processing, as small-scale transformations are required to face i) the new urban food practices such as note à note cooking, connected cooking, street food, etc., ii) the increase of new practices such as swap, urban gleaning, leftover cooking, collaborative and social solidarity food preparation actions, etc.) and iii) the development of flexible bio-refineries to transform locally produced bio-waste. Safety issues, which are particularly difficult to address in this new context of unconventional new food systems are highlighted...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates how {{new system}} {{initiatives}} around deposit-refund systems (DRS) and end-of-life management (EoLM) could merge and possibly {{lead to a}} circular and sustainable transition path of metal resources embedded in information and communications technology (ICT) products. Seen through the object of mobile phones, the cardinal objective has been {{to find ways of}} approaching full recycling and recovery of the finite metals and to see how these could be cycled back into the supply chain. In this way, bypassing environmental and social externalities in the pre-manufacturing phase from the use of virgin resources. Inspired by the transformative approach in backcasting methodology, this study builds a vision for a sustainable future of ICT products, by analyzing approaches to circular economy (Boulding) (Stahel) and how it conforms to the sustainability approach in environmental and ecological economics respectively. This vision is used to make a sustainable gap analysis of the present postcommercialisation ICT product life cycle, and to define a set of goals along information transfer, resource and value transfer and needs of technological innovation, for increased recycling and recovery of metals. This leads up to a scenario analysis for a DRS on mobile phones and the search for new opportunities in EoLM. Empirical studies for the analysis are based on a larger consumer survey around mobile phones and formal semi-structured interviews of individuals in relation to the present collection, pre-processing and end-processing stages of e-waste. The main conclusion is that a DRS system is deemed able to create a solid foundation for effective endcollection throughout the post-commercialization product life cycle and is able to transfer valuable resources and information to the EoL phase. EoLM can ensure better recovery if original equipment manufactures (OEMs) engage by using the opportunities of <b>reversed</b> <b>logistics</b> and sub-contracting the scrap-resource to end-processors. Here, {{there is a need to}} certify the processing of e-waste and to provide eco-rating systems of products, to ensure sustainability in the system and provide measurable and transparent lifecycle product profiles in the future. If such system initiatives are broadly adopted, the analysis shows that needed technological eco-innovation of products could emerge as a result of efficient collection, symbiotic network possibilities in EoL and possible push-effects from political consumers. Therefore, this study contributes to the planning field of sustainable production and consumption systems by qualifying a combined scenario on how to design and approach the opportunities in DRS and EoLM...|$|R

40|$|Food waste consumes resources, has a {{negative}} effect on the environment and leads to monetary losses for the supply chain participants. One of the ways to address food waste is to reconsider the supply chain´s linear process and implement the reverse supply chain. Many researchers consider reverse supply chain to be sustainable and value adding. Yet some studies mention that in supplier-retailer interface in the context of food industries, reverse supply chains with take-back clause might be exposed to retailers’ market power abuse and cause overproduction and waste. This study used the qualitative approach to explore implications of power relations in retailer-supplier interface on take-back practice by looking at the case of Swedish bread suppliers. All major bread suppliers that have take-back agreement along with retailer chains, representing all retailer corporate ownership groups in Sweden have been interviewed. Using the theory of market power and reverse supply chain sustainability, the study analyzed the implications of power-relations on the take-back practice and explored sustainability concerns and/or fixtures it poses for the supply chain. The study findings do not fully confirm with conclusions of previous research arguing that <b>reverse</b> supply <b>logistics</b> systems serve as additional incentive for powerful retailers to over-order or lead to higher waste due to inability of suppliers to properly dispose of waste. Yet other instances of retailer’s market power that have not been touched upon in previous research were found within studied take-back agreement. The specific terms of agreement resulting from power asymmetries were found to still cause over-ordering and other negative effects on the overall sustainability of bread supply chains. The sustainability breaches identified in the study are mainly connected with lack of retailer’s economic incentive {{to reduce the amount of}} unsold bread, which becomes the source of overproduction, and leads to economic, environmental and social costs...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{issue is}} {{becoming}} a serious global concern. Human activities associate with industrial activities and households produce {{a great amount of}} greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, and gives significant impact on the environment. The legislation on carbon emissions has become an important agenda in order to control the amount of carbon emissions that might affect the world for future generations. In conjunction to this issue, therefore, the research was conducted to investigate the impact of the carbon emission policies on <b>reverse</b> and forward <b>logistics</b> strategies and operations and propose optimisation models for the paper recycling and fresh produce industry with cases in the UK. The optimal network design approach for both cases under carbon emission control is formulated. The research concluded that exporting the waste paper to Asia is a better option when pollution from the recycling is not charged. However, when considering the carbon emission in both the UK and the Asian country, the best strategy would depend on the amount of recycling and the differences between the costs of the recycling locally and overseas. For fresh produce case, with no carbon policies, road is a better transportation option. However, if the industry has to pay for carbon emission, consideration of multimodal transportation has to be made in order to remain optimal. The analysis of business strategies and configuration of <b>reverse</b> and forward <b>logistics</b> networks are carried out with quantitative optimisation modelling. The analysis for paper recycling and the fresh produce industry consider contributions to the environment and costs in relation to carbon emission. Mixed integer linear programming models were developed for both cases to obtain the optimal choice in strategic and operational decision making. Transportation industry is a main contributor of greenhouse gases that give direct impact to the environment. Multimodal transportation planning is important because it can help to reduce impact on the environment, by using a combination of at least two modes of transportation in a single transport chain, without a change of container for the goods, with most of the route travelled by road, rail, inland waterway or ocean-going vessel and with the shortest possible initial and final journeys by road. Multimodal transportation planning is proposed in the fresh produce industry with another variable which is time. The analytical result derived from sensitivity analysis is discussed to draw academic and practical findings for carbon control policy making and logistics network configuration. The research outcome has a good generic contribution to eco-logistics management of other recycling materials and to generic logistics network configuration issues. The research is also significantly contributed to government policy making in carbon emission control...|$|R
40|$|The m ilitary defence {{system of}} the Republic of Serbia (the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Army) {{represent}} s a complex organisational and technical - technological system. T he nature of its operations imposes it to be equipped with {{a considerable amount of}} electrical and electronic equipment and devices. Such equipment and devices during operation, over time, lose their primary function, become useless and turn into electrical and electronic equipment waste; therefore, they must be handled properly. This article discusses the problems and possible directions of the logistics of development and implementation of electrical and electronic waste generated in the defence as the logistics of waste and <b>reverse</b> waste <b>logistics,</b> which is, in a narrower sense, a part of waste materials management. For the purpose of this paper, the logistics of electrical and electronic waste in the defence is regarded as the process of planning, implementation, control and realisation of flows, processes and activities of electrical and electronic waste materials from their place of origin to their place of disposal, through collecting and transportation to the final destination (places of  treatment, reuse, disposal and destruction) {{in order to meet the}} requirements of all stakeholders at minimal cost. The legislation and European initiatives in the area of electrical and electronic waste In 2003, the European Union, stimulated by the rapid emergence and amount of e-waste, as well as its hazardous influence on the environment, adopted two directives: Directive 2002 / 96 /EC of the European Parliament and the European Council on 27. 01. 2003 on the management of electrical and electronic waste (WEEE - Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and Directive 2002 / 95 /EC of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe 27. 01. 2003 on the restrictions on the use of hazardous substances in electronic and electrical equipment (RoHS - Restriction of the use of hazardous substances). The adopted Directives should improve the management of e-waste and make its treatment safer. Experience of developed countries in dealing with electrical and electronic waste Most of the management of e-waste in the developed countries of Europe and the world is organized around the existing municipal waste collection points. A common thing is the existence of three primary channels for collecting e-waste: municipal collection points, retail stores and direct return to the manufacturer. There is a great diversity in the amount of collected and treated electrical and electronic waste, although different categories of devices and the size of the population were considered. In addition to quantitative measures, various qualitative measures for the management of e-waste are defined: -        Environmentally acceptable treatment (Denmark), -        Adequate treatment in accordance with the regulations (Norway), -        Pre-treatment of waste prior to disposal in landfills (Sweden, Switzerland), -        Minimum standards for the treatment, recovery of metals and incineration of chemicals that cannot be restored (Switzerland), -        Division of devices into reusable and non-reusable ones (Belgium). Production of electronic and electrical waste in the defence system During the development and technological modernization of the military and defence system as a whole, a substantial part of electrical and electronic equipment and devices is coming into the state when it is either replaced by newer equipment or rejected. Most of such equipment and devices become e-waste. The specificity of e-waste generated in the defence system is its complexity and speed with which electrical products become obsolete and replaced by new ones. Due to rapid technology development, faulty equipment and devices are rarely repaired, but rather replaced with new ones, because it is simpler and often more cost-effective. The average life span of computers has been reduced from six to just two years. The situation is similar with other IT and telecommunications equipment. The amount of e-waste generated in the defence system is growing rapidly, and the content of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment is a major concern of the e-waste management and its recycling that it is not implemented to a sufficient extent. The amount of  electrical and electronic waste generated in the defence system In the Republic of Serbia as well as in its defence system there are no exact figures on the amount of e-waste generated in a year. Establishing fully reliable amounts of e-waste is very difficult because there are some difficulties in the quantitative determination of the parameters related to the production and consumption of electrical and electronic devices. Besides that, determining the amount of e-waste in the defence system depends on how much waste is generated in the Army units and in the organizational units of the Ministry (administration and sectors), quantities of old equipment and devices in warehouses, etc. To determine the potential volume of e-waste generated in the defence system, different approaches and methods can be used, depending on the availability of the required data. The European Agency for the Environment has proposed the use of the following methods: -        Time-progressive method (Time Step), -        Market methods, -        Carnegie-Mellon methods, -        Approximate methods I and II. The accuracy of the established amount of e-waste depends on the reliability and completeness of the database. To obtain a more reliable estimate of the potential amount of e-waste, it is advisable to simultaneously use a number of possible methods and compare the results. Given the nature of the defence system, to determine the potential volume of e-waste generated in it, it is possible to use the method of gradual time and approximate methods I and II. Activities of electrical and electronic waste logistics To fulfill the requirements of the Directive on e-Waste, it is necessary to establish effective organizational and logistic feedback systems. Collection and transportation must be organized to optimize the reuse and recycling of the components or whole appliances suitable for recycling or reuse. The preservation of devices for reuse requires proper organization and logistic operations of collecting, transporting, sorting, and waste-storage, all in order to preserve the re-usability of the product. Conclusion For successful logistics of e-waste generated in the defence system, it is necessary to continuously work on designing, planning and undertaking certain organizational measures. Designed measures should be taken during the execution of the whole process of e-waste logistics, from collection activities at the source to final disposal activities, either in processing plants or landfills. Some quality performances of e-waste logistics services can be improved. The followingt should be considered: need for development of appropriate systems for the selective collection of e-waste; need for sharing responsibilities within the logistic operations and financial management of e-waste;, possibility of establishing different control mechanisms in the management of waste materials, with efforts to the development of methods for e-waste prevention; development of measures for the prevention of sending e-waste to landfills or incineration lines; difficulties in establishing fully reliable amounts of e-waste due to some uncertainty regarding the production and consumption of electrical and electronic devices; need to establish effective organizational and logistic feedback systems; opportunity and need for the system to define number, capacity, location and organization within a collection point; and training of personnel for proper handling, loading, unloading and reloading of e-waste in order to preserve the ability to re-use it.  </p...|$|R
