2500|$|Around 1970, Robert Moses {{returned}} his {{focus to the}} expressway, proposing that the highway be extended north from Syosset.

The theme of the conference, according to The New York Times, was the [...] "gay agenda": [...] "how to make gay people straight, how gay men often sodomized teenage boys and how 'the gay movement is an evil institution' whose goal is 'to defeat the marriage-based society {{and replace it with a}} culture of sexual promiscuity'". Kapya Kaoma, an Anglican priest from Zambia, was in attendance and reported on the conference. Lively asserted in his workshops that legalizing homosexuality would be akin to accepting child molestation and bestiality. He also claimed that gays threaten society by causing higher divorce rates, child abuse, and HIV transmission. He said that US homosexuals are out to recruit young people into homosexual lifestyles.
