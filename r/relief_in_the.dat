5|$|After the Iron Age {{occupation}} {{may have}} {{continued into the}} Roman era indicated by the discovery of pottery fragments, a small stone statue of Mars possibly from a Roman temple and coins of Claudius Gothicus and Valentinian II. The site may still have been occupied into the Anglo-Saxon period. Several of the finds were uncovered during excavations by Harold St George Gray in 1922, although the coin dating from around 370 was discovered in 1945 and a Romano-British <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner defensive ditch in 1974. The relief was given to North Somerset Museum, and loaned to Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his later}} works, {{following}} in his traditional sketches {{about his life}} and people he has met, were Hurry-Graphs (1851), Out-Doors at Idlewild (1854), and Ragbag (1855). Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, Paul Fane, which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel, may {{have been based on}} painter Chester Harding. His final work was The Convalescent (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with Washington Irving at Sunnyside.|$|E

Later that day, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered $725,000 be made available for disaster <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern provinces following an emergency meeting.

5|$|During {{her second}} commission, Indiana {{spent most of}} her time laid up in the reserve fleet, {{occasionally}} participating in practice cruises. In January 1907 she helped provide <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of the 1907 Kingston earthquake. In 1908, the /40 caliber guns and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery turrets and because the ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50 caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops. At the same time a cage mast was added. By 1913 it was speculated that the ship might soon be used for target practice, but instead, the ship was decommissioned on 23 May 1914. After the United States entered World War I, Indiana was commissioned for the third time and served as a training ship for gun crews near Tompkinsville, Staten Island and in the York River, and placed under the command of George Landenberger.|$|E

5|$|On September 25, manager Bruce Bochy {{decided to}} give Zito one final start with the Giants {{as a tribute to}} his tenure with the team. Zito responded by {{allowing}} two runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory over the Dodgers. However, because Zito was removed between innings during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in to pitch in <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final game of the year so that Giants' fans could give him a standing ovation. Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 and struck out Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 7–6. He finished the 2013 season at 5–11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts. Following the season, Zito took out a full-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle thanking Giants fans for their support. The Giants declined Zito's 2014 option, buying it out for $7 million.|$|E
5|$|The World Series {{that year}} was again against the Dodgers, {{who won the}} first two games at Ebbets Field. Stengel lectured the team before Game 3 at Yankee Stadium and the team responded with a victory then and in Game 4. For Game 5, Stengel pitched Don Larsen, who had been knocked out of Game 2, and who responded with a perfect game, the only one in major league postseason history. The Dodgers won Game 6 as the Series {{returned}} to Ebbets Field. Many expected Whitey Ford to start Game 7, but Stengel chose Johnny Kucks, an 18-game winner that season who had been used twice in <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Series. Kucks threw a three-hit shutout as the Yankees won the championship, 9–0, Stengel's sixth as their manager.|$|E
5|$|The script {{called for}} the {{creation}} of the Enterprise-C. In the first season, illustrator Andrew Probert– who had designed the Enterprise-D– was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from James T. Kirk's Enterprise to The Next Generations much larger ship, which was realized as a wall <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conference lounge behind the command bridge. Like most others, Probert assumed that the Enterprise-B was an Excelsior-class vessel and reasoned that the C would share design elements with its Excelsior-class predecessor and its Galaxy-class successor, Picard's ship. During this lineage project, Probert also produced a small color sketch of his version of Enterprise-C, but he left {{at the end of the}} season and his absence meant that no one knew what the drawing was intended to be.|$|E

40|$|It is {{permissible}} to use <b>reliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> payment {{of social security}} contributions, based either on a definitive waiver by the creditor of the whole or relevant part of the amount due (partial or complete remission) or only a temporary waiver of such amounts (payment deferral or payment <b>in</b> installments). <b>The</b> use of such reliefs is possible upon the occurrence of conditions laid down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Act, for example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of total non-recovery of contributions, for economic or other reasons worth considering, if justified by important interests of the person concerned. The prerequisites mentioned above have a nature of general clauses, allowing for their flexible adjustment to specific situations. Entities authorized to grant <b>reliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> payment of social security contributions act {{within the limits of}} administrative discretion. But it is not a fully free operation, because the economic impact resulting from the use of such reliefs has a direct impact on the financial balance of earmarked funds which finance social security benefits, in particular pensions, disability allowances and other benefits...|$|R
5|$|Among {{the various}} {{patterns}} and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored lozenge {{that creates a}} three-dimensional illusion of cubes in perspective for the viewer. This pattern appears in fifteen different locations, {{making it one of}} the most common. Other motifs include waves and stepped triangles, while major themes include maritime, theatrical, natural, or mythological objects and figures. The single wave pattern, a common motif in Hellenistic art, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and appear in mosaics of Arsameia (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The rosette motif, which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic palmette motif is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central rosette motif. The illusion of three-dimensional <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of polychrome, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.|$|E
5|$|Matteo Sereni and Finidi George arrived {{before the}} 2001–02 season {{to boost the}} squad for its foray into Europe. The club's league form was poor, and 18 games into the campaign, Ipswich were bottom of the table with just one league victory. However, there was some <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UEFA Cup with a victory over Inter Milan 1–0 {{at home in the}} third round, despite which the tie was lost over two legs after a 4–1 defeat at the San Siro. From bottom of the table at Christmas, a run of seven wins from eight {{fixtures}} appeared to have secured the team's league status, but another decline set in and relegation was confirmed {{on the final day of}} the season with a 5–0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield. The loss of income due to relegation to the Championship contributed to the club going into financial administration, resulting in the sale of a number of players including Jamie Clapham, Darren Ambrose, and club captain Matt Holland. Ipswich had the consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, through UEFA's Fair Play system, losing in the second round to Czech side Slovan Liberec. A poor start to the domestic season, leaving the club 19th in the table by mid-October, resulted in George Burley being sacked after nearly eight years as manager.|$|E
