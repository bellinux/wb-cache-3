40|$|Ideally, Ihe {{design of}} {{instructional}} material should include ample testing of <b>preliminary</b> <b>designs</b> so that design errors {{can be detected}} and repaired before the instruction is deployed. Such fonnative evaluations are rarer than they should be for several reasons: • Although the final polishing can be left off, all the little design details must be fully worked out before the instruction can be given to human students. It {{would be much better}} if fonnative evaluations could be conducted while the design was still in a <b>rough,</b> <b>preliminary</b> state. When <b>design</b> errors are detected early in the design cycle, less time is wasted worldng out the details of designs that will ultimately be discarded. • Testing instruction with human students can be difficult, time consuming and expensive. Allhough increasing the quality () f instruction is always a desirable goal in principle, the time and money needed for fonnative evaluation may not always be justifiable. • Current testing methods often yield only two kinds of infonnation, neither of which is particularly helpful to designers.

40|$|This thesis {{document}} was issued {{under the authority}} of another institution, not NPS. At the time it was written, a copy was added to the NPS Library Collection for reasons not now known. It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. Two distinct aspects of computer aided ship design are addressed in this thesis. First, a geometrical hull form modification technique employing the longitudinal repositioning of sections is developed. The second aspect deals with the mathematical representation of lines and line fairing. Before this is done however, justification is presented for utilizing third degree polynomials as an approximation to the spline curves of the naval architect. The results obtained indicate that a fairing procedure based on a least squares curve fitting criteria and a lines representation procedure based on parametric cubic equations could be adapted to generate faired hull forms from the <b>roughest</b> <b>preliminary</b> hull <b>design.</b> Additionally, the hull form modification technique could be programmed so as to produce designs with desired values of Cp, LCB, Cw and LCF from a basis design of similar type.

40|$|The <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> {{process is}} {{characterized}} by imprecision: the vagueness of an incomplete design description. The Method of Imprecision uses the mathematics of fuzzy sets to explicitly represent and manipulate imprecise <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> information, enabling the designer to explore the space of alternative designs {{in the context of}} the designer and customer's preferences among alternatives. This paper introduces new methods to perform Method of Imprecision calculations for general non-monotonic design evaluation functions that address the practical necessity to minimize the number of function evaluations. These methods utilize optimization and experiment design. Introduction Evaluation is a key component of <b>preliminary</b> <b>design.</b> Evaluating alternatives early in the design process avoids further investment in inferior alternatives, and can allow more alternatives to be considered.
