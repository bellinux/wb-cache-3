40|$|The optical {{properties}} of titanate nanotubes (TiNts) intercalated with rare earths (RE) ions were intensively investigated in this study. To prepare the nanomaterials, sodium titanate nanotubes (Na-TiNts) were submitted to ion exchange reactions with different {{rare earth elements}} (RE: Pr 3 +, Er 3 +, Nd 3 +, and Yb 3 +). To {{the best of our}} knowledge, {{it is the first time}} that these RE-TiNts were synthesized. All samples were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Furthermore, the {{optical properties}} were examined using photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. The PL intensity (visible range) of the <b>RE-TiNt</b> samples showed a strong dependence when the temperature was decreased down to 20 [*]K. This PL enhancement probably was promoted by electronic modifications in titanate layer band gap and/or interface charge transfers due to RE ions intercalation...|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{technique}} {{can sometimes}} be observed in older hand-tinted postcard views, where a [...] "night" [...] view of a scene is created by simply <b>re-tinting</b> the original (black and white) photo with darker coloration suggestive of night.|$|R
50|$|The new {{replacement}} shots consist of the RX-M flying through space; it landing tail {{first on the}} Red Planet; a different shot of the crew heading away from the RX-M to explore the stark Martian surface; the surviving explorers quickly returning to their nearby spaceship; and the RX-M later blasting off from Mars into space. These six replacement shots were filmed near Los Angeles in color, then converted to black-and-white and <b>re-tinted</b> where necessary to match the original film footage. (Unlike the DVD release, the earlier laser disc of Rocketship X-M contains extra bonus material documenting {{the making of the}} film and the creation of this new footage.) The film's production and the making of these new scenes were also presented in RX-M feature articles in both Starlog magazine and later expanded in the first issue (1979) of Starlogs spin-off magazine CineMagic. Prints of the original theatrical release version of RX-M are still stored in Williams' Kansas City film vaults. They have not been converted to a home video format.|$|R
2500|$|Though Purcell’s plans did {{not come}} to {{fruition}} in his lifetime, Anson Cutts Jr.’s bequest of the house, along with funds for its restoration, led to a 3-year-long undertaking (lasting from 1987 to 1990) by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts with the firm of MacDonald & Mack Architects. It was opened to the public as the Purcell–Cutts House in September 1990. Their restorative work centered on preventing further deterioration of the roof of the house, stabilizing the main roof and straightening the cantilever of the projecting first-story eaves. Restorers also worked to return surfaces to their original color, <b>re-tinting</b> exterior stucco, and preserving, restoring, or repainting interior stencil friezes as necessary. Wood trims were refinished and waxed, and the mural by Charles Livingston Bull was cleaned. The art glass windows were repaired and cleaned. The landscaping, including the reflecting pool and fountain, were recreated to match historic photographs. Based on historic evidence, the MIA reproduced furniture for the house including a reproduction of the Hanna suite for the dining room. As a part of the house’s bequest, mementos of the Cutts family also remain. [...] Public tours are held the second weekend of each month.|$|R
