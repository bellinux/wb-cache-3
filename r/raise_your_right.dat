Then you proceed to the patient, who extends his wrist, and asks you what his complaint is. Then you examine his tongue, you feel his pulse, you look learned, and-he is talking all the time-after hearing a detailed list of all his ailments, you gravely discover them, taking for the same as much praise to yourself as does the practising phrenologist for a similar simple exercise of the reasoning faculties.

[...] Cure is easy, but it will take time, and you, the doctor, require attention; any little rudeness it is in your power to punish by an alteration in the pill, or the powder, and, so unknown is professional honour, that none will brave your displeasure. If you would pass for a native practitioner, you must finally proceed to the most uncomfortable part of your visit, bargaining for fees. Nothing more effectually arouses suspicion than disinterestedness in a doctor. I once cured a rich Hazramaut merchant of rheumatism, and neglected to make him pay for treatment; he carried off one of my coffee cups, and was unceasingly wondering where I came from.

In fact, I {{would suggest that the}} chairman swear counsel. I have a few questions I would like to ask counsel.Mr. McDowell: Stand up and <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> <b>right</b> hand.Mr. Braverman: I will stand up, but I refuse to be sworn in as a witness in this case. I am counsel.Mr. McDowell: Get a subpoena.Mr. Braverman: Mr. McDowell, will you permit me to call counsel?Mr. McDowell: Well, no : there has been no action taken yet. Wait a minute.Mr. Braverman: I would like to call counsel before I am subpoenaed.Mr. McDowell: There has been no subpoena yet. Just wait a minute until you need counsel.(...)Mr. Stripling: You asked to call counsel. Are you prepared to testify if we subpoena you?Mr. Braverman: I am not prepared.Mr. Stripling: You are not prepared?Mr. Braverman: I would like to state my reason, too.Mr. Stripling: I can see, Mr. Chairman, that the witness would not testify and I suggest that we withhold the subpoena.Mr. Braverman: I would like the opportunity of stating my reason, Mr. Stripling.Mr. Stripling: For refusing to take the oath?Mr. Braverman: Yes when it was asked of me.Mr. Stripling: I ask you now : Will you take the oath?Mr. Braverman: No, I won't.Mr. Stripling: Why?Mr. Braverman: For the simple reason that I am here representing Mr. Rosen. I think any attempt to put me under oath is an attempt to intimidate my client and hurt my professional relations between attorney and client. I have a perfect right to appear as attorney for my client, and I think {{the committee}} has no right to ask questions regarding relations between me and my client.Mr. Stripling: We are not asking you about the relations between your client and yourself.Mr. Braverman: I think any questions would be in that regard.Mr. Stripling: We often swear counsel. In fact, we swore counsel yesterday in public hearing, and because you come here with a witness and seek to give him advice on how to answer questions doesn't give you any immunity.Mr. Braverman: I haven't claimed that immunity. I am merely stating my position.Mr. Stripling: You have refused. [...] On September 8, 1948, Braverman appeared again before HUAC as counsel to Addie Rosen (Mrs. William Rosen). When Mrs. Rosen continued to refuse to answer questions by pleading the Fifth Amendment, the committee again turned on Braverman: [...] The Chairman: Mr. Counsel, will you stand and be sworn? Please stand and be sworn, because we want to ask some questions about this matter and it is very important and we want sworn testimony.Mr. Braverman: Mr. Thomas, I will state as I stated before, that I am not here as a witness. I am here as counsel.The Chairman: From now on you are here as a witness.Mr. Braverman: Before I appear as a witness I would like the privilege of consulting counsel and being represented by counsel before this committee.The Chairman: Is your counsel present now?Mr. Braverman: No.The Chairman: Do you refuse to be sworn?Mr. Braverman: I refuse to be sworn and appear as a witness until I have the right of counsel. I want counsel present to advise me.The Chairman: I will have to insist that you be sworn now. <b>Raise</b> <b>your</b> <b>right</b> hand or I will hold you in contempt.Mr. Braverman: I am sorry, I {{do not want to be}} in contempt of this committee, but if I am sworn as a witness I want the right to consult counsel.The Chairman: We want to ask you two or three simple little questions and we think the testimony shoul be sworn testimony, so if you will just please oblige the committee by raising your right hand.Mr. Braverman: If this committee will allow me the right to have counsel present when I am here as a witness, I will be happy to be sworn as a witness.Mr. Stripling: The witness has just given the committee a dissertation of his familiarity with the rights and privileges of witnesses. I don't think he needs counsel.(...)Mr. Stripling: Are you going to appear with Mr. Rosen tomorrow ?Mr. Braverman: I understood he was going to appear today.Mr. Stripling: It will be tomorrow.Mr. Braverman: I have been retained by Mr. Rosen.Mr. Stripling: We will serve a subpena on you at the direction of the chairman to appear tomorrow. So bring counsel with you also.(...)Mr. Stripling: Mr. McDowell, here is what I think is the situation : We know that the Communist Party got in touch with Rosen before he appeared before this committee, and we know that the Communist Party sent this hiAvyer Braverman to accompany her. We also know that that signature which appears on this assignment of title is not that of William Rosen. We do know that William Rosen and his wife, Mrs. Rosen, are and have been members of the Communist Party. [...] On September 9, 1948, Braverman appeared again before HUAC, both as counsel to Rosen and as witness himself. After counseling Rosen, HUAC swore him in. Serving as his counsel were Joseph Forer (the best known pro-Communist lawyer in Washington and prominent member of the local chapter of the National Lawyers Guild) and Mitchell A. Dubow (future district judge in Minnesota). [...] Once on the stand as witness and his background discussed, Braverman found himself accused of Communism: [...] Mr. Stripling: Are you a member of the Communist Party?Mr. Braverman: Mr. Chairman, I want to state here that the only reason I am before this committee is because I came here representing a witness. The committee has not been satisfied with the way that witness appeared here, and has called me here to harass me, to intimidate me, to intimidate my clients.Any questions that go into my private, personal, or political life go to the root of the attorney and client relationship. That is the only reason that I am here before this committee, and I say that this committee has no right to ask me that question.(...)Mr. Stripling: Are you a member of the Communist Party, Mr. Braverman?Mr. Braverman: I repeat my answer, Mr. Stripling, and I refuse to state—I refuse to answer that question on the ground of the first amendment, which gives me the right of freedom of speech; freedom of assembly, and freedom of association; and the fifth amendment, the amendment providing for self-incrimination.Mr. Stripling: Self-incrimination. Are you pleading self-incrimination?Mr. Braverman: I will repeat my answer, Mr. Stripling.Mr. Stripling: I want this straight. Are you pleading self-incrimination?Mr. Braverman: I am pleading the fifth amendment to the Constitution.(...)Mr. Stripling: Did you know Albert E. Blumberg?Mr. Braverman: Yes : I know Mr. Blumberg.Mr. Stripling: How w^ell do you know Mr. Blumberg?Mr. Braverman: He is a client of mine.Mr. Stripling: A client of yours? Have you ever represented the Communist Party?Mr. Braverman: Yes, I have represented the Communist Party.Mr. Stripling: How many times have you represented the Communist Party?Mr. Braverman: I do not know. Offhand, I cannot say.(...) Mr. Stripling: Mr. Chairman, I have certain information here which I do not wish to introduce at this time. I want to introduce it in open session. I have no further questions.I recommend that this witness also be cited for contempt of the committee. [...] (Albert E. Blumberg (1906 - October 8, 1997) of Baltimore was an American philosopher and political activist.
