2500|$|Robert's Rules continues: [...] "The {{system of}} {{preferential}} voting just described {{should not be}} used in cases where it is possible to follow the normal procedure of repeated balloting until one candidate or proposition attains a majority. Although this type of preferential ballot is preferable to an election by plurality, it affords less freedom of choice than repeated balloting, because it denies voters the opportunity of basing their second or lesser choices on the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>earlier</b> ballots, and because the candidate or proposition in last place is automatically eliminated and may thus be prevented from becoming a compromise choice." [...] Two other books on parliamentary procedure take a similar stance, disapproving of plurality voting and describing preferential voting as an option, if authorized in the bylaws, when repeated balloting is impractical: The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure and Riddick's Rules of Procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Normally during alpha–beta, the subtrees are {{temporarily}} {{dominated by}} either a first player advantage (when many first player moves are good, and at each search depth {{the first move}} checked by the first player is adequate, but all second player responses are required {{to try to find}} a refutation), or vice versa. This advantage can switch sides many times during the search if the move ordering is incorrect, each time leading to inefficiency. As the number of positions searched decreases exponentially each move nearer the current position, it is worth spending considerable effort on sorting early moves. An improved sort at any depth will exponentially reduce the total number of positions searched, but sorting all positions at depths near the root node is relatively cheap as there are so few of them. [...] In practice, the move ordering is often determined by the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>earlier,</b> smaller searches, such as through iterative deepening.|$|E
