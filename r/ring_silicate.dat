Papagoite CaCuAlSi 2 O 6 (OH) 3 is a hydroxy mixed anion compound with both silicate and hydroxyl anions in the formula. The structural characterization of the mineral papagoite remains incomplete. Papagoite is a four-membered <b>ring</b> <b>silicate</b> with Cu 2 + in square planar coordination. The intense sharp Raman band at 1053 cm− 1 is assigned to the ν 1 (A 1 g) symmetric stretching vibration of the SiO 4 units. The splitting of the ν 3 vibrational mode offers support to the concept that the SiO 4 tetrahedron in papagoite is strongly distorted. A very intense Raman band observed at 630 cm− 1 with a shoulder at 644 cm− 1 is assigned to the ν 4 vibrational modes. Intense Raman bands at 419 and 460 cm− 1 are attributed to the ν 2 bending modes. Intense Raman bands at 3545 and 3573 cm− 1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of the OH units. Low-intensity Raman bands at 3368 and 3453 cm− 1 are assigned to water stretching modes. It is suggested that the formula of papagoite {{is more likely to be}} CaCuAlSi 2 O 6 (OH) 3 · xH 2 O.

Inosilicates are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates {{have two or three}} shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; in the case of double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result.

When compared to literature data [1], osumilite sample from Mt. Arci is characterized by a significantly high Fe 2 + content (1. 478 apfu). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) enabled the crystal chemical characterization of osumilite surface, where iron was still observed in its divalent state, thus confirming a similarity in osumilite surface and bulk chemical composition. A further evidence of Fe oxidation state at osumilite surface is provided from X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Fe-L 2, 3 edge. Vesuvianite is a complex tetragonal silicate. Vesuvianite ideal formula is Ca 19 (Al,Mg) 13 (B, Si) 18 O 68 (OH, O, F) 10 and crystallizes, generally, in the space group P 4 /nnc. Vesuvianite presents in nature two different structural type: a high temperature type (at about 1000 °C) and a low temperature type (at about 900 °C). To recognize which type of vesuvianite, our sample belongs to, we studied its thermal decomposition via X-ray powder diffraction method by using a Philips X’Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with X’Celerator area detector. Finally we could assure that our sample is a high temperature vesuvianite with high symmetry P 4 /nnc. Unlike osumilite, vesuvianite surface is very complex to study because of its roughness on given faces of the crystal.

Associated H 20 is randomly located between the TMA pillars, and no scattering from these molecules was observed. The calculated height of the TMA molecule is shown to be 4. 15 A. Steric and electrostatic arguments suggesting that adjacent TMA molecules must alternate apex direc-tions (-+c) allow for a description of the local TMA arrangement. This model involves the keying of TMA molecules laterally, thereby explaining why perfect 3 -dimensional stacking occurs. The offset of TMA {{from the center of the}} interlayer region produces a cavity suitable as an adsorption site for small molecules, such as benzene, which is consistent with the higher than expected adsorption of these mol-ecules in TMA-smectites of high layer charge. This offset also explains the easy expandability of TMA-clays, since only very weak interactions occur between TMA and i adjacent silicate layer, thereby allow-ing molecules to enter the interlayer.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{mechanism of}} zeolite has drawn much attention {{due to their}} use in oil refining, petrochemical and fine chemical industry field. Understanding the synthesis mechanism of zeolite {{is a very interesting}} but challenging topic, because zeolite crystals are usually formed through complicated routes. UV Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to characterize zeolite synthesis process because it can avoid the fluorescence interference occurring in visible Raman spectra and concurrently enhances the Raman signal owing to the short wavelength and resonance Raman effect. In this lecture, the synthesis processes of zeolite and transition metal-containing zeolite (such as zeolite X, AlPO- 5, Fe-ZSM- 5 and Fe-ZSM- 35) have been studied with in situ Raman and Resonance Raman techniques coupled to the home-assembled UV Raman spectrograph. The synthesis mechanism of these zeolites, including the identification of primary units, assembly through key intermediates, transition metal species and organic templates in the very early stages of zeolite formation have been all well studied. The synthesis process of zeolite X and AlPO- 5 have been studied by In situ UV Raman spectroscopy. It is found that zeolite X are formed via the assembly of 4 -rings, branched units in the solid phase and monomer silicate species in the liquid phase. In the synthesis process of AlPO- 5, the condensation of the 4 -ring species with the steric role of the organic templates results in an amorphous pre-state with channel-like structures, which subsequently transform into 3 D AFI architectures via the newlybuilt 6 -rings. The evolutions of the zeolite framework and iron species were studied by UV Raman and UV resonance Raman spectroscopies during the synthesis of Fe-ZSM- 5. The precursor contains iron atoms in distorted tetrahedral coordination and <b>silicate</b> <b>rings</b> in the early synthesis stage. Nucleation via aggregation of these precursor species happened from inside out of the amorphous particles has been observed. Based on the understanding of the synthesis mechanism of zeolites, the synthesis strategies of iron containing zeolite have been developed, which include assembly of tailored iron species and zeolite intermediates. 法国国家科学研究院The synthesis mechanism of zeolite has drawn much attention due to their use in oil refining, petrochemical and fine chemical industry field.

40|$|Denisovite {{is a rare}} mineral {{occurring}} as aggregates of fibres typically 200 – 500  nm diameter. It {{was confirmed}} as a new mineral in 1984, but important facts about its chemical formula, lattice parameters, symmetry and structure have remained incompletely known since then. Recently obtained results from studies using microprobe analysis, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), electron crystallography, modelling and Rietveld refinement will be reported. The electron crystallography methods include transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), precession electron diffraction (PED) and electron diffraction tomography (EDT). A structural model of denisovite was developed from HAADF images and later completed {{on the basis of}} quasi-kinematic EDT data by ab initio structure solution using direct methods and least-squares refinement. The model was confirmed by Rietveld refinement. The lattice parameters are a = 31. 024  (1), b = 19. 554  (1) and c = 7. 1441  (5)  Å, β = 95. 99  (3) °, V = 4310. 1  (5)  Å 3 and space group P 12 /a 1. The structure consists of three topologically distinct dreier silicate chains, viz. two xonotlite-like dreier double chains, [Si 6 O 17] 10 −, and a tubular loop-branched dreier triple chain, [Si 12 O 30] 12 −. The silicate chains occur between three walls of edge-sharing (Ca,Na) octahedra. The chains of silicate tetrahedra and the octahedra walls extend parallel to the z axis and form a layer parallel to (100). Water molecules and K+ cations are located at the centre of the tubular silicate chain. The latter also occupy positions close to the centres of eight-membered <b>rings</b> in the <b>silicate</b> chains. The silicate chains are geometrically constrained by neighbouring octahedra walls and present an ambiguity with respect to their z position along these walls, with displacements between neighbouring layers being either Δz = c/ 4 or −c/ 4. Such behaviour is typical for polytypic sequences and leads to disorder along [100]. In fact, the diffraction pattern does not show any sharp reflections with l odd, but continuous diffuse streaks parallel to a* instead. Only reflections with l even are sharp. The diffuse scattering is caused by (100) nanolamellae separated by stacking faults and twin boundaries. The structure can be described according to the order–disorder (OD) theory as a stacking of layers parallel to (100) ...|$|R
