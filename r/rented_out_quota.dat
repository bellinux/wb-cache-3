When individuals <b>rent</b> <b>out</b> to other individuals, or when businesses rent commercial premises, a security deposit of 1-6 months is usually requested.|$|R

This paper seeks to find {{explanations}} to why land productivity is lower on land <b>rented</b> <b>out</b> by female landlord households than on land <b>rented</b> <b>out</b> by male landlord households in the Ethiopian highlands. The authors find that female landlords have tenants who are older, own less oxen, are more related, and under longer-term contracts.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the factors that}} drive livestock rental market participation by using farm household data. Furthermore, it assessed if there exits any association between livestock and land rental markets. Double hurdle models were applied {{on both sides of}} the livestock rental markets separately. Results show that low caste households are more likely to rent in livestock as compared to high caste; and this is similar for male headed households and households with more male labor. Caste however, does not affect the likelihood to <b>rent</b> <b>out</b> livestock. The larger the owned livestock the less is the probability to rent in livestock and the amount to rent in. Owned livestock holding only affected the amount to <b>rent</b> <b>out</b> but not the likelihood. Owned land holding increased the amount of livestock to <b>rent</b> <b>out.</b> Households with migrated members are less likely to rent in and more likely to <b>rent</b> <b>out</b> livestock. Migration reduced the amount of livestock rented in and increased the amount <b>rented</b> <b>out.</b> This indicates that livestock renting is partly driven by land poverty and partly by Maoist war. A bivariate ordered probit model showed a significant positive association between the decision to participate in livestock and land rental markets. Key words: livestock rental market; land rental market; caste; Maoist war; Nepal 1...|$|R
