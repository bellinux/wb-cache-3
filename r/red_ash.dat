5|$|Black Creek is {{situated}} within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal {{beds in the}} watershed include the Lower <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> bed, the Upper <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. Ridges of mine waste also occur in the creek's drainage basin. Mining {{was done in the}} watershed as early as the winter of 1836-1837, but it stopped in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The main rock {{formations}} in {{and near the}} watershed of Nanticoke Creek include the Mauch Chunk Formation (which dates to Late Mississippian and Early Pennsylvanian times), the Pottsville Group (from Pennsylvanian times), and the Llewellyn Formation (also from Pennsylvanian times). The Lower <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> coal seam is present near {{the headwaters of the}} creek.|$|E
5|$|A delta fan made of eroded <b>red</b> <b>ash</b> {{sediment}} {{occurs at}} the mouth of Keyser Creek. The creek flows through rock formations such as the Llewellyn Formation and the Pocono Formation. conglomerate and limestone have been observed in the creek's vicinity. There are coal measures {{in the vicinity of the}} creek. There are pyroclastic materials in foundry slag and coal mining waste in the watershed. Large deposits of drift have been observed near the creek. Substantial till deposits are also present in its valley.|$|E

5|$|After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, {{they were}} {{replaced}} about 36million {{years ago by}} eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of {{what would become the}} Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid down on top of the Clarno Strata, the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains <b>red</b> <b>ash</b> such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, saber-toothed tigers, horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata, such as hydrangea, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as pines and many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
25|$|Coal mining {{remained}} the prominent industry in Pittston for many decades, but disasters did strike {{on more than}} one occasion. The first major tragedy occurred in the Newton Coal Company's Twin Shaft Mine (near the city's railroad junction). In {{the early morning hours of}} June 28, 1896, ninety miners were at work in the <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> Vein of the Newton Coal Company's Twin Shaft Mine in Pittston. At 3:00 a.m., the roof quickly caved-in. The concussion from the explosion was so great that it was heard for miles around. The foundation of nearly every building in Pittston was shaken. The cave-in killed 58 miners (including the city's then-acting mayor, Michael J. Langan).|$|E
500|$|There {{are five}} beds of coal {{that have been}} mined in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek: the Lower <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> bed, the Upper <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. The Lower <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> coal bed has a thickness of up to [...] at the West End Mine in the watershed and the Upper <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> coal is up to [...] thick.|$|E

When they got him quiet and heard the story, Mrs. Quinn rather damped his joy, by telling him the money wasn't his, and he ought to advertise it.|$|R
60|$|The sun had set now, and the flames, dancing {{up as the}} boy {{threw an}} armful of dry wood on the fire, gave the hut a more cheerful appearance. For some time the lad busied himself with {{preparation}} for supper.

5000|$|Blood red (selectively bred “Diffused”) corn snakes carry a {{recessive}} trait (known as diffused) that {{eliminates the}} ventral checkered patterns. These originated from a somewhat unicolor Jacksonville and Gainesville, Florida strain of corn snake. Through selective breeding, an almost solid ground color has been produced. Hatchlings have a visible pattern that can fade as they mature into a solid orange <b>red</b> to <b>ash</b> <b>red</b> colored snake. The earlier bloodreds {{tended to have}} large clutches of smaller than average eggs that produce hard to feed offspring, though {{this is no longer}} the case.|$|R
500|$|There are 14 coal seams in the Solomon Creek watershed. The deepest seam is the Bottom <b>Red</b> <b>Ash.</b> Other seams {{included}} the Middle <b>Red</b> <b>Ash,</b> the Top <b>Red</b> <b>Ash,</b> the Checker Bed, the Pittston Bed, the Ross Bed, the Skidmore Bed, the Kidney Bed, the Snake Island Bed, the Hillman Bed, and the Abbott Bed. There are also three numbered beds called the #2, #3, and #4 beds. Historically, {{parts of the}} seams were within [...] of the surface, but they were completely mined. Areas {{along the banks of}} the creek are covered in coal ash, coal silt, sand, and gravel. There are gravel bars and point bars in the lower reaches of the creek. The lower reaches of Solomon Creek have a 0.2% grade.|$|E
500|$|Keyser Creek is topographically {{very similar}} to the nearby Saint Johns Creek. In its headwaters, its {{gradient}} is steep and it passes through several small cataracts. In its lower reaches, it is in a shallow floodplain. The creek begins in springs and wetlands on a mountain known as Bald Mountain, which has an elevation of [...] above sea level. At some locations, Keyser Creek has experienced significant erosion, causing sediment and <b>red</b> <b>ash</b> (burned culm) to enter the creek.|$|E
500|$|A {{mine fire}} {{known as the}} Laurel Run mine fire started burning in the {{watershed}} of Solomon Creek since 1915, when a miner accidentally left a carbide lamp hanging from a timber support in the <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> Coal Mine. The lamp caused the support to catch fire. The fire may continue into the 22nd century. The fire was contained in 1973, but was not extinguished. Had the fire not been contained, it would have eventually spread under {{the entirety of the}} Wyoming Valley. The fire burns between [...] and [...] underground at a temperature of approximately [...]|$|E

500|$|From {{the age of}} six and for {{the rest}} of his life Saint-Saëns {{composed}} mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes ("Persian Songs", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge ("The <b>Red</b> <b>Ash</b> Tree", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: [...] "you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable." [...] Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including [...] "Le lever du soleil sur le Nil" [...] ("Sunrise over the Nile", 1898) and [...] "Hymne à la paix" [...] ("Hymn to Peace", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.|$|E

[...] A native food garden has been established at the south-west corner of the property, near the Mungara visitor centre.|$|E
2500|$|Excavation has {{revealed}} extensive evidence of destruction by {{fire in the}} form of a layer of <b>red</b> <b>ash</b> beneath the city at this date. Suetonius then returned to the legions' slower infantry, who met and defeated the British army, slaughtering as many as 70,000 men and camp followers. There is a long-standing folklore belief that this battle took place at King’s Cross, simply because as a mediaeval village it was known as Battle Bridge. Suetonius's flight back to his men, the razing of Verulamium (StAlbans), and the battle shortly thereafter at [...] "a place with narrow jaws, backed by a forest", speaks against the tradition and no supporting archaeological evidence has been yet discovered.|$|E

60|$|I {{woke up with}} a start, {{and feeling}} stifled in that hot place and aggravated {{by the sound of}} Anscombe's {{peaceful}} breathing, threw a coat about me and, removing the door-board, crept into the air. The night was still, the stars shone, and at a little distance the embers of the fire still glowed. By it was seated a figure wrapped in a kaross. The end of a piece of wood that the fire had eaten through fell on to the <b>red</b> <b>ashes</b> and flamed up brightly. By its light I saw that the figure was Nombe's. The eternal smile was still upon her face, the smile which suggested a knowledge of hidden things that from moment to moment amused her soul. Her lips moved as though she were talking to an invisible companion, and from time to time, like one who acts upon directions, she took a pinch of ashes and blew them, either towards Heda's hut or ours. Yes, she did this when all decent young women should have been asleep, like one who keeps some unholy, midnight assignation.|$|R

60|$|Often in {{peaceful}} after-days was Alleyne {{to think}} of that scene of the wayside inn of Auvergne. The shadows of evening had fallen, and the corners of the long, low, wood-panelled room were draped in darkness. The sputtering wood fire threw out a circle of red flickering light which played over the little group of wayfarers, and showed up every line and shadow upon their faces. Sir Nigel sat with elbows upon knees, and chin upon hands, his patch still covering one eye, but his other shining like a star, while the ruddy light gleamed upon his smooth white head. Ford was seated at his left, his lips parted, his eyes staring, and a fleck of deep color on either cheek, his limbs all rigid as one who fears to move. On the other side the famous French captain leaned back in his chair, a litter of nut-shells upon his lap, his huge head half buried in a cushion, while his eyes wandered with an amused gleam from his dame to the staring, enraptured Englishmen. Then, last of all, that pale clear-cut face, that sweet clear voice, with its high thrilling talk of the deathlessness of glory, of the worthlessness of life, of the pain of ignoble joys, and of the joy which lies in all pains which lead to a noble end. Still, as the shadows deepened, she spoke of valor and virtue, of loyalty, honor, and fame, and still they sat drinking in her words while the fire burned down and the <b>red</b> <b>ash</b> turned to gray.|$|E

60|$|The night set in gusty and tempestuous, and {{the moon}} was all girt with ragged clouds. The wind blew in melancholy gusts, sobbing and sighing over the moor, and setting all the gorse bushes agroaning. From time to time a little sputter of rain pattered up against the window-pane. I sat until near midnight, glancing over the {{fragment}} on immortality by Iamblichus, the Alexandrian platonist, of whom the Emperor Julian {{said that he was}} posterior to Plato in time but not in genius. At last, shutting up my book, I opened my door and took a last look at the dreary fell and still more dreary sky. As I protruded my head, a swoop of wind caught me and sent the <b>red</b> <b>ashes</b> of my pipe sparkling and dancing through the darkness. At the same moment the moon shone brilliantly out from between two clouds and I saw, sitting on the hillside, not two hundred yards from my door, the man who called himself the surgeon of Gaster Fell. He was squatted among the heather, his elbows upon his knees, and his chin resting upon his hands, as motionless as a stone, with his gaze fixed steadily upon the door of my dwelling.|$|R

60|$|As Christie and Jessie Carr {{looked from}} {{the windows of the}} coach, whose dust-clogged wheels were slowly {{dragging}} them, as if reluctant, nearer the last stage of their journey to Devil's Ford, they were conscious of a change in the landscape, which they could not entirely charge upon their changed feelings. The few bared open spaces on the upland, the long stretch of rocky ridge near the summit, so vivid and so velvety during their first journey, were now burnt and yellow; even the brief openings in the forest were seared as if by a hot iron in the scorching rays of a half year's sun. The pastoral slopes of the valley below were cloaked in lustre-leather: the rare watercourses along the road had faded from the waiting eye and ear; {{it seemed as if the}} long and dry summer had even invaded the close-set ranks of pines, and had blown a simoom breath through the densest woods, leaving its charred <b>red</b> <b>ashes</b> on every leaf and spray along the tunnelled shade. As they leaned out of the window and inhaled the half-dead spices of the evergreens, they seemed to have entered the atmosphere of some exhausted passion--of some fierce excitement that was even now slowly burning itself out.|$|R
