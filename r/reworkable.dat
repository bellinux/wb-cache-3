However, rework of defective CSPs cannot be performed after the underfill operation. Thus, inability to rework assemblies has hindered the wide spread use of underfill materials. However, reworkability of the packages with underfill is, needed for Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs) with CSPs failing either during final test or in the field.

Cellular phones, pagers, disk drives, computers, engine controllers and new, contactless smart cards are now employing Flip Chip {{as the best}} avenue to smaller-faster-cheaper. Flip Chip is also gaining popularity for multi-chip packages and micro-BGAs, replacing wire bonding as lead count increases and performance demands rise. Most Flip Chips require underfill, said {{by many to be}} a “bottleneck ”- the down-side of this otherwise simple technology. The common capillary flow underfills have achieved very fast flow with only a 5 -minute cure, but dispensers, ovens and extra time are still penalties.

It is also important to a supply manager of any organization to control and maintain the inventories of perfect and imperfect quality items. Salameh and Jaber [8] developed an inventory model for imperfect quality items using the economic production quantity (EPQ)/economic order quantity (EOQ) formulae and assumed that inferior quality items are sold as a single batch {{at the end of the}} total screening process. Thereafter, Goyal and Cardenas-Barron [9] extended the idea of Salameh and Jaber's [8] model and proposed a practical approach to determine EPQ for items with imperfect quality. Yu et al.

Liu and Yang [11] investigated a single-stage production system with imperfect process delivering two types of defects: <b>reworkable</b> and non-reworkable items. The <b>reworkable</b> items are sent for reworking, whereas non-reworkable items are immediately discarded from the system. They determined the optimal lot size that maximized the expected total profit over the expected time length of the production cycle. Panda and Maiti [12] represented a geometric programming approach for multi-item inventory models with price-dependent demand under flexibility and reliability with imprecise space constraint.

40|$|Each {{aircraft}} on {{the final}} assembly line inevitably has minor build errors and deviations from the intended design. Errors, like these, that can be corrected on the line are called <b>reworkable</b> discrepancies. Because hundreds of <b>reworkable</b> discrepancies can occur on each aircraft {{it is a huge}} opportunity for improvement and cost reduction. It would be impossible to analyze each one that occurs on the line. However, last year at X Aerospace another researcher created a tool to categorize discrepancies by key words based on free form text describing them. Root cause analysis and corrective action teams were put in place for the highest driving discrepancies but a more exhaustive analysis was not conducted. In this research, to continue the root cause analysis, and gain a more detailed understanding of why discrepancies occur, a single aircraft was followed through final assembly and each discrepancy reviewed. Some key findings of this review were confirmation that the tool created previously was accurate, that there is a time lag between creation of a discrepancy and its discovery upon inspection, and that there is lack of access to specifications and data on the floor. To address the issues with late discovery of discrepancies, more specific and guided inspection instructions are needed. Standard work has been developed for writing inspection instructions that are clearer. They include features such as guided and general tasks, references to specs for all directive instructions, specific locations on the assembly and drawings, and symbols and wording to indicate instruction versus reference information and which contain only instructions relevant for the particular inspection. Changes in management have halted the implementation of the standard work for writing inspection instruction. However, this standard work became the basis for changes being made to improve work instructions. To address the lack of access to data, a tool which collects data and displays a cross Pareto heat map of the highest driving issues on each line, position, and work order has been developed. The line managers have been trained on how to use the tool to determine high driving issues in almost real time and implement corrective actions more quickly. In addition the tool is in use by quality engineers to help guide reduction efforts. by Jessica Bashkoff. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the multi-item inventory model in a production/rework system with multiple production setups. Rework can be depicted as the transformation of production rejects, failed, or non-conforming items into re-usable products of the same or lower quality during or after inspection. Rework is very valuable and profitable, especially if materials are limited in availability and also pricey. Moreover, rework {{can be a good}} contribution to a ‘green image environment’. In this paper, we establish a multi-item inventory model to determine the optimal inventory replenishment policy for the economic production quantity (EPQ) model for imperfect, deteriorating items with multiple productions and rework under inflation and learning environment. In inventory modelling, Inflation plays a very important role. In one cycle, production system produces items in n production setups and one rework setup, i. e. system follows (n, 1) policy. To reduce the deterioration of products preservation technology investment is also considered in this model. Holding cost is taken as time dependent. We develop expressions for the average profit per time unit, including procurement of input materials, costs for production, rework, deterioration cost and storage of serviceable and <b>reworkable</b> lots. Using those expressions, the proposed model is demonstrated numerically and the sensitivity analysis is also performed to study the behaviour of the model. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the area}} of reverse logistics, {{remanufacturing}} has been {{proven to be a}} valu- able option for product recovery. In many industries, each step of the products’ recovery is carried out in lot sizes which leads to the assumption that for each of the different recovery steps some kind of fixed costs prevail. Furthermore, holding costs can be observed for all recovery states of the returned product. Although several authors study how the different lot sizes in a remanufacturing system shall be determined, they do not consider the specificity of the remanufacturing process itself. Thus, the disassembly operations which are always neglected in former analyses are included in this contribution as a specific recovery step. In addition, the assumption of deterministic yields (number of <b>reworkable</b> compo- nents obtained by disassembly) is extended in this work to study the system behavior in a stochastic environment. Three different heuristic approaches are presented for this environment that differ in their degree of sophistication. The least sophisticated method ignores yield randomness and uses the expected yield fraction as certainty equivalent. As a numerical experiment shows, this method already yields fairly good results in most of the investigated problem instances in comparison to the other heuristics which incorporate yield uncertainties. How- ever, there exist instances for which the performance loss between the least and the most sophisticated heuristic amounts to more than 6 %. reverse logistics, remanufacturing, lot sizing, disassembly, random yield...|$|E

This thesis describes {{the search for a}} human-friendly alternative to polyester resins. In this work, mostly biobased (obtained from renewable sources) chemicals are used to end up with a green compound. However, just "going green" does not solve the problem of waste generated at the end of product life, in order to address this and reduce the carbon footprint of the material even further a reversible crosslinking Chemistry was employed. The reason polyester resins possess such desirable mechanical quantities is due to their chemical crosslinking. This is achieved via a polymerization reaction which yields a very tough material. However, the downside of this crosslinking is that the final material can never be reused, recycled or reclaimed: it has to be discarded, burnt for energy recovery, or at best some of it can be reused in a low-value application (like asphalt filler). The material described in this thesis is shown to be fully recyclable and <b>reworkable,</b> due to the use of Diels alder Chemistry which allows the crosslinks (which give the material its strength) to be re-opened, This allows the material to be reused and reshaped. The first chapters describe the synthesis of the material, and its successful recycling. This is shown by grinding spent testbars, remolding them and obtaining a new sample with identical mechanical properties. The later chapters describe various alterations through which the mechanical properties of the compound can be improved (e. g. better impact resistance) or altered (e. g. influencing the softening temperature). Overall the complete route from commercially available green chemical to final material in (close to) real life application is covered...|$|E

Drawing on thirty-six semi-structured interviews, I employ a qualitative methodology that seeks {{to bridge the gap}} between critical theorisations of algorithmic personalisation and the negotiations of web users themselves who encounter algorithmic personalisation in everyday life. To do this I focus on three sites of investigation. I first examine privacy tool Ghostery and the ways in which Ghostery users’ negotiate their positions as data-tracked subjects, especially in relation to privacy, knowledge and their sense of self. I then investigate Facebook’s autoposting apps as examples of algorithmic personalisation that act on the user’s behalf, and draw on the accounts of Facebook app users to explore themes such as identity performance, autonomous control and algorithmic governance. Finally I examine users’ engagement with the ‘predictive powers’ (Google Now, 2014) of the personalisation app Google Now, specifically in regards to notions of user trust, expectation and speculation. My critical enquiries produced a number of themes that tie this thesis together. Central were: the epistemic uncertainties that emerged as trust and anxiety in participant responses; the implications for a performative understanding of selfhood when algorithmic personalisation intervenes in user self-articulation; the (asymmetrical) data-for-services exchange which web users must negotiate with commercial data trackers; and the struggle for autonomy between user and system that algorithmic personalisation creates.

This is being addressed through work on OpenLearn (the open content initiative from The Open University developed {{with support from the}} William and Flora Hewlett Foundation) and POCKET (The Project on Open Content for Knowledge Exposition and Teaching, supported by JISC under the repositories and preservation programme). The approach is evaluative considering transfer of lessons from work on the reworking of distance learning materials (within the OpenLearn initiative) to the reworking of material from campus-based universities (supported by the POCKET project). Analysis will include the role of supporting artifacts (guidelines, examples, tools) and the process support required (shared aims, workshops, structure).

40|$|Recent trends to {{miniaturized}} {{systems such}} as smartphones and wearables, {{as well as the}} rise of autonomous vehicles relying on all-electric and smart in-car systems, have brought unprecedented needs for superior performance, functionality, and cost requirements. Transistor scaling alone cannot meet these metrics unless the remaining system components such as substrates and interconnections are scaled down {{to bridge the gap between}} transistor and system scaling. In this regard, 3 D glass system packages have emerged as a promising alternative due to their ultra-short system interconnection lengths, higher component densities and system reliability enabled by the tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), high dimensional stability and surface smoothness, outstanding electrical properties and low-cost panel-level processability of glass. The research objectives are to demonstrate board-level reliability of large, thin, glass packages directly mounted on PCB with conventional BGAs at pitches of 400 µm SMT and smaller. Two key innovations are introduced to accomplish the objectives: a.) <b>Reworkable</b> circumferential polymer collars providing strain-relief at critical high stress concentration areas in the solder joints, b.) novel Mn-doped SACMTM solder to provide superior drop test performance without degrading thermomechanical reliability. Modeling, package and board design, fabrication and reliability characterization were carried out to demonstrate reliable board-level interconnections of large, ultra-thin glass packages. Finite-element modeling (FEM) was used to investigate the effectiveness of circumferential polymer collars as a strain-relief solution on fatigue performance. Experimental results with polymer collars indicated a 2 X improvement in drop performance and 30 % improvement in fatigue life. Failure analysis was performed using characterization techniques such as confocal surface acoustic microscopy (C-SAM), optical microscopy, X-ray imaging, and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS). Model-to-experiment correlation was performed to validate the effectiveness of polymer collars as a strain-relief mechanism. Enhancement in board-level reliability performance with advances in solder materials based on Mn-doped SACMTM is demonstrated in the last part of the thesis. The studies, thus, demonstrate material, design and process innovations for package-to-board interconnection reliability with ultra-thin, large glass packages. M. S...|$|E
40|$|An {{embedded}} planar capacitor {{is a thin}} laminate {{embedded in}} a multilayered printed wiring board (PWB) that functions both as a power-ground plane and as a parallel plate capacitor. The capacitor laminate consists of a dielectric material (epoxy-BaTiO 3 composite dielectric is widely used) sandwiched between two Cu layers. These capacitors have gained importance {{with an increase in}} the operating frequency and a decrease in the supply voltage in electronic circuits since it can lead to PWB miniaturization. Further, the use of embedded planar capacitor leads to better electrical performance of the PWB. Although embedded planar capacitors have various advantages there are some issues such as lack of reliability information and a high leakage current in the epoxy-BaTiO 3 composite dielectric. This dissertation aims in investigating these issues that needs to be investigated for wide scale commercialization of these capacitors. The reliability of embedded planar capacitors is critical since these capacitors are not <b>reworkable</b> and its failure can lead to PWB failure. In this work the reliability of an embedded planar capacitor (with epoxy-BaTiO 3 composite dielectric) is investigated under environmental stress conditions in the presence of an applied bias. Temperature-humidity-bias (THB) tests and highly accelerated life test (HALT) was performed at multiple stress levels to investigate the reliability under these conditions. The failure modes and mechanisms during THB and HALT are investigated. Further, during HALT the life time is also modeled using the Prokopowicz model and regression of the in-situ capacitor data. The loading of BaTiO 3 in the epoxy-BaTiO 3 composite dielectric should be as high as possible (until the theoretical maximum packing density is achieved) to maximize the effective dielectric constant of the composite. But as the loading of BaTiO 3 in the composite dielectric increases, the undesirable leakage current also increases. The mechanism of current conduction in this composite dielectric is investigated in this work. The effect of various factors such as BaTiO 3 loading, BaTiO 3 particle diameter, temperature, and voltage on the resulting leakage current has been modeled. Measurements of leakage current were performed on embedded capacitors with varying BaTiO 3 loading and varying particle diameters over a range of temperature and voltage. The consistence of the leakage current data with standard conduction models is compared to investigate the conduction mechanism...|$|E
40|$|It is an axiom of the {{manufacturing}} of any complex product that errors will occur that require repair or discard of said product. In building aircraft, Raptor Aerospace encounters and repairs numerous deviations from the original design drawings. This process is known as rework. Reducing the amount of rework necessary represents a substantial opportunity both for improving quality and for cutting cost. Rework can be further split into several categories, with the simplest repairs referred to as <b>reworkable</b> discrepancies which has been valued at over $ 50, 000, 000 per year. This thesis will present a project that began {{at the start of}} the internship, when the author was paired with a specialist from Raptor Aerospace to lead a team whose purpose was to develop an approach and implement improvements that would generate a significant reduction in rework. This process would include both physical changes to {{the manufacturing}} process and would target specific aspects of the prevailing culture at Raptor. With no existing plan for reducing rework, the two team leaders began the project by conducting a thorough analysis of existing rework data, focusing on the descriptive texts that were provided by inspectors. This analysis generated a pareto of the inspectors' words, enabling the team to identify the most common causes of rework at Raptor. Based on these results, small teams were created to perform root cause and corrective action analyses on the biggest issues. In addition to the small teams, the co-leaders also searched for solutions that would have a systemic impact on the volume of rework. To this end, an automated tool was developed that would report the rework history of every single task completed in final assembly. Within the timeframe of the internship (6. 5 months), the various approaches completed by the project team produced verified annualized savings of over $ 2, 000, 000, as well as time savings of over 40 manhours per week. In addition, other efforts that were begun but not yet completed have anticipated savings of over $ 10, 000, 000. Finally, the project has produced indications of cultural improvements within Raptor Aerospace, as individuals and departments have begun volunteering to contribute and lead improvement efforts. Overall, it appears that the approaches taken by the project team have successfully launched a change initiative which could have substantial and long-lasting value to Raptor Aerospace. by Jeremy A.

40|$|Lidar is {{a useful}} tool for taking {{metrology}} measurements without the need for physical contact with the parts under test. Lidar instruments are aimed at a target using azimuth and elevation stages, then focus a beam of coherent, frequency modulated laser energy onto the target, such as the surface of a mechanical structure. Energy from the reflected beam is mixed with an optical reference signal that travels in a fiber path internal to the instrument, and the range to the target is calculated based on the difference in the frequency of the returned and reference signals. In cases when the parts are in extreme environments, additional steps need to be taken to separate the operator and lidar from that environment. A model has been developed that accurately reduces the lidar data to an absolute position and accounts for the three media in the testbed air, fused silica, and vacuum but the approach can be adapted for any environment or material. The accuracy of laser metrology measurements depends upon knowing the parameters of the media through which the measurement beam travels. Under normal conditions, this means knowledge of the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the air in the measurement volume. In the past, chamber windows have been used to separate the measuring device from the extreme environment within the chamber and still permit optical measurement, but, so far, only relative changes have been diagnosed. The ability to make accurate measurements through a window presents a challenge as {{there are a number of}} factors to consider. In the case of the lidar, the window will increase the time-of-flight of the laser beam causing a ranging error, and refract the direction of the beam causing angular positioning errors. In addition, differences in pressure, temperature, and humidity on each side of the window will cause slight atmospheric index changes and induce deformation and a refractive index gradient within the window. Also, since the window is a dispersive media, the effect of both phase and group indices have to be considered. Taking all these factors into account, a method was developed to measure targets through multiple regions of different materials and produce results that are absolute measurements of target position in three-dimensional space, rather than simply relative position. The environment in which the lidar measurements are taken must be broken down into separate regions of interest and each region solved for separately. In this case, there were three regions of interest: air, fused silica, and vacuum. The angular position of the target inside the chamber is solved using only phase index and phase velocity, while the ranging effects due to travel from air to glass to vacuum/air are solved with group index and group velocity. When all parameters are solved simultaneously, an absolute knowledge of the position of each target within an environmental chamber can be derived. Novel features of this innovation include measuring absolute position of targets through multiple dispersive and non-dispersive media, deconstruction of lidar raw data from a commercial off-the-shelf unit into <b>reworkable</b> parameters, and use of group velocities to reduce range data. Measurement of structures within a vacuum chamber or other harsh environment, such as a furnace, may now be measured as easily as if they were in an ambient laboratory. This analysis permits transformation of the raw data into absolute spatial units (e. g., mm). This technique has also been extended to laser tracker, theodolite, and cathetometer measurements through refractive media...|$|E
