Her distress signal had been picked up by only a single Allied merchant ship, which did not report it until she arrived at Fremantle on 17March.

5|$|The {{character}} Crunch Bandicoot {{was designed}} by Craig Whittle of Traveller's Tales and Sean Krankel of Universal. The concept of battling mini-bosses within the game's levels was dropped to uphold the fast and frantic pace of the series' gameplay. Multiplayer capability was also considered before being dropped. An earlier draft of the story featured an alternate version of the game's climax and ending, which involved Crash battling Crunch in a mechanical robot suit. At {{the end of the}} fight, Crunch would destroy Crash's suit with a bolt of electricity. The resulting debris would render Cortex unconscious, destroy the remote control device controlling Crunch and start an electrical fire in the space station. As the Bandicoots escape to <b>resume</b> <b>their</b> beach-going vacation, the ruins of the space station would crash-land onto the island of Cortex's original settlement, conveniently allowing Cortex and Uka Uka to <b>resume</b> <b>their</b> world domination bids.|$|E

5|$|During 1936, the Arab Revolt {{broke out}} in the British Mandate of Palestine. British troops were dispatched, ending {{the first phase of the}} war by the close of the year. Fighting soon resumed and reached its zenith during the summer of 1938. With rising {{tensions}} in Europe, the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement—on 30September 1938—calmed the rising tensions in Europe and averted war, allowing the British to <b>resume</b> <b>their</b> military build-up in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Freelancer {{features}} a multiplayer mode, allowing up to 128players to play {{together in a}} game. Multiplayer games are hosted on game servers; personal computers that meet the requirements for the game {{can act as a}} server. Gameplay is similar to the single-player mode, but is absent of story-driven quests. The server keeps individual records of the players' progress, and they can <b>resume</b> <b>their</b> game on their next log on to this server. A persistent virtual galaxy is thus maintained for them.|$|E

A week later, Johnson's squadron was moved to RAF Tangmere on the Channel coast.

If the Germans did not <b>resume</b> <b>their</b> assault the Wing {{was to take the}} fight to them.|$|E

5|$|Operation Bodenplatte (Baseplate), {{launched}} on 1 January 1945, {{was an attempt}} by the Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries during the Second World War. The goal of Bodenplatte was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could <b>resume</b> <b>their</b> advance. The operation was planned for 16 December 1944, but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year’s Day, the first day that happened to be suitable.|$|E
5|$|The Muslims found {{themselves}} in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community.

5|$|The {{existence}} of the railway meant that sufficient supplies and armaments had been transported to the plateau for the allies to <b>resume</b> <b>their</b> attack. The Second Bombardment started on April 9 and continued for ten days. Initially, little progress {{seemed to have been}} made because again the Russians were able to repair the damage caused, and the Russians continued to deliver supplies to Sevastopol from the north. However, they had sustained heavy casualties. Following a period of stalemate, Allied forces cut off one of the main Russian supply lines at Kerch on May 24.|$|E

5|$|While Daniels {{supported}} the legislation, {{he believed the}} Republican lawmakers should drop the bill {{because it was not}} part of their election platform and deserved a period of public debate.

Their refusal to return left the Indiana General Assembly unable to pass any legislation, until three of the twelve bills they objected to were dropped from the agenda on March 28.
