40|$|The use of <b>rotary</b> shaft <b>seals</b> made of PTFE {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence}} of their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable <b>rotary</b> shaft <b>seals,</b> there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by PTFE <b>rotary</b> shaft <b>seals.</b> The relieved <b>rotary</b> shaft lip <b>seal</b> represents a special design among PTFE <b>rotary</b> shaft <b>seals.</b> Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved <b>rotary</b> shaft <b>seal</b> as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the permissible pressure range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the sealing edge, thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved <b>rotary</b> shaft <b>seal.</b> Earlier designs of the relieved <b>rotary</b> shaft <b>seal,</b> similar to other commercially available <b>rotary</b> shaft <b>seals,</b> sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material. This was remedied by a functional analysis of the sealing system, experimental investigations, and by the use of FE simulations. In this way, the plastic memory effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

To determine a solution for turbo-engine efficiency enhancement, we investigated the clearance reduction between the rotary parts in air systems, the successive starts and stops, the thermal expansion and the vibrations that might cause direct rub interactions between a <b>rotary</b> <b>seal,</b> known as a labyrinth seal, and a turbo-engine housing coated with a sacrificial abradable material.

40|$|Global warming, climate change, rising {{fuel prices}} and {{sustainable}} future environment {{are the main}} motivations behind this research project. Hydropower {{is a very good}} example of renewable energy and it is the most reliable base-load energy source. There is huge untapped technically exploitable hydro energy potential of about 14, 000 TWh (Taylor, 2004, Sommers, 2004) waiting to be utilised throughout the world. There are few small to medium scale low head hydro turbines commercially available, but they are very expensive for micro power generation at individual level. Therefore, there is an inherent need of a simple low cost and low head hydro turbine that can encourage use of hydropower available in abundant from creeks, small rivers, streams etc. at an individual level. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to develop low cost and high performance simple reaction water turbine for electricity production from low head hydro sources. In this thesis, two new innovative designs of simple reaction water turbine are presented and the performance characteristics of their prototypes are investigated experimentally and graphically presented. The theoretical analysis of the simple reaction turbine presented in this thesis highlights the potentials and intrinsic characteristics of simple reaction turbine. The governing equations for ideal situation without losses and practical situation with losses are presented in this thesis. The theoretical analysis predicts the centrifugal pumping effect that allows additional mass of water to flow through the turbine as it starts to rotate faster. Further, the theoretical model for optimum turbine diameter is presented followed by the theoretical analysis of jet-interference phenomenon. This thesis explains the systematic procedure of manufacturing turbine rotors for both the innovative new designs. <b>Rotary</b> <b>seal</b> arrangements used in the testing of these turbine prototypes are presented with figures. Thesis further illustrates the experimental test rig and its instrumentation used for testing the prototypes of the new turbine designs. Experimental procedures are explained with illustrative pictures of test rig and its instrumentation. The experimental investigation presented in the thesis shows the centrifugal pumping effect through the additional flow rate measured as the turbine speed increases. The fluid frictional power loss characteristics of simple reaction turbine are experimentally estimated for stationary and rotary conditions and presented as k-factor in this thesis. The performance characteristics like turbine power output, electrical power output, turbine efficiency and overall efficiency verses rotational speed for different supply pressures (supply heads) is also presented with examples and illustrative discussion for all new turbine designs. A case study of the potential low head hydro site in Victoria, Australia is presented with detail turbine sizing and water intake system for small creek using natural stone weir.

40|$|International audienceA major {{challenge}} in countercurrent chromatography (CCC), the technique {{that works with}} a support-free biphasic liquid system, is to retain the liquid stationary phase inside the CCC column (Sf parameter). Two solutions are commercially available: the hydrostatic CCC columns, also called centrifugal partition chromatographs (CPC), with disks of interconnected channels and <b>rotary</b> <b>seals,</b> and the hydrodynamic CCC columns with bobbins of coiled open tube and no <b>rotary</b> <b>seals.</b> It was demonstrated {{that the amount of}} liquid stationary phase retained by a coiled tube was higher with larger bore tubing than with small bore tubes. At constant column volume, small bore tubing will be longer producing more efficiency than larger bore tube that will better retain the liquid stationary phase. Since the resolution equation in CCC is depending on both column efficiency and stationary phase retention ratio, the influence of the tubing bore should be studied. This theoretical work showed that there is an optimum tubing bore size depending on solute partition coefficient and mobile phase flow rate. The interesting result of the theoretical study is that larger tubing bores allow for dramatically reduced experiment durations for all solutes: in reversed phase CCC (polar mobile phase), hydrophobic solutes are usually highly retained. These apolar solutes can be separated by the same coil at high flow rates and reduced Sf with similar retention times as polar solutes separated at smaller flow rates and much higher Sf...|$|R

50|$|Magnetic {{stirrers}} {{are often}} used in chemistry and biology, {{where they can be}} used inside hermetically closed vessels or systems, without the need for complicated <b>rotary</b> <b>seals.</b> They are preferred over gear-driven motorized stirrers because they are quieter, more efficient, and have no moving external parts to break or wear out (other than the simple bar magnet itself). Magnetic stir bars work well in glass vessels commonly used for chemical reactions, as glass does not appreciably affect a magnetic field. The limited size of the bar means that magnetic stirrers can only be used for relatively small experiments, of 4 liters or less. Stir bars also have difficulty in dealing with viscous liquids or thick suspensions. For larger volumes or more viscous liquids, some sort of mechanical stirring is typically needed.|$|R

50|$|Magnetic liquid <b>rotary</b> <b>seals</b> {{operate with}} no {{maintenance}} and extremely low leakage {{in a very}} wide range of applications. Ferrofluid-based seals used in industrial and scientific applications are most often packaged in mechanical <b>seal</b> assemblies called <b>rotary</b> feedthroughs, which also contain a central shaft, ball bearings and an outer housing. The ball bearings provide two important functions: maintaining the shaft's centering within the seal gap, and supporting external loads. The bearings are the only mechanical wear-items, as the dynamic seal is actually a series of rings made of ultra-low vapor pressure, oil-based liquid held magnetically between the rotor and stator. Therefore, the operating life and equipment maintenance cycles are generally very long, and the drag torque very low. The magnet material is permanently charged and requires no electrical power or other re-energizing or maintenance. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs reach performance levels that other technologies can't achieve, by optimizing features such as ferrofluid viscosity and magnetic strength, magnet and steel materials, bearing arrangements, and water cooling for applications with extremely high speeds or temperatures. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs routinely operate in environments including ultra-high vacuum (below 10âˆ’8 mbar), temperatures over 1,000 Â°C, {{tens of thousands of}} RPM, and multiple-atmosphere pressures.|$|R

Many failures have been reported due to this problem. Some manufacturers try to solve it by using magnetic couplings and totally avoiding <b>rotary</b> <b>sealing.</b> This improves reliability of the sealing and shafting, but they lose in efficiency due to limited torque transfer capability of the magnetic coupling and they solve this problem by using a high speed, low torque propeller. In most models the efficiency is as low as 25% which is very low for underwater thrusters. Magnetic bearings require {{the propeller}} to be rotated on the outer shell surfaces using a layer of water as a lubricant, which may reduce the bearing life considerably in contaminated water. Some other manufacturers use tapered bearings and a multiple sealing system for redundancy. In this design if the main seal (usually a ceramic seal) fails, the others seals keep the motor safe and the thruster can continue operation.|$|R
