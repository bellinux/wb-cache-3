40|$|The {{short and}} {{long-term}} effects of spacecraft explosions, {{as a function of}} the end-of-life <b>re-orbit</b> altitude above the geostationary orbit (GEO), were analyzed in terms of the additional contribution to the debris flux in the GEO ring. The simulated debris clouds were propagated for 72 years, taking into account all the relevant orbital perturbations. The results obtained show that 6 - 7 additional explosions in GEO would be sufficient, in the long-term, to double the current collision risk with sizable objects in geostationary orbit. Unfortunately, even spacecraft reorbit in between 300 and 500 km above GEO would not improve significantly the situation and an altitude increase of at least 2000 km should be adopted to reduce by one order of magnitude the long-term risk of collision among geostationary satellites and explosion fragments. The optimal debris mitigation strategy should be a compromise between the reliability and effectiveness of spacecraft end-of-life passivation, the <b>re-orbit</b> altitude and the acceptable debris background in the GEO ring. However, until the <b>re-orbit</b> altitudes currently used will be less than 500 km above GEO, new spacecraft explosions will have to be absolutely avoided for the long-term preservation of the geostationary environment...|$|R

The computer model, GEO-EVOL 1 and 2, was used to run different mitigation scenarios. The simulation result shows that the <b>re-orbit</b> maneuvering and the restriction of satellite explosions to the rate of 4 * 10 - 6 {{are one of the most}} cost effective measures and indispensable for a sustainable GEO environment over the long term. As for the economical valuation, the lower discount rate (less than or equal 6 %) should be used to correspond with the increasing threats of space debris in the GEO environment, where they have no natural forces to help remove the debris. New international regulations or agreements on debris mitigation are necessary to help ensure the long-term economic benefits from the space activities in the GEO region, however this will not be an easy path.

40|$|For {{satellites}} in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) {{the available}} propellant mass {{leads to a}} limited yet predictable operational life span. Already in an early phase during routine operations the question arises whether the remaining propellant is sufficient to fulfill the expected operational lifetime. Especially {{towards the end of}} operational life the remaining propellant mass is the driving factor for deciding when to <b>re-orbit</b> the satellite to the graveyard orbit. Therefore, at any time during mission operations, a statement about the expected durability of the remaining propellant mass is desired. A simple extrapolation of retrospective propellant mass data is insufficient since the mass consumption is affected. Three impacts that severely influence the propellant consumption are identified. The major impact on the satellite is the sequential consumption of the propellant mass seen over the whole satellite lifetime. With diminishing satellite mass the amount of propellant needed to create a specific velocity increment, is decreasing. As an effect of the sequential propellant mass reduction the propellant pressures drop over the long term, which represents the second major impact. Therefore, an increasing amount of propellant is needed to create a specific velocity increment. The perturbations on the orbit due to the moon and the su...|$|R

On the short-term, the explosions in geostationary orbit are the most detrimental for the GEO ring environment, even though the average fragment density in the ring is never higher than 1 / 5 of the background, decreasing to less than 1 / 100 of the existing environment after 4 yr (apart for a density rebound five decades later, due to luni-solar perturbations). Spacecraft end-of-life <b>re-orbiting</b> is a possible mitigation solution. But the <b>re-orbiting</b> altitude is critical if explosions continue to occur. In order to reduce the post-event average density by an order of magnitude with respect to an explosion occurring in GEO, more than 500 km of <b>re-orbiting</b> are needed. Concerning the long-term environmental impact, the <b>re-orbiting</b> strategy supported by IADC seems adequate to guarantee, after 2 - 3 years, a long-term average density of fragments in the GEO ring at least two orders of magnitude below the existing background.

Based on orbital data in ESA 2 ̆ 7 s DISCOS database the situation near the geostationary ring (GEO) is assessed for a reference epoch in December 2008. An {{analysis of the}} orbital evolution histories of 970 objects showed that 335 of the GEO objects were controlled inside their longitude slots, 476 were drifting above, below or through GEO, 154 were captured {{at one of the}} two stable libration points, and 5 objects had an ill-defined orbit status (e. g. due to insufficient orbit data). Furthermore, there were 46 controlled satellites and 170 uncontrolled objects with no TLE information at all. Thus, the total number of known objects in the geostationary region was 1186, out of which 381 were controlled, 800 were uncontrolled and 5 could not be classified. During the year 2008, 12 GEO spacecraft reached their end of life. Seven of them were re-orbited following the IADC guidelines, two were re-orbited with an insufficient GEO clearance and three spacecraft were abandoned without any <b>re-orbiting</b> manoeuvre. The <b>re-orbiting</b> statistics of the years from 1997 to 2008 show that the adherence to the IADC space debris mitigation guidelines is slowly improving over time. Also the <b>re-orbiting</b> practice of GPS satellites is analysed. For 22 of the 56 launched GPS satellites a disposal manoeuvre was identified from the DISCOS TLE data. Since the year 2000, the orbits of the GPS satellites are usually raised by about 1000 km at end-of-life. Finally the <b>re-orbiting</b> options of Galileo satellites are compared.

Starting from the MASTER- 2005 debris population, the long term evolution of the GEO environment was simulated under a few realistic scenarios, based on increasingly aggressive mitigation strategies. Beyond the high eccentricity objects, also the influence of the rocket stages separated from GEO spacecraft and left in geosynchronous drift orbits was analyzed. The main mitigation measures considered included the <b>re-orbiting</b> of GEO spacecraft at the end-of-life in the super-GEO graveyard zone, the de-orbiting of GTO/HEO upper stages and the <b>re-orbiting</b> of the rocket stages usually abandoned in drift orbits.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{evolution and}} environmental impact in MEO {{of all the}} abandoned spacecraft and upper stages associated with the GPS and GLONASS navigation constellations were analyzed. The orbits of the disposed objects, as of 1 May 2011, were propagated for 200 years and snapshots of their evolving distribution were obtained, together with an estimation of the changing collision probability with the spacecraft of the operational navigation systems existing or planned in MEO, i. e. GLONASS, GPS, Beidou and Galileo. The probability that the abandoned objects considered will collide with the operational spacecraft of the navigation constellations is very low, even {{taking into account the}} intrinsic eccentricity instability of the disposal orbits. Assuming the present or envisaged configuration of the constellations in MEO, the probability of collision, integrated over 200 years, would be < 1 / 300 with a GLONASS spacecraft, < 1 / 15, 000 with a GPS or Beidou spacecraft, and < 1 / 250, 000 with a Galileo spacecraft. The worst disposal strategy consists in abandoning satellites and upper stages close to the altitude of the operational constellation (GLONASS), while a <b>re-orbiting</b> a few hundred km away (GPS) is able to guarantee an effective long-term dilution of the collision risk, irrespective of the eccentricity instability due to geopotential and luni-solar perturbations. The disposal strategies applied so far to the GPS satellites should be able to guarantee for at least a few centuries a sustainable MEO environment free of collisions among intact objects. Consequently, there would be no need to adopt disposal schemes targeting also the optimal value of the eccentricity vector. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that the GPS disposal strategy was devised well in advance of the Beidou constellation announcement, so most of the abandoned satellites were re-orbited fairly close to the altitude of the new Chinese system.

Among these, laser propulsion potentially offers great weight and power savings, obtained by separating the propulsion system energy source from the propelled satellite.

A wide-ranging survey of end-of-life disposal techniques and strategies is presented for comparison against a gossamer structure prior to a down-selection of viable competing techniques; solar sailing, high and low-thrust propulsion, and electrodynamic tethers. A parametric comparison of the down-selection competing techniques is presented where {{it was found that}} exploiting solar radiation pressure on the gossamer structure was of limited value.

Atmospheric drag augmentation was found to be of most benefit for end-of-life disposal when an entirely passive means is required, allowing the device to act as a ‘fail-safe’, which if the spacecraft suffers a catastrophic failure would activate.

Recent proposals for missions involving the use of space manipulators and/or automated transfer vehicles are presented as a solution for a lot of problems which now affect the procedures and the performance of the in-orbit space systems. Other projects involving space manipulators have been developed by DARPA aiming to demonstrate several satellite servicing operations and technologies including rendez-vous, proximity operations and station-keeping, capture, docking, fluid transfer (specifically, “hydrazine”), and ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) transfer.

40|$|The {{geostationary}} orbit (GEO), {{which is an}} ideal orbit for communication and earth observation satellites, is accumulating {{an increasing number of}} spacecraft. Lack of atmospheric drag keeps the retired satellites near GEO orbit extremely long. Therefore it is interesting and meaningful to know the long-term effects of micrometeoroid impacts on spacecraft. This thesis aims to study the cumulative effects of micrometeoroid impacts on spacecraft in GEO and quantify the timescale for them to damage the typical spacecraft surface materials that are currently widely used in space missions. The mechanism of hypervelocity impact by a single particle is thoroughly reviewed and a set of damage scaling equations are chosen to evaluate the damage of single micrometeoroid impact. In combination with the implementation of the interplanetary meteoroid flux model developed by Grün et al., the cumulative effects of micrometeoroid impacts on cover glass of solar cells, MLI and radiators are quantified in terms of Volume Ejection Rate (VER) and Area Damage Rate (ADR). Furthermore a simple model is developed to predict the probability of a catastrophic collision between a meteoroid particle and a spacecraft. The results from both long-term effects and catastrophic collision are discussed and compared. The results show that it takes about several ten thousands years for micrometeoroid impacts to erode away the cover glass material and radiator material, or cover all the MLI surface area, and that after 100 years the chance of a catastrophic collision that can totally fragment the impact target is about one impact per hundred thousand years.

40|$|In {{the context}} of an {{exponential}} increase in the space debris population, which might yield to a substantial reduction of space activities in highly exploited orbits in a near future, new techniques for mitigating its growth are of key importance and are receiving an increasing attention in the international community. Among many proposals for active debris removal stands the Ion Beam Shepherd (IBS), a method which consists in a spacecraft rendez-vousing with the space debris object and relocating it to a di erent orbit with the use of electric propulsion. Such a shepherd spacecraft consequently requires two main thrusters, one directed at the target object, which transmits a force to it through the action of the ions of the plasma plume, and the other one, used to compensate the thrust generated by the rst, thus maintaining the satellite and the debris at a constant distance throughout the de-orbiting or <b>re-orbiting</b> mission. In this bachelor's thesis, the plasma interaction between the IBS and a target debris is studied through simulations. The software used for modelling the system and simulating its physics is SPIS (Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software), an open source software developed by Onera and Artenum under the contract of the European Space Agency. Unfortunately, some unexpected technical issues with the software made it impossible to study, in detail, the primary goal of the di erential charging between the IBS and the debris when a plasma bridge is established between the two objects. However, the corresponding limitations {{in the use of the}} SPIS software (not known a priori) were identi ed and its knowledge will certainly help any future project whose goal is to study the spacecraft-debris interaction in {{the context of}} the IBS.

40|$|In situ {{atmospheric}} measurements at low orbital heights {{are necessary}} to build accurate atmospheric models and in particular {{to contribute to the}} development of a global, real time, space weather forecasting service, following the high variability of the atmospheric environment and allowing accurate predictions of LEO object trajectories and maneuvers planning. Missions for real-time in situ atmospheric measurements have been recently proposed, based on nanosatellite swarms. The main limitation in these missions is the effect of atmospheric drag, which dissipates the orbital energy making the nanosatellite re-enter and burn quickly in the Earth atmosphere. Therefore, the operative orbit height must be sufficiently high to guarantee a meaningful orbital lifetime, justifying the launch and sophisticated instrumentation costs. Using a propulsion system, the useful satellite lifetime could be extended and at the same time the operative orbit height could be lowered, to explore more interesting zones. However, conventional propulsion systems, namely chemical and electric propulsion systems, are not compatible with the on board resources constraints imposed by nanosatellites, in terms of mass and power. Innovative propulsion techniques enabling atmospheric measurement missions at low altitudes should be investigated. Among these, laser propulsion offers great weight and power potential savings, obtained separating the propulsion system energy source from the satellite. The energy source for the propulsion system is a laser beam generated remotely, while only a collecting mirrors and ablative material are necessary on the target spacecraft. The mission proposed in this paper is based on the idea that the source of the propulsion energy necessary for the whole nanosatellite swarm can be concentrated in one or more large satellites orbiting at higher altitudes, where the atmospheric drag can be easily compensated. Energy is transferred to the low orbit target nanosatellites by a laser beam, that impinges on the nanosatellite's surfaces, vaporizes a cover slide of ablating material, giving net thrust to the target nanosatellite. The mission is designed taking into account long term orbital perturbations on the target nanosatellite swarm and on the laser source spacecraft. The laser sustained <b>re-orbiting</b> maneuver sequence is optimized, depending on the relative orbital geometry, showing that the laser propulsion system is an enabling technology for low altitude nanosatellite aeronomy missions.

40|$|The {{space debris}} {{long-term}} analysis program SDM {{was developed in}} the early 902 ̆ 7 s to study the long-term evolution of orbital debris and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} mitigation measures. SDM was now upgraded to Version 3. 0 including several new features and models for the sources and sinks mechanisms: 1) a very accurate propagator including all the relevant gravitational and non gravitational perturbations was added to the existing DCP propagator; 2) a model for the production of Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) slag was added; 3) the new NASA EVOLVE 4 breakup model to simulate the generation of debris clouds produced by on-orbit explosions and collisions was added; 4) a breakup model for low-velocity collisions was added; 5) a set of advanced mitigation options for LEO, MEO and GEO were added to allow the simulation of a number of complex scenarios in the different orbital regimes; 6) both the pre-processing and the post-processing sections of the code were completely revised and updated. Then the long-term evolution of the space debris population with mass larger than 1 mg, from LEO up to 40 000 km of altitude, was studied with the upgraded SDM 3. 0 model. The purpose of the study was to test the updated software and to analyse the effect of a series of mitigation measures recently proposed, and partly also applied, at international level and to test the sensitivity of the evolution to different models implemented in SDM. First a new, up-to-date Business As Usual scenario was outlined, taking into account the changing features of the recent space activities and the most probable future traffic trends. Building on this default scenario, the effectiveness of several mitigation measures was tested, in different orbital regimes. Below 2000 km the envisaged EOL mitigation measures (including passivation and <b>re-orbiting</b> or de-orbiting with different residual lifetimes) obtain the important result of stabilising, and then progressively reducing, the number of objects larger than 10 cm in orbit. Even a residual spacecraft lifetime of 75 years in LEO is able to reach this important goal, averting the long-term onset of an exponential growth, but of course there is a temporal delay and a correspondingly higher maximum population with respect to the other three scenarios. The sensitivity of the results to the adoption of the new NASA EVOLVE 4 breakup models was then discussed. It was found that, with the adoption of this last breakup model, the population of objects larger than 10 cm in LEO keeps growing, though slowly, even in the mitigated scenarios. Therefore, if it will turn out that the new NASA breakup models are better to simulate future explosions and collisions, the proposed mitigation scenarios are not able to stabilise the population of debris larger than 10 cm in LEO...|$|E
40|$|Through careful {{consideration}} of the orbit perturbation force due to the oblate nature of the primary body a secular variation of the ascending node angle of a near-polar orbit can be induced without expulsion of propellant. Resultantly, the orbit perturbations {{can be used to}} maintain the orbit plane in, for example, a near-perpendicular (or at any other angle) alignment to the Sun-line throughout the full year of the primary body; such orbits are normally termed Sun-synchronous orbits [1, 2]. Sun-synchronous orbits about the Earth are typically near-circular Low-Earth Orbits (LEOs), with an altitude of less than 1500 km. It is normal to design a LEO such that the orbit period is synchronised with the rotation of the Earth‟s surface over a given period, such that a repeating ground-track is established. A repeating ground-track, together with the near-constant illumination conditions of the ground-track when observed from a Sun-synchronous orbit, enables repeat observations of a target over an extended period under similar illumination conditions [1, 2]. For this reason, Sun-synchronous orbits are extensively used by Earth Observation (EO) platforms, including currently the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT), the second European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS- 2) and many more. By definition, a given Sun-synchronous orbit is a finite resource similar to a geostationary orbit. A typical characterising parameter of a Sun-synchronous orbit is the Mean Local Solar Time (MLST) at descending node, with a value of 1030 hours typical. Note that ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 used a MLST at descending node of 1030 hours ± 5 minutes, while ENVISAT uses a 1000 hours ± 5 minutes MLST at descending node [3]. Following selection of the MLST at descending node and for a given desired repeat ground-track, the orbit period and hence the semi-major axis are fixed, thereafter assuming a circular orbit is desired it is found that only a single orbit inclination will enable a Sun-synchronous orbit [2]. As such, only a few spacecraft can populate a given repeat ground-track Sun-synchronous orbit without compromise, for example on the MLST at descending node. Indeed a notable feature of on-going studies by the ENVISAT Post launch Support Office is the desire to ensure sufficient propellant remains at end-of-mission for <b>re-orbiting</b> to a graveyard orbit to ensure the orbital slot is available for future missions [4]. An extension to the Sun-synchronous orbit is considered using an undefined, non-orientation constrained, low-thrust propulsion system. Initially the low-thrust propulsion system will be considered for the free selection of orbit inclination and altitude while maintaining the Sun-synchronous condition. Subsequently the maintenance of a given Sun-synchronous repeat-ground track will be considered, using the low-thrust propulsion system to enable the free selection of orbit altitude. An analytical expression will be developed to describe these extensions prior to then validating the analytical expressions within a numerical simulation of a spacecraft orbit. Finally, an analysis will be presented on transfer and injection trajectories to these orbits...|$|E
40|$|On February the 28 th the Specular Point-like Quick Reference (SPQR) {{equipment}} was launched {{on board the}} 17 P Progress flight to the International Space Station (ISS). The {{equipment was}} installed {{after a few days}} on a ISS win-dow and the experiment was successfully performed in March-May 2005, in the frame of the Italian Soyouz Mission “Eneide” (ISM). The Columbia disaster showed how critical manned missions are and how useful would be a device for imaging low Earth orbit manned satellites with a resolution of 20 cm (which would have probably been sufficient to detect the damage on the Columbia surface). Unfortunately, the Earth atmosphere blurs the images thus preventing from achieving sharp photographs of satellites. The aim of SPQR experiment is to test a procedure suitable to overcome this problem and to improve the imaging resolution to about 20 cm or less. This can be done by providing in the pic-ture a point-like light source with a high signal to noise ratio, which has been subjected to the same atmospheric dis-tortion as the target spacecraft. The point spread function of this reference can be used to process the image for ob-taining a sharp image. The SPQR equipment consists of a glass Cube Corner Reflector (CCR) inserted in a mounting designed to interface the CCR with an ISS window. The window, during the experiment allocated time, has been oriented in the nadir di-rection. The CCR has been illuminated by a ground based laser. The laser beam has been retro-reflected to the ground station by the CCR. Hence, the ground station telescope devoted to take images of the ISS, has also seen the “point-like reference” consisting of the laser beam reflected by the “specular” CCR. Although the SPQR equipment is completely passive (it is just a reflector), for uploading it on the ISS a number of issues arised, essentially due to safety considerations related with the crew presence in the ISS cabin. For this reason, some tests have been required by Rocket and Space Corporation – Energia (the company managing the ISM for the Russian Space Agency) and by the European Space Agency (ESA, managing the mission for the sponsoring institu-tions and providing additional services). The paper illustrates the tests the SPQR flight models have been submitted to as well as the relevant results. The tests, performed in January 2005, are as follows: 1. 	Vibration and shock tests, to simulate the vibration environment. The following tests were performed (on each axis) : 	Vibration test of the Flight Model (FM) inside its Transportation Bag (TB) simulating the Progress launch conditions; 	Vibration test of the FM inside its TB simulating the Progress insertion conditions, i. e. the boosting phases while the Progress approaches the ISS orbit; 	Shock test of the FM inside its TB simulating the Progress docking to the ISS; 	Vibration test of the FM, hard mounted on the interface with the shaker, as it would have been mounted on the ISS window. This test simulated the ISS orbit conditions, i. e. the ISS <b>re-orbiting</b> boosting phases. 2. 	Interferometric test of the CCR, to verify that the vibration and shock tests did not cause any damage to the CCR glass. This test was requested by ESA safety and structures experts to have a greater safety factor about the CCR glass: in fact this is a major concern from a safety standpoint, since small glass particle in a micro-gravity environment can be lethal for the crew due to the ease of ingestion and breathing. 3. 	Non-destructive test of the SPQR aluminium interface, to verify the absence of cracks. 4. 	Off-gassing test, to prove that the SPQR equipment non-metallic materials would not have produced gases dangerous for the astronauts or affecting their capabilities. 5. 	Flammability tests, to verify the flame propagation on some SPQR materials. After a short description of the SPQR experiment and equipment, the paper depicts the test purposes, performances and results...|$|E
