This article argues {{that the notion of}} language <b>rights</b> <b>is</b> far from clear. According to May, one key reason for rejecting the claim that language <b>rights</b> should <b>be</b> considered as human <b>rights</b> <b>is</b> the widespread belief that language <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> collective <b>rights.</b> In order to address this kind of objection, the collective character attributed to language <b>rights</b> must <b>be</b> carefully assessed, distinguishing two different views of what a collective <b>right</b> <b>is...</b>|$|R
