40|$|MBA - WBSIt is {{estimated}} that there are approximately 4900 <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> stations operating in South Africa. The industry is typically characterised by an oversupply of <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> stations, strong competition, {{a high degree of}} regulation and low retail margins. In order to differentiate their product offering, oil companies and fuel retailers make use of branding of <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> outlets, the inclusion of fuel additives to petrol and diesel and diversification of services available at <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> stations (for example the addition of convenience stores) to increase their competitive advantage. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the relative importance of branding in the South African <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> industry and to examine if certain demographic groups consider branding to be more important compared to other attributes. The research found that there is a significant difference in the degree of importance the South African private fuel consumer attaches to brand, location, fuel specification, quality of convenience store and level of forecourt service when determining <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> station preference. The private fuel consumer typically rates the <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> brand as the most important factor in his/her preference of a <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> station. The level of service, quality of the convenience store and the location of the <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> station also play an important role in determining <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> station preference. It was found that fuel specification played the least importance to the private consumer when selecting a <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> station. It was also found that certain demographic groupings attached varying importances to these attributes. For example, it was found that the Indian population seemed to be more brand conscious compared to other races, and that in general, men are more brand loyal than women. Women, on the other hand, valued the level of service and the quality of the convenience store as more important than men. A number of consumer clusters could be identified that attach different importances to the various <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> station attributes. From this cluster analysis, a group of respondents could be identified that base their <b>fuel</b> <b>retail</b> preference almost exclusively on brand...|$|R

I also explore whether <b>fuel</b> station <b>retail</b> market structure has an effect on alternative fuel availability and find no evidence that the presence of stations affiliated with integrated gasoline producers has limited the availability of E 85 at the market level.

I develop a theoretical model linking {{the shape of}} the ethanol demand curve to the distribution of price ratios at which individual households switch fuels. I estimate the model using data from many <b>retail</b> <b>fueling</b> stations. Demand is price-sensitive with a mean elasticity of 2. 5 – 3. 5. I find that preferences are heterogeneous with many households willing to pay a premium for ethanol. This reduces the simulated cost of an ethanol content standard, since some households choose ethanol without large subsidies; simulated costs are still high relative to likely environmental benefits. ...|$|R
