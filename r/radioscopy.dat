MethodsPatients who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between April 13, 2013, and April 20, 2013, were included in the study. These patients were evaluated retrospectively and two groups were identified: one in which intraoperative <b>radioscopy</b> was used to assess the positioning of the tibial component during the surgery and the other in which this resource was not used. ResultsThe mean angle of alignment of the tibial component in relation to the tibial diaphysis was greater in the group without use of intraoperative <b>radioscopy</b> (90. 82) than in the group with <b>radioscopy</b> (90. 63), which was a statistically significant result (p< 0. 05).

40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{establishing}} x-ray {{methods for}} inspection of cast aluminium components by combining two approaches, a radioscopic inspection, and a photon counting system. Indeed, <b>radioscopy</b> {{is widely used}} in castings inspection for automatic defect detection and is an efficient method for characterising rather small thicknesses, typically less than 40 mm. However cast components often show a high range of thicknesses and imaging the whole range is difficult. We propose to use photon-counting measurements to complement the radioscopic image for high thicknesses. Photon counting is not an imaging tool, but the thickness sensitivity obtained from photon-counting measurements (number of x-ray photons transmitted through the object) {{is much better than}} what can be obtained by classical <b>radioscopy</b> for up to 60 mm of aluminium.

40|$|Medical X-ray {{appliances}} use high-voltage {{power supplies}} {{that must be}} able to work with very different energy requirements. Two techniques can be distinguished in X-ray medical imaging: fluoroscopy and <b>radioscopy.</b> The former involves low power radiation with a long exposure time, while <b>radioscopy</b> requires large power during short radiographic exposure times. Since the converter has to be designed by taking into account the maximum power specification, it will exhibit a poor efficiency when operating at low power levels. Such a problem can be solved by using a new multilevel LCC topology. This topology is based on a classical series-parallel resonant topology, but includes an additional low-voltage auxiliary transformer whose function depends on the X-ray technique considered. When <b>radioscopy</b> operation is selected, the transformer will allow the power to be shared between two full-bridges.

40|$|International audienceSynchrotron {{real-time}} <b>radioscopy</b> and in situ microtomography are {{the only}} techniques providing direct visible information on a micrometre scale of local deformation in the implant-abutment connection (IAC) during and after cyclic loading. The microgap formation at the IAC has been subject {{to a number of}} studies as it has been proposed to be associated with long-term implant success. The next step in this scientific development is to focus on the in situ fatigue procedure of two-component dental implants. Therefore, an apparatus has been developed which is optimized for the in situ fatigue analysis of dental implants. This report demonstrates both the capability of in situ <b>radioscopy</b> and microtomography at the ID 19 beamline for the study of cyclic deformation in dental implants. The first results show {{that it is possible to}} visualize fatigue loading of dental implants in real-time <b>radioscopy</b> in addition to the in situ fatigue tomography. For the latter, in situ microtomography is applied during the cyclic loading cycles in order to visualize the opening of the IAC microgap.

Conventional Film Radiography is a slow, expensive and hazardous method, particularly for mass production.

40|$|Multi-energy <b>radioscopy</b> with {{normalization}} to {{a reference}} material is basically an easy-to-realize method with {{no special requirements}} to the equipment. Investigations as described above {{can be done with}} any radioscopic system. It is possible to identify a material by the comparison of two radioscopic images obtained at different accelerating voltages. In order to evaluate composite materials and to characterize material layers which are covered by a surrounding medium three irradiation energies are necessary. Therefore, the images obtained at three accelerating voltages should be imaged as color radioscopic images and evaluated by means of color image processing. Experiments and simulation calculations showed that this technique also allows the identification of materials in layered systems. An important result of simulation calculations is the fact that in many cases signal noise and digitalization errors are critical due to the little differendes in the gray-scali valued of two norm alized images. Therefore, low-noise images, i. e. the application of high integration times and an improved gray-scale value resolution (12 - 16 bit), are necessary. The practical advantage of this technique is the testing of components which can't be accessed wiht conventional analytical methods. This is especially a problem for the characterization of inner layers in layered structures. Multi-Energy <b>Radioscopy</b> can alos be applied to composite materials...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Aiming at {{promoting}} and facilitating {{learning and}} training in percutaneous renal surgery, we have created an easy to assemble, reproducible and cheap laboratory model. The model was built using pig kidney, foam layer, plastic catheter, linen or cotton holding sutures, and wide scotch tape. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: The kidney with catheterized ureter is fixed and involved in a foam layer. It stays hidden, and is visible only through <b>radioscopy.</b> This model is positioned and fixed to a radiological table {{in such a way}} that it simulates the patient&# 8217;s lumbar region. After that, contrast medium is injected through the ureter, and the urinary system is examined through <b>radioscopy.</b> All percutaneous maneuvers can be accomplished, from the puncture, tract dilation, insertion of Amplatz sheath, and introduction of nephroscope, allowing lithotripsy and endopielotomy, as well as other types of percutaneous surgeries. COMMENTS: The great advantage of this model is its easy construction, by using very cheap and widely available material. Foam can be several times washed and reused. After treatment, the model can be immediately open, and a critical analysis can be made, being then possible to verify if the place of renal puncture was well chosen, if dilation was correctly accomplished, and if the collecting system has been preserved. Therefore, this model can represent a great advance for the learning {{and training in}} percutaneous surgery...|$|E

30|$|Complete radiolucencies can be {{progressive}} and symptomatic, {{and it could}} reflect gross or moderate elbow instability that {{gives way to the}} prosthesis loosening up or that can be asymptomatic and non-progressive radiolucencies, in which there could be a degree of elbow instability, albeit mild. This may also cause loosening of the stem with loss of press-fit, but this minor instability {{comes at a time when}} is compensated by the prosthesis movement inside the radius (looser-type prostheses), and finds a balance that prevents it from progressing like the previous type. The cases with progressive radiolucencies appear with circumferential radial neck re-absorption, thus suggesting a good stem osteointegration; however, if moderate or severe instability persists in that elbow, it causes a symptomatic loosening of the stem. In case 14, we have been able to confirm this approach, as dynamic <b>radioscopy</b> carried out prior to surgery to remove the prosthesis showed a posterior dislocation of both the ulna and the radial head when extending the elbow We have no <b>radioscopy</b> for the other case, only suppositions. During the surgery undertaken to remove the prosthesis, we saw in both cases that the stem was completely loose, and pain improved after prosthesis removal; one of the cases had a MEPS score without prosthesis of 85 points and mild pain, linked to effort-making, on the lateral side of the elbow; therefore we recommended prosthesis removal in case of symptomatic loosening (Fig.  1 E–H).|$|E
