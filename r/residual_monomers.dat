PalacosR, a commercial bone cement, is used as the main component. The cement is modified by adding short glass fibers and resorbable oligomer fillers, and an additional cross-linking monomer. The test specimens are classified according to the composition of the bone cement matrix (i. e., oligomer-filler, glass-fiber reinforcement, and/or cross-linking monomer). The exothermal characteristics during autopolymerization are analyzed using a transducer connected with a computer. The quantities of <b>residual</b> <b>monomers</b> were analyzed from different test groups using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The Δ value for the oligomer filler and the glass-fiber-containing acrylic bone cement is lower than that for the unmodified bone cement (2. 1 ± 0. 8 vs. 23. 5 ± 4. 2 °C). The addition of a cross-linking monomer, EGDMA, shortens the setting time of the autopolymerization of the unmodified bone cement (7. 1 ± 0. 9 min vs. 3. 3 ± 0. 3 min). The quantity of the <b>residual</b> <b>monomers</b> released is higher in the modified bone cement than that in the unmodified cement.

One quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) lamp and two light-emitting diode (LED) device at three different curing regimes (L 1 = 12 J; L 2 = 24 J; L 3 = 24 J) were used to cure the specimens.

40|$|Background : Microwave postpolymerization {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a method to improve the flexural strength of an autopolymerizing denture reline resin. However, the effect of microwave postpolymerization on the <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> content and its influence on flexural strength have not been investigated. Objectives : This study analyzed the effect of microwave postpolymerization on the <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> content and its influence on the flexural strength of an autopolymerizing reline resin (Denture Liner). Materials and Methods : A total of 70 specimens (64 &# 935; 10 &# 935; 3. 3 mm) were polymerized according to the manufacturer&#x 2032;s instructions and divided into 7 groups (n = 10). Control group specimens were not subjectedto any further processing. Before testing, the specimens were subjected to postpolymerization in a microwave oven using different power (550 and 650 W) and time (3, 4, and 5 min) settings. Two specimens of each group were then manually ground into fine powder and samples extracted from the specimens using reflux method. The samples were then subjected to gas chromatography for <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> determination in area&#x 0025;. Eight specimens were subjected to a three-point bending device with a span of 50 &# 8197;mm and crosshead speed of 5 mm/min, and the flexural strength was determined in MPa. Data analyses included Student&#x 2032;s t-test and one-way analysis of variance. Results : For the Denture Liner reline resin, the <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> content decreased and the flexural strength increased significantly with the application of microwave irradiation using different time/power combinations. The specimens with the lowest <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> content were the similar specimens which presented with the highest flexural strength.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} environmental incentives for the polymer industry is to reduce the <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> in polymer products. Although several techniques are available for the removal of <b>residual</b> <b>monomer,</b> most methods are rather energy intensive and time consuming. Since supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) is known to have a plasticizing effect on many polymers and is a good solvent for most commonly used monomers, a scCO 2 -based process forms an interesting alternative. This paper focuses on the development of a post-emulsion polymerization process, which decreases the amount of methylmethacrylate (MMA) in polyMMA lattices using scCO 2. Typically, the method comprises a counterflow process, in which part of the <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> is converted by the increased diffusion inside the polymer particles due to the swelling by scCO 2. In addition, the amount of <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> is further reduced by the extraction capacity of scCO 2. Experimental {{studies have shown that the}} scCO 2 extraction of MMA is the predominant effect as compared to the enhanced polymerization due to plasticization. From a mass transfer model, the largest resistance in the extraction process appears to be situated in the water phase near the scCO 2 interface due to a relatively small surface area as compared to the overall polymer–water interfacial area. A viability study, including equipment sizing and economic evaluation, has shown that the removal of <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> from latex products using scCO 2 in principle yields a process which is both technically and economically feasible, capable to meet the future requirements...|$|R

The discs were then immersed in culture medium to obtain the eluates for the experimental groups (A 1 -Single Bond 2; A 2 -Scotchbond Multi-purpose; A 3 -Clearfil SE Bond; A 4 Scotchbond Universal). As a negative control, paper discs were immersed in culture medium only. After 24 h or 7 days, the eluate obtained was applied on fibroblast culture. Cell viability, cell morphology, membrane damage {{and the presence of}} <b>residual</b> <b>monomers</b> were evaluated by MTT assay, SEM, flow cytometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively.

Moreover, the adhesives caused intense morphological alterations and cell membrane damage.

This may be because of a potentially low <b>residual</b> <b>monomer</b> elution, resulting in a lower health risk and a better choice of material {{to be used in}} clinical practice.|$|R
