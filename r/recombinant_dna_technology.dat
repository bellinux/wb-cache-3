5|$|In 1981, Racaniello and Baltimore used <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology</b> to {{generate}} the first infectious clone of an animal RNA virus, poliovirus. DNA encoding the RNA genome of poliovirus was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced.

5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology</b> at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of homeotic genes that regulate development {{in a wide range of}} eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology.</b> Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Type I interferons (IFNs) {{are used}} to treat {{a wide variety of}} medical {{conditions}} including hepatitis C, cancers, viral and inflammatory diseases. IFNs can either be extracted from a natural source, such as cultured human cells or blood leukocytes, or they can be manufactured with <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies.</b> Most of these IFN treatments have a low response rate.|$|R

25|$|<b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology</b> arose as {{a result}} of {{advances}} in biology that began in the 1950s and 60’s. During these decades, a tradition of merging the structural, biochemical and informational approaches to the central problems of classical genetics became more apparent. Two main underlying concepts of this tradition were that genes consisted of DNA and that DNA encoded information that determined the processes of replication and protein synthesis. These concepts were embodied in the model of DNA proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick, and further research on the Watson-Crick model yielded theoretical advances that were reflected in new capacities to manipulate DNA. One of these capacities was <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Interferon was {{scarce and}} {{expensive}} until 1980, when the interferon gene was inserted into bacteria using <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology,</b> allowing mass cultivation and purification from bacterial cultures or derived from yeasts.

25|$|The {{human insulin}} protein is {{composed}} of 51 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 5808 Da. It is a dimer of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by disulfide bonds. Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in carbohydrate metabolism effects) from human insulin because of these variations. Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{effects of}} these {{guidelines}} are still being felt through the biotechnology industry and {{the participation of the}} general public in scientific discourse. Due to potential safety hazards, scientists worldwide had halted experiments using <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology,</b> which entailed combining DNAs from different organisms.

25|$|Eli Lilly and Company {{developed}} and marketed the first rapid-acting insulin analogue (insulin lispro rDNA) Humalog. It was engineered through <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology</b> {{so that the}} penultimate lysine and proline residues on the C-terminal end of the B-chain were reversed. This modification did not alter the insulin receptor binding, but blocked the formation of insulin dimers and hexamers. This allowed larger amounts of active monomeric insulin to be available for postprandial (after meal) injections.|$|E
25|$|GH {{deficiency}} {{is treated}} by replacing GH with daily injections {{under the skin}} or into muscle. Until 1985, growth hormone for treatment was obtained by extraction from human pituitary glands collected at autopsy. Since 1985, recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) is a recombinant form of human GH produced by genetically engineered bacteria, manufactured by <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology.</b> In both children and adults, costs of treatment in terms of money, effort, and the impact on day-to-day life, are substantial.|$|E
25|$|Considered a very {{versatile}} {{host for}} the production of heterologous proteins, researchers can introduce genes into the microbes using plasmids, allowing for the mass production of proteins in industrial fermentation processes. Genetic systems have also been developed which allow the production of recombinant proteins using E. coli.

40|$|AbstractRecombinant <b>DNA</b> <b>technology,</b> {{which is}} based on the {{assembly}} of DNA fragments, forms the backbone of biological and biomedical research. Here we demonstrate that a uniform shear flow can induce and control the assembly of λ-phage DNA molecules: increasing shear rates form integral DNA multimers of increasing molecular weight. Spontaneous assembly and grouping of end-blunted λ-phage DNA molecules are negligible. It is suggested that shear-induced DNA assembly is caused by increasing the probability of contact between molecules and by stretching the molecules, which exposes the cohesive ends of the otherwise undeformed λ-phage DNA molecules. We apply this principle to enhance the kinetics and extent of DNA concatenation in the presence of ligase. This novel approach to controlled DNA assembly could form the basis for improved approaches to gene-chip and <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies</b> and provide new insight into the rheology of associating polymers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Like natural viruses, manmade protein cages {{for drug}} {{delivery}} {{are to be}} ideally formed by repetitive subunits with self-assembling properties, mimicking viral functions and molecular organization. Naturally formed nanostructures (such as viruses, flagella or simpler protein oligomers) can be engineered to acquire specific traits of interest in biomedicine, for instance through the addition of cell targeting agents for desired biodistribution and specific delivery of associated drugs. However, fully artificial constructs would be highly desirable regarding finest tuning and adaptation to precise therapeutic purposes.

25|$|The names {{somatotropin}} (STH) or {{somatotropic hormone}} {{refer to the}} growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses. Hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hGH. The main growth hormone produced by <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technology</b> has the approved generic name somatropin (INN) and the brand name Humatrope, and is properly abbreviated rhGH in the scientific literature.

25|$|Growth hormone {{treatment}} {{refers to}} the use of growth hormone (GH) as a prescription medication—it is one form of hormone therapy. Growth hormone is a peptide hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates growth and cell reproduction. In the past, growth hormone was extracted from human pituitary glands.

25|$|Initially, murine {{antibodies}} {{were obtained}} by hybridoma technology, for which Jerne, Köhler and Milstein received a Nobel prize. However the dissimilarity between murine and human immune systems led to the clinical failure of these antibodies, except in some specific circumstances. Major problems associated with murine antibodies included reduced stimulation of cytotoxicity and the formation complexes after repeated administration, which resulted in mild allergic reactions and sometimes anaphylactic shock.

50|$|In the Biochemistry of Foods, Peter Eck {{explains}} <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies</b> in food. Pages 543-545 {{explain the}} use of glycerophospholipid cholesterol acyltransferase and the reaction products which are lysophospholipids. He states that “the enzyme preparation is used in egg yolk and whole eggs, in processed meats, in degumming of vegetable oils, in milk products such as cheese, and in bakery products containing eggs, such as cake products.” Then he lists each one and that in milk, the enzyme produces lysophospholipids from the phospholipids. He further explains that the enzyme preparation converts phospholipids to lysophospholipids {{in each of the}} above areas. Lysophosphatidylcholine is a lysophospholipid. This is significant and shows that there are unnaturally high amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine in enzyme-modified foods.|$|R

40|$|The {{convergence}} of three research pathways {{has led to}} the development of anew class of biological agents that can successfully treat chronic disease, including aggressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Basic studies on the pathogenesis of RA identified tumor necrosis factor– (TNF) as the central mediator of the chronic inflammation that results in joint swelling, degradation, and loss of function. Parallel development of monoclonal antibody (MAb) and <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technologies</b> has enabled the design and production of several potent biologics that can specifically block the deleterious effects of TNF.
