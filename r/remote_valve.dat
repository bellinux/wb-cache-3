We have previously described the instrument, which automates fluidic control via <b>remote</b> <b>valve</b> switching and detects fluorescence from reacted substrate, for use in a molecular diagnostics application. The ELISA chip reported here utilizes a high surface area bead bed to enhance capture efficiency and increase the dynamic range of the assay as compared to a standard plate-based ELISA.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a fully {{integrated}} lab-on-a-chip and associated instrument {{for the detection of}} bacteria from liquid samples. The system conducts bacterial lysis, nucleic acid isolation and concentration, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and end-point fluorescent detection. To enable truly low-cost manufacture of the single-use disposable chip, we designed the plastic chip in a planar format without any active components to be amenable to injection molding and utilized a novel porous polymer monolith (PPM) embedded with silica that has been shown to lyse bacteria and isolate the nucleic acids from clinical samples (M. D. Kulinski, M. Mahalanabis, S. Gillers, J. Y. Zhang, S. Singh and C. M. Klapperich, Biomed. Microdevices, 2009, 11, 671 - 678). (1) The chip is made of Zeonex (R), a thermoplastic with a high melting temperature to allow PCR, good UV transmissibility for UV-curing of the PPM, and low auto-fluorescence for fluorescence detection of the amplicon. We have built a prototype instrument to automate control of the fluids, temperature cycling, and optical detection with the capability of accommodating various chip designs. To enable fluid control without including valves or pumps on the chip, we utilized a <b>remote</b> <b>valve</b> switching technique. To allow fluid flow rate changes on the valveless chip, we incorporated speed changing fluid reservoirs. The PCR thermal cycling was achieved with a ceramic heater and air cooling, while end-point fluorescence detection was accomplished with an optical spectrometer; all integrated in the instrument. The chip seamlessly and automatically is mated to the instrument through an interface block that presses against the chip. The interface block aligns and ensures good contact of the chip to the temperature controlled region and the optics. The integrated functionality of the chip was demonstrated using Bacillus subtilis as a model bacterial target. A Taqman assay was employed on-chip to detect the isolated bacterial DNA...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{availability}} on {{the market}} of <b>remote</b> control <b>valves</b> for water distribution systems allows a more flexible implementation of the “divide and conquer” paradigm, that consists in dividing large networks into smaller district meter areas defining a water network partitioning (WNP), aiming at controlling water balance, pressure levels and water quality protection. The positioning of gate valves is carried out using optimization approaches to guarantee the network reliability that can be significantly reduced by WNP owing to the closure of several pipes by means of gate valves, decreasing topologic and energy redundancy. Anyway, starting from the optimal positioning of <b>remote</b> controlled gate <b>valves,</b> obtained with SWANP software, the paper investigates the effectiveness of dynamic control, in order to face hydraulic failure in fire estinguishment.

40|$|Corrosion, poor pipe joints or {{insufficient}} {{thrust restraint}} all cause minor leakage in water pipelines. Minor leakage {{is difficult to}} eliminate because it is small and distributed. On the other hand, aged or weakened pipes may be broken accidentally because of excessive pressure, external loads, water hammer, frost or construction excavation. This emergency leakage requires rapid attention because large volumes of water may be lost. Potential for damage to other structures due to flooding or soil (slope) failures, or risk to trafKc from flooding or icing of road surfaces is also increased. In addition, in areas of significant traffic congestion, e. g. many Asian cities, it may take one or more hours to dispatch a repair crew to the site. The proposed model {{may be used in}} conjunction with a geographical information system (GIS), a monitoring/alarm system and a <b>remote</b> control <b>valve</b> system to form an integrated leakage detection and control system which can automatically reduce water losses and risks associated with emergency leakage. The proposed model minimizes discrete leakage while satisfying mass and energy conservation constraints. Piezometric pressure heads at the leakage points are the decision variables.

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{method for}} {{the preparation of}} elastomeric magnetic films with increased magneto-responsivity is presented. Polymeric films containing aligned magnetic microchains throughout their thickness are formed upon the magnetophoretic transport and assembly of microparticles during polymer curing. The obtained films are subsequently magnetized at a high magnetic field of 3 T directed parallel to {{the orientation of the}} microchains. We prove that the combination of both alignment of the particles along a favorable direction during curing and the subsequent magnetization of the solid films induces an impressive increase of the films’ deflection. Specifically, the displacements reach few millimeters, up to 85 times higher than those of the nontreated films with the same particle concentration. Such a process can improve the performance of the magnetic films without increasing the amount of magnetic fillers and, thus, without compromising the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. The proposed method can be used for the fabrication of magnetic films suitable as components in systems in which large displacements at relatively low magnetic fields are required, such as sensors and drug delivery or microfluidic systems, especially where <b>remote</b> control of <b>valves</b> is requested to achieve appropriate flow and mixing of liquids...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Converting a {{gasoline}} engine to propane (LPG) usually results in power reduction. This can be mitigated by careful {{design of the}} injection system so the heat required for evaporation of the LPG is drawn from the intake air, so it is cooled and densified, resulting {{in an increase in}} volumetric efficiency. In this work, LPG sprays were imaged using Mie and LIF imaging techniques from {{a gasoline}} direct injection (GDI) injector, a port fuel injector and from long and short pipes connecting a <b>remote</b> LPG metering <b>valve</b> to the injection point. Images were taken in an optically accessed pressure chamber at pressures from atmospheric to 20 bar and with fuel line pressures from 10 to 80 bar. The imaging of the pipe-coupled injection system shows that there is significant evaporation in the pipe, which amount depends on the length and diameter of the pipe. During its travel down the pipe, the injected pulse of fuel spreads out so the duration of the LPG pulse at the manifold end is, for 300 mm pipes, five times the original duration at the injector and even greater for 600 mm pipes. The narrow structure of the sprays and the amount of evaporation that occurs before the fuel enters the manifold explains the observed differences in engine torque and in-cylinder mixture temperature observed with the different systems. The spray structures with gasoline and LPG from the direct injector are similar and more sensitive t...|$|R
40|$|The valve testing unit {{is a high}} {{pressure}} test equipment to test the valve manufactured in industries. Valves are tested {{to ensure that they}} sustain {{high pressure}} in the range of 10000 to 15000 PSI for the required amount of time without any leakage. It has few drawbacks such as inefficient usage of power, fatal accidents due to the proximity of the users with the testing unit to note the valve pressure during operation. It is much dangerous for the industry personnel to note the valve pressure for every minute during operation. There are chances of bolts fitted in the valve thrown away due to the issues in the bolt fittings and the immense pressure inside the valve. Therefore in order to avoid fatal accidents andto improve the industrial safety an efficient valve testing unit is designed and developed using ZigBee wireless transmission technology. The proposed efficient pressure monitoring unit uses emerging technologies like ZigBee, RFID along with ARM 7 processor. The proposed system uses LabVIEW software to develop the monitoring unit in PC. ZigBee wireless transmission technology is used for <b>remote</b> monitoring of <b>valve</b> pressure for every minute. RFID module is used for uniquely identifying the valve and to track the test results. The proposed unit saves energy by sending a signal to turn off the air driven booster pump once the prescribed pressure level is reached.
