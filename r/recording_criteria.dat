40|$|To {{examine the}} {{possibilities}} of introducing an alternative and more general recording system of road traffic accidents more than 10000 claim forms of insurance companies have been analyzed {{with regard to their}} usefulness as basic information for an integral road traffic accident recording system. The criteria by which these forms have been tested were: comprehensiveness, reliability and uniformity of data. The main conclusions are that data supplied by the insured to the insurance companies about the accident are in principle useful for examination purposes; in a number of cases their comprehensiveness and reliability are not quite satisfactory; for efficient data processing a uniform claim form is desirable; a better insight into <b>recording</b> <b>criteria</b> is necessary...|$|E

40|$|This paper tackles the {{analysis}} {{of a series of}} cases of reutilisation in Roman times of prehistoric sacred spaces and monuments, recorded throughout the South of the Iberian Peninsula. The cases under study are grouped in three main categories: (i) spatial proximity or overlapping of prehistoric and Roman burial areas, (ii) reutilisation of the inner and outer spaces of prehistoric mortuary chambers, and (iii) re-use of rock art sanctuaries and prehistoric stelae. As a conclusion, we suggest, firstly, the need to reconsider the <b>recording</b> <b>criteria</b> by which the appearance of later materials in old monuments is archaeologically assessed; secondly, we point out the need to look at these cases from the viewpoint of the elements of tradition and memory that some old sacred sites convey for the Iberian-Roman populations. Finally, we suggest these cases must be interpreted in terms of religious and political ideology...|$|E

40|$|Aims Description {{of rapid}} and slow {{ejection}} phases in the cardiac cycle. Materials and methods The theory of cardiac cycle phase analysis and mathematical equations of hemodynamics {{were used in}} the paper. The equations were employed to verify the balance of the phase-related diastolic and systolic blood volumes reliant on phase durations, and the identification of boundaries of the cardiac cycle phases on the ECG. Further, synchronous ECG & RHEO recording was used. Aortic blood filling was studied in the stated phases. Results The location of boundaries of rapid and slow ejection phases is traced. The boundaries did not have a precise definition before. Thus, a new symbol, the L point, on the ECG has been introduced to identify the boundaries of phases S-L, L-j. Conclusion Previously the location of point j on the ECG was impossible to identify. It was considered as a hypothermic wave on the ECG that could not always be traced. Point j was defined as the j (Osborn) wave. Thereby the location of boundaries of rapid and slow ejection phases, where volumetric parameters were equal to the stroke volume, was not accurately identified. The research enabled detecting the ECG <b>recording</b> <b>criteria</b> of the rapid and slow ejection phases. The results of the present research are published for the first time. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: General practice–based data, {{collected}} within {{general practice}} registration networks (GPRNs), {{are widely used}} in research. The quality of the data is important but the <b>recording</b> <b>criteria</b> about what type of information is collected and how this information should be recorded differ between GPRNs. Objective: We aim to identify aspects that describe the quality of general practice-based data in the Netherlands. Methods: To investigate the quality aspects, we used the method of concept mapping, a structured conceptualization process for a complex multi-dimensional topic. We explored the ideas of representatives from 10 Dutch GPRNs {{on the quality of}} general practice–based data in five steps: preparation, generation of statements, structuring, representation and interpretation. In a brainstorm session, 10 experts generated statements about good data quality from general practice, which we completed with information from the literature. In total, 18 experts participated in the ranking and clustering of the statements. These results were analysed using ARIADNE software, using a combination of principal component analysis and cluster analysis techniques. Finally, the clusters were labelled based on their content. Results. : A total of 72 statements were analysed, which resulted in a two-dimensional picture with six clusters, ‘complete health record’, ‘coding of information’, ‘episode oriented recording’, ‘diagnostic validity’, ‘recording agreements’ and ‘residual category’. Conclusions: The quality of general practice–based data can be considered on five content-based aspects. These aspects determine the quality of recording. (aut. ref. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the prevalence and distribution, by gender, of occlusal traits in a sample of Italian students aged 11 – 14 years (mean 13 ± 1 years). Using standardized and validated <b>recording</b> <b>criteria,</b> a single operator measured the overjet, overbite, open bite, anterior and posterior crossbites, crowding, coincidence of the upper and lower midlines, and diastema, in 810 secondary school students (53. 6 per cent males). Chi-square, t-test statistics, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95 per cent confi dence intervals (CI) were used to investigate the relationship between gender and malocclusion characteristic. Logistic regression was used to further analyse the independent association between gender and each outcome measure. Ninety-three per cent of the subjects showed at least one occlusal trait, with one or two anomalies recorded in 63 per cent of children. The prevalence of occlusal traits ranged from 1. 1 (negative overjet) to 54 per cent (upper and lower midlines not coincident). Males were more likely than females to show both an increased overbite and an increased overjet, although the latter result was not confi rmed by logistic regression (P = 0. 05). Multivariate analysis showed a negative association between overbite and misalignment of the lower incisors and lack of coincidence of the upper and lower midlines, whereas subjects with an increased overbite were more likely to have an increased overjet (all P < 0. 01). Further studies are required in order to further clarify these fi ndings and to provide accurate estimates of the orthodontic treatment need in Italian adolescents...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the historical and}} archaeological data for the consumption of herring and the gadid fishes (primarily cod, haddock, whiting, ling and hake) as stored fish cured by salting, drying and smoking. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts, in the first part the historical evidence for developing fisheries, storage methods, marketing and consumption is discussed with an evaluation of the nutritional changes to the fish as a result of storage. In part two factors affecting fish bone preservation and recovery are presented and the authors own <b>recording</b> <b>criteria.</b> A new methodology is introduced using the documented data for portions and rations from monasteries and the forces, showing herring and the gadids by volume offish eaten compared with the number of bones counted. Distribution of body parts as evidence for stored and fresh fish in the large gadids, hitherto only used to show processing is adapted for application to the data sample which largely represents consumption. In part three the 20 sites comprising the data sample are described. Portion and body part methods are applied to the herring and gadid bones from these assemblages. In the majority of sites herring predominate by number of bones, by portion cod becomes the primary fish in many cases. Evidence for stored cod, ling and hake were found by body part distribution in many assemblages. The results of this study have shown that the archaeological data when expressed as a volume of fish supports the historical evidence for cod as the prime fish among these species, both as fresh and stored. Fish assemblages transcribed into portion from bone numbers present fish as a volume of food and often relegate herring, excessively favoured by bone numbers, into a subsidiary position...|$|E
