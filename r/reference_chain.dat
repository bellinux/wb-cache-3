40|$|The {{classical}} dataflow {{approach to}} determine the set of variables that are live {{at some point in}} a program entails using an iterative algorithm across the entire program, usually with costly bitvector data structures. Methods based on sparse evaluation graphs exist, but these are solved on a per-variable basis and are also iterative. Inspired by our group's interest in sparse representations of use-def and def-use reference chains, we are investigating still another approach. In this paper, we present an algorithm for determining liveness of variables based on upwards exposed use information at control flow branch points, analogous to the collection of reaching definition information in the popular Static Single Assignment form.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the structural and conformational properties of solutions containing semiflexible polyelectrolyte chains using a self-consistent integral equation theory approach. A one-component system is considered where the polyelectrolyte chains {{interact with each}} other via a Debye-Huckel potential. Nonelectrostatic interactions among the polymers are taken into account by a self-consistently determined solvation potential. The conformational properties of the polymer chain are determined from a variational calculation with a semiflexible <b>reference</b> <b>chain.</b> The finite chain extensibility is taken into account by constraints for the bond lengths and bond angles using Lagrangian multipliers. The scaling relation for the size of an isolated semiflexible chain with respect to chain length exhibits a transition from rodlike to excluded volume type for a given Debye screening length. For flexible chains in solution, the theory provides conformational properties which are in excellent agreement with computer simulation results. The bare chain stiffness has a pronounced influence on the conformational and structural properties of the solution. In the semidilute regime a pronounced liquidlike order is obtained for flexible polyelectrolyte chains which diminishes with increasing bare persistence length. This process is accompanied by a shift of the structural peaks to smaller length scales. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{large body of}} {{knowledge}} of relational query optimization techniques can be utilized {{as a starting point}} for object-oriented query optimization the full exploitation of the object-oriented paradigm requires new, customized optimization techniques [...] not merely the assimilation of relational methods. This paper describes such an optimization strategy used in the GOM (Generic Object Model) project which combines established relational methods with new techniques designed for object models. The optimization method unites two concepts: (1) access support relations and (2) rule-based query op- limizalion. Access support relations constitute an index structure that is tailored for accessing objects along <b>reference</b> <b>chains</b> leading from one object to another via single-valued or set-valued attributes. The idea is to redundantly maintain frequently traversed <b>reference</b> <b>chains</b> separate from the object representation. The rule-based query optimizer generates for a declaratively stated query an evaluation plan that utilizes as much as possible the existing access support relations. This makes the exploitation of access support relations entirely transparent to the database user. The rule-based query optimizer is particularly amenable to incorporating search heuristics in order to prune the search space for an optimal (or near-optimal) query evaluation plan...|$|R
40|$|Building on {{the work}} of Iftimie et al., Boltzmann {{sampling}} of an approximate potential (the 'reference' system) is used to build a Markov chain in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. At the endpoints of the chain, the energy is evaluated at a higher level of approximation (the 'full' system) and a composite move encompassing all of the intervening steps is accepted {{on the basis of a}} modified Metropolis criterion. For reference system chains of sufficient length, consecutive full energies are statistically decorrelated and thus far fewer are required to build ensemble averages with a given variance. Without modifying the original algorithm, however, the maximum <b>reference</b> <b>chain</b> length is too short to decorrelate full configurations without dramatically lowering the acceptance probability of the composite move. This difficulty stems from the fact that the reference and full potentials sample different statistical distributions. By manipulating the thermodynamic variables characterizing the reference system (pressure and temperature, in this case), we maximize the average acceptance probability of composite moves, lengthening significantly the random walk between consecutive full energy evaluations. In this manner, the number of full energy evaluations needed to precisely characterize equilibrium properties is dramatically reduced. The method is applied to a model fluid, but implications for sampling high-dimensional systems with ab initio or density functional theory (DFT) potentials are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Learning about {{periodic}} and oscillatory {{systems is}} a huge step in an undergraduate’s comprehensive understanding of physics and complex systems such as solids. However, understanding how specific changes to such a system affect aspects of the entire system can be difficult. The goal {{of this study is}} to create a learning tool to see how changes to the system alter its characteristics by using a simple one-dimensional solid of length N. In order to compare how the system’s energy varied for different changes to the system, a <b>reference</b> <b>chain,</b> with on-site energy α= 0 and nearest neighbor coupling terms β=- 1, was established and its ground state energy and wave function were calculated. The allowed states and energies of the solid were studied as the on-site energies and coupling terms at one site were modified. Surface states and impurity states were observed to localize for potentials below- 1 and 0, respectively. Relationships were found between the ground-state energy and the change to the system. The deviation in energy from the energy of the reference matrix was found to be inversely proportional to the change in the chain length:; inversely proportional to the decay length d as the edge potentials were varied:; and quadratically related to the decrease in nearest-neighbor coupling p in the chain:.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} MATCHMAKER, a new synthesis {{tool that}} aims to help programmers use software frameworks by synthesizing source code needed {{to interact with the}} framework. Software engineers of today are constantly faced with the task of using or extending large software code bases. This proves to be a challenging endeavor, as object-oriented frameworks tend to grow exceedingly intricate. Functionality is spread out among numerous classes and tailoring it for a specific need requires knowledge of exact components to extend and combine. MATCHMAKER is presented to help programmers understand such complex behavior, especially, to help deal with one common task in using frameworks: connecting two classes so that they can interact with each other. Taking as input two classes that the programmer want to connect, MATCHMAKER observes many real runs of the framework, aggregates relevant execution traces in which similar connections are built by client-framework interactions, and synthesizes the necessary source code the user needs to write to make the connection possible. MATCHMAKER relies on the hypothesis that the logical connection between two objects is fulfilled by a chain of pointer references linking them together, and the earliest possible pointer <b>reference</b> <b>chain</b> (called Critical Chain) is critical to the logical connection. MATCHMAKER employs a new program behavior data engine (called DELIGHT) to find the critical chain, uses a special slicing algorithm to dig out the relevant instructions which form the client-framework protocol from the critical chain, and synthesize the client code from the slices. In this thesis we also demonstrate MATCHMAKER's capability on a range of programming tasks using complex software frameworks such as Eclipse, and evaluate MATCHMAKER's usability and its improvement to programming efficiency by comprehensive user study. by Zhilei Xu.

This process yields a set of weighted access paths. The statically extracted (syntactical) access patterns are then matched with the actual object net. Thereby the interobject <b>reference</b> <b>chains</b> that are likely being traversed in the database applications accumulate correspondingly high weights.

The general idea is to maintain redundant separate structures (disassociated from the object representation) to store object references that are frequently traversed in database queries. The proposed access support relation technique is no longer restricted to relate an object (tuple) to an atomic value (attribute value) as in conventional indexing. Rather, access support relations relate objects with each other and can span over <b>reference</b> <b>chains</b> which may contain collection-valued components in order to support queries involving path expressions.

Moreover, we are able to explore different combinations of compact and non-compact diffusion in the local and large-scale dynamics by varying the embedding dimension. Z 9...|$|R

Studies included varied widely in quality with MMAT scores ranging from 0 % to 100 %. A key finding was that perceptions of working environment varied across clinical staff and study location, but that high levels of autonomy and teamwork offset stress around high pressure and high volume workloads. The large range of tools used to assess staff perception of working environment limits the comparability of the studies.
