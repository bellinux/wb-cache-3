[...] While the LFR required a complex ground installation and only a simple AM receiver on board the aircraft, NDB ground installations were simple single-antenna transmitters requiring somewhat more complex equipment on board the aircraft. [...] The NDB's radio emission pattern was uniform in all directions in the horizontal plane. The NDB's on-board receiver was called a <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (<b>RDF).</b> [...] The NDB-RDF combination allowed pilots to determine the direction of the NDB ground station relative to the direction the airplane was pointing. [...] When used in conjunction with the on board magnetic compass, the pilot could navigate to or from the station along any chosen course radiating from the station.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{system of}} radio {{navigation}} was the <b>Radio</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder,</b> or <b>RDF.</b> [...] By tuning {{in a radio}} station and then using a directional antenna, one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna. A second measurement using another station was then taken. Using triangulation, the two directions can be plotted on a map where their intersection reveals {{the location of the}} navigator. Commercial AM radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power, but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task, especially near airports and harbours.|$|R

Due to radio's ability to travel very long distances and [...] "over the horizon", {{it makes a}} particularly good navigation system for ships, small boats, and aircraft that might be some distance from their destination. The radio direction finder is the earliest form of radio navigation. It was first patented by American physicist John Stone Stone. He filed on January 23, 1901 and was granted the patent (U.S. Patent 716,134) on December 16, 1902.|$|E

5000|$|NDBs {{have long}} been used by {{aircraft}} navigators, and previously mariners, to help obtain a fix of their geographic location {{on the surface of}} the Earth. Fixes are computed by extending lines through known navigational reference points until they intersect. For visual reference points, the angles of these lines can be determined by compass; the bearings of NDB radio signals are found using <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (<b>RDF)</b> equipment.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an original idea to detects accidents. The idea {{has been developed}} keeping in mind the considerations of cost and compatibility with existing system. The Short Message Service or SMS as it is popularly referred to the hospitals and Ambulance services. The solution offered is the Force-Transducer method in this paper. The victim {{is assumed to be}} unconscious and the accident is detected automatically by the mobile phone get the shock signal. The threshold level is set based on data collected from the experiments. One major problem in such design is the technique to find the victim’s position if the force caused very high. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is found to be costly comparing to proposed system. So, an unorthodox design using <b>Radio</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finders</b> (<b>RDF)</b> and beacon signals is described. The Goniometer or Crossed Loop Antenna is used for this purpose. This reduces cost effectively when compared with the GPS system. The paper proceeds to suggest an abstract view of the software robot required to perform the Emergency message routing task. It uses a special hierarchical message dispatch system wherein people nearby and more likely to help are contacted. The robot also acts as a proxy to the victim and monitors responses for him and it keep on monitoring is the message is false or not. The proposed system as include, it inform the local government hospital example, In TamilNadu the GH phone number is 108 and finding more than one like two or three victims at a time by using more than one antenna to detect the accident...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>direction</b> finding, <b>Radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder,</b> or <b>RDF</b> {{was once}} the primary {{aviation}} navigational aid. (Range and Direction Finding was the abbreviation {{used to describe the}} predecessor to Radar.) Beacons were used to mark [...] "airways" [...] intersections and to define departure and approach procedures. Since the signal transmitted contains no information about bearing or distance, these beacons are referred to as non-directional beacons, or NDB in the aviation world. Starting in the 1950s, these beacons were generally replaced by the VOR system, in which the bearing to the navigational aid is measured from the signal itself; therefore no specialized antenna with moving parts is required. Due to relatively low purchase, maintenance and calibration cost, NDB's are still used to mark locations of smaller aerodromes and important helicopter landing sites.|$|R
25|$|Such {{detection}} {{would not}} have helped the Americans track the Japanese fleet. A <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (DF or <b>RDF)</b> from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings.) To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target. If the target was moving, the detections must be close {{to one another in}} time. To plot the task force's course with certainty, at least four such detections must have been made in proper time-pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means. This complex set of requirements did not occur; if the Kido Butai was detected, it was not tracked.|$|R

50|$|High-frequency {{direction}} finding, usually {{known by}} its abbreviation HF/DF or nickname huff-duff, is the common name for a type of <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (<b>RDF)</b> introduced in World War II. High frequency (HF) refers to a radio band that can efficiently communicate over long distances; for example, between U-boats and their land-based headquarters. HF/DF was primarily used to catch enemy radios while they transmitted, although it was also used to locate friendly aircraft as a navigation aid. The basic technique remains in use to this day {{as one of the}} fundamental disciplines of signals intelligence, although typically incorporated into a larger suite of radio systems and radars instead of being a stand-alone system.|$|E

50|$|Receiving antennas do {{not have}} to be as {{efficient}} as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The most common receiving antenna is the ferrite loopstick antenna (also known as a ferrite rod aerial), made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, ferrite antennas are also used in portable <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (<b>RDF)</b> receivers. The ferrite rod antenna has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the rod points exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.|$|E
5000|$|During 1942, Trump became Secretary of the Microwave Committee, a {{sub-committee}} of the NDRC. The {{director of}} the Microwave Committee was Alfred Lee Loomis, the millionaire physicist, who decided to create a laboratory. He selected a site for it, chose a suitably discreet and ambiguous name for it and funded the construction, until the Federal administration was established. The new institution was the MIT Radiation Laboratory, or the [...] "Rad Lab". The British were also researching radar, which they termed <b>Radio</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder</b> (<b>RDF),</b> and had started much earlier. Their Tizard Mission to the US showed how much more sophisticated they were {{with some of the}} technologies, particularly the magnetron. The US decided to send a team to Britain to help coordinate the efforts of the two Allies. The unit was known as the [...] "British Branch of the Radiation Laboratory" [...] (BBRL) and operated as a department of Britain's Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) at Malvern, in Worcestershire. In 1943, as the technical aide in Division 14 of the NDRC, Trump reviewed and analyzed the papers of Dr. Nikola Tesla when Dr. Tesla died in a New York City hotel. The research was completed on behalf of he Alien property Custodian office in Washington DC. From February 1944 {{to the end of the}} war in Europe, Trump was the Director of the BBRL. During this time, Trump also served in the Advisory Specialist Group on Radar, advising USAAF General Carl Spaatz on navigational radar, precision-bombing radar, and also defenses against the German radars found in their night-fighters and in their flak units. The systems included: Gee, Oboe, LORAN, H2X, MEW & SCR-584. Trump worked with all the most important British radar experts, including Sir Robert Watson-Watt, A.P. Rowe and Bernard Lovell. At the end of the war, Trump also had interviews with Germany's main radar technicians. Trump received recognition for his war-work from both the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|E
