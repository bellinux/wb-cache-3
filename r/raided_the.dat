They <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> house with explosive devices and with firearms drawn. During the course of the raid, they shot and killed the Calvo family's two pet Labrador retriever dogs.|$|E
5|$|Major General Charles Grey <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts {{communities}} of New Bedford, Fairhaven, and Martha's Vineyard in September 1778 {{as part of}} British operations in the American Revolutionary War.

5|$|Again, the Swiss <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> Klettgau and the Hegau and pillaged several {{fortified}} smaller Swabian {{cities such}} as Tiengen or Stühlingen before retreating again. This whole war was characterized by many such smaller raids and plundering expeditions of both sides between a few larger battles. On the eastern front, a new Habsburg attack on the Rhine valley provoked a counterstrike of the Eidgenossen, who remained victorious {{in the battle of}} Frastanz near Feldkirch on April 20, 1499.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} blockade, the Egyptian Navy carried out several other missions. Coastal {{artillery}} at Port Said {{participated in the}} fire preparation by bombarding Fort Budapest and Fort Orkal, while coastal artillery at Suez hit targets opposite the Third Army. Missile boats bombarded Rumana and Ras Beyron on the Mediterranean, Ras Masala and Ras Sidr on the Gulf of Suez, and Sharm el Sheikh. Naval frogmen <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> oil installations at Bala'eem, disabling the massive driller.|$|E

2500|$|The 2001 film Pearl Harbor (with Alec Baldwin playing Doolittle) {{presented}} a heavily fictionalized version of <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> <b>The</b> film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier [...] in Corpus Christi, Texas, {{to stand in}} for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from the , standing in for the [...] from which <b>the</b> Doolittle <b>Raid</b> was launched. <b>The</b> film's portrayal of the planning of <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> <b>the</b> air <b>raid</b> itself, and <b>the</b> <b>raid's</b> aftermath, is not historically accurate.|$|R
5000|$|The treaty {{did little}} to end the {{conflict}} between the Navajo, the New Mexicans and recently arrived Anglos.

5|$|Having seen Saigon {{slip from}} his hands on many {{occasions}} in the previous decade, Nguyễn Ánh was keen to strengthen his hold on the key southern city, turning it into his capital, and the base for his preparations for his planned conquest of the Tây Sơn and Vietnam. His enemies had regularly <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> area and confiscated the rice harvest.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally large thefts of {{diamonds}} take place. In February 2013 armed robbers {{carried out a}} raid at Brussels Airport and escaped with gems estimated to be worth $50m (£32m; 37m euros).

5|$|On November 20, 1985, {{one week}} later, rescue efforts began to cease. Nearly 4,000relief workers and rescue team members were {{still searching for}} survivors, with little hope of finding any. By then, the {{official}} death toll was registered at 22,540people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000homeless, and 4,000injured. Looters <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and yellow fever. For most of the relief workers, their job was over.|$|E

5|$|The RPF forces held Ruhengeri {{through the}} {{afternoon}} of 23 January, before withdrawing back into the mountains for the night. The Rwandan government sent troops to the city the following day, and {{a state of emergency}} was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area. The RPF <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> city every night, fighting with the Rwandan army forces, and the country was back at war {{for the first time since}} the October invasion.|$|E
5|$|This {{plan was}} {{affected}} by {{the needs of the}} war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been stripped to a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E
5|$|After Vatondas, Negroponte {{seemed about}} to fall into Licario's hands too. The city, however, was quickly {{reinforced}} by Jacques de la Roche, lord of Argos and Nauplia, who, along with the energetic Venetian bailo, Niccolo Morosini Rosso, led its defence. Facing determined resistance and possibly fearing an intervention of John I Doukas, ruler of Thessaly, Licario was forced to raise the siege. Licario then turned to reducing the remaining Latin strongholds on the island, becoming its total master except {{for the city of}} Negroponte itself, and ruling it from the fortress of Fillia. His fleet carried out further naval expeditions: the islands of Sifnos and Serifos were taken, and Licario's ships <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnese.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the siege}} {{consumed}} {{a large part}} of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> frontier. On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the Bulgars, with whom Leo concluded a treaty that possibly included alliance against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1633, the relief force, led {{personally}} by the king and numbering about 25,000 (20,000 in the Polish-Lithuanian army, according to Jasienica), arrived near Smolensk; they reached Orsha on 17 August 1633. By {{the first days of}} September, {{the main body of the}} relief forces approaching Smolensk numbered around 14,000. The Russian army, recently reinforced, numbered 25,000. Only when Cossack reinforcements, led by Tymosz (Timofiy) Orendarenko and numbering between 10,000 and 20,000, arrived on 17 September would the Commonwealth army gain numerical superiority. The Cossacks under Orendarenko and Marcin Kazanowski <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> Russian rear lines, freeing the Polish-Lithuanian units under Radziwiłł and Gosiewski to join the effort to break the siege.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 April 1918, {{the port}} {{was the target}} of a famous <b>raid,</b> <b>the</b> Zeebrugge <b>Raid,</b> by <b>the</b> Royal Navy and Royal Marines.

The next year, Dalassenos repeated his raids against Tripoli, Rafaniya, Awgh, and al-Lakma, capturing the latter. At the same time, the inhabitants of Tyre, {{under the leadership of}} a sailor named Allaqa, rose up in revolt against the Fatimids and requested Byzantine assistance; further south, in Palestine, the Bedouin leader Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah attacked Ramlah.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Napoli and {{her three}} sisters were {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division. They spent much of the war rotating between the bases at Taranto, Brindisi, and Valona, but did not see combat. On 1415 May 1917, three light cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> Otranto Barrage; in the ensuring Battle of the Strait of Otranto, Napoli and her sisters raised steam to assist the Allied warships, but the Italian commander refused to permit them to join the battle for fear of risking their loss in the submarine-infested Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|In 836, Abu'l-Aghlab {{launched}} fresh attacks.

The Muslim fleet, under al-Fadl ibn Yaqub, <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> Aeolian Islands and seized a number of forts on the northern coast of Sicily, most notably Tyndaris.
