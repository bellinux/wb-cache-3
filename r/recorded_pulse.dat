40|$|We {{characterize}} the practical photon-counting receiver in optical scattering communication with finite sampling rate and electrical noise. In the receiver side, the detected signal {{can be characterized}} as a series of pulses generated by photon-multiplier (PMT) detector and held by the pulse-holding circuits, which are then sampled by the analog-to-digit convertor (ADC) with finite sampling rate and counted by a rising-edge pulse detector. However, the finite small pulse width incurs the dead time effect that may lead to sub-Poisson distribution on the <b>recorded</b> <b>pulses.</b> We analyze first-order and second-order moments on the number of <b>recorded</b> <b>pulses</b> with finite sampling rate at the receiver side under two cases where the sampling period is shorter than or equal to the pulse width as well as longer than the pulse width.

40|$|The Majorana Demonstrator {{searches}} for neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{ 76 }$Ge using arrays of high-purity germanium detectors. If observed, this process would demonstrate that lepton number {{is not a}} conserved quantity in nature, with implications for grand-unification and for explaining the predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe. A problematic background in such large granular detector arrays is posed by alpha particles. In the Majorana Demonstrator, events have been observed {{that are consistent with}} energy- degraded alphas originating on the passivated surface, leading to a potential background contribution in the region-of-interest for neutrinoless double-beta decay. However, it is also observed that when energy deposition occurs very close to the passivated surface, charges drift through the bulk onto that surface, and then drift along it with greatly reduced mobility.

Here, we report quantitative experimental data on the motion of a prominent component of these structures, the anterior leaf, using synchronized laser Doppler vibrometry and acoustic recordings in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). The vibrometry data has demonstrated non-random motion patterns in the anterior leaf. In these patterns, the outer rim of {{the walls of the}} anterior leaf twitches forward and inwards to decrease the aperture of the noseleaf and increase the curvature of its surfaces. Noseleaf displacements were correlated with the emitted ultrasonic pulses. After their onset, the inward displacements increased monotonically towards their maximum value which was always reached within the duration of the biosonar pulse, typically towards its end. In other words, the anterior leaf’s surfaces were moving inwards during most of the pulse. Non-random motions were not present in all <b>recorded</b> <b>pulse</b> trains, but could apparently be switched on or off. Such switches happened between sequences of consecutive pulses but were never observed between individual pulses within a sequence. The amplitudes of the emitted biosonar pulse and accompanying noseleaf movement were not correlated in the analyzed data set.

This study aims to improve the understanding of altitude illness by determining if vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{plays a role in}} the development of AMS.

Patients and Methods: This is a prospective study of a cohort of healthy climbers on Denali (Mount McKinley) in Alaska at 14, 200 feet. Baseline demographics, medications, rates of ascent, and AMS scores were <b>recorded.</b> <b>Pulse</b> oximetry measurements and venous blood samples were obtained.

Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of clonidine in brachial plexus blocks and to compare it with tramadol. Material and Methods: Ninety patients posted for upper limb orthopedic surgery were divided randomly into three groups. 40 mL of local anesthetic solution was prepared using 15 mL of 2 % lignocaine-adrenaline-sodium bicarbonate solution, 15 mL of 0. 5 % bupivacaine, and 10 mL distilled water. Patients received a supraclavicular brachial plexus block with 0. 7 mL/kg of this solution to which either 1 mg/kg tramadol, 1 μg/kg clonidine, or 1. 5 μg/kg clonidine was added. The onset and duration of sensory and motor block and the duration of postoperative analgesia were <b>recorded.</b> <b>Pulse</b> rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, saturation, sedation, and any side effect were monitored. Results were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance F-test and unpaired t-test. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in the onset of both the sensory and motor components of the block with the fastest onset seen when clonidine was used in a dose of 1. 5 μg/kg. The block also lasted statistically significantly longer with clonidine as compared with tramadol although there was no statistically significant increase in the duration of the block when a higher dose of clonidine was used. The time for rescue analgesia was the longest in patients who received 1. 5 μg/kg of clonidine (491. 8 ± 33. 9 min). This duration was also statistically significant. Patients who received tramadol reported a statistically significant higher incidence of nausea. Conclusion: Clonidine in a dose of 1. 5 μg/kg body weight provided the fastest onset of sensory as well as motor block and the longest duration of postoperative analgesia and thus is a good additive to local anesthetic solutions for brachial plexus blocks...|$|E
