[...] Saakashvili then slammed the EU’s reaction to Russia’s admission of violating Georgian airspace in July 2008. [...] "This admission by Russia was a clear sign that they were testing western reaction," [...] he stated. Saakashvili said that his first meeting with Medvedev in June 2008 in St. Petersburg was good; while at the next meeting with Medvedev in Astana in July 2008, the Russian president’s stance was changed and [...] "it was clear that they [...] were preparing for something bad." [...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, [...] "we moved one brigade [...] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [...] as well." [...] "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. [...] "When we ask our western partners: didn't you see them coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over , but it was impossible {{to see what was happening}} on the ground because it was cloudy.

Third, the reply defends certain limits on the practice of excluding religion, particularly the presumptive prohibition on singling out particular sects.
