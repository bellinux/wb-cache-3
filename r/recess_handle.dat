50|$|ATA Spec 300 {{establishes}} {{regulations that}} ensure effective packaging for supplies and equipment shipped by airlines. It stipulates, for example, that a shipping case {{be able to}} withstand a minimum of 100 shipments, have durable <b>recessed</b> <b>handles,</b> be coated with non-corrosive products, and have rounded well constructed edges. There has been an increased use of personal luggage that meets the ATA 300 required standards. The ATA Spec 300 was first published on August 1, 1960.|$|R
50|$|Some combo amp {{and speaker}} cab {{manufacturers}} sell fitted amp or cab covers, {{to protect the}} equipment from dust and inclement weather. Professional touring bassists may place their amp heads, combo amps and speaker cabinets into foam-lined road cases to protect them during transportation. Rackmounted road cases typically have <b>recessed</b> <b>handles</b> on the sides for carrying the case. Touring professional bassists may have roadies who carry their amps and cabinet on and off stage.|$|R
5000|$|Designs such as <b>recessed</b> car-door <b>handles,</b> {{reducing}} {{the chance of}} accidental operation, or simply the inconvenience of [...] "snagging" [...] the handle.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{equipment}} {{preceded the}} forthcoming Australian Design Rules, and featured front discs as standard on all models, <b>recessed</b> door <b>handles</b> and full-length side intrusion reinforcements on all doors.|$|R
25|$|The Mark IV {{brought the}} most {{comprehensive}} changes to the Spitfire. It featured a completely re-designed cut-off rear end, giving a strong family resemblance to the Triumph Stag and Triumph 2000 models, {{both of which were}} also Michelotti-designed. The front end was also cleaned up, with a new bonnet pressing losing the weld lines on top of the wings from the older models, and the doors were given <b>recessed</b> <b>handles</b> and squared-off glass in the top rear corner. The interior was much improved: a proper full-width dashboard was provided, putting the instruments ahead of the driver rather than over the centre console. This was initially black plastic however was replaced with wood in 1973.|$|R
500|$|Touring {{subwoofer}} cabinets {{are typically}} designed with features that facilitate moving the enclosure (e.g., wheels, a [...] "towel bar" [...] <b>handle</b> and <b>recessed</b> <b>handles),</b> a protective grill for the speaker (in direct radiating-style cabinets), metal or plastic {{protection for the}} cabinets to protect the finish as the cabinets are being slid {{one on top of}} another, and hardware to facilitate stacking the cabinets (e.g., interlocking corners) and for [...] "flying" [...] the cabinets from stage rigging. In the 2000s, many small-to mid-size subwoofers designed for [...] bands' live sound use and DJ applications are [...] "powered subs"; that is, they have an integrated power amplifier. These models typically have a built-in crossover. Some models have a metal-reinforced hole in which a speaker stand can be mounted for full-range cabinets.|$|R
50|$|Some large combo amps {{and large}} speaker {{cabinets}} have ball-bearing-mounted caster wheels {{to make it}} easier to move them. All combo amplifiers and speaker cabinets have some types of carry handles, either a folding handle on the top or <b>recessed</b> <b>handles</b> on the sides. There are two types of recessed handles: some equipment has folding, spring-loaded metal handles, with the spring holding the handle flush against the chassis until it is pulled out for use; the second type is handles that are non-moving, and which are flush with the surface of the amp/cab, but with a hollow area behind the handle for the hand to go. In both cases, the handle does not project out beyond the amp/cab, preventing the handle from catching on items during transportation and/or being damaged.|$|R
50|$|All Roomba {{models are}} disc-shaped, 34 cm (13") in {{diameter}} and less than 9 cm (3.5") high. A large contact-sensing mechanical bumper is mounted on the front half of the unit, with an omnidirectional infrared sensor at its top front center. A <b>recessed</b> carrying <b>handle</b> is fitted {{on the top of}} most units.|$|R
50|$|These {{cars were}} offered as an Australian {{replacement}} to the Austin 1800. Their boxy styling, {{developed for the}} car to be a proper six-seater, was all-new, but a few features, including the doors, were retained. These doors however utilised <b>recessed</b> door <b>handles,</b> to satisfy Australian Design Rules safety concerns. The body had an exceptionally stiff torsional rigidity, a trait it inherited from the 1800s.|$|R
25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front door <b>handles,</b> <b>recessed</b> rear door <b>handles,</b> and a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre licence plate holder. The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden rear door handles and prominent front door handles to give it a coupé look. The design was influenced by three historical Alfa Romeo models: the 1900, the Giulietta and the Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31.|$|R
50|$|With prototypes {{rolled out}} in September and December 1951, the SZD-8 Jaskółka (Swallow) was a {{high-performance}} glider for its day, introducing several innovations to glider design {{such as a}} sliding moulded Plexiglas canopy, <b>recessed</b> <b>handle</b> in the rear fuselage for ground handling and a semi-retractable mainwheel. The all-wood wings were covered with plywood and fabric incorporating Fowler flaps on the trailing edges, which could be lowered to 12° or 25°, and Schemp-Hirth style airbrakes aft of the mainspars. Main designer was Tadeusz Kostia. The first prototype was flown on 21 September 1951 (test pilot Adam Zientek), but it revealed faults. After reconstruction, with longer fuselage and enlarged rudder (designated SZD-8-2) it appeared successful and was ordered into production, becoming the most popular competition glider in Poland from 1953 to 1957. Many of the 135 production aircraft were exported, garnering at least fifteen world records from May 1954 to May 1960. Licensed production was also {{carried out in the}} DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik - German Democratic Republic) and the PRC (People's Republic of China). Several variants were produced which introduced various improvements and modifications.|$|R
5000|$|M1898 Rifle, {{generally}} {{much like}} M1896, {{but with a}} wide range of minor changes, including reconfiguring the bolt <b>handle</b> <b>recess</b> to simplify receiver manufacture, reversing the operation of the magazine cut-off lever, and (beginning in 1901) providing windage adjustment on the rear sight.|$|R
50|$|The Y10's most {{important}} design innovation was the vertical tail cut-off, {{characterized by the}} tailgate painted in black satin, regardless of the color chosen for the body. The notable wedge shape of the small body is very aerodynamic (CX 0.31) thanks to the hood, which is inclined towards the curved windscreen, and side windows that were mounted flush with the bodywork, {{as well as the}} absence of drip rails, the <b>recessed</b> door <b>handles</b> and roof tapering slightly toward the back.|$|R

5000|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45 cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28 mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18-20 mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.Touring subwoofer cabinets are typically designed with features that facilitate moving the enclosure (e.g., wheels, a [...] "towel bar" [...] <b>handle</b> and <b>recessed</b> <b>handles),</b> a protective grill for the speaker (in direct radiating-style cabinets), metal or plastic protection for the cabinets to protect the finish as the cabinets are being slid {{one on top of}} another, and hardware to facilitate stacking the cabinets (e.g., interlocking corners) and for [...] "flying" [...] the cabinets from stage rigging.

50|$|As before, the {{interior}} lighting uses only long-lasting, energy-saving LED technology. With 64 colours, the optionally extended ambience lighting offers {{a wealth of}} individual settings. It adds lighting highlights, for example, on the trim elements, the central display, the stowage facility {{at the front of}} the centre console, the <b>handle</b> <b>recesses,</b> the door pockets, in the front and rear footwells, on the overhead control panel, and on the tweeters when the vehicle is equipped with the Burmester® High-End 3D Surround Sound System.|$|R
40|$|Oak chest {{measuring}} 36 cm {{in height}} 45 cm in width and 32 cm in depth. The cabinet contains 5 graduating drawers and it closes with 2 hinged doors, each bearing an arch. There are <b>recessed</b> brass <b>handles</b> on the 2 {{sides of the}} cabinet and one of these handles {{on each of the}} drawers. On the top of the cabinet there is an escutcheon engraved with “S. D. Woodruff Esq., St. Catharines, 157 Ontario”. The cabinet has a lock which is still functional and opens with a skeleton key which is part of this collection. The top 2 drawers have been lined with a piece of cardboard carefully cut to size and covered with brocade. There is some scratching {{on the top of the}} cabinet and one of the front doors is missing some of the wooden trim...|$|R
5000|$|The Mini was {{modified}} during its production {{to improve its}} safety. In 1974 a prototype Mini experimental safety vehicle was built, the Mini Clubman SRV4. It featured a longer crumple zone, a [...] "pedestrian friendly" [...] front-end, run-flat tyres, strengthened door sills, extra internal padding and <b>recessed</b> door <b>handles,</b> the latter having been used earlier on Australian-built Minis owing to local laws. Jack Daniels, {{one of the original}} Issigonis team, is stated to have been working on further safety improvements for the Mini when he retired in 1977. [...] Several times it was thought that safety regulations would stop Mini production [...] Safety improved in 1996, with the introduction of airbags and side-impact bars. [...] The Mini, challenged by increasingly demanding European safety and pollution standards, was planned by British Aerospace to be taken out of production in 1996, but BMW chose to invest to keep the Mini legal until the launch of a new model.|$|R
40|$|A {{receptacle}} to hold {{a medical}} sharps device such as a scalpel (5) during a surgical procedure. The receptacle has an elongate recess (10, 12) to receive the medical sharps device, a finger access arrangement (15) to enable access to {{the handle of the}} medical device and laterally extending wings (9) on the receptacle to provide stability for the receptacle in use. A raised portion (17) in the <b>recess</b> raises the <b>handle</b> of the medical device to assist gripping it. Adhesive pads (13) may be placed under the wings. The receptacle can be disposable or be able to be sterilised...|$|R
50|$|<b>Recessed</b> ‘safety’ door <b>handles</b> also {{highlighted}} the car’s innovative aspirations, {{as did the}} advertised automatic transmission and diesel engine options. Comparisons with Citroën's large family car of the time were and remain unavoidable. In that comparison, the basic underpinnings of the 402 remained conventional, based on known technologies, and presumably were relatively inexpensive to develop and manufacture: it was Citroën that in 1934 {{had been forced to}} sell its car manufacturing business to its largest creditor. Sticking to a traditional separate chassis configuration also made it much easier for Peugeot's 402 to be offered {{with a wide range of}} different bodies.|$|R
50|$|These similar {{telephones}} {{were initially}} only loop disconnect types, when {{introduced in the}} early 1980s, but were later available in MF4 (touchtone) versions. They {{were among the first}} range of BT phones to be available for outright sale. A novel feature of these phones was that both the dialing circuit and the transmission circuit were on a single microchip. The one shown in the photograph is a 9003R manufactured in January 1984 and is loop disconnect. The Tremolo has squarer, flatter styling with a <b>handle</b> <b>recess</b> in the case, below the handset, by which it may be carried in use.|$|R
5000|$|The final major {{facelift}} for the GT6 came in 1970 in {{the form}} of the Mk III. This time the entire bodyshell was revised to match the changes made to the Spitfire Mk IV: modifications included a cut-off rear end, <b>recessed</b> door <b>handles</b> and a smoother front end. Only detail changes were made to the mechanics, but in 1973 - close to the end of the car's production life - the rear suspension was changed again, this time for the cheaper (but still effective) [...] "swing-spring" [...] layout fitted to the Spitfire Mk IV. This was a modification of the swing axle rear suspension used on the Herald-derived models, with the transverse leaf spring mounted on a pivot, eliminating roll stiffness at the rear, and thus greatly reducing the jacking effect under cornering loads. To compensate for this loss of roll stiffness, a larger front anti-roll bar was fitted. A brake servo was also added in 1973, and seats were changed from vinyl to cloth. There was still a fairly comprehensive options list, but the knock-on wire wheels were no longer available. The unladen weight increased slightly to 2030 lb.|$|R
5000|$|There are principally {{two types}} of {{overwing}} exits (excluding the full-sized door on the likes of the Boeing 747, which is not considered an overwing exit - {{referred to as a}} Type I exit) in use on modern aircraft. These disposable hatch type exit are called Type IIIA and Type IIIB exits. The first (older) type IIIA is the most common, where the operator must first remove the [...] "plug type" [...] hatch from its frame before disposing of it on the wing (or inside on the adjacent seats). The second type is the self-disposing Type IIIB hatch, found on more modern aircraft (such as the Boeing 737 Next Generation) which has been designed to both simplify the opening of the exit and to reduce the hazard of the removed hatch blocking the exit. This is accomplished by the passengers simply pulling in and down on a <b>handle</b> <b>recessed</b> into the top of the door and initiating the exit's self-opening mechanism, whereby the door rotates up and out on a hinge {{at the top of the}} exit frame.|$|R
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a <b>recessed</b> trunk pull-down <b>handle,</b> and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle {{maintains}} the British cock-on-closing feature, {{in which the}} bolt's mainspring is loaded and the rifle cocked {{as part of the}} return stroke of the bolt, which aided rapid fire, especially as the action heated up. Most bolt action designs after the Mauser 98 cocked as part of the opening stroke. The rifle has a characteristic [...] "belly" [...] due to a deeper magazine, allowing the rifle to hold six rounds of the US [...]30-06 cartridge in the magazine, and one in the chamber. The M1917 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve. In a manufacturing change from the Mauser 98 and the derivative Springfield, the bolt is not equipped with a third 'safety' lug. Instead, as on the earlier Model 1895 (Chilean) Mauser, the bolt <b>handle</b> <b>recesses</b> into a notch in the receiver, which serves as an emergency locking lug in the event of failure of the frontal locking lugs. This change saved machine time needed on the rifle bolt, cutting costs and improving production rates, and this alteration has since been adopted by many commercial bolt-action rifle designs for the same reasons.The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle is low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee-Enfield, P13 and P14, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently.The M1917 Enfield bolt locking lugs had a 4 degree helical angle with matching angles on the receiver lug seats (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The design probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The angled lugs had no tendency to unwind with chamber pressure since the [...] "angle of repose" [...] of smooth, lubricated steel surfaces is approximately 8 degrees. One advantage was that when the bolt handle was turned up was that the lugs cleared each other immediately so full effort was applied to the extraction cam. The trigger had a mechanical interlock to prevent firing unless the bolt was fully locked. The location of the safety on the right rear of the receiver has also been copied by most sporting bolt-action rifles since, as it falls easily under the firer's thumb. The trigger pull is ≥ 3 lb-f N. One notable design flaw was the leaf spring that powered the ejector, which could break off and render the ejector inoperable. A combat-expedient repair method was to slip a bit of rubber under the bolt stop spring. A redesigned ejector, incorporating a small coil spring in place of the fragile leaf spring, was developed and can be fitted to the M1917 to remedy this issue.|$|R
