5000|$|Production of the Mk VI {{began in}} 1936 {{and ended in}} 1940 with 1,682 Mark VI tanks having been built. Many of those {{produced}} were actually variants designed to solve problems found with the original design. The Mk VIA had a <b>return</b> <b>roller</b> removed {{from the top of}} the leading bogey and attached to the hull sides instead, and also possessed a faceted cupola. The Mk VIB was mechanically identical to the Mk VIA but with a few minor differences to make production simpler, including a one-piece armoured louvre over the radiator instead of a two-piece louvre, and a plain circular cupola instead of the faceted type. The Mk VIC, which was the last in the MK VI series, had the commander's cupola removed and had wider bogies and three carburettors to improve engine performance; it was also more powerfully armed than the other models, replacing the [...]303 and [...]50 Vickers machine guns with co-axial 15 mm and 7.92 mm Besa machine guns. A small number of specialized variations were also built based on the Mk VI chassis. The Tank, Light, AA Mk I was built in the aftermath of the Battle of France and was intended to act as a counter-measure against attacks by German aircraft. It featured a power-operated turret fitted with four 7.92 mm Besa machine guns; a Mk II was produced which was mechanically similar but had improvements, such as better quality sights for the machine guns and a larger turret for easier access. A variant on the Mk VIB was produced for service with the British Indian Army, in which the commander's cupola was removed and replaced with a hatch in the turret roof.|$|E

50|$|The M3 was the solution. The {{design was}} unusual because the main weapon — a larger caliber, low-velocity 75 mm gun — {{was in an}} offset sponson mounted in the hull with limited traverse. The sponson mount was {{necessary}} because, at the time, American tank plants were incapable of casting a turret {{big enough to hold}} the 75mm main gun. A small turret with a lighter, high-velocity 37 mm gun sat on top of the tall hull. A small cupola on top of the turret held a machine gun. The use of two main guns was seen on the French Char B1 and the Mark I version of the British Churchill tank. In each case, two weapons were mounted to give the tanks adequate capability in firing both anti-personnel high explosive ammunition and armor-piercing ammunition for anti-tank combat. The M3 differed slightly from this pattern having a main gun that could fire an armor-piercing projectile at a velocity high enough for efficiently piercing armor, as well as deliver a high-explosive shell that was large enough to be effective. Using a hull mounted gun, the M3 design could be produced faster than a tank featuring a turreted gun. It was understood that the M3 design was flawed, but Britain urgently needed tanks. A draw-back of the sponson mount was that the M3 could not take a hull-down position and use its 75 mm gun at the same time.The M3 was tall and roomy: the power transmission ran through the crew compartment under the turret cage to the gearbox driving the front sprockets. Steering was by differential braking, with a turning circle of 37 ft. The vertical volute-sprung suspension (VVSS) units possessed a <b>return</b> <b>roller</b> mounted directly atop the main housing of each of the six suspension units (three per side), designed as self-contained and readily replaced modular units bolted to the hull sides. The turret was power-traversed by an electro-hydraulic system {{in the form of an}} electric motor providing the pressure for the hydraulic motor. This fully rotated the turret in 15 seconds. Control was from a spade grip on the gun. The same motor provided pressure for the gun stabilizing system.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{proliferation}} of minimally invasive cardiac surgery has increased dependence on augmented venous return techniques for cardiopulmonary bypass. Such augmented techniques {{have the potential}} to introduce venous air emboli, which can pass to the patient. We examined the potential for the transmission of air emboli with different augmented venous return techniques. Methods: In vitro bypass systems with augmented venous drainage were created with either kinetically augmented or vacuum-augmented venous <b>return.</b> <b>Roller</b> or centrifugal pumps were used for arterial perfusion in combination with a hollow fiber oxygenator and a 40 -μm arterial filter. Air was introduced into the venous line via an open 25 -gauge needle. Test conditions involved varying the amount of negative venous pressure, the augmented venous return technique, and the arterial pump type. Measurements were recorded at the following sites: pre-arterial pump, post-arterial pump, post-oxygenator, and patient side. Results: Kinetically augmented venous return quickly filled the centrifugal venous pump with macrobubbles requiring continuous manual clearing; a steady state to test for air embolism could not be achieved. Vacuum-augmented venous return handled the air leakage satisfactorily and microbubbles per minute were measured. Higher vacuum pressures resulted in delivery of significantly more microbubbles to the “patient” (P <. 001). The use of an arterial centrifugal pump was associated with fewer microbubbles (P =. 02). Conclusions: Some augmented venous return configurations permit a significant quantity of microbubbles to reach the patient despite filtration. A centrifugal pump has air-handling disadvantages when used for kinetic venous drainage, but when used as an arterial pump in combination with vacuum-assisted venous drainage it aids in clearing air emboli.

40|$|Toolbox {{training}} {{is often described}} as short, informal training conducted at a worksite by technically competent persons for the benefit of a work team. The key feature of toolbox {{training is}} the focus on a work team and what is important to that group in its workplace. Toolbox training conducted by peers can connect miners and establish the feeling that the hazard is a real threat to them. This feeling can bridge the gap between delivery of a safety message and behavioral changes that can prevent an accident. Toolbox training is a popular form of "maintenance" training that should not be used to teach a new skill. The 10 - or 15 -minute toolbox session is simply too short a time to teach or learn a new skill and test for skill development. However, the toolbox format is an excellent way to inform workers of changes in workplace rules, conditions, or hazards by bringing the discussion of change {{to the level of the}} work group and suggesting how a change will affect the way workers perform their jobs. Toolbox training should be structured to address a very specific hazard. That is, the hazard source should be identified and the effect of the hazard on the worker described. The temptation to discuss a safety subject in broad terms will result in an equally vague result. For instance, discussing "equipment guards" is inappropriate for a 15 -minute training session. There simply is not enough time to cover all the hazards and their remedies. A more appropriate topic would be "placing guards on a conveyor return roller" or "hazards of cleaning a conveyor <b>return</b> <b>roller.</b> " Each topic is concise enough to allow the trainer time to define a particular threat to the safety of miners and discuss ways to defend against that threat. The clearest way to a safe workplace is to identify hazards methodically and eliminate them. This cannot be done with sweeping, generalized training. Some best practices that will protect a worker from the hazard should be presented, and the hazard should be located at the specific worksite. Toolbox training is an opportunity for the work team to participate in learning and share experiences and knowledge, often through storytelling. Storytelling is an ancient form of passing along information in an entertaining way. It is entertaining because it draws the listener in with imagination and creativity. Stories told within work groups are a way for miners to exchange experiences in which they made mistakes that resulted in an accident or a near-miss and learned a valuable lesson. Thus, co-workers can learn from others without the pain or fear that accompanied the storyteller's learning path. To encourage these shared experiences, the people in the group must be comfortable with one another. Participation doesn't stop with listening to a near-miss story or informing the group of an unsafe work practice. Participation by sharing experiences, knowledge, and skills should lead toward action in changing the unsafe tool, practice, or machine (Wallerstein, 1992). This power to change is called empowerment. Empowered workers use toolbox training sessions to discuss a problem; direct their own knowledge, experience, and talents in the context of their work environment to solve the problem; and put into practice what they have learned by sharing (Baker, 1992). A worker is much more likely to implement changes they have contributed to creating than changes forced upon them. Toolbox training functions best when the group size is small (under 20) and composed of workers with similar job functions. While combining all workers on a shift or multiple shifts may be convenient, the level of participation will drop dramatically as group size increases and participants are less connected. Similarly, when the work group participants are from different job functions, keeping the materials relevant to the individual becomes more difficult. The role of management in the toolbox training system is to communicate among various groups so...|$|E
