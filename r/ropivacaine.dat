25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, <b>ropivacaine,</b> and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and <b>ropivacaine</b> are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, <b>ropivacaine,</b> bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac {{toxicity}} {{associated with}} overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic {{is characterized by}} hypotension, atrioventricular conduction delay, idioventricular rhythms, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period, bupivacaine avidly blocks the cardiac sodium channels, thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias. Even levobupivacaine and <b>ropivacaine</b> (single-enantiomer derivatives), developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects, still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery.

50|$|Choice of agentsA person {{receiving}} an epidural for pain relief may receive local anaesthetic, an opioid, or both. Common local anaesthetics include lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, <b>ropivacaine,</b> and chloroprocaine. Common opioids include hydromorphone, morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil, and pethidine (known as meperidine in the United States). These are injected in relatively small doses, compared {{to when they}} are injected intravenously. Other agents such as clonidine or ketamine are also sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|Delivery of an opioid such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, sufentanyl or {{meperidine}} {{directly into}} the subarachnoid cavity (the space between the spinal cord's inner, waterproof sheath and its outer protective sheaths) provides enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects, and has reduced the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. The anxiolytic clonidine, or the nonopioid analgesic ziconotide, and local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, <b>ropivacaine</b> or tetracaine may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
50|$|Like lidocaine, {{bupivacaine}} is an amino-amide anesthetic; the aromatic {{head and}} the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an amide bond rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics. As a result, the amino-amide anesthetics are more stable {{and less likely to}} cause allergic reactions. Unlike lidocaine, the terminal amino portion of bupivacaine (as well as mepivacaine, <b>ropivacaine,</b> and levobupivacaine) is contained within a piperidine ring; these agents are known as pipecholyl xylidines.|$|E
50|$|A {{mixture of}} short and long-acting local anesthetics {{is used to}} prolong the {{duration}} as well as reduce {{the onset of the}} nerve block. Lidocaine is an appropriate short-acting local anesthetic and drugs such as levobupivacaine or <b>ropivacaine</b> are appropriate long-acting local anesthetics. The amount of drugs needed for a patient during shoulder replacement can range from 30 to 50 ml and is calculated based on the patient's characteristics as well as the specific anesthetic technique used.|$|E
50|$|Systemic {{exposure}} to excessive quantities of <b>ropivacaine</b> mainly result in {{central nervous system}} (CNS) and cardiovascular effects - CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. CNS effects may include CNS excitation (nervousness, tingling around the mouth, tinnitus, tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, seizures followed by depression (drowsiness, loss of consciousness), respiratory depression and apnea). Cardiovascular effects include hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and/or cardiac arrest - {{some of which may}} be due to hypoxemia secondary to respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery.

A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the plexus, so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it.|$|E
50|$|A local {{anesthetic}} is a {{drug that}} causes reversible local anesthesia {{and a loss of}} nociception. When it is used on specific nerve pathways (nerve block), effects such as analgesia (loss of pain sensation) and paralysis (loss of muscle power) can be achieved. Clinical local anesthetics belong to one of two classes: aminoamide and aminoester local anesthetics. Synthetic local anesthetics are structurally related to cocaine. They differ from cocaine mainly in that they have no abuse potential and do not act on the sympathoadrenergic system, i.e. they do not produce hypertension or local vasoconstriction, with the exception of <b>Ropivacaine</b> and Mepivacaine that do produce weak vasoconstriction.|$|E
50|$|Bupivacaine (Marcaine) is {{the local}} {{anaesthetic}} most commonly used, although lidocaine (lignocaine), tetracaine, procaine, <b>ropivacaine,</b> levobupivicaine, prilocaine and cinchocaine may also be used. Commonly opioids are added to improve the block and provide post-operative pain relief, examples include morphine, fentanyl, diamorphine or buprenorphine. Non-opioids like clonidine may also be added to prolong the duration of analgesia (although Clonidine may cause hypotension). In the United Kingdom, since 2004 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section is supplemented with intrathecal diamorphine and this combination is now the modal form of anaesthesia for this indication in that country. The peculiar legal status of diamorphine (heroin) means that this cannot easily occur elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} pharmacology and toxicology of <b>ropivacaine.</b> To {{assess the}} clinical efficacy of <b>ropivacaine</b> when used for postoperative epidural analgesia {{and to provide}} recommendations for clinical practice. DATA SOURCES: Search in the Medline data base of original articles in French and English published since 1995, using the following key words: <b>ropivacaine,</b> postoperative analgesia, epidural, caudal block. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective randomised studies in adults and children were selected. Letters to editors and editorials were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles have been analyzed: to determine the dose of <b>ropivacaine</b> required for postoperative epidural analgesia, to assess the benefits of combination of epidural <b>ropivacaine</b> and additives (opioids or other), to compare epidural <b>ropivacaine</b> and bupivacaine and to assess the use of <b>ropivacaine</b> via caudal route for paediatric postoperative analgesia. DATA SYNTHESIS: 20 mg h- 1 of <b>ropivacaine</b> is required to provide effective analgesia. This dose produces a motor block in {{a significant number of}} patients. Combination with an opioid allows for a reduction in <b>ropivacaine</b> requirement and subsequently in the incidence of motor blockade. In adults, equipotency ratio of <b>ropivacaine</b> and bupivacaine varies between 1. 5 / 1 and 1 / 1 depending upon the concentration used. At equipotent doses, early postoperative mobilisation is facilitated with <b>ropivacaine.</b> In case of paediatric caudal analgesia, this ratio is close to 1. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural <b>ropivacaine</b> combined with opioid provide good postoperative pain relief.

After insertion of a femoral catheter, 21 patients in the Ropivacaine-Epinephrine (ROPI-EPI) group received 20 mL <b>ropivacaine</b> 0. 5 % plus epinephrine 1 : 200, 000, whereas 20 patients in the <b>Ropivacaine</b> group (ROPI) received 20 mL plain <b>ropivacaine</b> 0. 5 %. Thereafter, a sciatic block with 30 mL bupivacaine 0. 5 % plus epinephrine 1 : 200, 000 was performed in all patients, followed by general anesthesia. After surgery, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with <b>ropivacaine</b> 0. 2 % plus epinephrine 1 : 200, 000 for Group ROPI-EPI and plain <b>ropivacaine</b> 0. 2 % for Group ROPI was available via the femoral catheter (200 mL <b>ropivacaine</b> 0. 2 % +/- epinephrine, bolus 20 mL, lockout 120 min). The patients were instructed to use PCA when the knee pain score was > 3 cm. The interval between the initial <b>ropivacaine</b> injection and the first PCA injection determined the duration of 20 mL <b>ropivacaine</b> 0. 5 % +/- epinephrine, whereas the interval {{between the first and}} second PCA injection determined the duration of 20 mL <b>ropivacaine</b> 0. 2 % +/- epinephrine. The average duration of <b>ropivacaine</b> 0. 5 % was 657 +/- 345 min for the ROPI-EPI group and 718 +/- 423 min for the ROPI group (NS), whereas for <b>ropivacaine</b> 0. 2 %, the average duration was 409 +/- 245 min for the ROPI-EPI group and 419 +/- 339 min for the ROPI group (not significant).

Methods: A total of 60 patients (> 75 years of age) who scheduled inguinal hernioplasty at the Shenzhen People’s Hospital from December 2013 to March 2015 were randomly assigned to three groups: 0. 25 % <b>ropivacaine</b> (n= 20), 0. 5 % <b>ropivacaine</b> (n= 20), and 0. 75 % <b>ropivacaine</b> (n= 20). Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia was performed before every surgery. Non-invasive blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before the operation, during the first 5 minutes of the surgical procedure, and 5 minutes after the operation of the patients, and compared between the groups. Incidence of adverse reactions, postoperative Visual Analog Scale score, and analgesic effect were also recorded and analyzed. Results: The surgical procedure and anesthesia was performed successfully in all patients. Patients with high-dose <b>ropivacaine</b> (0. 5 % and 0. 75 %) in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia exhibited lower arterial pressure and lower heart rate during the operation when compared to low-dose group. The interquartile range of Visual Analog Scale scores in both group C (0. 75 % <b>ropivacaine)</b> and group B (0. 5 % <b>ropivacaine)</b> were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than in group A (0. 25 % <b>ropivacaine).</b> Accordingly, the interquartile range of satisfactory scores in both group C (0. 75 % <b>ropivacaine)</b> and group B (0. 5 % <b>ropivacaine)</b> were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than in group A (0. 25 % <b>ropivacaine).</b> More cases in high-dose groups reported abnormal skin sensation; however, it did not negatively affect the satisfaction level of patients.

40|$|Objective: The authors {{hypothesized}} {{that it is}} safe to combine local infiltration analgesia (LIA) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with a retransfusion drain since <b>ropivacaine</b> concentrations would not exceed the arterial toxicity threshold concentrations of 4. 3 mg/L for total and 0. 56 mg/L for unbound <b>ropivacaine.</b> Materials and methods: 22 patients scheduled for primary TKA were included. During surgery three peri-articular injections with <b>ropivacaine</b> (300 mg) were given. Plasma and shed blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 24 hours postoperatively. Results: At 6 hours postoperatively, the total <b>ropivacaine</b> plasma concentration ranged from 0. 26 to 1. 53 mg/L and unbound <b>ropivacaine</b> from 0. 03 to 0. 12 mg/L. At 7 hours, the total <b>ropivacaine</b> plasma concentration ranged from 0. 19 to 1. 71 mg/L and unbound <b>ropivacaine</b> from 0. 02 to 0. 09 mg/L. In the collected shed blood, a total of 0. 27 to 12. 8 mg (median 3. 73 mg) unbound <b>ropivacaine</b> was present. Reinfusion would lead to an addition of 3. 73 mg (median) unbound <b>ropivacaine</b> that would be reinfused into the patient. The calculated (modeled) estimation regarding the maximum unbound <b>ropivacaine</b> plasma concentration showed a median value of 0. 114 mg/L (IQR: 0. 09, 0. 12 mg/L). All concentrations were well below reported toxicity thresholds. Conclusions: The combination of LIA and reinfusion presented herein are considered safe. However, differences in pain protocol lead to changes in the safety evaluation.

40|$|Background: Recently {{introduced}} <b>ropivacaine</b> is 40 % less potent than bupivacaine. <b>Ropivacaine</b> made hyperbaric by {{the addition}} of dextrose is known to provide reliable spinal anesthesia (SA). This study was designed to compare the clinical efficacy of equal doses of hyperbaric 0. 5 % <b>ropivacaine</b> with 0. 5 % bupivacaine for SA. Materials and Methods: Eighty American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I-II patients undergoing elective infraumbilical surgeries under SA were recruited and randomized to receive 3 ml of hyperbaric <b>ropivacaine</b> 5 mg/ml containing dextrose 83 mg/ml ({{by the addition}} of desired dose of 25 % dextrose) in Group R or 3 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg/ml containing dextrose 80 mg/ml in Group B. Monitoring of vitals and observation for the block parameters were carried out. The data were presented as mean with a standard deviation and frequency with percentage. Statistical analysis was performed using InStat computer software with appropriate tests and P < 0. 05 was considered to be significant. Results: <b>Ropivacaine</b> produced a slower onset of sensory block (<b>ropivacaine</b> 4. 5 min; bupivacaine 3. 2 min; P < 0. 05) and the mean total duration of sensory block was significantly lesser (<b>ropivacaine</b> 155 min; bupivacaine 190. 5 min; P < 0. 05).

They indicated that the plasma concentration of <b>ropivacaine</b> after 70  min was 1.88  μg/mL. Huet et al. [7] reported that the plasma concentration of <b>ropivacaine</b> 55  min after cardiac arrest associated with lumbar plexus block was 5.61  μg/mL. In addition, Gnaho et al. [8] indicated that the plasma concentration of <b>ropivacaine</b> 15  min after ventricular fibrillation associated with sciatic nerve block was 2.48  μg/mL. Thus, the plasma concentration of <b>ropivacaine</b> reportedly ranged from 1.88 to 5.61  μg/mL although the interval from cardiac arrest until blood collection varied. Agarwal [9] and McCloskey [10] reported several cases of bupivacaine systemic toxicity secondary to continuous infusion (caudal epidural and intrapleural) in children. The blood levels at the time of seizures (four cases, 3 to 9 -years-old) ranged from 5.4 to 10.2 μg/mL. The blood levels in one 3.89  kg-neonate with the initial episode of ventricular tachycardia was 5.6  μg/mL. Although they have reported bupivacaine toxicity, higher plasma concentrations of <b>ropivacaine</b> may be necessary to induce systemic toxicity because plasma concentration of <b>ropivacaine</b> was higher than that of bupivacaine when the symptoms were elicited [5]. In our case, the plasma concentration of <b>ropivacaine</b> was 5.2  μg/mL. As the blood was collected 6  min after cardiac arrest, the concentration at the time of cardiac arrest may have been higher. Therefore, our patient may also have had a high enough blood <b>ropivacaine</b> concentration to cause cardiac arrest.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ropivacaine</b> {{is a local}} {{anesthetic}} {{widely used}} for regional anesthesia and epidural analge-sia, but its relatively short duration limits its clinical use. A novel sustained release lipid for-mulation of <b>ropivacaine</b> has been recently developed to prolong its duration. We examined the epidural anti-hypersensitivity and preemptive effects of <b>ropivacaine</b> in mesylate injection and sustained release suspension forms in a rat model of neuropathy produced by peripher-al nerve injury. Epidural administration of <b>ropivacaine</b> mesylate injection specifically blocked mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia by approximately 50 % with a biological half-effective duration of approximately 3 hrs. The equivalent dose of <b>ropivacaine</b> free-base in sustained release suspension significantly prolonged the duration of anti-allodynia and anti-hyperalgesia by approximately 2 times. Multiple daily epidural injections of <b>ropivacaine</b> in both the mesylate injection and sustained-release suspension forms did not induce toler-ance or potentiation to anti-allodynia or anti-hyperalgesia. Moreover, the single or multiple daily administration of <b>ropivacaine</b> mesylate injection before surgery in particular, markedly blocked the initiation and development of neuropathic pain, increasing the biological half...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} 6 buffalo calves of 6 - 12 months of age to study haematological changes after epidural administration of <b>Ropivacaine</b> as an epidural analgesia. <b>Ropivacaine</b> {{was found to have}} no clinically relevant effects on respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and hepatic parameters. <b>Ropivacaine</b> did not show any adverse clinical effect on the physiological parameters. From the present study, it was concluded that it can be used an effective epidural analgesic in physiologically impaired animals.
