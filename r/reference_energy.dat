40|$|OBJECTIVE:To compare serving sizes {{reported}} on processed food labels with reference serving sizes according to nutrition labeling legislation and the "Food Guide for the Brazilian Population". METHODS:This cross-sectional study analyzed the labels of 2, 072 processed foods {{in a supermarket}} of Florianópolis, Santa Caratina, Brazil. The foods were classified according to the Brazilian food labeling legislation. Central tendency and variability values were calculated for the serving sizes and energy values {{reported on}} the labels, {{as well as the}} ratio between the reported and <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> value. The Spearman correlation test was performed between the reference serving size and the <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> density, and also between the reference serving size and energy density of each study food. RESULTS:Nutrition labeling and the Food Guide presented reference servings with different sizes and energy values. The serving sizes reported on the labels did not follow either of the references and presented heterogeneous values, with a maximum range of 55 - 240 g among ready and semi-ready pre-prepared dishes. The reported energy values were between 0. 1 times smaller and 2. 4 times larger than the reference values. The reference serving sizes presented a highly inverse correlation with the <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> density (Spearman coefficient= 0. 9) and a very low inverse correlation with the energy density of the foods analyzed (Spearman coefficient= 0. 2). CONCLUSION:This study showed the need for standardizing reference serving size information for the Brazilian population as well as reviewing nutrition labeling legislation in order to standardize the serving sizes reported on labels and to update the <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> density used to calculate serving sizes...|$|E

What we do know is the difference between two given energies. We resolve this problem by finding a <b>reference</b> <b>energy</b> and then finding another energy by examining the data, relative to the <b>reference</b> <b>energy.</b> From the difference between them we can approximate the energy distribution for a given energy, and since we know the energy threshold of the reaction (E_threshold for 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be is about 1880. 4 - 1880. 8 (keV)) we can calibrate the beam energy. We then determine the energy which produce the maximum yield derivative as the reference and record the energy whose neutron yield is 5 % of the <b>reference</b> <b>energy.</b> The data is collected by simulating this reaction using SimLit. Since this is a simulation we know the real energy distribution so we make a linear fit for energy distribution as function of energy difference.

40|$|Highly {{accurate}} (extrapolated CCSD(T) /aug-cc-pwCVQZ) <b>reference</b> <b>energies</b> {{have been}} calculated for olefin insertion {{in a set}} of simple models for olefin polymerization catalysts, and also for related reactions (hydrogen transfer to metal and to monomer, allyl formation). The model systems cover early (groups 3 and 4, 10 basic systems, 216 geometries) and late (group 10, 3 basic systems, 51 geometries) transition metals. The <b>reference</b> <b>energies</b> were then used to evaluate the performance of 22 commonly used density functionals, as well as several ab-initio methods. Dispersion corrections (either implicit or explicit) are essential in getting the olefin complexation energy right, but are less important for describing further reactions from the olefin pi-complex stage on. No functional performs entirely satisfactorily (within similar to 1 kcal/mol) for both early and late transition metals. Of the functionals tested, TPSSh-D 0 shows the best "across-the-board" performance (important if chemistry involving more than a single metal needs to be described e. g. chain shuttling, bimetallic complexes, bifunctional systems), but M 06 - 2 X performs somewhat better specifically for early transition metals. A subsequent benchmark on 21 experimentally known pi-coordination enthalpies and barrier heights for early, middle and late TM systems yielded an MAD of 0. 60 kcal/mol using our recommended protocol. Finally, we revisited prototypical catalysts systems studied in early computational work, and conclude that insertion of ethene is nearly barrierless for titanocenes, and has a slightly higher barrier for constrained-geometry catalysts and for Zr analogs.
