A general CB1 inverse agonist pharmacophore model can be extracted from the common features of these analogs, diarylpyrazoles (Figure 4). This pharmacophore contains a cyclic core, C, (e.g. pyrazole in rimonabant) substituted by two aromatic moieties, A and B. A hydrogen bond acceptor unit, D, connects C with a cyclic lipophilic part, E. In some cases unit E directly connects to C. In Figure 4 rimonabant is used as an example.

One {{objective of this}} study was to synthesize a series of heteroarotinoids structurally related to SHetA 2 and to measure the effect of structural alterations on the cytotoxicity activities of the compounds on A 2780 ovarian cancer cells. Alterations included comparisons of activity of an NO 2 end group versus a CO 2 Et end group, a thiourea linker versus a urea linker, and a distorted, thiochroman <b>ring</b> <b>unit</b> versus a planar quinoline <b>ring</b> <b>unit.</b> Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated the thiourea linker compounds to be similar in potency to the urea linker counterparts, the NO 2 substitutions were slightly more potent than the CO 2 Et substitutions, and replacement of the thiochroman group with a planar quinoline fused ring system markedly reduced activity. The mechanism of cytotoxicity through apoptosis was confirmed for the compounds. The optimal combination of structural features for enhancing potency consisted of a urea linker, a NO 2 substitution, and a flexible thiochroman unit.

50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse <b>unit</b> <b>ring</b> gear was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear <b>unit</b> <b>ring</b> gear to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear <b>unit</b> <b>ring</b> gear band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear <b>unit</b> <b>ring</b> gear had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear <b>unit</b> <b>ring</b> gear with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse <b>unit</b> <b>ring</b> gear were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn.
