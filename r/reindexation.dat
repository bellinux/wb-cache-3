40|$|Most parallelization {{techniques}} for DO loop nests {{are based on}} <b>reindexation.</b> <b>Reindexation</b> yields a new iteration space, which is a convex integer polyhedron defined {{by a set of}} affine constraints. Parallel code generation needs thus to scan all the integer points of this convex, thereby requiring {{the construction of a new}} DO loop nest. We detail an algorithm for this purpose, which relies on a parametrized version of the Dual Simplex. We show how the resulting loop nest and especially the loop bounds can be kept simple and streamlined, so as not to reduce the benefits of parallelization. Keywords: automatic parallelization, convex integer polyhedron, code generation.

40|$|Reanalysis in {{language}} comprehension provides {{a window on}} how superficially similar processes of conflict resolution may differ {{depending on the context}} in which they are initiated. Thus, previous ERP studies have shown that reanalyses towards object-initial orders in German sentences with dative-active verbs (e. g., folgen, ‘to follow’) engender N 400 effects, while reanalyses with accusative verbs (e. g., besuchen, ‘to visit’) elicit P 600 effects. This difference appears surprising since these two verb classes are both associated with a subject-initial base order. The present paper reports two ERP experiments designed to shed further light {{on the nature of the}} conflict resolution processes involved in each case by examining structures in which word order disambiguation is separated from verb class disambiguation. Experiment 1 contrasted dative-active verbs with accusative verbs, while Experiment 2 compared dative-active and dative object-experiencer verbs (which are associated with an object-initial base order). Our results show that the reanalysis pattern for dative-active constructions is context-dependent: when verb class disambiguation precedes word order disambiguation, an N 400 –P 600 pattern results. By contrast, the reanalysis patterns for the other two verb types are context independent: object-experiencer verbs invariably show an N 400 and accusative verbs invariably show a P 600. We argue that (a) the N 400 is a general marker of reanalysis in dative sentences, reflecting an argument <b>reindexation,</b> while (b) the P 600 in accusative sentences reflects a structural recomputation. The variable pattern for dative-active sentences reflects the (in) applicability of “good-enough” representations during conflict resolution in garden path sentences...|$|E

We tried to answer to two main questions : (i) " What are the reasonsfor which the respondent has joined the Club nanometrology ?, (ii) " What specifically are you awaitingfrom such a collaborative structure ? ". At the end of the processing and analysis of the questionnaireconcerned a hundred respondents. These results highlight the need for a Community Management activity. The advantage of this practiceenhances proactive actors [Lambert and Sidhom, 10] and their cohesion for the emergence of new offersnano ventures. Following this study, we focused on the analysis summarized a bibliographic corpus spintronics. Thisextraction has shed light on the evolution of the field. Which technologies are more persistant than others? Is there often emergence of new technologies ? Can we measure the stability of the domain in a givenperiod ?For this purpose, a domain ontology of spintronics was specifically created. Thus, over forty conceptswere interconnected with basic relations (IsA, belongsTo, etc.). This ontology was then implementedinto a NooJ dictionary. Besides the nature of the word each entry of this new dictionary, we add severalontological labels permitting us to tag texts with concepts. The output allows to ensure : (i) <b>reindexation</b> content and (ii) data visualization to detect the mostfrequent topic used in the corpus. For this first step, relations have not been treated in this work which focused only on the detection ofconcepts of spintronics. This approach could open more widely on the different fields of nanotechnology to highlight which areasof nanoscience and nanotechnology are the most promising for innovation and transferability...|$|E
40|$|Outlines the {{potential}} impact of the fuel excise on the environment and on lower income Australians. Summary Treasury anticipates that the <b>reindexation</b> of the fuel excise will collect $ 2. 2 billion over the forward estimates. From 2001 when the excise was deindexed from inflation by the Howard Government to today, the budget has lost more than $ 46 billion in tax revenue. If the excise is not reindexed by 2025, more than $ 160 billion will be lost. To put this figure into context, the full suite of Gonski education reform recommendations were estimated to cost the budget $ 5 billion per year. For the year ending June 2014, the cost to the budget in foregone revenue from the frozen indexation of the fuel excise was $ 6. 3 billion, a figure that increases in value every year. By not indexing the fuel excise to inflation, petrol is cheaper today than it would otherwise be. This, by extension, means that driving is cheaper - people drive more and invest less in fuel-efficient vehicles. Since the excise was de-indexed, the falling cost of driving has resulted in 22. 6 billion more kilometres of driving. If the excise is not re-indexed by 2025, more than 54 billion additional kilometres will have been driven, resulting in an additional 16. 1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and impacts on urban air quality and human health. The fuel excise is regressive - the poor households spend a greater proportion of their income on fuel (3. 1 per cent) than wealthy households do (1. 7 per cent). Although regressive, the vast bulk of the excise is paid by higher income earners. If the index freeze is maintained until 2025, it will save the highest income earners $ 48 billion but save only $ 15 billion for the lowest income earners. The index freeze reduces government revenue which could easily be diverted to offset its regressive nature. Some opposition to the change is based on its link to road funding. However, the change will account for only three per cent of proposed infrastructure funding and road projects are likely to proceed with or without the change. The excise has a minor impact on road funding, but is a significant contributor to overall government revenue...|$|E
