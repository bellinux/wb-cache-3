MinE is also known to form a ring near each pole. The purpose of this ring structure is to catalyze the release of membrane-bound MinD in turn, imparting <b>regional</b> <b>specificity</b> of Min protein localization.|$|E

Adaptations into other dialects were made by Charles Letellier (Mons, 1842) and Charles Wérotte (Namur, 1844); much later, Léon Bernus published some hundred imitations of La Fontaine in the dialect of Charleroi (1872); he was followed during the 1880s by , writing in the Borinage dialect under the pen-name Bosquètia.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} {{to the study of the}} evolution of economic institutions in the resource-producing region, to the investigation of their specificity and institutional traps. As the initial data, the legal framework, the experience of the functioning of economic institutions and statistical data were used. The subject matter of the research is the influence of <b>regional</b> <b>specificity</b> on the evolution of economic institutions. The research topic is the analysis of the evolution, specificity and institutional traps of the economic institutions of the resource-producing region on the example of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug—Yugra. The purpose of the research is to identify the relationship between the <b>regional</b> <b>specificity</b> and the direction of the evolution of economic institutions. The hypothesis of the study is that the <b>regional</b> <b>specificity</b> has an impact on the evolution of economic institutions and contributes to the formation of institutional traps. The framework methodology of the work is a comparative institutional analysis. As a result, the stages of the evolution of economic institutions are determined, their <b>regional</b> <b>specificity</b> and institutional traps are revealed. The scientific input is in the revealing of the specificity of institutional traps at the regional level as well as the influence of specificity on the evolution of economic institutions. The author came to the conclusion that the specificity of the region's economy affects the specificity of institutions as well as the formation of institutional traps. At the same time, some traps have a system-wide character and do not depend on the specificity of the region; this applies to the basic economic institutions. The most strongly the <b>regional</b> <b>specificity</b> is appeared in the evolution of the economic institutions for development, whose institutional traps are in many respects predetermined by the <b>regional</b> <b>specificity.</b> The results can be applied by the public administration at the regional level for the development and introduction of amendments to the legislation and further research. There is still the question of what comes first—the regional economic institutions or the economic development of the region, that is necessary to study both the co-evolution regional institutions and regional economics. Also, more research is needed to assess the impact of institutions on the level of transaction costs of economic entitie...|$|E

In vertebrates the study if neurospheres isolated from different regions of the CNS show region specific markers thereby indicating <b>regional</b> <b>specificity</b> of stem cells in early development.

40|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} <b>Regional</b> <b>specificities</b> are a key factor when {{analyzing}} {{the environmental impact of}} a biofuel pathway through a life cycle assessment (LCA). Due to different energy mixes, transport distances, agricultural practices and land use changes, results can significantly vary from one country to another. The Republic of Argentina is the first exporter of soybean oil and meal and the third largest soybean producer in the world, and therefore, soybean-based biodiesel production is expected to significantly increase in the near future, mostly for exportation. Moreover, Argentinean biodiesel producers will need to evaluate the environmental performances of their product in order to comply with sustainability criteria being developed. However, because of <b>regional</b> <b>specificities,</b> the environmental performances of this biofuel pathway can be expected to be different from those obtained for other countries and feedstocks previously studied. This work aims at analyzing the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina for export.

40|$|The {{silk gland}} of the {{silkworm}} Bombyx mori {{is a long}} tubular organ that is divided into several subparts along its anteroposterior (AP) axis. As a trait of terminal differentiation of the silk gland, several silk protein genes are expressed with unique <b>regional</b> <b>specificities.</b> Most of the Hox {{and some of the}} homeobox genes are also expressed in the differentiated silk gland with <b>regional</b> <b>specificities.</b> The expression patterns of Hox genes in the silk gland roughly correspond to those in embryogenesis showing “colinearity”. The central Hox class protein Antennapedia (Antp) directly regulates the expression of several middle silk gland–specific silk genes, whereas the Lin- 1 /Isl- 1 /Mec 3 (LIM) -homeodomain transcriptional factor Arrowhead (Awh) regulates the expression of posterior silk gland–specific genes for silk fiber proteins. We summarize our results and discuss the usefulness of the silk gland of Bombyx mori for analyzing the function of Hox genes. Further analyses of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the region-specific expression of silk genes will provide novel insights into the molecular bases for target-gene selection and regulation by Hox and homeodomain proteins...|$|R

30|$|Although the FA in the ipsilesional CST {{seems to}} provide a robust {{predictor}} of motor outcome, by considering only a single tract {{it is not possible}} to confirm the specificity of these findings, or whether, for example, FA values in other tracts also might predict motor outcome. Therefore, in order to test the <b>regional</b> <b>specificity</b> of the findings, we also exported the mean FA for the contralesional CST using the combined approach, and repeated the nonparametric partial correlation testing of the contralesional FA versus outcome. This additional analysis was performed just in the subgroup of patients with stroke, since some of the patients with TBI demonstrated bilateral injuries, potentially affecting both the contralesional and ipsilesional motor tracts. We found significant correlation between the WeeFIM motor outcome and the ipsilesional FA in the stroke subgroup, which was not present in the contralesional CST, providing some support for the <b>regional</b> <b>specificity</b> of the ipsilesional CST for motor outcome.|$|E
