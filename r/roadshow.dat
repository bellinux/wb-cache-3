5|$|Fantasia, an {{experimental}} film produced to an accompanying orchestral arrangement conducted by Leopold Stokowski, {{was released in}} November 1940 by Disney itself {{in a series of}} limited-seating <b>roadshow</b> engagements. The film cost $2 million to produce, and although the film earned $1.4 million in its <b>roadshow</b> engagements, the high cost ($85,000 per theater) of installing Fantasound placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio. RKO assumed distribution of Fantasia in 1941, later reissuing it in severely edited versions over the years. Despite its financial failure, Fantasia was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February 26, 1942– one {{for the development of the}} innovative Fantasound system used to create the film's stereoscopic soundtrack, and the other for Stokowski and his contributions to the film.|$|E

5|$|Fantasia grossed over $300,000 in {{the first}} sixteen weeks in New York; over $20,000 in the opening five weeks in San Francisco; and almost the same amount {{in the first}} ten weeks both in Los Angeles and Boston. The first eleven roadshows earned a total of $1.3 million by April 1941, but the $85,000 in {{production}} and installation costs of a single Fantasound setup, along with theatres having to be leased, forced Disney to exceed their loan limits. The onset of the Second World War prevented plans for a potential release in Europe, normally the source {{of as much as}} forty-five per cent of the studio's income. Up to eighty-eight engagements were outlined across five years, but wartime demands for material limited the number of Fantasound prints to sixteen. All but one of the Fantasound setups were dismantled and given to the war effort. Upon acquiring the film's distribution rights in April 1941, RKO initially continued the <b>roadshow</b> booking policy but presented the film in mono, which was easier to exhibit. The combined average receipts from each <b>roadshow</b> was around $325,000, which placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio.|$|E

5|$|In March 2001, {{he helped}} write the {{screenplay}} to the horror film Below, which he also produced. In April 2001, Aronofsky entered negotiations with Warner Bros. and Village <b>Roadshow</b> {{to direct a}} then-untitled science fiction film, with Brad Pitt in the lead role. In June 2001, actress Cate Blanchett entered talks to join the film, which Aronofsky, wanting the title to remain secret, had given the working title of The Last Man. Production was postponed {{to wait for a}} pregnant Blanchett to give birth to her child in December 2001. Production was ultimately set for late October 2002 in Queensland and Sydney. By now officially titled The Fountain, the film had a budget of $70 million, co-financed by Warner Bros. and New Regency, which had filled the gap after Village <b>Roadshow</b> withdrew. Pitt left the project seven weeks before the first day of shooting, halting production. In February 2004, Warner Bros. resurrected it on a $35 million budget with Hugh Jackman in the lead role. In August, actress Rachel Weisz filled the vacancy left by Blanchett. The Fountain was released on November 22, 2006, a day before the American Thanksgiving holiday; ultimately it grossed $15,978,422 in theaters worldwide.
