5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to <b>reconnect</b> <b>with</b> Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E

Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} a {{grounded}} theory approach {{to develop a}} model of courtship following divorce. To be included in this study, individuals had to be: (1) divorced; (2) have a child or children; and (3) currently involved in a committed heterosexual relationship. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} ten individuals. Data analysis consisted of open coding, axial coding, and selective coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Desire for connection is the basic social process underlying the model of courtship after divorce. Three stages which describe this process emerged in the current study: <b>reconnecting</b> <b>with</b> self, <b>reconnecting</b> <b>with</b> others, and <b>reconnecting</b> <b>with</b> a partner. The first stage, <b>reconnecting</b> <b>with</b> self, was a time when people stepped back and reflected on their divorce/separation experiences and started redefining themselves outside of the marriage relationship that had ended. The second stage, reconnection with others, was when people began going out with potential partners after divorce. For most, this stage was not marked by a conscious decision to start dating again, but it did include feelings of anxiety about dating. The experience of going out with different individuals helped people realize what they were searching for in a relationship and in a partner. This process was described in the intervening condition of realizing what you want, which facilitated movement from the stage of <b>reconnecting</b> <b>with</b> others to the final stage of <b>reconnecting</b> <b>with</b> a partner. Personal support, companionship/friendship, and similarity were the factors that emerged in realizing what you want. The final stage of the model, <b>reconnecting</b> <b>with</b> a partner, described people's involvement in committed postdivorce relationships. This stage involved a conscious effort not to repeat past mistakes and, for many, a belief that {{there was no need to}} get remarried. It included cohabitation for some couples, but not for others. Decisions regarding cohabitation were influenced by the presence or absence of children living with them. Children emerged as a contextual condition in the model. Age of the children, the relationship between the partner and children, and a belief that children come first were the key factors that comprised the contextual condition of children in the model...|$|R
5|$|In 2004, Eve's vengeful adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne {{arranges}} for Eve's past {{relationship with}} Julian {{to be exposed}} to the Russell family and the rest of Harmony, resulting in Chad being erroneously identified as their son.

She initiates a relationship with Fox Crane to be able to insinuate that he is the father and protect herself, and her child, from the stigma of incest. She gives birth to a son and immediately uses her then-boyfriend Fox Crane's power of attorney to put him up for adoption. Two couples—Julian and Eve, and T.C. and Liz—compete to adopt the boy, but Chad is awarded custody of the child. He attempts to use the child to <b>reconnect</b> <b>with</b> Whitney. Whitney and Chad name their baby Miles Davis Harris after jazz musician Miles Davis. During the show's 2005 summertime extravaganza, Whitney has sex with Chad {{in the middle of a}} tsunami and admits to Chad that he is Miles' biological father. Identified as the Vendetta plot, the show's 2006 summertime extravaganza centers on Alistair Crane luring Whitney, Chad, and several other residents of Harmony, to Rome. While in Rome, Chad is given his birth certificate by tabloid editor JT Cornell and discovers that he was conceived during Alistair's rape of Liz. Following the revelation of his true paternity, Chad marries Whitney and they decide to raise their son together, and rename him Miles Harris-Crane.|$|E
5|$|MD 704 {{was named}} for George N. Palmer, a banker and {{community}} leader in Seat Pleasant, by 1951. John Hanson Highway was constructed from US 301 in Bowie west to MD 704 between 1954 and 1957. MD 704 was expanded to a divided highway through the highway's interchange with the freeway {{as part of the}} construction. In addition to the current set of ramps, the interchange included loop ramps from westbound MD 704 to the eastbound freeway and from the westbound freeway to westbound MD 704.

This temporary route extended west into Washington along newly completed East Capitol Street and the pair of Independence Avenue and Constitution Avenue to <b>reconnect</b> <b>with</b> US 50 at 2nd Street in Capitol Hill. US 50 remained along Defense Highway (now MD 450) from Bowie to Bladensburg and on Bladensburg Road and Maryland Avenue within the city until 1962, when the U.S. Highway was placed along the newly completed John Hanson Highway from Bowie to Washington and Temporary US 50 was removed from MD 704.|$|E
5|$|T.C. Russell is {{the patriarch}} of the Russell family.
