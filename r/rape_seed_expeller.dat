The lactation feeding was phased by giving the sows more protein (<b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> <b>expeller)</b> at the last half of lactation (from 3 weeks lactation to weaning). The feeding of gestation was phased by replacing a part of the gestation feed with lactation feed at the last third of gestation. Experiment was carried out with 84 sows. The experiment was focused on sow feeding during lactation (n= 74 sows) as only a small number of the sows (n= 23) had results from the gestation period. MTT’s sow unit was closed at the end of 2013.

40|$|When {{rape oil}} is {{chemically}} extracted, <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal, a solid residue remains. Currently, {{it is used}} as animal feed. Several plants {{for the production of}} rape methyl ester (RME, biodiesel) are in operation or under construction. Combustion properties have been studied for <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal produced as a by product to rape-methyl esther (RME, biodiesel). Composition of the material has been measured, using proximate and ultimate analysis. The lower heating value was 18. 2 ± 0, 3 MJ/kg d. w. and the ash content was 7 - 8 percent d. w. The material is rich in nitrogen and sulphur. Concentrations of K, P, Ca and Mg are high in the fuel. <b>Rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal was mixed with bark and pelletised. Bark pellets were also used as a reference fuel. Pellets with 10 and 30 percent <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal were produced. Material with 80 percent <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal and 20 percent planer shavings was also pelletised. Wood had to be added to provide enough friction in the pelletising process, with adapted equipment <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal could probably be easily pelletised). The material was studied using Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and compared with data from tests with wood powder. The pyrolysis of the <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal has a characteristic temperature of 320 oC. Devolatilisation starts at 150 oC (at a lower temperature than for wood powder), and proceeds within a rather wide temperature range. The probable cause is the difference in organic content, in particular protein content. The result does not suggest that the material will be difficult to ignite. Experiments in a bench-scale fluidised bed (5 kW) showed that pellets containing only bark, and the mixture <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal/wood had a bed agglomeration temperature well over the normal operational bed temperature. For the fuel mixtures <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal and bark, the agglomeration temperature was slightly over the operational temperature. Particle emissions from fluidised bed combustion and grate combustion were, the latter simulated using a commercial pellet burner, were roughly doubled with fuels containing <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal compared to bark. In the powder burner tests, particle emissions increased with a factor 17 with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal compared to wood powder. The emitted particles were mainly found in the fine (1 µm) and a fine mode fraction. The particles from grate combustion of bark contain mostly K, S, Na and Cl apart from oxygen and carbon. When <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal is present, Cl and Na concentrations decrease considerably and the main contents of the particles are K and S (and O and C). The results from the X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD) analyses showed the presence of crystalline K 2 SO 4 och KCl. The fine particles (< 1 µm) from powder combustion contain mainly K, P and S. The only identified crystalline phase was K 2 SO 4, suggesting that most phosphorus was in the amorphous phase, i. d. most probably molten. The deposit formation on a cooled probe was studied during the fluidized bed and powder combustion experiments. The fine particles deposited during fluidised bed combustion contained K, Cl and S. When bark was combusted in the fluidised bed, the coarse fraction contained Ca and Si, when <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal in different mixes was combusted this changed to P, K, Ca and Mg. The deposits formed during combustion of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal in the powder burner were mainly made up of phosphates (Ca-, Mg/K-, Ca/Mg-phosphates) and MgO. Sintered material (slag) from grate combustion of bark contained mainly Si, Ca, K and Al, probably as silicates. Adding <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal tended to increase P, Ca and Mg while Si and Ca content tended to decrease. Through XRD a number o crystalline phases in the sintered material {{and the rest of the}} bottom ashes could be identified. NO emissions from the combustions tests increased two to four times with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal compared to typical wood fuels. For the fluidised bed test, SO 2 concentrations were rather high for the <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal pellets (with 20 percent wood), still only about 20 percent of the sulphur in the fuel formed SO 2. For the grate combustion and powder burner combustion, 60 percent and 70 percent of the sulphur respectively formed SO 2. HCl emissions were low for all tests. The rather high emissions of NOx and SOx mean that the material should be used in large-scale facilities with external SOx and NOx cleaning. In smaller facilities, the material may be used in small amounts mixed with other fuels. The risk of slagging is not very high, and should not rule out grate combustion of pellets with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal mixed with other fuels. The risk of corrosion of superheater surfaces during combustion is probably low since the smaller-size particles formed at fluidised bed combustion and grate combustion contain K 2 SO 4. However, a large fraction of the particles formed in powder burner combustion probably contains low temperature melting K 2 PO 4, making the risk for deposit formation significant. <b>Rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal for powder burner applications should be used with care. The content of phosphorus in the material may be an advantage when mixes of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal and other fuels are considered. The high affinity between potassium and phosphorus means that more sulphur in the fuel will be available for sulphatising of any KC. (formed from combustion of many forest and agricultural fuels). Use of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal as a sulphur containing additive could thus be an option. For grate combustion and fluidised bed combustion, addition of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal may reduce the risk of slagging and bed agglomeration, respectively. Full scale tests in fluidised beds or grate combustors with problematic biofuels (containing Cl and K) would be useful to test whether ash-reduced operational problems could be reduced through the addition of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> meal. Effektiva värmevärdet hos rapsmjöl är 18, 2 +/- 0, 3 MJ/kg TS och askhalten varierar mellan 7 - 8 %. Bränslet har högt N- och S-innehåll, och bränslet är rikt på K, P, Ca och Mg. Partikelemissionerna från fluidbäddseldning och rosterförbränning med rapsmjölsblandningar var ungefär dubbelt så höga som från barkförbränning. Vid pulverförbränning av rapsmjöl ökade partikelemissionerna med en faktor 17 jämfört med träpulver. De höga NOx och SOx emissionerna från rapsmjölsförbränning innebär att materialet bör utnyttjas i storskaliga anläggningar med extern svavel. - eller NO-rening, eller i relativt låga inblandningsgrader i andra bränslen. Mindre anläggningar med enbart cyklonrening är olämpliga på grund av de höga stofthalterna. Rapsmjöl torde vara ett intressant sameldningsbränsle vid roster- och fluidbäddseldning med klor- och kaliumrika skogs- och åkerbränslen då rapsmjöl eventuellt skulle kunna användas som svaveladditiv för reduktion av klorinducerad korrosion på t ex överhettare.

Breckling et al. developed geostatistical models to forecast long-term and regional effects of commercial plantation of GM <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> that cannot be assessed through experimental approaches [65, 66].

40|$|Oil seed {{production}} {{has an important}} role in human nutrition and industry. Success in oil plant cultivation is related to {{seed production}} with high viability and rapid germination, because these seeds rapidly loose their viability by fats oxidation. Thus, in this work we studied the effects of ascorbic acid, pyridoxine and hydrogen peroxide solutions on germination quantitative traits, catalase activity, protein and malondialdehyde content of three old oil <b>seeds</b> (sunflower, <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> and safflower). The results showed that ascorbic acid and pyridoxine stimulated significantly the sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> germination. These vitamins, however, didn't have any effect on safflower germination. Hydrogen peroxide strongly increased safflower germination. Ascorbic acid and pyridoxine decreased catalase activity in sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed,</b> whereas hydrogen peroxide increased it. Ascorbic acid and pyridoxine prevented protein degradation and lipid peroxidation in germinated seeds. Consequently, we understand that ascorbic acid and pyridoxine can increase sunflower and <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> germination and stimulate rate of growth. Also safflower germination increased due to germination inhibitor oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. In conclusion, this report shows that oil seeds treated with ascorbic acid, pyridoxine and hydrogen peroxide remarkably increase the capacity of germination.

40|$|This Licentiate thesis {{deals with}} {{small-scale}} extraction of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> {{oil and the}} use of this oil in an Elsbett engine tractor. Small-scale extraction of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil was studied in practical tests in the laboratory at Ultuna, Uppsala. The influence of the speed of the press screw, nozzle size and nozzle performance, the distance between the press screw and the press chamber head, the ambient temperature, and preheating of the seed with air was studied. At Sjösa farm a small plant for on-farm extraction of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil was built. The processing of three bigger batches of oil seed was studied. Data of interest were registered in an operating log. Capacity and oil extraction efficiency were studied. A tractor with an Elsbett engine was operated at Sjösa farm on the processed <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil. Data of interest were registered in an operating log and with an automatic data collection system. The data obtained on the farm were used to conduct an energy analysis. The oil press has higher capacity with bigger nozzles and higher screw speeds. However, the amount of oil extracted from each seed increased if the nozzles were smaller and/or the press screw speed was lower. Nozzles with a long press nozzle channel gave a more solid meal. It was important that the temperature in the press chamber head reached a temperature of about 70 °C. The optimum seed moisture content (wet basis) was 7 - 8 per cent. Preheating with air usually improved the capacity, but there is a risk of over-drying so it must be done with care. Preheated seed involves a risk of getting too high levels of phosphorus in the oil. On the farm, the simplest way of cleaning the oil is settling. This can be done in three series-coupled sedimentation tanks. If the ambient temperature is + 20 °C and the settling height is 0. 6 m, about 18 days are needed for the settling. A tractor with an Elsbett engine can be operated almost {{in the same way as}} a conventional tractor. The differences are <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil fuel, separate starting fuel, more frequent fuel filter exchange, electrical heating of the fuel system and about 10 per cent higher fuel consumption. Problems may occur when the <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil stiffens at - 15 °C. To obtain a good energy balance it is important to have a high yield and low moisture contents. It is important also to have uses for the meal and straw. Direct seeding also improves the energy balance. The main conclusion of the project is that a system involving <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil and the Elsbett engine works well technically. The system is not, however, competitive as there are cheap fossil fuels on the market, and the Elsbett engine has not yet entered serial production. In addition, the supply of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil in Sweden is limited, and the oil produced could be used for better purposes than as vehicle fuel...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of three-year (2000 - 2003) experiments to determine the effect of the date of sulfur application (fall + spring or spring only) and the fertilizer rate (0, 30, 60, 90 kg⋅ha- 1) on the usability of winter <b>rape</b> <b>seeds.</b> The pre-sowing and the spring rates of sulfur as well as the rate applied entirely in the spring did not lead to significant variations in crude fat concentrations, but a clear tendency towards an increase in the total protein content was observed in <b>rape</b> <b>seeds.</b> A one-way increase was reported to the level of 60 kg S⋅ha- 1. An increase in the sulfur rate (regardless of the date of application) to 90 kg⋅ha- 1 raised the concentrations of alkene glucosinolates, mainly gluconapin and progoitrin, and – to a les-ser degree – of indole glucosinolates, mainly 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, in <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> cv. Lisek. The splitting of the total sulfur rate into two rates (fall + spring) caused a higher increase in the concentrations of gluconapin, progoitrin and 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin than a single rate application in the spring...|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the United Kingdom, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Bayer CropSciences AG to modify the existing MRL for the active substance bixafen in <b>rape</b> <b>seed.</b> The submitted residue data support the intended use of bixafen in <b>rape</b> <b>seed,</b> linseed, poppy seed and mustard seed in France as well. In order to accommodate for the intended use of bixafen, the United Kingdom proposed to raise the existing MRL from 0. 015 mg/kg to 0. 1 mg/kg. The United Kingdom drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 07 mg/kg for the proposed use on <b>rape</b> <b>seed,</b> linseed, poppy seed and mustard seed. An adequate analytical enforcement method is available to control the residues of bixafen in oilseeds. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of bixafen on <b>rape</b> <b>seed,</b> linseed, poppy seed and mustard seed will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk. This risk assessment has to be regarded as provisional since the residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment in oilseeds are provisional and pending the need for MRLs in rotational crops and the definitive MRLs in animal origin commodities...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effects of barley or <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> cake as supplement to silage given ad libitum on milk production and health of dairy cows. A total of 103 cows {{were divided into two}} groups on two farms. Before the experiment, the cows had an average milk yield of 26. 9 kg ECM and they were in milk for an average of 99 days. Their average parity was 2. 3 and their weight 596 kg. The cows in each group received either solely barley or an isoenergetic mixture of <b>rape</b> cake <b>seed</b> and barley as supplement. The supplement feed was fed frequently by automatic feeding. A mixture of clover grass silage and whole crop silage was fed ad libitum. The daily milk yields were not significantly different in the barley and <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> cake treatment (22. 8 v. 24. 1 kg). The milk fat content was not significant different either (4. 51...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consider}} {{alternatives for}} {{heating and cooling}} planned office buildings at Arlanda airport. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts where the third part is a shorter synthesis of the two first. In the first part the energy demands of the buildings are modelled in a computer program. Two different building models are created, one more conventional and one with good energy properties. The results shows that with proper construction and ventilation systems etc. the energy required for heating and cooling could be very low. Whether the consumption will be so low that normal energy installations could be omitted is although hard to predict from the results. The second part of the work concerns different ways of producing the required energy for the buildings. Four energy producing systems (aquifer, <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> diesel generator, snow-cooling and air blast cooler) are compared with today’s systems (districts heating and compression cooling machines) with respect to environmental impact and economy. District heating and diesel generator with <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil are systems with negative global warming potential, mainly due to the simultaneous production of power together with heat. Compression cooling has the highest GWP and the remaining systems shows a small GWP. <b>Rape</b> <b>seed</b> diesel generator and (in less extent) district heating has a relative large impact on acidification and eutrophication while the other systems have a much smaller impact. Economically the aquifer and air blast cooling are the most competitive systems; the per-kWh price of energy is lower than for today’s systems. Snow cooling also has promising economical potential but the high price on <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil makes the diesel alternative less interesting at the moment...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{nitrogen}} requirements, oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> should be cultivated after rye-grass-clover mixtures (Böhm 2007). But in this case oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> is in competition with wheat, because wheat has a high N-requirement as well. So, the crop rotation must be organized in another way, {{so that there is}} no competition between oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> and wheat. In two-year field trials at the experimental farm of the Institute of Organic Farming (FAL) in Trenthorst the hypothesis was tested, whether oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> with an undersown white clover is a better preceding crop to wheat compared to oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> without underseed. Additionally, the yield was compared to “wheat after ryegrass-clover mixture”. The results showed a higher yield of wheat after oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> with undersown white clover compared to the wheat after oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> without underseed. Only in one year was the yield of wheat after ryegrass-clover mixture about 0. 45 t ha- 1 higher than the yield of wheat after oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> with undersown white clover. Under the given conditions of location, the yield of wheat after “oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> with an undersown white clover” is similar to that after ryegrass-clover mixture. So, an integration of oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> in the crop rotation seems possible without a lower yield of wheat...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{ecological}} lubricants based on vegetable oil and, other {{tendency is to}} use synthetic lubricants, both applications reducing the field of mineral oil. Biodegradable lubricants will be more used in environment with ecological risk, as for instance, equipment functioning in hygroscopic protected medium, in agriculture, food and wood industry {{as well as for}} those with lubricant leakage. The success of vegetal oils is related to their biodegradability and reduced toxicity but a wider use is limited by their insufficient stability in time. This paper presents first experimental results on lubricating capacity of <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil compared to that obtained for a usual mineral oil. From these results it seems that <b>rape</b> <b>seed</b> oil has actual capacity for being used in industrial applications...|$|R
