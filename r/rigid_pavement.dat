5000|$|<b>Rigid</b> pavementsThe <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> {{have four}} {{subgrade}} categories as given below: ...|$|R
50|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) {{is the most}} common material used in the construction of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> slabs. The reason for its popularity is due to its availability and the economy. Rigid pavements must be designed to endure frequently repeated traffic loadings. The typical designed service life of a <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> is between 30 and 40 years, lasting about twice as long as a flexible pavement.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} subcategories of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> {{overlays}} that are organized {{depending on the}} bonding condition at the pavement overlay and existing slab interface.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the end of}} a rigid pavement's service life, a {{decision}} must be made to either fully reconstruct the worn pavement, or construct an overlay layer. Considering an overlay can be constructed on a <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> that has not reached the end of its service life, it is often more economically attractive to apply overlay layers more frequently. The required overlay thickness for a structurally sound <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> is much smaller than for one that has reached the end of its service life. Rigid and flexible overlays are both used for rehabilitation of rigid pavements such as JPCP, JRCP, and CRCP.|$|E

50|$|One major design {{consideration}} of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> is reducing fatigue failure {{due to the}} repeated stresses of traffic. Fatigue failure is common among major roads because a typical highway will experience millions of wheel passes throughout its service life. In addition to design criteria such as traffic loadings, tensile stresses due to thermal energy {{must also be taken}} into consideration. As pavement design has progressed, many highway engineers have noted that thermally induced stresses in <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> can be just as intense as those imposed by wheel loadings. Due to the relatively low tensile strength of concrete, thermal stresses are extremely important to the design considerations of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements.</b>|$|R
40|$|Imperfections {{of plastic}} {{concrete}} can cause severe deteriorations in <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> surface and structure and reduce its life and serviceability. Diagnosing these imperfections, identifying their causes, and applying effective remedies early can prevent costly repairs in <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements.</b> However, if these imperfections are not remedied in correct time, the deteriorations in <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> shall be reminded {{as soon as}} possible to avoid worsening the pavement condition. This domain involves diagnostic nature which suitable to be modelled as an expert system to help practicing engineers to identify the causes of the problems and their expected effects on pavement as well as applying suitable remedies. This paper presents the stages of development of an expert system in this domain. The development process includes knowledge elicitation, knowledge representation, knowledge coding, system validation, verification and evaluation...|$|R

50|$|The {{segment of}} the JVLR which starts from Saki Vihar Road {{junction}} and ends at LBS Marg junction (in Gandhi Nagar) {{is referred to as}} Section 2 of JVLR. As it is located {{in the middle of the}} entire JVLR, it is also referred as the middle section of the JVLR. The length of the middle section is 4.3 km. Section 2 was re-constructed with <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> for a width of 2-4 lanes width (i.e. 7-14 m) in 1996-97. The pavement was widened in subsequent years with <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> and flexible pavement in others. Section 2 was later widened by the BMC to an unequal width of 4-6 lane (with/without central median) with <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement,</b> barring a length of about one kilometre opposite the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (lITB) campus. The entire Section 2 was widened to 6-lane with a central median in the 2000s under the MUTP. Out of six lanes, four central lanes have been constructed with flexible bituminous concrete and outermost lanes on either side have been asphalted. In the middle section, the terrain is slightly rolling, but the road alignment passes over almost level ground from L&T factory to lITB campus. Beyond lITB campus, the alignment runs down over a steep hill further to meet LBS Marg.|$|E

5000|$|Today, roadways are {{primarily}} asphalt or concrete. Both {{are based on}} McAdam's concept of stone aggregate in a binder, asphalt cement or Portland cement respectively. Asphalt {{is known as a}} flexible pavement, one which slowly will [...] "flow" [...] under the pounding of traffic. Concrete is a <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement,</b> which can take heavier loads but is more expensive and requires more carefully prepared subbase. So, generally, major roads are concrete and local roads are asphalt. Concrete roads are often covered with a thin layer of asphalt to create a wearing surface.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> are {{generally}} used in constructing airports and major highways, {{such as those}} in the interstate highway system. In addition, they commonly serve as heavy-duty industrial floor slabs, port and harbor yard pavements, and heavy-vehicle park or terminal pavements. Like flexible <b>pavements,</b> <b>rigid</b> highway <b>pavements</b> are designed as all-weather, long-lasting structures to serve modern day high-speed traffic. Offering high quality riding surfaces for safe vehicular travel, they function as structural layers to distribute vehicular wheel loads in such a manner that the induced stresses transmitted to the subgrade soil are of acceptable magnitudes.|$|R

30|$|Paved {{roads are}} {{typically}} categorized {{as either a}} flexible or <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> system. Sometimes, {{as part of the}} reclamation, the old road is not completely removed prior to construction of the new road and is referred to as a composite pavement [60]. The major difference between flexible and <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> systems is the application of a bituminous surface layer (e.g., asphalt layer) in a flexible pavement or a Portland cement concrete layer in a <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> system. In general, regardless of the type, pavement systems are constructed with the highest quality materials on the top where traffic stresses are greatest [60]. The thickness of the layers within the pavement system will typically decrease as constructed over subgrade due to the increased cost of the materials.|$|E
40|$|The Benkelman Beam {{structural}} test of flexible pavements was replaced in 1976 by dynamic deflection testing {{with a model}} 400 Road Rater. The Road Rater is used to determine structural ratings of flexible pavements. New pavement construction in Iowa has decreased with a corresponding increase of restoration and rehabilitation. A method to determine structural ratings of layered systems and <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> is needed to properly design overlay thickness. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the feasibility of using the Road Rater to determine support values of layered systems and <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements.</b> This evaluation was accomplished by correlating the Road Rater with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Thumper, a dynamic deflection testing device. Data were obtained with the Road Rater and Thumper at 411 individual test locations on 39 different structural sections ranging from 10 " of PCC pavement and 25 " of asphalt pavement to a newly graveled unpaved roadway. A high correlation between a 9000 pound Thumper deflection and the 1185 pound Road Rater deflection was obtained. A Road Rater modification has been completed to provide 2000 pound load inputs. The basin, defined by four sensors spaced at 1 foot intervals, resulting from the 2000 pound loading is being used to develop a graph for determining relative subgrade strengths.
