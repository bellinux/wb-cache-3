5000|$|All civil flying {{instructors}} had to {{be certified}} by the CAA, {{as well as the}} ground school instructors and aircraft mechanics. Also flying instructors had to undergo a two-week Army refresher program. In order to exempt the instructors and mechanics from the wartime draft, all were enlisted into the Army as privates in the Army Reserve. Each CPS was commanded by an Army officer (mostly, but not all West Point graduates), who supervised all aspects of the program as well as insuring that military discipline was maintained. Also, a few Air Corps pilots conducted all check rides.However, the existing CPS contractors were unable to expand to train this increased number. In response, the Air Corps issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>bid</b> (RFB) to all of the 38 Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) approved flying schools in the country outlining the specifications for Army pilot training. From the schools responding to the RFB, the Air Corps selected eleven new contractors for Army primary flight training. [...] With the war in Europe expanding, and the threat of war with the Japanese Empire becoming more and more a possibility, the Chief of Staff of the Army directed Arnold to increase pilot training to 30,000 per year. To meet this new rate, the CPS concept was again expanded by converting three of the Level 1 primary CPS schools to Level 2 basic flying training and expanded the number of CPS contractors.|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} {{companies}} are leveraging Internet technologies {{in order to}} improve their business processes. A particular process strongly influenced by the Internet is the sourcing process, including requirements definition, suppliers scouting and qualification, <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>bid,</b> and final negotiation and selection. A number of B 2 B operators have started providing e-sourcing services, the most well known being electronic auctions, to allow companies to increase their efficiency in this specific process. This paper discusses this phenomenon in the Italian landscape and aims at identifying the main adopted e-sourcing services, areas of applicability of e-sourcing and electronic auctions, and finally, the main benefits and criticalities for both buyers and sellers involved in the sourcing process. This research is part of a wider project conducted by Politecnico di Milano over the period July 2002 –January 2003 studying B 2 B interactions over the Internet. Empirical evidence is based on 24 case studies involving both B 2 B operators, industrial customers and suppliers...|$|E
40|$|Message {{exchange}} patterns provide {{means to}} define the message flow of a service and how these messages are related in an abstract and reusable manner. They {{are an integral part}} of WSDL 2. 0 and allow defining op-erations that have a message exchange beyond request-response. They reduce the impedance mismatch between imperative programming and message orientation while emphasizing the message orientated nature of Web Ser-vices. Whereas BPEL defines a flow between Web Ser-vice operations, BPELlight is an appropriate candidate {{to define the}} flow within operations since it abstracts from WSDL. In this paper we extended BPELlight to facili-tate capturing complex multi-lateral message exchanges. We refine the partner model and relax the definition of a conversation to enable modelling conversations that involve different partner types. We also extend the lan-guage with a first-class construct that enables storing, querying and thus distinguishing addressing information related to multiple partner instances.
