5|$|Hoover's {{influence}} {{extended beyond}} federal government employees {{and beyond the}} loyalty-security programs. The records of loyalty review hearings and investigations {{were supposed to be}} confidential, but Hoover <b>routinely</b> gave evidence from them to congressional committees such as HUAC.|$|E
5|$|However, in locally {{advanced}} tumours, surgery may not <b>routinely</b> {{provide the}} best chance of cure and is often not technically feasible to perform. In these cases radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, offers the only chance of cure.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that, once diagnosed, individuals be <b>routinely</b> {{followed by a}} cardiologist, endocrinologist, dermatologist, and other appropriate specialties as symptoms present.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians <b>routinely</b> {{advocate}} sex-positive {{feminism and}} genetically modified food. They also have protested against wars and the Catholic Church.|$|E

5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government {{scrutiny of}} train and airplane passengers substantially increased, but bus passengers are largely free of it. Baggage is seldom inspected, and cash customers {{do not require}} identification.

5|$|Although {{recorded}} in small numbers sporadically throughout twentieth century {{it was not}} until the 1980s that Grey-headed flying foxes <b>routinely</b> visited Melbourne. Since the 1990s their permanent colony in Melbourne has been postulated as possibly due to habitat loss in their northern range, greater supply of reliable food by native eucalypt plantings and backyard fruit trees, climate change, and increase urbanisation leading to warmer temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the story}} of the Tree That Owns Itself is more legend than history, the tree has become (along with the University Arch and the Double-Barreled Cannon) one of the most {{recognized}} and well-loved symbols of Athens.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the investigation, lines of {{communication}} were set up between the Navy and the Air Force. The Air Force knew nothing of Operation Market Time and did not <b>routinely</b> communicate with Naval Forces, Vietnam. To avoid a repetition of the incident, aircraft patrolling near the DMZ were instructed not to attack vessels without first contacting CSC Da Nang for clearance.|$|E
5|$|Between 1984 and 1991, British Airways flew a thrice-weekly Concorde service between London and Miami, {{stopping}} at Washington Dulles International Airport.

5|$|Due to the area's vacationers, many {{of which}} come from New York and Northern New Jersey, Route 37 is <b>routinely</b> {{congested}} with seasonal traffic in the summer, especially on and around the Mathis and Tunney Bridges and at the Garden State Parkway interchange as heavy tourist traffic converges on the shore. Additionally, the road sees congestion due to the area's rapid growth in commercial development.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, local {{politics}} split over slavery as many had ties to Southern cotton. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, {{the number of}} military volunteers <b>routinely</b> exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union.

5|$|During the Principate, {{recruitment}} {{into the}} legions {{was restricted to}} Roman citizens only. This rule, which derived from the pre-Social War Republican army, was strictly enforced.

5|$|Earlier, {{his family}} had become {{concerned}} in August when he called them to say he had dropped the course, but was remaining there.

5|$|FETA {{began to}} be {{concerned}} over the structural wear of the bridge in the 21st century. The planned theoretical capacity for the bridge (30,000vehicles per day in each direction) was <b>routinely</b> exceeded as traffic levels outstripped predictions. The Scottish Government stated in 2006 that 60,000vehicles travelled on {{more than half the}} days in a year. This raised concerns about the lifespan of the bridge, originally planned at 120 years.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{court cases}} are {{heard in the}} United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, which holds court in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, and Fergus Falls.

5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not <b>routinely</b> needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E
5|$|Games of the Trail Blazers are <b>routinely</b> {{broadcast}} via {{television and}} radio. The team {{was one of}} the first in the NBA to produce its own television broadcasts.

5|$|In 1959, Nhu {{tried to}} assassinate Sihanouk by sending him a parcel bomb. As a result, Sihanouk <b>routinely</b> gave asylum to {{political}} refugees {{who had tried}} to depose or kill Diệm. In November 1960, he had given asylum to a group of paratroopers who tried to depose Diệm.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, German and Italian Tornados {{participated in}} Operation Allied Force, NATO's {{military}} operation against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War. The ECR aircraft would escort various allies' aircraft while carrying several AGM-88 HARM missiles to counter attempted use of radar against the allied aircraft. During the Kosovo hostilities, Germany's IDS Tornados would <b>routinely</b> conduct reconnaissance flights to identify both enemy ground forces and civilian refugees within Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish <b>routinely</b> fielded {{indigenous}} allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua {{brought from the}} recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and the participation of these Mesoamerican allies was decisive.|$|E
5|$|John Hancock (Will Smith) is an {{alcoholic}} amnesiac with superhuman powers reminiscent {{to those of}} superheroes. Though he uses his powers to stop criminals in his current residence of Los Angeles, his activity inadvertently causes {{millions of dollars in}} property damage due to his constant intoxication. As a result, he is <b>routinely</b> jeered at crime scenes. Hancock also ignores court subpoenas to address the damage he has caused.|$|E
