60|$|He had {{difficulty}} climbing down {{and up the}} gorge, but, once across it, there was the graded <b>road-bed,</b> leading straight to the next camp. This <b>road-bed</b> was soft, and not easy going for a horse. Neale found better ground along the line, on hard ground, and here he urged the fresh horse to a swift and steady gait.|$|E

6000|$|Bermuda {{roads are}} made by cutting down a few inches into the solid white coral--or a good many feet, where a hill intrudes itself--and {{smoothing}} off {{the surface of the}} <b>road-bed.</b> It is a simple and easy process. The grain of the coral is coarse and porous; the <b>road-bed</b> has the look of being made of coarse white sugar. Its excessive cleanness and whiteness are a trouble in one way: the sun is reflected into your eyes with such energy as you walk along that you want to sneeze all the time. Old Captain Tom Bowling found another difficulty. He joined us in our walk, but kept wandering unrestfully to the roadside. Finally he explained. Said he, [...] "Well, I chew, you know, and the road's so plagued clean." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{were at the}} {{far north}} end of the yard now, under a switchtower, looking down on the four-track way of the main traffic. The Boston Compound was to haul [...] .007's string to some far-away {{northern}} junction over an indifferent <b>road-bed,</b> and she mourned aloud for the ninety-six pound rails of the B. & A.|$|E
60|$|And in {{that moment}} she remembered Planchette; it seared her brain as a lightning-flash of all-embracing memory. Her horse was back on its haunches, {{the weight of her}} body on the reins; but her head was turned and her eyes were on the falling Comanche. He struck the <b>road-bed</b> squarely, with his legs loose and lifeless beneath him.|$|E

60|$|Out on {{the level}} plain {{stretched}} the hundreds of teams, moving on and returning, the drivers shouting, the horses bending. The hot sun glared, the wind whipped up the dust, the laborers speeded up to the shout of the boss. And ever westward crept the low, level, yellow bank of sand and gravel--the <b>road-bed</b> of the first transcontinental railway.|$|E
60|$|They {{carried the}} tie {{out to the}} end of the rails and dropped it on the level <b>road-bed.</b> Men there set it {{straight}} and tamped the gravel around it. Neale and his partner went back for another, passing a dozen couples carrying ties forward. Behind these staggered the rows of men burdened with the heavy iron rails.|$|E
60|$|Another day dawned {{in which}} he saw the grading gangs return from work ahead. They were done. Streams of horses, wagons, and men on the return! They had met the graders from the west, and the two lines of <b>road-bed</b> had been connected. As these gangs passed, cheer on cheer greeted them from the rail-layers. It was a splendid moment.|$|E

60|$|Jumping down, he {{went along}} {{the track and}} stopped in the strong light a blast-lamp threw across a gap. The <b>road-bed</b> was gone and a great bank of stones and snow rested on the hillside. Bent rails slanted into the hole and a broken {{telegraph}} pole hung by the tangled wires. Shovels rattled and a gang of men threw down soil and stones. Deering stopped one.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can imagine}} the cost if we cut back the hill far enough to ease the curve and lay the track on solid ground," [...] Norton interposed. [...] "The half-measure of {{scooping}} out a shallow <b>road-bed</b> and dumping the stuff on the incline is ruled out, because the spoil wouldn't lie and the river would sweep the dirt away. If we filled up the channel with rock, we'd turn the current on the bridge-pier." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was getting}} dark and noisy blast-lamps threw up pillars of white fire. The line had sunk in the {{afternoon}} and it was necessary to lift the rails and fill up the subsidence before the next gravel train arrived. Lister was angry and puzzled, for he had pushed the <b>road-bed</b> across to near the other side, but the rails had not sunk in the new belt but in ground over which the trains had run.|$|E

60|$|A {{string of}} flat-cars, loaded with rails and ties, {{stood on the}} track where the work of {{yesterday}} had ended. Beyond stretched the <b>road-bed,</b> yellow, level, winding as far as eye could see. The sun beat down hot; the dry, scorching desert breeze swept down from the bare hills, across the waste; dust flew up in puffs; uprooted clumps of sage, like balls, went rolling along; and everywhere the veils of heat rose from the sun-baked earth.|$|E
60|$|The ground shook, {{and flying}} {{fragments}} of ballast beat upon his turned-down hat; {{there was a}} deafening roar as the cars jolted past, {{and he saw the}} rails spring. Then the wind that buffeted him changed to eddying puffs, the noise receded, and he lifted his bent head. The rockwork stood firm, the ends of the timbers had not moved, and only a few small heaps of gravel had fallen from the <b>road-bed.</b> Festing felt that he was trembling, and Kerr put his hand on his arm.|$|E
60|$|All the engineers, {{including}} the chief, {{though he was}} noncommittal, were bitter about this expert-commissioner law. If a good <b>road-bed</b> had been surveyed, the engineers knew more about it than any one else. They were the pioneers of the work. It was exceedingly annoying and exasperating to {{have a number of}} men travel leisurely in trains over the line and criticize the labors of engineers who had toiled in heat and cold and wet, with brain and heart in the task. But it was so.|$|E

When I got here to-day I inquired about him, remembering {{that he had}} taken severe exception to the judgment of the commissioners about that five miles of <b>road-bed.</b> I learned he is a strange, excitable young fellow, who leaves his work for long wild trips and who is a drunkard and a gambler. It seems to me somewhat absurd seriously to consider the false report with which he has excited this council." ...|$|E
60|$|Every day the {{criss-cross}} of ties lengthened {{out along}} the winding <b>road-bed,</b> and the lines of glistening rails kept pace with them. The sun beat down hot--the dust flew in sheets and puffs--the smoky veils floated up from the desert. Red-shirted toilers, blue-shirted toilers, half-naked toilers, sweat and bled, and laughed grimly, and sucked at their pipes, and bent their broad backs. The pace had quickened to the limit of human endurance. Fury of sound filled the air. Its rhythmical pace was the mighty gathering impetus of a last heave, a last swing.|$|E
60|$|The rope at {{the island}} caught it while a trolley ran down, but the {{straining}} wire curved and parted, and the trolley fell into the river as the log swept on.

Things might have been worse, for nobody was hurt, although some yards of <b>road-bed</b> had been carried away and a derrick he had built to put the logs on the cars was smashed. As he studied the damage a wet and angry engineer ran up.|$|E
