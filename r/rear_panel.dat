50|$|The {{first batch}} of genuine OmniTowns {{to appear in}} the United Kingdom were {{delivered}} to Nottingham City Transport in 2004 for use on tram feeder services. The bodywork, in common with the OmniDekka, was built by East Lancs but received front and <b>rear</b> <b>panels</b> from Scania, to match the OmniCity/OmniDekka. The body only differed from the East Lancs Myllennium in terms of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{external}} appearance and equipment of the VAM Pacer {{consisted of a}} full bright molding package (wheel lips, top edges of the hood and fenders, window surrounds, rocker panels), bright <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> between the taillights and the rear licence plate housing, protective side moldings, front and rear bumper guards, bumper nerfing strips, five-mile-per-hour bumpers with recovering shocks (only VAM car with this characteristic along with the Matador-based Classic line), five-spoke in-house VAM wheels, trim rings and full cover volcano center caps on the wheels, ER78x14 radial tires, driver's side manual remote mirror, radio antenna on the passenger's side fender, squared VAM logo emblems on the fenders, Pacer emblems on the fenders and bright <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> and a two-step hood latch.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 a {{production}} car was modified and dubbed the Gremlin XP prototype. It has a larger glass hatchback and additional side quarter windows. A pronounced crease started from the mid-body section and wraps {{over the roof}} while the rear quarter panels feature bulges around the wheel well openings. The <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> has a recessed and blacked out area with four lights. The design of the concept car improved visibility around the Gremlin's original wide C-pillar.|$|E

25|$|Since the boro taxis {{are part}} of the livery services, they are {{associated}} with companies (or bases). The decals of base station name and telephone number are affixed on the <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> of the vehicle. Customers can call the bases for pre-arranged trips. The passengers for pre-arranged trips can negotiate the price, but can only be picked up in all the outer boroughs (including the airports) and north of the yellow zone in Manhattan. These airport pick-ups by boro taxis are only allowed for pre-arranged trips.|$|E
25|$|Thames Valley Police has a local {{policing}} {{team working}} from every police station. These teams consist of officers, community support, special constables and police staff who work to patrol and attend local incidents. They use marked vans which read neighbourhood policing {{on the side}} <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> under the Thames Valley police corporate logo. These officers will typically be unarmed and rarely carry taser weapons. The neighbourhood police vans double up as prisoner transport vans when the larger detention van is off-area or busy. However most LPA police vehicles are available to this unit.|$|E
25|$|The SS {{was now a}} trim option {{limited to}} the mid-level Malibu series. Shoppers could even get an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, no less—but the mix of sport and {{utilitarian}} wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower bodyside and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black taillight bezels, SS fender and <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> emblems, special front and rear stabilizer bars, 14x7 inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{body was}} largely identical, except with new {{pressings}} {{for the front}} and <b>rear</b> <b>panels</b> to fit with the British Leyland [...] "corporate look", and to finally {{get rid of the}} tailfins of the original model.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the OmniTown could {{temporarily}} {{be ordered}} with modified Esteem front and <b>rear</b> <b>panels.</b> This version is currently operating with Metrobus and Preston Bus. The {{central part of}} the bodywork was the same as the OmniTown.|$|R

25|$|The 1974 Rambler American was a carryover. The only {{difference}} was {{the presence of}} the rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and the rear license plate was relocated {{to the center of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> over the gas filler. The standard wheels for the year were VAM's new 14x6-inch five-spoke design with volcano hubcaps. The 258 six included an evaporative canister to reduce emissions, and a slightly lower 8.3:1 compression ratio. However, during the mid-year, the compression ratio was lowered even more to 7.6:1. In both cases, the engines were still advertised as having an output of 170hp. The seat and door panel designs were revised. The parking brake pedal received a new smaller rubber pad.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme {{was also}} {{manufactured}} as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built. They were rear engined and the <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> design {{was different from}} the Supreme V as it has vents and had odd shaped moulding around the rear window. As a semi-integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no chassis members to support the body. Opening the side lockers luggage could be piled in one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way so it was very cutting edge technology. It is said that 2 of these survive today. The bulk of the 20 were exported, mainly to the Netherlands, the left hand drive version had a tapered front to meet Dutch swept turning-circle requirements.|$|E
25|$|The new car {{featured}} a more prominent long hood short deck styling, and was longer lower and {{wider than the}} 1969 models. The roofline was lower, while all models now {{featured a}} much less formal roof line than previous years. The windshield rake was increased, and the SportsRoof models had an even flatter fastback roofline. The overall styling appeared much more aerodynamic than years previous, and featured a pointed front end. The grille covered the full width of the front fascia, and surrounded the quad headlights. The front fender line extended to front door, sloping downward and gradually disappearing in the quarter panel. Both front and rear bumpers were slim tight fitting chromed units, that carefully followed the body lines. The taillights were situated in the <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> above the bumper, and were now long rectangular units with rounded outer edges.|$|E
50|$|The Chrysler CL models {{featured}} new grilles, a new {{nose cone}} and new bonnet, and, (on sedans), new <b>rear</b> <b>panels</b> including boot lid, lower panel and quarter panel. A panel van body style {{was added to}} the range in April 1977.|$|R
5000|$|For 1939 the Y7 tourer was {{replaced}} by the 8hp E94A Roadster. It retained the front styling, eight hp engine and 90" [...] wheelbase of the 7Y tourer but featured different <b>rear</b> <b>panels.</b> The E94A was produced only for the 1939 model year.|$|R
500|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/4 {{carried the}} 2 cm FlaK 30 mount {{on a special}} {{platform}} with fold-down side and <b>rear</b> <b>panels.</b> This platform was specifically designed for the Flak 30 mount and could not readily accept a Flak 38 mount or vice versa. To accommodate the gun mount the vehicle was both wider and taller than normal, namely [...] wide and [...] and weighed [...] empty. Four folding seats were fitted on the platform for the crew. Some of these gun mounts had a gun shield fitted. The ready ammunition bins fastened {{to the side and}} <b>rear</b> <b>panels</b> (four on each side and two in the rear) contained one 20-round magazine each. It usually towed an ammunition trailer (Sd.Ah. 51 - Sonderanhängerspecial single-axle trailer) with 640 more rounds, the gun's sights and its rangefinder.|$|R
25|$|For 1974, a new {{rear bumper}} system {{replaced}} the squared tail and chrome rear bumper blades introduced in 1968 with a trim, tapering urethane cover carrying an integral license plate holder and recesses for the trademark round taillights. Underneath sat a box-section aluminum impact bar on two Omark-bolt slider brackets {{similar to the}} system used in the nose which allowed the Corvette to pass federal five-mph impact tests at the rear {{as well as the}} front. The new rear design was quite beautiful, and more up-to-date than the 60's shape that it replaced with the vast majority of enthusiasts embracing the new design. For the 1974 model only, casting limitations mandated left and right bumper covers with a vertical center seam. The anti-theft alarm key activator was moved from the <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> to the front left fender. Tailpipes were now turned down as the new bumper cover eliminated the tailpipe extensions.|$|E
25|$|Gerard was commemorated by an {{elaborate}} memorial in Ashley parish church, which grew and was modified over several generations. The main structure, built {{under the supervision}} of Gilbert's son, Thomas, portrays him and Anne, lying in splendour. She has her Talbot dog at her side, while he is in full armour, an uncharacteristic garb for him, with a finely modelled gauntlet at his side. Beneath the Gerards is a cadaver, but, unlike the case of a normal cadaver tomb, it appears to date from an earlier period. The kneeling figure of Thomas Gerard looms over his parents at the head end, vigilant but not in prayer. A smaller kneeling and praying figure, said to be the younger son Ratcliffe, is placed {{at the feet of the}} couple. Both kneeling figures are completely free-standing and detached from the main structure, clearly added later and at the sacrifice of part of its moulded edge. The four daughters of Gilbert and Anne, all of whom survived their parents, are portrayed on a separate <b>rear</b> <b>panel.</b> Two more smaller kneeling and praying female figures, free-standing and detached, are placed to the front of the main structure - possibly daughters who predeceased their parents, but more likely of a later generation. The monument is surmounted by a vast, densely decorated alabaster canopy, displaying the armorial bearings of the Gerards and Radcliffes.|$|E
500|$|The {{fountain}} {{was originally}} installed facing south where it remained until 1963 {{when it was}} moved next to the Morton Wing addition facing west where it sits today. [...] In its original location it was visible from the Jackson and Michigan Avenue intersection once known as [...] "route center" [...] to the south. [...] The fountain was commissioned by the Benjamin Ferguson fund and one surface references the title B. F. Ferguson Fountain of the Great Lakes. [...] There is a relief sculpture of Benjamin Ferguson on the <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> that has been hidden from view since the fountain was moved.|$|E
5000|$|The Optare Sigma is a step-entrance {{single-deck}} bus {{body that}} was built by Optare between 1994 and 1996 on the Dennis Lance chassis. The body was constructed from Alusuisse aluminium alloy with GRP front and <b>rear</b> <b>panels.</b> It was the single-deck version of the Optare Spectra which had the same lower dash styling.|$|R
50|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/4 {{carried the}} 2 cm FlaK 30 mount {{on a special}} {{platform}} with fold-down side and <b>rear</b> <b>panels.</b> This platform was specifically designed for the Flak 30 mount and could not readily accept a Flak 38 mount or vice versa. To accommodate the gun mount the vehicle was both wider and taller than normal, namely 2.02 m wide and 2 m and weighed 4075 kg empty. Four folding seats were fitted on the platform for the crew. Some of these gun mounts had a gun shield fitted. The ready ammunition bins fastened {{to the side and}} <b>rear</b> <b>panels</b> (four on each side and two in the rear) contained one 20-round magazine each. It usually towed an ammunition trailer (Sd.Ah. 51 - Sonderanhänger - special single-axle trailer) with 640 more rounds, the gun's sights and its rangefinder.|$|R

2500|$|The 1969 Fairlane/Torino saw few {{cosmetic}} changes, {{but there}} were quite a few performance oriented changes. Ford performed the typical minor styling adjustments, but overall the 1969 models were similar to the 1968 models. The grille was revised slightly, and now had a more prominent centre dividing bar, while the taillights were restyled on non-fastback models to ape the big '69 Fords. [...] Fastbacks retained the 1968-style taillights and <b>rear</b> <b>panel.</b> [...] All models above the Fairlane, had an aluminium dividing bar that ran across the <b>rear</b> <b>panel,</b> between the taillights and inline with the reverse lights on SportsRoof models.|$|E
