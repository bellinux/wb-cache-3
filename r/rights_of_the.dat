5|$|Although the Belloni {{decision}} {{established the}} <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indians {{to exercise their}} treaty fishing rights, the states of Oregon and Washington continued to arrest Indians for violations of state law and regulations that infringed on those rights. In September 1970, the United States Attorney filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging {{that the state of}} Washington had infringed on the treaty <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, and Skokomish tribes. Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes intervened in the case. Defendants were the state of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.|$|E

5|$|The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a suit {{to enforce}} the treaty <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tribe. The trial {{court held that the}} {{property}} <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including the Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.|$|E

5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E

5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E

5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extraterrestrial beings.

If such a species {{were not to be}} treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
