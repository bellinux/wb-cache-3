40|$|It is {{currently}} constitutional to house {{male and female}} prisoners in separate jail facilities based solely on gender. But is it also constitutional to provide separate early <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> to male and female prisoners convicted of the same crime, in the same county, and sentenced to the same length of time based solely on gender and separate housing arrangements? For decades, jail officials in many counties have released some prisoners {{before the end of}} their judicially mandated sentences to relieve overcrowding and meet budget constraints. A small study of jails around the country conducted as research for this Article reflects the differences these early <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> can have between genders. The United States Supreme Court has never directly addressed the issue of differing early <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> based on gender, and lower federal courts have only addressed the constitutionality of unequal programs and services for male and female inmates. Some of these courts analyzed prisoners 2 ̆ 7 equal protection claims under heightened or intermediate scrutiny, while others have given wide discretion to prison administrators concerning varying needs of individual prisons and applied only rational basis review. This Article argues that all gender-based equal protection claims made by prisoners should be analyzed using intermediate scrutiny, rather than the more deferential rational basis test, and that male and female prisoners subject to early <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> should be deemed similarly situated in an equal protection analysis. Specifically, it suggests that separate gender-based early <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> are not gender-neutral, even when they appear facially neutral, because of the causal relationship between these policies and the segregation of men and women into separate prison facilities. Accordingly, the Article finds such policies unconstitutional under the intermediate scrutiny standard. Finally, this Article concludes with suggestions for altering these problematic early <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> in ways that are both gender-neutral and cost effective...|$|R

40|$|Many {{organizations}} specify complex information <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> {{to describe}} the terms under which sensitive information may be released to organizations outside of their control. In this paper, we present AIR, a formal language for describing information <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> in terms of security automata. Each automaton’s state transitions correspond to conditions that must be satisfied before information may be released, and released information may be optionally downgraded. We give a semantics to AIR policies by translating them into an API for programs written in λAIR, a core formalism for a purely functional programming language. Through its use of dependent, singleton, and affine types, λAIR’s type system assists in the proof that programs use an AIR policy API correctly. Our work takes an important step toward building software, such as so-called cross-domain guards, that can be verified to correctly enforce high-level information <b>release</b> <b>policies.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Information {{security}} has {{a challenge to}} address: enabling information-flow controls with expressive information <b>release</b> (or declassification) <b>policies.</b> Existing approaches tend to address some aspects of information release, exposing the other aspects for possible attacks. It is striking that these approaches fall into two mostly separate categories: revelation-based (as in information purchase, aggregate computation, moves in a game, etc.) and encryption-based declassification (as in sending encrypted secrets over an untrusted network, storing passwords, etc.). This paper introduces gradual <b>release,</b> a <b>policy</b> that unifies declassification, encryption, and key <b>release</b> <b>policies.</b> We model an attacker’s knowledge by the sets of possible secret inputs as functions of publicly observable outputs. The essence of gradual release is that this knowledge must remain constant between releases. Gradual release {{turns out to be}} a powerful foundation for <b>release</b> <b>policies,</b> which we demonstrate by formally connecting revelation-based and encryption-based declassification. Furthermore, we show that gradual release can be provably enforced by security types and effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Distributed proof {{construction}} protocols {{have been}} shown to be valuable for reasoning about authorization decisions in open distributed environments such as pervasive computing spaces. Unfortunately, existing distributed proof protocols offer only limited support for protecting the confidentiality of sensitive facts, which limits their utility in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a distributed proof construction protocol in which the release of a fact’s truth value can be made contingent upon facts managed by other principals in the system. We formally prove that our protocol can safely prove conjunctions of facts without leaking the truth values of individual facts, even in the face of colluding adversaries and fact <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> with cyclical dependencies. This facilitates the definition of context-sensitive <b>release</b> <b>policies</b> that enable the conditional use of sensitive facts in distributed proofs. ...|$|R
