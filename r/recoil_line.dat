40|$|Inelastic neutron {{scattering}} measurements of "/-MnO 2 at 30, 100 and 200 K give S(Q, to) maps of intensity over large o 1 energy and momentum transfer anges (from 0 to 1 eV and from 0 to 40 A-, respectively). They reveal a ridge of intensity due to recoil of free particles with effective mass of [...] 1 amu. The {{width of the}} <b>recoil</b> <b>line</b> is one order of magnitude greater than that anticipated from the kinetic momentum distribution of an isolated gas of protons at {{the temperature of the}} sample. Several models are considered: ideal gas obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann or Fermi statistics, multiple scattering, phonon wings, protons trapped in shallow potentials and quantum correlations between free and bound protons. None of them is satisfactory. Finally, broadening by zero-point motions of the lattice provides a satisfactory theoretical framework to represent the shape and intensity of the recoil spectra. New aspects of proton dynamics in 3,-MnO 2 are highlighted. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} post-demagnetization {{performance}} of interior permanent magnet (IPM) ac machines by employing the more accurate <b>recoil</b> <b>line</b> approach {{based on a}} 2 -D transient finite-element analysis (FEA). The method predicts continuous demagnetization of each magnet element undergoing partial demagnetization and evaluates the machine behavior after an event of short-circuit faults across its terminals. Along with the short-circuit faults, a failure in a drive controller or a position sensor, which {{may lead to a}} reverse voltage across the machine terminals that can eventually be more fatal and can cause significant reduction in the performance due to high levels of demagnetization, is analyzed as the worst case scenario. The FE predicted post-demagnetization performance is validated by experimental measurements in which a six-phase IPM machine designed for electric vehicle traction is allowed to lose its synchronization with the inverter when forced to operate on a torque-speed envelope, which is way beyond the drive voltage setting...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{techniques}} for characterization of longitudinal recording media using remanence measurements are extended to perpendicular media, {{in particular to}} Alumite, and correction for demagnetizing fields is taken into account. It is found that these techniques have limited value because of {{the sensitivity of the}} analysis to the correction factor used. Measurement of the <b>recoil</b> <b>lines</b> is investigated as an alternative method of probing the reversal processes...|$|R
50|$|The Mateba Autorevolver's barrel {{alignment}} {{is different}} from most other revolvers. The barrel is aligned with {{the bottom of the}} cylinder instead of the top. This lowers the bore axis (line of the barrel) which directs the <b>recoil</b> in <b>line</b> with the shooter's hand thereby reducing the twisting motion or muzzle flip of normal revolvers.|$|R
60|$|At {{the battle}} of the Boyne, Walter Davenant, with his father's troop, had taken part in all the desperate charges upon the enemy. During the long hours the battle had lasted, the cavalry had been incessantly engaged. Time after time they had charged down upon the Dutch squares, and no sooner had the ranks been reformed, after <b>recoiling</b> from the <b>line</b> of fixed bayonets, than they were called upon to charge in another direction.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} inelastic neutron {{scattering}} (INS) spectroscopy {{to study the}} "A, B, C" region of the hydrogen bond in potassium dihydrogen arsenate. The broad spectral feature observed in infrared spectroscopy is shown {{to be associated with}} a ridge of constant intensity in the INS, which follows the <b>recoil</b> <b>line</b> for a unit-mass particle. The onset energy of the ridge is unclear but, we believe, is associated with the optical "C" feature at 1610 cm(- 1), and which we assign to nu(O-H). The "B" and "A" optical bands were both demonstrated to be two-quantum events and are, thus, not associated with the fundamental nu(O-H). They are readily assigned to the harmonic overtone delta(OH) (0 - 2) and the combination gamma(OH) (0 - 1) + delta(OH) (0 - 1), which both sit astride the ridge and there is no evidence for Evans' holes. The other overtone, gamma(OH) (0 - 2), has been assigned to a very weak feature, observed {{for the first time at}} 1900 cm(- 1). A simple model was used to describe the intensity distributions. ...|$|E
60|$|The {{surprise}} of the French army at finding themselves {{in the presence of}} the English was so great that the first <b>line</b> <b>recoiled</b> in confusion. Those marching up from behind imagined that they had been already engaged and repulsed by the English, and the disorder spread through the whole army, and was increased by the common people, who had crowded to the field in immense numbers from the whole country round to see the battle and share in the plunder of the English camp.|$|R
40|$|Krolik (1989) {{pointed out}} that {{frequency}} redistribution due to scattering {{is more important than}} cosmological expansion in determining the Ly-alpha frequency profile during cosmological recombination, and that its effects substantially modify the rate of recombination. Although the first statement is true, the second statement is not: a basic symmetry of photon scattering leads to identical cancellations which almost completely erase the effects of both coherent and incoherent scattering. Only a small correction due to atomic <b>recoil</b> alters the <b>line</b> profile from the prediction of pure cosmological expansion, so that the pace of cosmological recombination can be well approximated by ignoring Ly-alpha scattering...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{measurements}} during AMPTE {{solar wind}} ion releases are described. The {{creation of a}} diamagnetic cavity, compression and draping of magnetic field <b>lines,</b> <b>recoil</b> of the entire artificial comet, and ion beam and tail formation are discussed. The wave measurements {{were used to determine}} the time variation of the plasma density from the measurement of the electron plasma frequency and to determine the state of cloud expansion and cavity formation. Features found include absence of strong turbulence and anomalous diffusion in the cavity boundary, and the appearance of very intense shock-like emission in front of the plasma clouds. The first effect suggests partially unknowm processes leading to magnetic field penetration into the region of the clouds. The direct observation of the interaction processes between the fast streaming solar wind plasma and the expanding cloud plasma of the Li and artificial comet releases may have relevance to astrophysical situations as, for instance, encountered in solar flares, interstellar clouds, or during accretion of matter onto compact objects...|$|R
5000|$|The scooter is {{generally}} unmotorized, and has mountain-bike-style tires ranging from 16" [...] to 26". These are not razor-type mini scooters, {{which would be}} dangerous in this sport. The scooters incorporate mountain-bike-style brakes and have a large footboard to stand on and kick off from. The scooters are occasionally called kick bikes {{because they are not}} yet largely marketed for the activity of dog scootering, although Pawtrekkers have a 'brushbow' attachment on the front to protect the dogs from the wheel and to provide an ideal pulling position for connecting the ganglines. Some of the other scooters like Diggler's Alpha Dawg also incorporate front shocks similar to mountain bikes to absorb bumps better and has a <b>recoiling</b> tug <b>line</b> that works to managing the gang line efficiently.the scooter is commonly used in (dry land [...] ) or dirt based racing through forests , A single dog or two dogs are the maximum on the scooter in Australian sled dog racing, three and more will use a rig (gig) typically 3 or four wheels. With limited snow in Australia, dry land racing is popular in all states of Australia, as of 2016, only Northern Territory does not have a registered competition. At present there are 4 snow races in Victoria, Australia, using typical snow sleds, and skijoring [...]An alternative is to use a bicycle instead of a scooter. This is seen as a more dangerous alternative, as it is more difficult to dismount a bicycle in an emergency. This alternative activity of harnessing dogs to a bicycle is known as bikejoring.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Durutte {{supervised}} the attack of his 1,700-man 2nd Brigade {{on the extreme}} right. About 1:30 PM, he sent his troops into the little valley in front of Papelotte and La Haye, covered by 18 horse artillery pieces and Jacquinot's cavalry. The original skirmish <b>line</b> <b>recoiled</b> before enemy fire and Durutte quickly reinforced it with battalions in open order. He also sent a horse battery to take Smohain under point-blank fire. Two battalions soon overran Papelotte and victory seemed to be at hand. At this moment, Durutte rode back to the ridge and found to his dismay that the 1st Brigade was crushed and the ground to his left covered with rampaging British cavalry. With the Dutch-Belgian cavalry brigade of Charles Étienne de Ghigny advancing downhill toward them, he had {{the men of the}} 2nd Brigade execute a hasty retreat covered by one of Jacquinot's regiments. The brigade was able to withdraw behind a battalion square from the VI Corps. These troops drove off Ghigny's light horsemen {{with the help of a}} nearby artillery battery.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that localized topological defects (solitons) experience recoil when they suffer an impact by incident particles. Higher-dimensional topological defects develop distinctive wave patterns propagating along their worldvolume under similar circumstances. For 1 -dimensional topological defects (vortex lines), these wave patterns fail to decay in the asymptotic future: the propagating wave eventually displaces the vortex line a finite distance {{away from its}} original position (the distance {{is proportional to the}} transferred momentum). The quantum version of this phenomenon, which we call ``local recoil'', {{can be seen as a}} simple geometric manifestation of the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in 1 + 1 dimensions. Analogously to soliton recoil, local <b>recoil</b> of vortex <b>lines</b> is associated with infrared divergences in perturbative expansions. In perturbative string theory, such divergences appear in amplitudes for closed strings scattering off a static D 1 -brane. Through a Dirac-Born-Infeld analysis, it is possible to resum these divergences in a way that yields finite, momentum-conserving amplitudes.

60|$|The {{second line}} of battle {{was now in}} disorder, broken by the {{fugitive}} men and horses of Sir Clugnet's party, smitten with the arrows to {{which they had been}} exposed as that party melted away, and by those of the English archers in the wood on their flank. The confusion heightened every moment as wounded knights tried to withdraw from the fight, and others from behind struggled to take their places in front. Soon the disorder became terrible. The archers plucked up their stakes and ran forward; the French <b>line</b> <b>recoiled</b> at their approach in order to get into fairer order; and the archers, with loud shouts of victory, slung their bows behind them, dropped the stakes, and with axe and bill-hook rushed at the horsemen. These were too tightly wedged together to use their lances, and as they had retired they had come into newly-ploughed ground, which had been so soaked by the heavy rain that the horses sank in the deep mud to their knees, many almost to their bellies. Into the midst of this helpless crowd of armed men the English archers burst. Embarrassed by their struggling horses, scarcely able to wield their arms in the press, seeing but scantily, and that only in front through the narrow slits of their vizors, the chivalry of France died almost unresistingly.|$|R
