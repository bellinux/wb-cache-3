5|$|Amira goes to Yusef for help, {{saying she}} needs him on her side, {{threatening}} to tell Zainab that Yusef {{bought her a}} plane ticket {{if he does not}} help her get Syed back. She convinces Zainab to talk to Yusef, and when Yusef sees 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), who has <b>recently</b> <b>come</b> out as homosexual, running out of Christian's flat, he asks if Christian acted inappropriately. At first Ben says nothing happened but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian touched him, and they tell Ben's father, Phil. This turns out to be untrue, but leads to Christian leaving Syed and Walford.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{was criticized}} {{severely}} {{by the international}} press for lax security measures in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle a pistol on board, and for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in Hannover. Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had <b>recently</b> <b>come</b> under fire after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that the explosives had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, the Frankfurt airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent security procedures.|$|E

5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. The White Girl shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had <b>recently</b> <b>come</b> in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory of innocence and its loss, and as a religious allusion to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has <b>recently</b> <b>come</b> to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E
