40|$|Finite element {{simulations}} of a rollover <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> {{are an important}} aspect in its design, as it provides a means of structural integrity qualification prior to the required destructive testing. A good understanding of the rollover <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> behaviour under simulated loading offers engineering practitioners the opportunity to optimize the design. The testing conditions, which are outlined in the applicable standards, result in plastic deformation of the rollover <b>protective</b> <b>structure,</b> associated with material hardening of various areas of the structure. An accurate description of the material behaviour is important for finite element {{simulations of}} the structural response. This research examines some of the hardening models commonly used in simulations of rollover <b>protective</b> <b>structures,</b> which are available in most finite element commercial software, including linear and multi-linear isotropic and kinematic hardening models and non-linear kinematic hardening models. The numerical performance of the plasticity models in representing the material behaviour was compared with the experimental data for commonly used rollover <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> material. Analysis revealed the potential benefits and drawbacks of the various models. Moreover, a damage-induced softening model was implemented at the structure joints {{in conjunction with the}} non-linear hardening models. Enhanced computational results were obtained through this modelling variation, highlighting the importance of material modelling at the primary structure and the joints of a rollover <b>protective</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Tractor rollovers are a {{major cause}} of farm {{injuries}} and fatalities. The authors used data from a statewide surveillance study to estimate the prevalence of safety features such as rollover <b>protective</b> <b>structures,</b> seat belts, and power take-off shields on farm tractors in Kentucky. METHODS: Using data from the Farm Family Health and Hazard Surveillance Project, the authors report on the prevalence of farm tractor safety features by size of farm, by region of the state, by number of tractors per farm, and by tractor age and estimate the prevalence of tractors equipped with rollover protection by region and for the state as a whole. RESULTS: Of the estimated 85, 446 family-owned farms in Kentucky with at least one tractor, an estimated 55. 6 %, or 47, 515 farms, do not have a tractor equipped with a rollover <b>protective</b> <b>structure.</b> Few tractors that are 10 years old or older were found to be equipped with seat belts; no tractors that were more than 20 years old were equipped with seat belts. CONCLUSIONS: Kentucky, with an estimated 25 to 30 tractor-related fatalities each year, may contribute up to 20 % {{of the total number of}} farm tractor fatalities in the nation. The overall prevalence of rollover <b>protective</b> <b>structures</b> on tractors in Kentucky is lower than estimates for other states as reported in national survey data.

40|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>structures</b> are {{designed}} explicitly to fulfil a function {{that in many}} cases is an extreme event; therefore, an explicit design has to properly and precisely account for the nature of the solicitation imposed by the extreme event. Extreme events such as explosions or earthquakes are reduced to design criteria on the basis of either empirical or historical data. To determine the design criteria, the physical data has to be translated into physical variables (amplitudes, pressures, frequencies, etc.) that are then imposed to the <b>protective</b> <b>structure.</b> While there is debate on the precision and comprehensive nature of this translation, years of research have provided strong physical arguments in supporting these methods. Performance is then quantified {{on the basis of the}} structure 2 ̆ 7 s capability to perform its required function. Classified solicitations may then be used to translate performance into prescribed requirements that provide an implicitly high confidence that the structure performs its function. When addressing fire, performance has been traditionally determined by imposing standardized requirements that necessarily attempt to bear a strong relationship with the reality of potential events - the fire performance of a <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> is thus defined as a fire resistance period. This paper addresses the concept of fire resistance and its relevance to the design of <b>protective</b> <b>structures.</b> The mathematical description of the thermal boundary conditions for a fire is of extreme complexity, therefore simplified approaches, that include the Fire Resistance concept, are currently used. By using classical heat transfer and structural engineering arguments, the work described herein demonstrates that an adequate level of complexity and precision for the thermal boundary conditions and input parameter is fundamental to correctly describe the response of a structure during a fire event. Simple criteria are presented to qualify the relevance of current approaches and to highlight important issues to be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{according}} {{to the structure of}} warships, the equivalence method of the <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> with reinforcing ribs is presented abided by the principal of equivalence in rigidity. The minimized model and the equivalence model of the <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> with reinforcing ribs penetrated by projectiles are investigated in experiment and numerical simulations, and the results show that the equivalence method of the <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> is reasonable. The reinforcing ribs are extensively used in <b>protective</b> <b>structures,</b> especially in ship structures. The reinforcing ribs are characterized in extensive distribution range and little weight of unit length, and have the main effect that the rigidity requirement of the structure is satisfied so that the structure has enough rigidity stability. However, the big and the small reinforcing ribs in actual structures originally have small size of the cross sectional area (CSA). According to a usual model research method, after an original structure is proportionally reduced {{according to}} the minimized proportion of one to four [1], the size of the CSA of the big and the small reinforcing ribs becomes smaller, and the shape of the cross sectional area is shown in Figure 1. Under such circumstances, an experimental research on the dynamic response of the reinforcing ribs under the impact load has the characteristics of great difficulty and bad feasibility, and in addition, the reliability of reflecting target characteristic by a proportionally reduced model is very low [2]. In order to study the action of the reinforcing ribs more objectively, the T-shaped cross section of the reinforcing ribs is converted to a rectangular cross section {{according to the}} principle of rigidity equivalence, and then, the action can be researched actually. The study method is given as follows. Equivalence method Firstly, the following formula is used...|$|R

40|$|Several {{federal and}} state {{agencies}} have promulgated regulations that require the installation of operator <b>protective</b> <b>structures</b> on mobile equipment used in mining, construction, agriculture and logging industries. These regulations cover {{many different types of}} vehicles, from small farm tractors to large rubber-tired front-end loaders, and require structures that help protect the operator from death or injury from vehicle overturns, from falling tree tops and logs, from falling rocks, and from tree limbs in clearing operations. Two general types of vehicle operator <b>protective</b> <b>structures</b> have evolved over the past twenty years. The first of these is the "Roll-Over Protective Structure'' or "ROPS" that is essentially a "roll bar" or "roll cage" that provides a relatively safe area for the vehicle operator if the vehicle should tip over and roll. The second <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> is the "Falling Object Protective Structure" or "FOPS" that provides overhead protection against falling material. The terms "ROPS" and "FOPS" are often used interchangeably (sometimes inaccurately) with "cabs", canopies, "roll bars", protective structures" and other such descriptive names. In this report, "ROPS" describes the function of the structure; "FOPS" also describes a particular function.
