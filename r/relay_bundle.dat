30|$|In [15], Zhang et al. {{presented}} {{the impact of}} finite buffer and short contact duration when using the epidemic routing protocol [42] and evaluated drop policies such as drop-head (Drop Oldest), drop-tail and drop-head high priority. For the drop-head policy, when a node receives a new bundle and its buffer is full, the node drops the oldest bundle. Using drop-tail, when the buffer of a node is full, the node will not accept any bundle. As for the last policy, (i) if a source bundle, one that is transmitted by a source node, is sent to a node with a full buffer, the receiving node will first drop the oldest <b>relayed</b> <b>bundle.</b> Here, a “relayed bundle” is one forwarded by a non-source node. If there are no <b>relayed</b> <b>bundles,</b> the node drops the oldest source bundle, (ii) if a <b>relayed</b> <b>bundle</b> is sent to a node with a full buffer, the receiving node drops the oldest <b>relayed</b> <b>bundle</b> {{and if there is}} no <b>relayed</b> <b>bundle,</b> the new <b>relayed</b> <b>bundle</b> is not accepted.|$|R

Such factors cause incomplete transmissions and the waste of link capacity. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of node localization in VDTNs. The exchange of signaling information related to nodes’ real-time location, current trajectory, velocity, and transmit range allows a Contact Prediction Algorithm to estimate contact durations. This information can be used in conjunction with additional signaling information (e. g. link data rate), to determine the maximum number of bytes that can be transmitted during contact opportunities. A Contact Duration Scheduling Policy can use this information to prevent incomplete transmissions, while increasing the number of successfully <b>relayed</b> <b>bundles</b> and improving data link utilization. Through a simulation study, we investigate the benefits of introducing the concept of node localization, and evaluate the performance of the proposed Contact Prediction Algorithm and Contact Duration Scheduling Policy. We demonstrate the gains introduced by this approach in comparison with an environment where VDTN nodes have no access to localization information.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of wireless devices {{along with the}} increase in user mobility have created new challenges such as network partitioning and intermittent connectivity. These new challenges have become apparent in many situations where the transmission of critical data is of high priority. Disaster rescue groups, for example, are equipped with numerous devices which constantly gather and transmit various forms of data. The challenge of establishing communication between groups of this type has led to an evolutionary form of networks which we consider in this paper, namely, Delay Tolerant Mobile Networks (DTMNs). Nodes in DTMNs usually form clusters that we define as regions. Nodes within each region have end-to-end paths between them. Both regions, as well as nodes within a region, can be either stationary or mobile. For such environments, we propose using a dedicated set of messengers that <b>relay</b> message <b>bundles</b> between these regions. Our goal is to understand how messenger scheduling can be used to improve network performance and connectedness. We develop several classes of messenger scheduling algorithms which can be used to achieve inter-regional communication in such environments. We use simulation to better understand the performance and tradeoffs between these algorithms...|$|R

This work considers a priority classes of service (CoS) model and investigates how different buffer management strategies can be combined with drop and scheduling policies, to provide strict priority based services, or to provide custom allocation of network resources.

40|$|Monocentric lenses provide compact, broadband, high resolution, wide-field imaging. However, {{they produce}} a curved image surface and have found limited use. The {{use of an}} {{appropriately}} machined fiber <b>bundle</b> to <b>relay</b> the curved image plane onto a flat focal plane array (FPA) has recently emerged as a potential solution. Unfortunately the spatial sampling that is intrinsic to the fiber <b>bundle</b> <b>relay</b> can {{have a negative effect}} on image resolution, and vignetting has been identified as another potential shortcoming of this solution. This thesis describes a metamaterial lens yielding a high-performance image relay from a curved surface to a flat focal plane. Using quasi-conformal transformation optics, a Maxwell's fish-eye lens is transformed into a concave-plano shape. A design with a narrower range of constitutive parameters is deemed more likely to be manufacturable. Therefore, the way in which the particular shape of the concave-plano reimager influences the range of needed constitutive parameters is explored. Finally, image quality metrics, such as spot size and light efficiency, are quantified...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} demand {{on behalf of the}} consumer, medical and {{military}} industries to make lighter weight, higher resolution, wider field-of-view and extended depth- of-focus cameras. This leads to design trade-offs between performance and cost, be it size, weight, power, or expense. This has brought attention to finding new ways to extend the design space while adhering to cost constraints. Extending the functionality of an imager in order to achieve extraordinary performance is a common theme of computational imaging, a field of study which uses additional hardware along with tailored algorithms to formulate and solve inverse problems in imaging. This dissertation details four specific systems within this emerging field: a Fiber <b>Bundle</b> <b>Relayed</b> Imaging System, an Extended Depth-of-Focus Imaging System, a Platform Motion Blur Image Restoration System, and a Compressive Imaging System. The Fiber <b>Bundle</b> <b>Relayed</b> Imaging System {{is part of a larger}} project, where the work presented in this thesis was to use image processing techniques to mitigate problems inherent to fiber <b>bundle</b> image <b>relay</b> and then, form high-resolution wide field-of-view panoramas captured from multiple sensors within a custom state-of-the-art imager. The Extended Depth-of-Focus System goals were to characterize the angular and depth dependence of the PSF of a focal swept imager in order to increase the acceptably focused imaged scene depth. The goal of the Platform Motion Blur Image Restoration System was to build a system that can capture a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), long-exposure image which is inherently blurred while at the same time capturing motion data using additional optical sensors in order to deblur the degraded images. Lastly, the objective of the Compressive Imager was to design and build a system functionally similar to the Single Pixel Camera and use it to test new sampling methods for image generation and to characterize it against a traditional camera. These computational imaging systems share a common theme in that they seek to accomplish camera designs that meet more demanding system requirements through the use of additional measurements made possible by hardware modifications, while relying on modeling and computational methods in order to provide valuable scene informatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The use of {{vehicular}} {{infrastructure to}} establish connectivity between isolated stationary Information Relay Sta-tions is an appealing application of Terrestrial Delay-Tolerant Networking. A source opportunistically releases data bundles to vehicles that randomly enter its range. In turn, those vehicles store the received bundles, carry and deliver {{them to their}} intended destination. It follows that a contemporaneous source-destination end-to-end path does not exist. Consequently, bundles experience longer queueing periods at the source. Under such circumstances, the end-to-end bundle delivery delays become several orders of magnitude higher than those experienced in traditional wireless networks. In this context, bundle delivery delay minimization emerges as a challenging problem {{that has not been}} adequately addressed in the open literature. This paper proposes a simple Probabilistic <b>Bundle</b> <b>Relay</b> Strategy with Bulk Bundle Release (PBRS-BBR) that aims at minimizing the average end-to-end bundle delivery delay while capturing the essence of vehicular delay-tolerant networking in that it revolves around minimal network information knowledge.

40|$|Abstract—Delay-tolerant {{networks}} (DTNs) {{provide a}} promising solution to support wide-ranging {{applications in the}} regions where end-to-end network connectivity is not available. In DTNs, the intermediate nodes on a communication path are expected to store, carry, and forward the in-transit messages (or bundles) in an opportunistic way, which is called opportunistic data forwarding. Such a forwarding method depends on the hypothesis that each individual node is ready to forward packets for others. This assumption, however, might easily be violated due {{to the existence of}} selfish or even malicious nodes, which may be unwilling to waste their precious wireless resources to serve as <b>bundle</b> <b>relays.</b> To address this problem, we propose a secure multilayer credit-based incentive scheme to stimulate bundle forwarding cooperation among DTN nodes. The proposed scheme can be implemented in a fully distributed manner to thwart various attacks without relying on any tamperproof hardware. In addition, we introduce several efficiency optimization techniques to improve the overall efficiency by exploiting the unique characteristics of DTNs. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Index Terms—Delay-tolerant networks (DTNs), incentive scheme, security. I...|$|R

40|$|Delay/Disruption {{tolerant}} networks (DTNs) are self-organized wireless ad-hoc networks, where end-to-end connectivity can not {{be guaranteed}} and communications rely {{on the assumption that}} the nodes are willing to store-carry-and-forward bundles in an opportunistic way.

To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose SUC-CESS, a secure user-centric and social-aware reputation based incentive scheme for DTNs. Different from conventional reputation schemes which rely on neighboring nodes to monitor the traffic and keep tracks of each other’s reputation, SUCCESS allows a node to manage its reputation evidence and demonstrate its reputation whenever necessary. Two concepts, self-check and community-check, are defined for reputation evaluation according to the candidate’s forwarding competency and the sufficiency of the evidence shown by the node itself, and for speeding up reputation establishment and forming consensus views towards targets in the same community, respectively.
