Different mixture rate of carbocoal with coal and different final temperature on coal pyrolysis tempereature rising characteristics were studied in the work. The results indicate: Coal is a poorly microwave absorbing material. Because carbocoal can be fast heated in microwave field, {{so it can be}} used as additive for coal pyrolysis. Carbocoal otained from different pyrolysis temperature have different heating rate, along with the increase of carbocoal pyrolysis temperature, carbocoal heating rate increases in microwave field.

But using the copper anode, it changed from <b>rising</b> <b>characteristics</b> to dropping or flat characteristics with increasing of the arc current, and arc voltage rising ratio, {{in the region of}} <b>rising</b> <b>characteristics,</b> became large as the radial distance (R_a) of anode from nozzle axis was increased. Using tungusten anode, anode spot of which temperature was 3, 700 ∿ 4, 400 K and diameter was 0. 08 ∿ 0. 13 mm always existed.

This effective interaction is then used to describe dense hadronic matter relevant to neutron stars in the nonrelativistic Thomas-Fermi approach.

An error was found in calculations for the band pass amplifier discussed in Group 9 of the Electronics Progress Report,MLM- 306, March 1 [...] 31, 1949, on the Cathode-Follower Probe. New calculations have been made and a band pass filter constructed to match the new values. Work on the cathode-follower circuit for coupling a Boron-wall tube to its linear amplifier indicated that the limit to the sharpness of a pulse which could be achieved was possibly caused by poor amplitude versus frequency response of the linear amplifier. To check this theory, modifications were made on an existing scaler {{which resulted in a}} frequency response flat up to 4. 5 megacycles. Plans are being made to improve the amplitude versus frequency of the higher frequencies. The response curve shows a slightly <b>rising</b> <b>characteristic</b> at 4. 5 megacycles and an attenuation at 7 megacycles.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 74 - 82. Dynamic textures {{are moving}} image sequences that exhibit stationary characteristics in time such as fire, smoke, {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) plumes, waves, etc. Most surveillance applications already have motion detection and recognition capability, but dynamic texture detection algorithms are not integral part of these applications. In this thesis, image processing based algorithms for detection of specific dynamic textures are developed. Our methods can be developed in practical surveillance applications to detect VOC leaks, fire and smoke. The method developed for VOC emission detection in infrared videos uses a change detection algorithm to find the rising VOC plume. The <b>rising</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the plume is detected using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The dark regions that are formed on the leaking equipment are found using a background subtraction algorithm. Another method is developed based on an active learning algorithm {{that is used to}} detect wild fires at night and close range flames. The active learning algorithm is based on the Least-Mean-Square (LMS) method. Decisions from the sub-algorithms, each of which characterize a certain property of the texture to be detected, are combined using the LMS algorithm to reach a final decision. Another image processing method is developed to detect fire and smoke from moving camera video sequences. The global motion of the camera is compensated by finding an affine transformation between the frames using optical flow and RANSAC. Three frame change detection methods with motion compensation are used for fire detection with a moving camera. A background subtraction algorithm with global motion estimation is developed for smoke detection. Günay, OsmanM. S...|$|E

The model is developed by applying both the average flow model and the elastic contact model between the friction disk and separator plate. The key components during wet clutch engagement are the separator plate, friction disk, and lubricant. The one-dimension transient models of heat transfer in radial direction for the three components are built {{on the basis of}} the heat transfer theory and the conservation law of energy. The friction transmission model and transient heat transfer models are coupled and solved by using the Runge-Kutta numerical method, and the radial temperature distribution and their detailed parametric study for the three components are conducted separately. The simulation results show that the radial temperature for the three components rises with the increase of radius in engagement. The changes in engagement pressure, lubricant viscosity, friction lining permeability, combined surface roughness RMS, equivalent elasticity modulus, difference between dynamic and static friction coefficients, and lubricant flow have important influence on the temperature <b>rise</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The proposed models can get better understanding of the dynamic temperature <b>rise</b> <b>characteristics</b> of wet clutch engagement...|$|R

40|$|Axial {{compressors}} in aero {{engines are}} prone to suffering a breakdown of orderly flow when operating {{at the peak of}} the pressure <b>rise</b> <b>characteristic.</b> The damaging potential of separated flows is why a safe distance has to be left between every possible operating point and an operating point at which stall occurs. During earlier investigations of stall inception mechanisms, a new type of prestall instability has been found. In this study, it could be demonstrated that the prestall instability characterised by discrete flow disturbances can be clearly assigned to the subject of “Rotating Instabilities”. Propagating disturbances are responsible for the rise in blade passing irregularity. If the mass flow is reduced successively, the level of irregularity increases until the prestall condition devolves into rotating stall. The primary objective of the current work is to highlight the basic physics behind these prestall disturbances by complementary experimental and numerical investigations. Before reaching the peak of the pressure <b>rise</b> <b>characteristic</b> flow, disturbances appear as small vortex tubes with one end attached to the casing and the other attached to the suction surface of the rotor blade. These vortex structures arise when the entire tip region is affected by blockage and at the same time the critical rotor incidence is not exceeded in this flow regime. Furthermore, a new stall indicator was developed by applying statistical methods to the unsteady pressure signal measured over the rotor blade tips, thus granting a better control of the safety margin...|$|R

40|$|Stall {{inception}} in a three-stage axial compressor has been suppressed over {{a range of}} previously unstable operating points through the feedback of velocity perturbations to the inlet flow field. Perturbations were generated using 12 individually actuated guide vanes at the compressor inlet. The operating range was extended by 7. 8 % to a slope of 0. 9 on the pressure <b>rise</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Over this range data describing the compressor's pressure rise and torque were collected. Flow field measurements upstream of the compressor revealed the excitation of spatial harmonics in the annular flow field before stall inception. With or without feedback, a spatial mode was observed to grow into a stall cell without a discontinuity of amplitude or position. The decrease in the stall inception mass flow {{as a result of}} damping the critical spatial mode indicated the importance of spatial modes in the stall inception process in this compressor. Destabilization was originally caused by the first mode. After stabilizing an under-damped mode, the flow range was extended until the next sequential mode became unstable. The independent behavior of the modes before stall inception is described by four versions of a small disturbance model of compressor dynamics adapted from that of Moore and Greitzer. The two more sophisticated versions are presented here for the first time. The models require a description of the compressor's geometry, knowledge of its pressure <b>rise</b> <b>characteristic,</b> and some versions require a lag parameter characterizing the pressure rise response lag. The response lag parameter which enabled the models to most accurately predict the open-loop compressor dynamics was consistent with published values. The open-loop modal dynamics were determined experimentally and could be accurately described by the dynamics represented in the simplest model. The open-loop dynamics were measured for the first three modes over a range of stable and formerly unstable operating points. The more elaborate models gave accurate predictions of the closed-loop compressor performance, and the most accurate one predicted the flow range extension with less than 1. 5 % error.
