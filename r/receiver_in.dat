5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal <b>receiver.</b> <b>In</b> this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Callender's true success, however, was in {{the passing}} game, where he accrued 92yards, putting him first among all {{receivers}} in the game. Callender's 13catches were an ACC Championship Game record and were the fourth-highest total for a <b>receiver</b> <b>in</b> any game in ACC history. Wide receiver Kevin Challenger finished the game with 4catches for 45yards, while the Eagles' Rich Gunnell finished the game with 54yards.

5|$|DuMont Laboratories {{was founded}} in 1931 by Dr. Allen B. DuMont with only $1,000, and a {{laboratory}} in his basement. He and his staff were responsible for many early technical innovations, including the first consumer all-electronic television <b>receiver</b> <b>in</b> 1938. The company's television receivers soon became the gold standard of the industry. In 1942, DuMont worked with the Army in developing radar technology during World War II. This brought in $5 million for the company.|$|E
5|$|In a game {{noted for}} {{dominant}} defense performances for both teams, offensively, both Alabama and LSU had similar statistics. The Crimson Tide compiled 295yards of total offense {{as compared to}} LSU's 239yards. Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron completed 16 of 28passes for 199passing yards.

5|$|Jarrett Lee {{entered the}} game as the Tigers' {{starting}} quarterback. However after he threw a pair of interceptions, Lee was replaced by Jordan Jefferson {{for the remainder of}} the game. In the game, Lee completed 3 of 7 passes for 24yards and Jefferson completed 6 of 10 passes for 67yards.

5|$|Johnson {{was also}} rated {{as the best}} player in Georgia, No.12 in the Southeast and No.37 in the nation by Rivals.com, the No.7 wide <b>receiver</b> <b>in</b> the nation by SuperPrep, and first-team all-state {{selection}} (Class AAAA) by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Finally, he was tabbed to the AJC's preseason Super11. By {{the time he was a}} junior, he was ranked as within the top10 wide receivers and the top100 players in the nation by almost every writer.|$|E
5|$|Luck {{distributed}} his passes relatively evenly {{among his}} receivers. Doug Baldwin was the team's leading receiver, with 56 receptions for 824 yards and 9 touchdowns {{during the regular}} season. Wide receiver and kick returner Chris Owusu, who played in only six games because of a knee injury, underwent arthroscopic surgery and was expected {{to play in the}} Orange Bowl.

5|$|On August 2, 2006, quarterback Rhett Bomar and {{offensive}} lineman J.D. Quinn, both sophomores, were dismissed from the team. It {{was reported that}} they violated NCAA regulations regarding receiving extra compensation. It was later determined Bomar received $7,406.88 and Quinn $8,137.17. The loss of these two key players affected the team's placement in many publications' preseason polls {{as well as their}} chances of winning a national championship. The team turned to starting quarterback Paul Thompson (a converted wide <b>receiver</b> <b>in</b> 2005) and backup Joey Halzle to lead the team.|$|E
5|$|One of Vick's {{favorite}} {{targets in}} the limited Tech passing attack was wide receiver André Davis, who caught 24 passes for 318 yards and two touchdowns. Davis was limited {{by the fact that}} he played in only nine of Tech's 11 games, but he still finished as the Hokies' No. 2 <b>receiver</b> <b>in</b> terms of yardage. Tech's No. 1 receiver was Emmett Johnson, who caught 34 passes for 574 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Supporting Ball and Johnson were a {{corps of}} capable {{receivers}} including James Johnson and Greg Smith. James Johnson was Tech's second-leading receiver behind Calvin Johnson, and recorded over 500 receiving yards {{heading into the}} ACC championship. During Tech's game against Virginia Tech, James caught a 49-yard touchdown pass for the game's first points.

5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters to work in an operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered unworkable as an operational system, and all effort moved to designs with both the transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>in</b> the interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association named Smith to the All-ACC first team as a wide <b>receiver.</b> <b>In</b> the 2010 Military Bowl against East Carolina, Smith had two catches for tenyards. Shortly after the game, he declared himself available for the 2011 NFL Draft in order to financially support his family. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. said, while he believed Smith could have potentially reached first-round status with another year, he would likely be selected in the second or third round of the 2011 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a <b>receiver</b> <b>in</b> the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
