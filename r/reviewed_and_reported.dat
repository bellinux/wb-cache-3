40|$|Office design {{needs to}} be based on the needs of the most {{important}} producers of profit and value for any organisation – the workforce. Drivers affecting office design have been economics – space being often viewed as a cost-centre rather than a business enabler; and more recently, ideas that office design can impact organisational culture – resulting in the adoption of more collaborative working spaces in an attempt to force interaction. What is not always considered are the actual working styles of the individuals and their motivations nor the requirements of the work itself. There is a need to profile not only the workforce, but also the work carried out. Recent research into space requirements for work is <b>reviewed</b> <b>and</b> <b>reported</b> with recommendations for better consideration of the psychological and physical needs of workers for office design. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response are dependent on changes in cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption. Furthermore, the amplitude of the response {{is dependent on the}} baseline physiological state, defined by the haematocrit, oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood volume. As a result of this complex dependence, the accurate interpretation of BOLD data and robust intersubject comparisons when the baseline physiology is varied are difficult. The calibrated BOLD technique was developed to address these issues. However, the methodology is complex and its full promise has not yet been realised. In this review, the theoretical underpinnings of calibrated BOLD, and issues regarding this theory that are still to be resolved, are discussed. Important aspects of practical implementation are <b>reviewed</b> <b>and</b> <b>reported</b> applications of this methodology are presented...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To report {{three cases}} of optic nerve aplasia (ONA). Case Report: Herein three {{subjects}} with ONA are described, two subjects had unilateral involvement. In {{one of these}} cases, the fellow eye had an associated persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV). The third patient had bilateral ONA with multiple intracranial anomalies. Previous reports are <b>reviewed</b> <b>and</b> <b>reported</b> findings are summarized. Orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal in two of our cases and loss of corpus callosum in the third case. Narrow optic nerve was observed {{on the right side}} and normal appearance in other two patients. Conclusion: The diagnosis of optic nerve abnormalities in children requires a thorough ophthalmic examination and proper ancillary testing. Although MRI is valuable in the diagnosis of associated central nervous system anomalies, the optic nerve may appear in normal size and course on MRI images and thus one {{may not be able to}} diagnose ONA in eyes with opaque media...|$|E

However, descriptions of deluge systems are not too clear in the local codes in comparing with those in other countries, nor demonstrated to be established with systematic full-scale burning tests on assessing {{the performance of the}} system. Overseas codes are always referred to for some projects. Since the architectural features of buildings and living styles of citizens are different, codes workable elsewhere might not be applicable to Hong Kong.

40|$|Doubly Charmed Baryons {{have been}} {{recently}} discovered in 2002 and exotic mesons in 2004. The value {{and significance of}} these discoveries is that they help to confirm the Standard Model since that model has predicted them (since the early 1960 's). Up to that time, the only baryons (composites that consist of 3 quarks) that contained charm were those where only one of its 3 quarks was a charm quark. Thus, the value and significance of the E 781 collaboration's work has been the expansion of charmed baryon composites to include a second charm quark {{as well as the}} expansion of strange meson or charm meson composites categories to include a charm-strange meson. In this paper, I have <b>reviewed</b> <b>and</b> <b>reported</b> on E 781 's method of finding these composites particles in terms of software and hardware techniques, and made reference to two approaches to obtaining decay particle track curvature with respect to ambient magnetic fields.
