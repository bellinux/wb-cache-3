In case of <b>real</b> <b>flow,</b> a shear layer is observed instead of a slipstream, because of the additional no-slip boundary condition.|$|E

40|$|Capturing and replaying <b>real</b> <b>flows</b> are {{important}} for testing network security products. However, capturing <b>real</b> <b>flows</b> demands a high storage cost and runs a risk of capture loss, which makes the replay inaccurate. Replaying <b>real</b> <b>flows</b> should be accurate and stateful {{to adapt to the}} reaction of the device under test. It should also efficiently reproduce a defect and help developers identify the flows triggering defects. Therefore, this work first presents the (N, M, P) capture scheme which begins with, for each connection, capturing at most N bytes of application payload and then at most M bytes of application payload for at most each of the subsequent P packets in the same connection. This scheme reduces 87 percent of storage cost while retaining 99. 74 percent of original events. This work develops a tool named SocketReplay with the mechanisms of loss recovery, stateful replay, and selective replay. Loss recovery tracks TCP sequence numbers to identify capture loss and recovers incomplete flows with dummy data. Stateful replay maintains the states in the TCP/IP stack to replay <b>real</b> <b>flows.</b> Selective replay incrementally selects flows to replay. The results show that SocketReplay can accurately and efficiently reproduce product events and significantly decrease the volume of replayed packet traces...|$|R

40|$|Periodic sharp {{sustained}} {{increases and}} then reversals in asset prices lead many to posit irrational price bubbles. The general case for irrationality is that real asset prices simply have moved too much given the future <b>real</b> cash <b>flows</b> the assets are reasonably likely to produce. A corollary for property is that observed mean reversion in <b>real</b> cash <b>flows</b> is not reflected in investor valuations, resulting in asset values being too high when <b>real</b> cash <b>flows</b> {{are high and}} vice versa.

Here, r_ij represents the number of travellers between two airports i and j, while c_ij represents the daily number of commuters between any two counties i and j.

50|$|The {{primary flow}} of a fluid, {{particularly}} {{in the majority of}} the flow field remote from solid surfaces immersed in the fluid, is usually very similar to what would be predicted using the basic principles of physics, and assuming the fluid is inviscid. However, in <b>real</b> <b>flow</b> situations, there are regions in the flow field where the flow is significantly different in both speed and direction to what is predicted for an inviscid fluid using simple analytical techniques. The flow in these regions is the secondary flow.
