An advantage of this setup is that the low energy of the infrared radiation does not induce photolysis reactions on the analyser cell windows in contrast to ultraviolet-based techniques. We present preliminary data on gas composition measurements obtained in the alkyl lines of an MOVPE reactor and show that useful information can readily be obtained on absolute gas concentrations, gas switching transients, and <b>reactor</b> <b>line</b> memory effects.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a cold {{radiating}} plasma mantle might help {{to solve the problem}} of energy exhaust in a fusion <b>reactor.</b> <b>Line</b> radiation of impurities localized at the boundary of the bulk plasma could distribute the heating power onto the whole vessel wall and avoid dangerous heat loads at the plasma facing components as limiters or divertor plates. Important requirements have to be fulfilled within such a concept: on the one hand a stationary impurity concentration at the edge on a high level, sufficient to radiate a substantial fraction of the heating power and to reduce the plasma temperature at the boundary and the convective heat flow to the limiters or divertor plates, but on the other hand a limitation of the central impurity concentration to values compatible with ignition in a fusion reactor at the same time. First experiments at the tokamak TEXTOR with neon as the radiating impurity gave evidence for the feasibility of this concept. Within this work further experiments with neon and a comparison with silicon as the radiating impurity have been performed. The results are discussed with the help of model calculations to judge these two elements with respect to their suitability for radiation cooling by characterizing the mechanisms of their plasma wall interaction and the properties of radiation and transport.

A failure time surface which is generated by structural finite element (FE) analysis of varying pressure and temperature loads serves as a basis for estimations of failure times.

40|$|The cost of {{maintaining}} and eventually replacing refractories {{as a result}} of slag attack is a significant cost component in the copper industry. Converting matte to blister copper takes place in <b>reactors</b> <b>lined</b> with direct-bonded magnesia-chrome refractories, and several continuous converting operations use calcium ferrite slag. Unfortunately, the low viscosity of calcium ferrite slag makes it aggressive toward the refractories. Ferrous calcium silicate (FCS) slag has been proposed as a replacement; however, the effect of this slag on magnesia-chrome refractories has not been studied. In this work, the interactions between FCS slag and magnesia-chrome refractory at 1573 K (1300 °C) with an oxygen partial pressure of 10 - 6 atm were studied and compared with that experienced with calcium ferrite slag under the same conditions. Both slags penetrated the pores in the refractory and caused compositional change in the chromite spinel intergranular bonding phase through cation interdiffusion, which resulted in cracking and debonding of periclase grains. It was observed that the refractory was penetrated much more deeply by calcium ferrite slag than FCS slag because of the higher surface tension and lower viscosity of calcium ferrite slag. As a result, the refractory was attacked less by FCS slag than it was by calcium ferrite slag. It is concluded that the use of FCS slag in continuous copper converting is likely to extend refractory life...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) Shunt {{reactors}} {{are used}} in power system amongst other things, to suppress overvoltages in the network during network switching, auto reclosing of transmission lines and under low loading condition of the network. Traditionally, shunt reactors of fixed type have been used and these have been permanently connected to the system. This research work investigated the feasibility of replacing the fixed shunt <b>line</b> <b>reactors</b> with a reactor, whose parameters are automatically varied depending on the system reactive power requirements, in a mature power system overlaid with high voltage lines to improve amongst, other things voltage stability. However, in a mature system overlaid with parallel higher voltage lines, power tend to flow on the matured system rather than higher voltage system as predetermined by various impedances of the power system. It is therefore desirable that loading of higher voltage lines be increased because of their higher power transfer capability and fact that higher voltage networks generate capacitive power which is substantially more than for each line at the original voltage. However, replacing {{a large number of}} fixed <b>line</b> <b>reactors,</b> at low loadings of higher voltage lines, even when system collapse is averted by increasing the number of reactors inserted into the system, overvoltage problems may still be an issue, until a certain number of must-run reactors, operating at full reactance, are put into service. If too much inductive reactance is removed from the system when the loading levels are extremely low, the power system will collapse. Therefore, there was no economic benefit in replacing all the fixed shunt <b>line</b> <b>reactors</b> with controllable type when the loading was still relatively low. Thus, the majority of the converted reactors were operating in their full rating as there was still more reactive power to be absorbed. However, when the power was diverted to flow on the higher voltage system through the use of series compensation of the higher voltage system, there was a possibility of making some fixed shunt <b>line</b> <b>reactors</b> on the higher voltage network controllable. This also allowed more power to be transferred in the higher voltage system thus improving its utilisation. Also, a positive impact on active system losses was realised...|$|R

To further research and development (R&D) in the areas mentioned above and several others, and to facilitate progress in Member States in design and technology development for small reactors without on-site refueling, the IAEA has conducted a dedicated Coordinated Research Project (CRP) entitled ‘Small Reactors without On-site Refuelling’ (CRPi 25001).
