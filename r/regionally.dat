5|$|Because it cannot {{compete with}} {{established}} plants, great mullein {{is no longer}} considered a serious agricultural weed and is easily crowded out in cultivation, except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with, such as Californian semi-desertic areas of the eastern Sierra Nevada. In such ecological contexts, it crowds out native herbs and grasses; its tendency to appear after forest fires also disturbs the normal ecological succession. Although not an agricultural threat, its presence can {{be very difficult to}} completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in overgrazed pastures. The species is legally listed as a noxious weed in the American state of Colorado (Class C) and Hawaii, and the Australian state of Victoria (<b>regionally</b> prohibited in the West Gippsland region, and <b>regionally</b> controlled in several others).|$|E
5|$|Communication {{also happens}} <b>regionally.</b> In the United States, {{there is the}} American Public Gardens Association (formerly the American Association of Botanic Gardens and Arboreta), and in Australasia there is the Botanic Gardens of Australia and New Zealand (BGANZ).|$|E

5|$|According to {{researchers}} from the National Australian Dictionary Centre {{there is evidence that}} barley (Scotland and the west of England), barlies (Aberdeen and a few English towns), bar (Swansea) and bars (Devon), are used in Australia.

Michael Phelps of the United States has won the global award eight times, followed by Katie Ledecky of the United States and Ian Thorpe of Australia with four. <b>Regionally,</b> German, Hungarian and Dutch swimmers have had the most success in Europe, while Australians have won more than three-quarters of the Pacific awards.|$|E
5|$|As the United Kingdom is {{a member}} of the European Union, there are {{elections}} held <b>regionally</b> in England to decide who is sent as Members of the European Parliament. The 2014 European Parliament election saw the regions of England elect the following MEPs: 22 UK Independence Party (UKIP), 17 Conservatives, 17 Labour, 3 Greens, and one Liberal Democrat.|$|E
5|$|At Middle Hope a {{sequence}} of carboniferous limestone is exposed, which includes thick volcanic tuffs and lavas, demonstrating Tournaisian carbonate sections.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, it doubled the number of police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the police force was the 3,000-strong special police, which was deployed in twelve military-style battalions. In addition, Croatia had 9,000–10,000 <b>regionally</b> organised reserve police officers organised in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but they lacked weapons.|$|E
5|$|Blackdown and Sampford Commons have {{extensive}} surviving {{examples of the}} heathland, carr woodland and marshy grassland habitats that have developed on the acidic soils overlying the Greensand and Keuper Marls of the Blackdown Hills. The heathland supports a typical invertebrate fauna, including {{a wide variety of}} butterfly species, and with spiders notably abundant. The site is <b>regionally</b> important for birds which favour heathland habitats.|$|E
5|$|Centuries later, {{the region}} around Salerno {{was the only}} {{exception}} to the rule that (except for skipping units that had <b>regionally</b> fallen out of use) the apothecaries' ounce was subdivided down to the scruple {{in exactly the same way}} as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10drachms.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the game in Spain, modifications to the traditional rules have appeared <b>regionally,</b> creating variations.

5|$|The network {{largely ignored}} the {{standard}} business model of 1950s TV, {{in which one}} advertiser sponsored an entire show, enabling it to have complete control over its content. Instead, DuMont sold commercials to many different advertisers, freeing producers of its shows from the veto power held by sole sponsors. This eventually became the standard model for US television. Some commercial time was sold <b>regionally</b> on a co-op basis, while other spots were sold network-wide.|$|E

5|$|While {{discussing}} typical Bollywood soundtracks, Nilanjana Bhattacharjya, {{a professor}} of music at Colorado College, noted that Rahman integrated traditional Punjabi cultural elements within his music for this soundtrack. <b>Regionally</b> defined elements such as a woman's prayer at the Sikh Gurdwara (Golden Temple) and the bhangra harvest dance are incorporated alongside more contemporary, global styles such as hard rock and hip hop to depict the cosmopolitan lifestyle of the youngsters in the film.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians, where <b>regionally</b> accessible, {{have been}} found in the river otter's diet during the spring and summer months, as {{indicated}} in many of the food habit studies.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army; to bolster its defence, the country doubled its police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective portion of the force was the 3,000-strong special police, deployed in 12 battalions with a military structure; an additional 9,00010,000 <b>regionally</b> organized reserve police were grouped into 16 battalions and 10 independent companies.

5|$|Human anatomy, {{physiology}} and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical {{students in their}} first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught <b>regionally</b> or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Wolf {{founded the}} airline company Cape Air, {{which at the}} time flew solely between Boston and Provincetown, Massachusetts. Since flying one route with eight {{employees}} and one plane, it has expanded to become the largest independent <b>regionally</b> based airline. Cape Air now serves parts of the East Coast, Midwestern United States, the Caribbean, and Micronesia with around 1,000 employees.

Since being elected to the Massachusetts Senate, Wolf continues to pilot during the summer on weekends.|$|E

Omaha is notorious for its 1989 demolition of 24 buildings in the Jobbers Canyon Historic District, which represents to date the largest loss of buildings on the National Register. The only original building surviving of that complex is the Nash Block.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, Judge Sanderson finally {{ruled that}} prize {{fighting}} was illegal in San Francisco {{and the courts}} would not determine who the winner was. Sharkey retained the purse, but the decision provided no vindication for Earp. Until the fight, Earp had been a minor figure known <b>regionally</b> in California and Arizona. Afterward, his name was known {{from coast to coast}} in the worst possible way. Earp sold his interest in his horses on December 20 and left San Francisco shortly afterward. He only returned when he caught a boat to Alaska. Earp's decision left a smear on his public character that followed him until he died and afterward.|$|E
5|$|On the Rochester end, NY33 {{primarily}} {{serves as}} a paralleling local route to Interstate490 (I-490), of less importance to the area's traffic patterns. Between the two cities, it is mostly a rural two-lane highway. The largest location on this stretch is the Genesee County city of Batavia, where NY33 reconnects to NY5 and crosses NY63 and NY98, two <b>regionally</b> important north–south highways. NY33 overlaps with all three routes {{at one point or}} another as it traverses Batavia. A southerly alternate route, designated NY33A, leaves NY33 northeast of Batavia in Bergen and rejoins its parent in Rochester.|$|E
