5000|$|All FTOS based {{switches}} offer a {{wide range}} of layer2 and layer3 protocols. All features are available on all switches: some switch models (in the S-series) offer an additional license for layer3 or routing: this additional license is NOT required to use that protocol, but only required to get support from the Dell Force10 support department on using these features. All interfaces on FTOS <b>running</b> <b>switches</b> are configured as a layer3 interface and by default shutdown.

50|$|<b>Switches</b> <b>running</b> FTOS {{can only}} be {{configured}} using a command-line interface or CLI: FTOS doesn't offer a web-based Graphical user interface. Initial configuration is done via the console port using either a straight-through or roll-over cable (depending on model) to a terminal on 9600 bit/s and some models also support an AUX port allowing remote management via a dial-in modem. Most switches have a standard serial port or offer a USB-B port. After initial configuration access to the cli is possible via telnet and/or SSH. FTOS based switches also support SNMP and file-transfer (FTOS upgrades and startup-configuration data) can be done via FTP, TFTP or Secure copyMost <b>switches</b> <b>running</b> FTOS offer a dedicated management interface where the IP routing to/from the management system {{is not part of}} the internal switching or routing system. Some S-series switches only offer in-band management using a physical router interface or a VLAN interface in layer-3 mode.|$|R
