25|$|One early {{example of}} {{inventory}} proportionality {{used in a}} <b>retail</b> <b>application</b> in the United States was for motor fuel. Motor fuel (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists {{do not know whether}} they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel, each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by Petrolsoft Corporation in 1990 for Chevron Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.|$|E

This means that the generic energy harvesting framework (on the EE) is independent from the application on the DUT. This way, the application {{does not need to}} implement an API, so any existing application can be evaluated.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse {{consumer}} decision-making processes on mobile service channels from both behavioural and perceptive perspectives on time dimension. With mobile channel {{becoming one of the}} major service channels, electronic retailers must ensure that their mobile <b>retail</b> <b>application</b> design is able to create usage value to their customers. The investigation of the impacts from the value co-creation on this channel to consumers' actual behaviours is based on the understanding of both cognitive and emotional perspective of consumer decision-making processes. The research aim is to therefore compare the results from survival analysis on behavioural data, and the results from structural equation modelling on questionnaire data, to explore the relationships between the usage of mobile application functions, the time consumption of a decision-making process and the probability of reaching a decision, and to provide insights on designing mobile <b>retail</b> <b>application.</b> This thesis, on one hand, employs Prospect Theory, the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Minkowski Spacetime as its theoretical foundations, and uses customer perceived value as a research lens to develop the research design. On the other hand, it develops survival analysis to investigate the actual practical value of using mobile retail applications {{in the context of a}} major health and beauty retailer, Boots' website, and uses structural equation modelling to test a conceptual model representing the prediction of customer perceived value on mobile service channels. The comparison and contrast between the results from these two separate studies offer a better understanding of consumer behaviours in this context. This study is one of the first to apply survival analysis to investigate consumer decision-making process on mobile service channels. It is also one of the first research that analyses consumer behaviours and perceptions from a temporal perspective.

40|$|With {{the quick}} {{development}} of RFID {{technology and the}} decreasing prices of RFID devices, RFID is becoming widely used in various intelligent services. Especially in the <b>retail</b> <b>application</b> domain, RFID is increasingly adopted to capture the shopping tracks and behavior of in-store customers. To further enhance the potential of this promising application, in this paper, we propose a unified framework for RFID-based path analytics, which uses both in-store shopping paths and RFID-based purchasing data to mine actionable navigation patterns. Four modules of this framework are discussed, which are: (1) mapping from the physical space to the cyber space, (2) data preprocessing, (3) pattern mining and (4) knowledge understanding and utilization. In the data preprocessing module, the critical {{problem of how to}} capture the mainstream shopping path sequences while wiping out unnecessary redundant and repeated details is addressed in detail. To solve this problem, two types of redundant patterns, i. e., loop repeat pattern and palindrome-contained pattern are recognized and the corresponding processing algorithms are proposed. The experimental results show that the redundant pattern filtering functions are effective and scalable. Overall, this work builds a bridge between indoor positioning and advanced data mining technologies, and provides a feasible way to study customers’ shopping behaviors via multi-source RFID data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Skyline queries {{have been}} widely used as a {{practical}} tool for multi-criteria decision analysis and for applications involving preference queries. For example, in a typical online <b>retail</b> <b>application,</b> skyline queries can help customers select the most interesting, among a pool of available, products. Recently, reverse skyline queries have been proposed, highlighting the man-ufacturer’s perspective, i. e. how to determine the expected buyers of a given product. In this work we develop novel algorithms for two important classes of queries involving customer preferences. We first propose a novel algorithm, termed as RSA, for answering reverse skyline queries. We then introduce a new type of queries, namely the k-Most Attractive Candidates (k-MAC) query. In this type of queries, given a set of existing product specifications P, a set of customer preferences C and a set of new candidate products Q, the k-MAC query returns the set of k candidate products from Q that jointly maximizes the total number of expected buyers, measured as the cardinality of the union of individual reverse skyline sets (i. e., influence sets). Applying existing approaches to solve this problem would require calculating the reverse skyline set for each candidate, which is prohibitively expensive for large data sets. We, thus, propose a batched algorithm for this problem and compare its performance against a branch-and-bound variant that we devise. Both of these algorithms use in their core variants of our RSA algorithm. Our experimental study using both synthetic and real data sets demonstrates that our proposed algorithms outperform existing, or naive solutions to our studied classes of queries. I...|$|E

40|$|Prior Hong Kong-based {{studies have}} dealt {{predominantly}} with Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) configured in a single-tranche offer form (see McGuinness (1992); Cheng et al. (2004); Fung et al. (2004); Vong (2006) {{for the main}} board; and Vong and Zhao (2008) for the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM)). This study revisits the issue by examining a recent set of IPOs utlizing a dual-tranche offer form, in which a local retail offer {{is accompanied by a}} book-built placing. This mechanism utilizes a number of features ('claw-backs', adjustable offer prices and over-allotment options) which allow for important supply and demand adjustments during the offer period. The absence of such features within the single-tranche offer form, which prevailed right up {{to the end of the}} 1990 s, suggests radically different pricing characteristics across single- and dual-tranche regimes. Assessment is first made of ex-ante type variables, constructed using publicly available data prior to the close in retail applications. Average retail subscription rates on issues immediately prior to a given offering, the clustering of IPOs and the performance of the overall Hong Kong secondary market in the period surrounding the <b>retail</b> <b>application</b> window all serve as significant factors in explaining both IPO returns and excess subscription demand. Mainland PRC-incorporation (H-share issuers), advising sponsorship quality, an issuer's propensity to disclose a forecast of earnings and price-to-earnings levels also appear significant. In terms of ex-post variables, both IPO underpricing and subscription demand were positively related to over-allotment option exercise and the SD of post-listing returns. Significantly, there is no evidence to support the notion that the incidence and/or size of subsequent seasoned equity issues helps to promote IPO underpricing. This is investigated by examining equity capital-raising activities over a 36 -month post-listing period. Given the mixed evidence to date (across markets and studies) on this issue, the results documented in this study provide an additional important data point to suggest that seasoned equity issuance is of second-order importance in relation to IPO underpricing. Finally, a measurement form for excess demand was also developed to reflect the idiosyncratic nature of the dual-tranche allotment mechanism. Subscription numbers were evaluated in relation to retail tranche supply adjustments, arising from 'claw-backs' and employee share allotments. Consistent with Vong's (2006) earlier work on simple IPO subscription rates, after-market volatility appeared much more strongly tied to excess demand than to initial return levels. A number of analogues of excess demand, notably over-allotment option exercise and the proportion of shares allotted to retail applicants subscribing at the minimum order level, were significant in explaining initial returns. Finally, and consistent with Hanley (1993), higher initial return levels were apparent in issues priced towards the upper end of the offer price range. ...|$|E
