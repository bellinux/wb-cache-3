25|$|Hell Hole Dam was {{partially}} completed {{at the time}} of extremely heavy storms in December 1964. The D/S <b>rockfill</b> portion was up ~220' above the river bottom, but the impervious core and adj zones were only up ~35'. Debris from extreme storm runoff U/S from the dam blocked the diversion outlet and water rapidly accumulated behind the partially constructed dam. As the water came up it was seeping thru the rockfill-and when it crested the entire mass collapsed in a matter of minutes. A surge went down the canyon-washing out 2 older suspension bridges below the Long Canyon influx and at the Spanish Dry Diggings crossing near Greenwood. It then washed out the State Highway 49 bridge over the American River just below Auburn. Folsom Dam reservoir absorbed the surge below that point.|$|E

40|$|The large dumps {{of waste}} {{material}} called ravaneti from marble quarrying activities in Alpi Apuane basin are distinguished {{features of the}} local landscape. They are strongly heterogeneous, never compacted and frequently subject to local instabilities. The access roads to the marble quarries cross the dumps; therefore, it is concern of the local authorities to hinder such phenomena. In this respect it {{is of paramount importance}} to evaluate the shear strength of the material comprising the dumps at the proper scale. In this note, the results of in-situ direct shear and tilt tests on samples of metric size are illustrated, together with the interpretation according to a strength criterion relative to <b>rockfills.</b> The results of a series of lab tests on the finer fraction of the waste material are also described and interpreted. Finally, qualitative considerations on the local and global stability of the waste dumps, related to their shear strength, are reported...|$|R

New Exchequer Dam is the largest dam on the river and forms Lake McClure, which holds [...] of water for irrigation, flood control and hydropower generation. This modern structure was preceded by the old Exchequer Dam forming [...] Exchequer Reservoir. The old concrete arch dam, completed in 1926, was flooded out when the new concrete-faced <b>rockfill</b> dam was built in 1967, but occasionally reappears during periods of low water.|$|E
500|$|Expanding the system's {{storage and}} {{delivery}} capacities in stages, the city built Conduit2 from Bull Run to Portland in 1911, and in 1917 constructed a small dam {{at the high}} water outlet of Bull Run Lake. In 1921, the city replaced the headworks diversion dam with a new one, about [...] high, and added Conduit3. In 1929, Portland built Dam1 (the Ben Morrow Dam), which is about [...] high. To keep pace with population growth and increasing water demands, the city created Reservoir 2 behind Dam 2.

40|$|Dams and dikes are {{commonly}} regarded as very save structures. People {{who are living}} close to big dams do not feel threatened. The trust results from 5000 years experience in building and controlling of dams and dikes. Statistics confirm the intuitive trust {{in the safety of}} dams: only 1 % of all dams build up to now did break. But there is nevertheless enough reason to be cautious. This holds especially for engineers who are constructing or controlling dams. During the last century hundreds of dam-breaks occurred. Three of these dam-break catastrophes caused the death of more than 2000 men each. At least two of them could have been avoided. Different from other technical structures the collapse of a dam is regarded as a natural catastrophe. The name 'Titanic' implies directly the reminding of a great catastrophe caused by human misjudgement. The name 'Macchu' has meaning only for a few specialists. Every barrage has a certain risk, which is small but not neglectible. This work does not provide knowledge on the increase of safety by the mean of constructional recommendations, but presents mathematical tools for the estimation of what happens, if the dam breaks. There are only earthern and <b>rockfilled</b> dams considered. The sudden collapse of concrete and arc dams can be estimated with known methods. Four different approaches are used. The first model is based on the analysis of 115 real dam-breaks. The second model consists of an analytical solution of the dam-erosion. The third model is similar to the second one, but solves the equations within some discrete time loop. This type of model is called parameter model. Fread calls this approach a simplified model. At least the dam erosion is numerically simulated. The shallow water equations and the sediment continuity equation by Exner are solved in two successive stages. The shallow water equations are solved with two different schemes, the Beam/Warming scheme and an explicit scheme from Nujic. The sediment transport was calculated with implicit and explicit formulations of the Exner equation. The 2 d-implementation of the numerical method offers the possibility to simulate time dependent the 3 d-shape of the dam surface. (orig.)

40|$|Four hydrographical {{data sets}} of recent periods (1984 - 2016) {{are used to}} analyze the {{exchange}} processes of the basin water of the Inner and Outer Barsnesfjord in West-ern Norway. The basins are periodically anoxic. The data from the Barsnesfjord will be compared to the data from the Sogndalsfjord, because they are connected, to identify the water that is flowing in and renewing the water in the Barsnesfjord. This thesis deals with analysis of hydrographical changes in Barsnesfjord and Sogndalsfjord with a prime focus on the parameters oxygen, density, and turbidity. In the Barsnesfjord water bodies, the data from the deeper parts (basin water) are of matter since the aim of this investigation is it to determine the sequence of deep/ba-sin water exchanges. A gradual or sudden increase in the basin water of the oxygen concentrations as well as an increase in density, salinity values and changes in temperature and/or turbidity are signs for water exchanges. Such exchanges were discernable in three of the four data sets in the Barsnesfjord. Major inflow events to the Barsnesfjord happened in winter time in January/February in the years 1984, 1991 and 2014 but also between late March and late April of 1993. Another basin water exchange happened between October and November in 1984 in the Outer Barsnesfjord. But this was only a partial water exchange since the inflowing water only renewed water at 30 m depth. Major inflow events to the Sogndalsfjord were observed in summer time (June to August) in 1984 and 1991. It should be mentioned that the focus in this thesis is on the parameter oxygen since it usually shows inflow events with an increase of values. During a basin water ex-change in the Outer Barsnesfjord in winter time of 2014, the oxygen concentration in the basin water increased from 1, 2 mg/l to 6, 51 mg/l due to an inflow of new water from the Sogndalsfjord. During a basin water exchange in the Inner Barsnesfjord in winter time 2014, the oxygen concentration increased from 0, 09 mg/l to 5, 92 mg/l at the depth of 60 m. In the Outer Barsnesfjord in 2014 however, a second inflow was not revealed by the oxygen concentrations. The density values revealed that there was another inflow or a continuation of a previous inflow. IX In addition to the determination of a succession of basin water exchange, it is also investigated how deep the renewing water will sink in the water column. Not always is the whole water column renewed, sometimes there is only a partial renewal of fjord water. The investigation showed that in some cases, water from the Sogndalsfjord only renewed water in the Outer Barsnesfjord at the depth of 30 m. This happened in 1984 {{as well as in the}} 2013 to 2014 period. Important for the basin water exchanges between the Sogndalsfjord and the Barsnesfjord is the sound at Loftesnes (7, 5 m depth) because the water has to go over the sill to get into the Barsnesfjord. A new bridge is being built there, which includes <b>rockfills</b> and two new pillars on the sound. It was concluded that if there are changes in the water exchange, they most probably will be positive since the removing of old bridge parts will increase the water exchange...|$|R
500|$|Iraq has {{commenced}} {{construction of}} the Bekhme and Deralok Dams and planned two others – the Khazir-Gomel and Mandawa Dams. Plans to build a dam in the Great Zab at the Bekhme Gorge for flood control and irrigation were first proposed in 1937. A feasibility study determined that the site was not suited for dam construction and the plan was abandoned. In 1976, another study proposed three different locations on the Great Zab, including the site suggested in the earlier study. This site was eventually chosen in 1989, when work on the dam commenced. Construction of the Bekhme Dam was interrupted by {{the outbreak of the}} Gulf War in 1990 and the dam remains unfinished. After the war, the site of the dam was looted. The plans of the Bekhme Dam called for a [...] high <b>rockfill</b> dam and an underground hydroelectric power station housing six turbines with a total capacity of 1,560 MW.
