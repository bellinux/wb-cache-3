Longitudinal and multivariate data from six different institutions, each with large engineering programs where co-op participation is not mandatory, were studied with stepwise logistic regression. Results show that cumulative GPA at the end of the second semester is the strongest predictor of co-op participation. While institutional differences, year of matriculation, ethnicity, major discipline, and high school variables are also significant, gender is not related to co-op participation.

40|$|This article {{presents}} examples of assessment tools created {{as part of}} an internship program that have been integrated into program assessment. Although these tools represent only part of the multiple assessment activities and measures used in the assessment process for accounting majors at Southeast Missouri State University (SEMO), these tools comprise an important component of that process and provide data not easily obtained through other means. The interaction and evaluations that occur among students, practitioners, and faculty during and at completion of the internship can be invaluable in measuring outcomes of the internship program and the professional competencies required for entry into the accounting profession. In addition to the on-site internship experience that must involve a <b>relevant</b> <b>professional</b> <b>experience,</b> student interns at SEMO must maintain a diary/journal of activities and of the learning which they believe is occurring; send bi-weekly e-mails to the on-campus coordinator concerning activities and progress; undertake a self-assessment survey, compose a written paper concerning the internship experience and the profession, and make an oral presentation to students, faculty, and others interested in the internship experience. Employing supervisors also complete evaluations/surveys. Information gathered from the use of these tools has provided important insights {{from the perspective of the}} student intern and the external internship supervisor. That feedback has been available for use in promoting and improving the internship program as well as the overall program for accounting majors. By sharing the tools used in evaluating the internship experience, students' learning, and satisfaction with the internship program, the author wishes to acknowledge how the assessment of internship experiences and students' performance can provide valuable data for analysis, discussion, and possible action. The tools shared in this article can be adapted by faculty at other institutions to focus on the mission, goals, and objectives of their programs and could be integrated with the AICPA Core Competency Framework for Entry into the Accounting Profession, core competency models designed by other international, professional organizations, and assessment activities for accreditation.

40|$|Expert searchers {{engage with}} {{information}} as information brokers, researchers, reference librarians, information architects, faculty who teach advanced search, {{and in a}} variety of other information-intensive professions. Their experiences are characterized by a profound understanding of information concepts and skills and they have an agile ability to apply this knowledge to interacting with and having an impact on the information environment. This study explored the learning experiences of searchers to understand the acquisition of search expertise. The research question was: What can be learned about becoming an expert searcher from the learning experiences of proficient novice searchers and highly experienced searchers? The key objectives were: (1) to explore the existence of threshold concepts in search expertise; (2) to improve our understanding of how search expertise is acquired and how novice searchers, intent on becoming experts, can learn to search in more expertlike ways. The participant sample drew from two population groups: (1) highly experienced searchers with a minimum of 20 years of <b>relevant</b> <b>professional</b> <b>experience,</b> including LIS faculty who teach advanced search, information brokers, and search engine developers (11 subjects); and (2) MLIS students who had completed coursework in information retrieval and online searching and demonstrated exceptional ability (9 subjects). Using these two groups allowed a nuanced understanding of the experience of learning to search in expertlike ways, with data from those who search at a very high level {{as well as those who}} may be actively developing expertise. The study used semi-structured interviews, search tasks with think-aloud narratives, and talk-after protocols. Searches were screen-captured with simultaneous audio-recording of the think-aloud narrative. Data were coded and analyzed using NVivo 9 and manually. Grounded theory allowed categories and themes to emerge from the data. Categories represented conceptual knowledge and attributes of expert searchers. In accord with grounded theory method, once theoretical saturation was achieved, during the final stage of analysis the data were viewed through lenses of existing theoretical frameworks. For this study, threshold concept theory (Meyer & Land, 2003) was used to explore which concepts might be threshold concepts. Threshold concepts have been used to explore transformative learning portals in subjects ranging from economics to mathematics. A threshold concept has five defining characteristics: transformative (causing a shift in perception), irreversible (unlikely to be forgotten), integrative (unifying separate concepts), troublesome (initially counter-intuitive), and may be bounded. Themes that emerged provided evidence of four concepts which had the characteristics of threshold concepts. These were: information environment: the total information environment is perceived and understood; information structures: content, index structures, and retrieval algorithms are understood; information vocabularies: fluency in search behaviors related to language, including natural language, controlled vocabulary, and finesse using proximity, truncation, and other language-based tools. The fourth threshold concept was concept fusion, the integration of the other three threshold concepts and further defined by three properties: visioning (anticipating next moves), being light on one's 'search feet' (dancing property), and profound ontological shift (identity as searcher). In addition to the threshold concepts, findings were reported that were not concept-based, including praxes and traits of expert searchers. A model of search expertise is proposed with the four threshold concepts at its core that also integrates the traits and praxes elicited from the study, attributes which are likewise long recognized in LIS research as present in professional searchers. The research provides a deeper understanding of the transformative learning experiences involved in the acquisition of search expertise. It adds to our understanding of search expertise in the context of today's information environment and has implications for teaching advanced search, for research more broadly within library and information science, and for methodologies used to explore threshold concepts...|$|E

This research also identified the personal and <b>professional</b> <b>experiences</b> of SDA college and university presidents that contributed to their successful accession to the presidency. The presidents came from the twelve non-medical SDA colleges and universities in the continental United States and Canada. The three themes that emerged relevant to the perceptions of presidential leadership were (1) succession planning, (2) increased professionalization of the presidency, and (3) increased presidential tenure. One theme emerged relevant to the personal experiences that contributed to the successful accession to the presidency and was classified as significant impact of spousal and familial support on career trajectory. One theme also emerged <b>relevant</b> to the <b>professional</b> <b>experiences</b> that contributed to the successful accession to the presidency and was classified as progressively more challenging job experiences. Implications for practice suggest that SDA institutions, their associated governing boards, and church policymakers create and execute strategies to address the lack of qualified presidential aspirants in the pipeline.

Scientific literacy {{for our students}} and the possibilities for careers available in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas are important topics for economic growth as well as global competitiveness. The achievement of students in science learning is dependent upon the science teachers' effectiveness and experienced science teachers depend upon <b>relevant</b> <b>professional</b> development <b>experiences</b> to support their learning. In order {{to understand how to}} improve student learning in science, the learning of science teachers must also be understood. Previous research studies on teacher professional development have been conducted in other states, but Minnesota science teachers comprised a new and different population from those previously studied. The purpose of this two-phase mixed methods study was to identify the current types of professional development in which experienced, Minnesota secondary science teachers participated and the factors that affect their participation in professional development activities. The mixed-methods approach s utilized an initial online survey followed by qualitative interviews with five survey respondents. The results of the quantitative survey and the qualitative interviews indicated the quality of <b>professional</b> development <b>experiences</b> and the factors which affected the science teachers' participation in professional development activities. The supporting and inhibiting factors involved the availability of resources such as time and money, external relationships with school administrators, teacher colleagues, and family members, and personal intrinsic attributes such as desires to learn and help students. This study also describes implications for science teachers, school administrators, policymakers, and professional development providers. Recommendations for future research include the following areas: relationships between and among intrinsic and extrinsic factors, science-related professional development activities within local school districts, the use of formal and informal professional development, and the needs of rural science teachers compared to urban and suburban teachers...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the main aim to inquire into the possibilities of the integration of themes on HIV/AIDS into the Natural Sciences (Grades 7 - 9) and Life Sciences (Grades 10 - 12) curriculum {{in such a way that}} learners can become aware of the danger of an epidemic such as caused by HIV/AIDS, and start to take care of themselves. The researcher also wanted to explore the views of educators as stakeholders’ perseverance and strategies for combating the pandemic spread of the HIV/AIDS amongst our youth and everyone else. It is generally accepted that many schools are already experiencing the effects of the disease as teachers, learners and members of their families fall ill and even die. This often results in the disruption of the normal school programme. At present, the assumption can be made that there is no integration of themes, knowledge and life skills on HIV/AIDS and the Natural Sciences (Grade 7 - 9) and Life Sciences (Grade 10 - 12) curriculum, and no teaching about the consequences of this disease. It is clear that HIV/AIDS, Natural Sciences (Grade 7 - 9) and Life Sciences (Grade 10 - 12) programmes should be designed to enable young learners to develop the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values that will prepare them to identify and solve problems and make decisions for their own benefit. At the same time, Natural Sciences (Grade 7 - 9) and Life Sciences (Grade 10 - 12) help learners to develop basic personal and community health knowledge and skills that would benefit the whole community. They will also learn about their rights and responsibilities and the causes and impact of problems that may affect their health and safety because the HIV/AIDS programmes can also be incorporated into the Natural Sciences (Grade 7 - 9) and Life Sciences (Grade 10 - 12) curriculum. Natural Sciences (Grade 7 - 9) and Life Sciences (Grade 10 - 12), and themes on HIV/AIDS, link closely to the knowledge and experiences the learners bring with them to school. The programmes should affirm both this prior knowledge and experience, and assist in the development of new life skills out of it. The Department of Education is expecting that the issue of HIV/AIDS should be taught in school. The problem that arises is HOW TO link or integrate HIV/AIDS and Natural Sciences (Grade 7 - 9) and Life Sciences (Grade 10 - 12). The educators need to be capacitated through in-service training and workshops to enable them to handle the issue of HIV/AIDS with all the sensitivity it deserves. Where teachers can draw on their <b>relevant</b> <b>professional</b> <b>experiences</b> and expertise to integrate and strengthen their Natural Sciences (Grade 7 - 9) and Life Sciences (Grade 10 - 12) skills, they should do so without hesitation. At the same time they should address the development of appropriate life skills and knowledge on HIV/AIDS to deal with the consequences of the disease and how to fight it. Dr. M.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{heritage}} language speakers of Spanish are enrolling in Spanish language courses during secondary school. Current scholarship has suggested that these heritage language learners (HLLs) have very different instructional needs than learners of second or foreign languages. Because Spanish language instruction in Nebraska secondary schools has been traditionally conceptualized only as foreign language instruction, classroom teachers may not be adequately prepared {{to meet the needs}} of HLLs. This dissertation examined the experiences of Nebraska secondary Spanish teachers who worked with HLLs in order to inform the creation of <b>relevant</b> <b>professional</b> learning <b>experiences</b> for pre- and in-service teachers. Specifically, data were collected from a statewide survey of Nebraska Spanish teachers (n= 92) and follow-up semi-structured interviews of nine of the survey participants representing three sub-groups. Findings from this design study indicated that while most teachers recognized significant differences between HLLs and L 2 learners enrolled in their courses and had very positive attitudes towards HL maintenance, few were engaged in significant instructional differentiation practices in mixed-enrollment courses. There were few reported instances of HLL specific courses offerings such as Spanish for Spanish speakers (SSS) across the state. Respondents reported, on average, receiving very little pre- or in-service professional development related to HLLs but indicated strong interest in learning more about serving HLLs. These data informed the design and delivery of a practitioner-led professional development workshop focused on one of the most significant practitioner- articulated learning needs: instructional differentiation for HLLs in mixed courses. Additional professional development areas identified by study included sociolinguistic characteristics of HLL affect and motivation, models of curriculum design and development for SSS courses, models of course articulation sequences and placement procedures for HLLs in World Language departments, and frank collegial discourse on the subject of teacher qualifications for HL instruction. This dissertation illuminated the importance of practitioner-led inquiry into “problems of practice,” and suggested several foci for future efforts in better preparing Spanish teachers to work with HLLs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this qualitative, phenomenological {{study was to explore}} the {{experiences}} of international graduate assistants at a public, four-year institution in the Southwestern U. S. This study concentrated on graduate-level (both master’s and PhD) international students who were at the time the research was conducted, employed within a graduate assistantship. The study was conducted in order to identify the essence of the phenomenon of being an international graduate assistant in the U. S. Explicitly, this study addressed how international graduate assistants simultaneously balanced the threefold experience of being an international student, pursuing a graduate-level degree, and working within a professional capacity as a graduate assistant. Twelve total participants participated in this study, and data was collected through a singular interview with each one of the participants. The participants were asked to share their experiences with personal expectations, challenges, their assistantships, their relationships with their advisors and other faculty, and also their relationships with peers and dependents. The findings revealed that although international graduate assistants viewed their overall experiences positively, there were several important areas in which the participants had indicated a desire for more support. The majority of international graduate assistants expressed a need for more initial information and assistance, particularly upon arrival in the U. S. Some participants felt cultural differences, such as having to adjust to a new academic system and a new work environment, created transition and adjustment challenges. The students also discussed the importance of their relationships with their advisors and peers, and how negative experiences or lack of interaction led to frustration and isolation. Finally, all of the participants emphasized the significance of graduate assistantships, which alleviated the financial burden of attending graduate school in the U. S., and also provided them with their only opportunity for <b>relevant,</b> <b>professional</b> career <b>experience.</b> The relevance of these findings suggest a greater need to study the unique experiences of international graduate assistants and how they can be supported more effectively...|$|R

Because Spanish language instruction in Nebraska secondary schools has been traditionally conceptualized only as foreign language instruction, classroom teachers and the World Language departments may not be adequately prepared {{to meet the needs of}} HLLs. This dissertation examined the experiences of Nebraska secondary Spanish teachers who worked with HLLs in order to inform the creation of <b>relevant</b> <b>professional</b> learning <b>experiences</b> for pre- and in-service teachers. Specifically, data were collected from a statewide survey of Nebraska Spanish teachers (n= 92) and follow-up semi-structured interviews of nine of the survey participants representing three sub-groups. ^ Findings from this design study indicated that while most teachers recognized significant differences between HLLs and L 2 learners enrolled in their courses and had very positive attitudes towards HL maintenance, few were engaged in significant instructional differentiation practices in mixed-enrollment courses. There were few reported instances of HLL specific courses offerings such as Spanish for Spanish speakers (SSS), though interviews revealed a growing interest in developing such courses across the state. Respondents reported, on average, receiving very little pre- or in-service professional development related to HLLs but indicated strong interest in learning more about serving HLLs. These data informed the design and delivery of a practitioner-led professional development workshop focused on one of the most significant practitioner- articulated learning needs: instructional differentiation for HLLs in mixed courses. Additional professional development areas identified by study included sociolinguistic characteristics of HLL affect and motivation, models of curriculum design and development for SSS courses, models of course articulation sequences and placement procedures for HLLs in World Language departments, and frank collegial discourse on the subject of teacher qualifications for HL instruction. This dissertation illuminated the importance of practitioner-led inquiry into “problems of practice”, and suggested several foci for future efforts in better preparing Spanish teachers to work with HLLs. ...|$|R
