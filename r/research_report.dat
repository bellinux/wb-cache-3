40|$|Scientific {{research}} is highly structured {{and some of}} that structure is reflected in <b>research</b> <b>reports.</b> Traditional scientific <b>research</b> <b>reports</b> are yielding to interactive documents which expose their internal structure and are richly linked to other materials. In these changes, there are opportunities {{to take advantage of}} the structure in scientific <b>research</b> <b>reports</b> which previously have not been systematically captured. Thus, we explore ways of capturing more of the structure of <b>research</b> in <b>reports</b> about the <b>research</b> and we use that structure to support the development of a new generation of document browsers which include novel interaction widgets. We apply the browsers incorporating the conceptual modeling framework to full-text <b>research</b> <b>reports</b> from the Public Library of Science (PLoS). In addition, we describe the application of model-oriented constructs to facilitating highly interlinked digital libraries...|$|R
40|$|This Index of NACA Technical Publications covers those NACA <b>research</b> <b>reports</b> {{issued in}} the period of June 1955 through June 1956. It is the fifth {{supplement}} to the basic 1919 - 1949 Index. The res ear c h reports issued prior to June 1955 which have been declassified since that date have also been included. In addition, current announcement of newly declassified materials is regularly made in the NACA Research Abstracts and Reclassification Notice. The arrangement of the present Index follows that of its predecessors: (1) A listing of the subject categories by numerical classifications, (2) a chronological listing of the NACA <b>research</b> <b>reports</b> under each subject category, (3) an aIphabe ic a I index to the subject categories, and (4) an author index. An Explanatory Chart on page iii may be helpful in identifying references to NACA <b>research</b> <b>reports</b> encountered in the literature. Entries included herein duplicate in part the information of the index cards furnished with the individual <b>research</b> <b>reports.</b> Recipients maintaining card fiIes may wish to discard those index cards on hand for unclassified <b>research</b> <b>reports</b> issued during the June 1955 -June 1956 period. Newly available <b>research</b> <b>reports</b> are currently announced in the NACA Research Abstracts and Reclassification Notice and are normally available for a period of five years after announcement. Most of the older <b>research</b> <b>reports</b> (those issued prior to May 1951) are thus available on a "loan only" basis within the United State...|$|R

Shortly after the report's publication and a sharp drop in Citigroup's stock, Charles Prince resigned as the bank's CEO and his successor slashed the dividend. Earlier that year, Forbes magazine had listed Whitney as the second-best stock picker in the capital-market industry. Citigroup stock went on to lose 97% of its value by early 2009.|$|E
