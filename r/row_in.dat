40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of Ir(110) -(1 × 2) has been re-analyzed by low-energy electron diffraction. In this study, the missing-row model with paired <b>rows</b> <b>in</b> the second layer and buckled <b>rows</b> <b>in</b> the third layer, {{as well as}} the Bonzel-Ferrer (sawtooth) model have been examined. In addition, two other models, which are obtained by putting the missing-row atoms back onto the surface in other sites, have also been considered. It is found that the missing-row model with paired <b>rows</b> <b>in</b> the second layer and buckled <b>rows</b> <b>in</b> the third layer gives the best R-factor among all the models considered in this study.
