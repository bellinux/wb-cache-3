5|$|Although much of Britain {{from this}} time is now beneath the sea, remains have been {{discovered}} on land that show horses were present, and being hunted, in this period. Significant finds include a horse tooth dating from between 55,000 and 47,000BC and horse bones dating from between 50,000 and 45,000BC, <b>recovered</b> from Pin Hole Cave, in the Creswell Crags ravine in the North Midlands; further horse remains from the same era have been <b>recovered</b> from Kent's Cavern. In Robin Hood Cave, also in Creswell Crags, a horse tooth was <b>recovered</b> dating from between 32,000 and 24,000BC; this cave has also preserved {{one of the earliest}} examples of prehistoric artwork in Britain– an engraving of a horse, on a piece of horse bone. A goddess figurine carved from horse bone and dating from around 23,000BC has been <b>recovered</b> from Paviland Cave in South Wales.|$|E

Both he and his second in command, Captain Ono Koro, were posthumously promoted to rear admiral, as was normal practice. To further prevent rumours from spreading, healthy and <b>recovered</b> survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the survivors were sent to Truk in the Caroline Islands and assigned to the 41st Guard Force.

Arkansas responded with their longest drive of the game; however, it ended when Deion Belue forced a Knile Davis fumble that was <b>recovered</b> by Nick Perry at the Alabama 20-yard line. With {{the majority of the}} offensive starters pulled from the game, the Crimson Tide reserves led Alabama on a 15-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a 12-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown run early in the fourth quarter.

He also tied the CFL career record for fumbles <b>recovered</b> for touchdowns when he <b>recovered</b> his fourth career blocked punt in an August game against the Toronto Argonauts. In November of that year, Allen again blocked a punt which was <b>recovered</b> by Paul Clatney for a Blue Bombers touchdown. In addition to his large role on special teams, Allen contributed far more defensively in 1989 than he did in his rookie year, recording 27 tackles in 16 regular season games.
