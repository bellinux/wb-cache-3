25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the name came from a Pee-wee brand miniature harmonica and the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. Reubens thought the name Pee-wee Herman was a name that sounded too real to be made up, and like a real name a parent would give a child that they didn't <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
25|$|For Thích Trí Quang, Thiệu was {{a symbol}} of the Diệm era of Catholic domination, when {{advancement}} was based on religion.

500|$|Prior to {{the game}} Hershiser {{explained}} why he wanted to win a World Series more than break the scoreless innings streak: [...] "You can break a record or win a Cy Young and go home and celebrate with your wife and friends, but after it's over there's {{only a few people}} that <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> it. But if you win a team thing, you've got 24 guys and all their families, all their friends, a whole city celebrating." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} were {{critical of the}} choice of setting. Though Lawrence claimed that it [...] "illustrated how good Pemberton and Shearsmith are at creating maximum tension on a minimal budget", others found that it interfered with their enjoyment of the episode. For Owen, it [...] "offered a definite production challenge that was made to look effortless ... but an appreciation of how well something was made isn't enough". Similarly, Lawrence felt that [...] "amid the karaoke din, {{it was hard to}} get a proper handle on the characters or, indeed, <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> their fates".|$|E

500|$|Producer Glen Schofield {{stated the}} biggest {{challenge}} the developers were facing was [...] "just trying to match the breathtaking {{look and feel of}} the movies". Similarly, Neil Young said [...] "We wanted to make something that's authentic and true to the movie. The people on our team <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> making a game that aspires to more than just a sequel, they want to make this equivalent to the movie experience itself." [...] EA Redwood Shores worked closely with New Line Cinema to make the games as authentic as possible, using the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props, lighting studies and motion capture data. EA's partner relations director, Nina Dobner said ...|$|E
500|$|... "Exposé" [...] was {{the fourteenth}} {{episode of the}} series {{directed}} by Stephen Williams, and the ninth written by the screenwriting duo Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Kitsis and Horowitz intended to make the episode an homage to film noir, with two con artists who did the [...] "perfect crime", that eventually goes wrong due to them getting stranded on the island. A reference to the genre was added by having Sawyer read Agatha Christie's Evil Under the Sun. A recurring theme is Nikki and Paulo's selfishness, which eventually leads to their deaths due to them being greedy and [...] "too focused on their own petty needs to <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> anyone else".|$|E
500|$|Exiled 1989 student leader Wang Dan {{said he was}} [...] "ecstatic". Human {{rights lawyer}} Li Heping called the award [...] "huge {{encouragement}} for the Chinese people... an affirmation {{that there are people}} around the world who <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> human rights and the legal system in China, that the world hasn't forgotten us." [...] He added that others, such as Gao Zhisheng, Chen Guangcheng, and Hu Jia, also deserved the prize. The Globe and Mail said that while many activists agreed he was worthy of the award, some radical reformers within Chinese democracy movement, such as Wei Jingsheng, see the moderate Liu as the wrong choice due to his advocacy of a gradual path to constitutional democracy in China.|$|E

500|$|Ian Dunn from One Giant Leap {{also wrote}} positively: [...] "The series has been amazingly gripping. The {{situation}} of the show allows it to be set just about anywhere, much like Doctor Who. The plot is enticing and you <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the characters." [...] He also commented: [...] "One intriguing thing about the series so far {{is that some of}} the scenarios have been rather adult for a show broadcast at 6pm. One episode, set in a Roman world featured a scene in a sex dungeon. Another featured Cerberus doing what all dogs do (no matter how many heads they have) and urinate on a motorbike – well, half man-half motorbike." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{murder of}} {{the heir to the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire and his wife {{produced}} widespread shock across European royal houses, and there was initially much sympathy for the Austrian position. Ordinary people did not <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> what happened, and on the evening of the assassination the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.. Within two days of the assassination, Austria-Hungary and Germany advised Serbia that it should open an investigation, but Secretary General to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Slavko Gruic, replied [...] "Nothing had been done so far and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government." [...] An angry exchange followed between the Austrian Chargé d'Affaires at Belgrade and Gruic.|$|E
500|$|Game Revolution's Eduardo Reboucas mainly {{criticized the}} story, stating that [...] "characters don't offer {{a lot of}} {{explanation}} and the little that is given seems more like a hastily put-together excuse to shoot up some fools and push some buttons on the way." [...] He also said {{that none of the}} conversation paths influence the game, giving no sense of closure or importance. Similarly, Maurice Tan of Destructoid criticized the ending sacrifice for lacking [...] "a good reason to <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> it", but still considered [...] "Arrival" [...] a worthwhile purchase due to its potential impact on Mass Effect 3. Despite the general criticism about the story, the pack's intense atmosphere has been highlighted, with Game Revolution noting that [...] "you'll never be bored by the visuals".|$|E

500|$|In late 2010, Owumi's agent Goran Gramatikov was {{approached}} by another agent looking for players of African descent to play professional basketball in Libya. By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about. I didn't <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the team, I cared about the money and that it was going to be on time and that I was going to be able to further my career and get to feed my family." ...|$|E
500|$|Ordinary {{matter and}} the forces that act on matter can be {{described}} in terms of elementary particles. These particles are sometimes described as being fundamental, since they have an unknown substructure, and it is unknown {{whether or not they are}} composed of smaller and even more fundamental particles. Of central importance is the [...] Standard Model, a theory that is concerned with electromagnetic interactions and the weak and strong nuclear interactions. The Standard Model is supported by the experimental confirmation of the existence of particles that compose matter: quarks and leptons, and their corresponding [...] "antimatter" [...] duals, as well as the force particles that mediate interactions: the photon, the W and Z bosons, and the gluon. The Standard Model predicted the existence of the recently discovered [...] Higgs boson, a particle that is a manifestation of a field within the Universe that can endow particles with mass. Well, actually, they don’t. What they <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> is the Higgs field, because it is so important.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a group of {{children}} singing the chorus, [...] "All I wanna say is that they don't <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> us". In between the chorus lines, one child chants, [...] "Don't worry what people say, we got it true" [...] after which another child says, [...] "Enough is enough of this garbage!" [...] According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] is played in the key of D minor and the track's time signature is common time. The song, which is cited as being a pop song, has a moderately slow tempo of 90 beats per minute. Instruments used include a piano and guitar. Jon Pareles stated that Jackson was calling himself [...] "a victim of police brutality" [...] and a [...] "victim of hate". He continued, [...] "A listener might wonder just who 'Us' is supposed to be... To make the songs lodge in the ear, Jackson uses elementary singsong melodies – a 'nyah, nyah' two-note motif in 'They Don't Care About Us'... and he comes up with all kinds of surprises in the arrangements".|$|E

500|$|He {{released}} goalkeeper Brian Horne, who {{he described}} as a [...] "fat slob"; this {{proved to be an}} unpopular move with [...] "a lot of nasty people who support Hartlepool... who purport to support this club [...] would rather back fat professional players than people who <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> Hartlepool United". As his replacement he signed Stephen Pears from Liverpool, as well as young defenders Glen Davies and Chris McDonald, teenage winger David Clegg, Exeter City midfielder Mark Cooper, and Blackpool midfielder Chris Beech. Hartlepool started the 1996–97 campaign with wins over Colchester United and Fulham, but his playing career came to an end after the fifth game of the season, against Wigan Athletic, when he retired due to a persistent knee injury. He continued to bemoan refereeing decisions which seemed to consistently go against Hartlepool. This in turn led to continued punishments from the FA over his use of foul language towards officials. With his team on a poor run of results {{at the foot of the}} table, he left the club by mutual consent on 4 November 1996. His assistant Mick Tait led the club to a 20th-place finish, and organised a benefit match for Houchen against Middlesbrough, which raised £23,000.|$|E
500|$|Though Sakic {{was a quiet}} individual, he {{was able}} to motivate his team to play at higher levels, which earned him the respect of his peers and executives. The first signs of Sakic's {{leadership}} began to show while still a member of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the bus crash that killed four of his teammates, Sakic was seen {{as the leader of the}} team, acknowledging that the experience changed his outlook on life. Early in his career with the Nordiques (when Mike Hough was still captain), with the team hoping to rebuild around their top draft pick Eric Lindros, and holding onto Lindros' rights for the season when he refused to sign, Sakic suggested that the team could progress without Lindros, saying, [...] "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. Sakic's leadership qualities led him to be courted by other teams, such as in the summer of 1997, when the New York Rangers offered him a large contract in order to replace departed captain Mark Messier, though the Avalanche ultimately matched the offer and retained Sakic.|$|E
500|$|In 1989–90, {{his second}} NHL season, Sakic {{was able to}} switch his number back to his {{familiar}} #19 (Alain Côté had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At {{the start of the}} next season, 1990–91, he was named co-captain along with Steven Finn (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games) and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but would slip during 1991–92 to 94 points, having missed 11 games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while Mike Hough was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the Eric Lindros holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, [...] "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here {{and there are a lot}} of others in this locker room who <b>really</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the Adams Division and last in the entire league for three straight years, from 1989 to 1991.|$|E
