Because Taiwanese carriers did not have direct access to China, EVA Air has used Hong Kong, Bangkok and Macau as interline destinations. EVA Air operated regular charter flights to China in 2008. The airline began regularly scheduled, direct cross-strait operations in December 2008, following the restoration of direct travel links.|$|E

In addition, the robustness of flight operations against unpredictable accidents such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters has become more important to airlines. In this study, the concepts and techniques from complex network theory are used to model airline <b>route</b> <b>networks,</b> and then an effective and efficient genetic algorithm is developed to optimize airline <b>route</b> <b>networks</b> in terms of network properties that may have crucial roles to play in improving the cost-effectiveness and reliability of airspace systems. The simulation results illustrate that the work reported in this study has a good potential to improve the topology of airline <b>route</b> <b>networks</b> in terms of given network properties such as operating costs and network robustness...|$|R
5|$|In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and {{the former}} LCDR City Branch {{formed the basis of}} the new Thameslink <b>route.</b> <b>Network</b> Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A key {{objective}} of the Thameslink Programme was allowing more trains to travel between central London and Brighton, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic Borough Market. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market. This would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a fly-over to connect {{the southern end of the}} new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill). This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead. From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink trains serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDevelopment {{of urban}} {{construction}} and ever-increasing growth of population lead to landuse changes especially in agricultural lands, which {{play an important}} role in providing human food. According to this issue, a proper landuse planning is required to protecting and preserving the valuable agricultural lands and environment, in today’s world. The prediction of urban growth can help in understanding the potential impacts on a region’s water resource, economy and people. One of the effective parameters in development of cities is connective <b>routes</b> <b>network</b> and their different types and qualities that {{play an important role}} in decreasing or increasing the growth of the city. On the other hand, the type of the connective <b>routes</b> <b>network</b> is an important factor for the speed and quality of development. In this paper, two different scenarios were used to simulate landuse changes and analyzing their results. In first scenario, modeling is based on the effective parameters in urban growth without classification of connective <b>routes</b> <b>network.</b> In the second scenario, effective parameters in urban growth were considered and connective routes were classified in 6 different classes with different weights in order to examine their effect on urban development. Simulation of landuse has been carried out for 2020 – 2050. The results clearly showed the effect of the connective <b>routes</b> <b>network</b> classification in output maps so that the effect of the first and second main <b>routes</b> <b>network</b> in development, is conspicuous...|$|R

40|$|During the Roman and early-medieval {{period in}} the Netherlands, an {{extensive}} <b>network</b> of <b>routes</b> connected settlements on the local, regional and supraregional scale. The orientation of these <b>route</b> <b>networks</b> in part was determined by settlement locations, and in part by environmental factors (e. g. soil type, relief). Therefore these <b>route</b> <b>networks</b> provide a key in understanding the dynamic interplay between cultural and environmental factors. This study focuses on modelling Roman and early-medieval routes using a multi-proxy approach. By combining network friction with archaeological data representing settlements, burial sites and shipping-related finds we wish to investigate the possibilities of using these large-scale datasets for modelling Roman and early-medieval <b>route</b> <b>networks</b> in the Netherlands. Data representing past infrastructure and isolated archaeological finds were used to validate the model output. Results show that in geomorphologically diverse lowland regions, such as the Netherlands, network friction is extremely useful for modelling historical <b>route</b> <b>networks.</b> We found a clear relationship between environmental conditions, settlement locations and the spatial distribution of infrastructure. Using evidence-based modelling, {{we were able to}} correctly predict the location of 89 % of the currently identified Roman infrastructure, and 85 % of the known early-medieval infrastructure in the Netherlands within a 1000 m buffer. Additionally, despite only roughly covering a surface area of 13 % in the Roman and 11 % in the early-medieval period of the Netherlands, 82 % and 72 % of all known isolated finds were located within the same buffer...|$|R
