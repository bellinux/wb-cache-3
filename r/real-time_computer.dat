25|$|John Gerrard, (born 20 July 1974) is an Irish artist, {{working in}} Dublin and Vienna, {{best known for}} his sculptures, which {{typically}} take the form of digital simulations displayed using <b>Real-time</b> <b>computer</b> graphics.|$|E
25|$|Gerrard {{received}} a BFA from The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, Oxford University. During {{this time he}} made his first experiments with 3D scanning as a form of sculptural photography. He undertook postgraduate studies at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago and Trinity College, Dublin, and in 2002 was awarded a Pépinières Residency at Ars Electronica, Linz, where he developed his first works in 3D <b>Real-time</b> <b>computer</b> graphics. In June 2009 he began a six-month guest residency at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten, Amsterdam. During 2012 he was Legacy Fellow at Magdalen College, Oxford, working on Exercise (Djibouti) 2012, a commission for Modern Art Oxford and the London 2012 Festival.|$|E
25|$|In a closed-circuit rebreather {{the oxygen}} partial {{pressure}} in the rebreather is controlled, {{so it can be}} maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial {{pressure in the}} breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires <b>real-time</b> <b>computer</b> processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen {{at any time during the}} dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.|$|E

2500|$|Gerrard's {{works are}} {{constructed}} as simulations or virtual worlds, using 3D <b>Real-time</b> <b>computer</b> graphics – a technology originally developed for military use, and now used {{extensively in the}} videogame industry. Although making use of advanced digital technology, Gerrard's work has been noted for its resistance to being categorised as 'new media art'. Gerrard himself regards realtime 3D as 'a post-cinematic medium in which one can manipulate and interact with time in new ways'. He has {{also said that the}} works constitute a continuing reflection upon his own time: 'these melancholic realms are in some way a road movie of the Twentieth Century, a revisiting of the extraordinary comforts and freedoms that I've experienced.' ...|$|E
