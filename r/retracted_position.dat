The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and {{they should not be}} worried seeing them in the <b>retracted</b> <b>position.</b> He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as a reminder of the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E

2500|$|At {{some point}} the glacier reaches a pinning point where calving is reduced due to a fjord {{narrowing}} or shoaling and the glacier’s AAR is near 100. [...] This is occurring with LeConte Glacier and Yathse Glacier. [...] Le Conte Glacier currently has an AAR of 90, is at a <b>retracted</b> <b>position</b> and seems likely to be set to advance after building a terminus shoal. The drop in calving rate allows the glacier to reestablish equilibrium.|$|E
2500|$|Other synapomorphies of Eusauropoda {{includes}} a <b>retracted</b> <b>position</b> {{of the external}} nares. Unlike prosauropods and theropods, which have a snout with smooth, unprotruding alveolar and subnarial regions, eusauropods have snouts with “stepped anterior margins”. [...] Further distinguishing features of eusauropods include {{the absence of the}} contact between the squamosal and the quadratojugal, the absence of the anterior process of the prefrontal, and a distally elongated anterior ramus of the quadratojugal. Separating the anteroventral process of the nasal from the posterolateral process of the premaxilla, eusauropods also have a long maxilla that forms the posteroventral margin of the external naris.|$|E
2500|$|If {{we begin}} at the stable <b>retracted</b> <b>position</b> {{at the end of}} a tidewater glacier cycle the glacier will have a {{moderate}} calving rate and a high AAR, above 70. [...] The glacier will build a terminus shoal of sediment further reducing the calving rate. [...] This will improve the glacier mass balance and the glacier can begin to advance due to this change or an increase in ice flux to the terminus due to increasing snowfall or reduced snow melt. [...] As the advance proceeds the terminus shoal will be pushed in front of the glacier and continue to build, keeping the calving rate low. [...] In the case of the most glaciers such as the Taku Glacier the glacier will eventually build a terminus shoal that is above water and calving will essentially cease. This will eliminate this loss of ice from the glacier and the glacier can continue to advance. Taku Glacier and Hubbard Glacier have been in this phase of the cycle. Taku Glacier which has been advancing for 120 years no longer calves. Hubbard Glacier still has a calving front. The glacier will then expand until the AAR is between 60 and 70 and equilibrium of the non-calving glacier is achieved. [...] The glacier is not very sensitive to climate during the advance as its AAR is quite high, when the terminus shoal is limiting calving.|$|E

60|$|Of the {{internal}} organs, whilst the Cirripede is still within the larva, I have already mentioned the stomach with its pair of cæca: from the <b>retracted</b> <b>position</b> of the thorax and rudimentary abdomen, and consequently of the anus, compared with these {{parts in the}} larva, the alimentary canal is not above half its former length. There is, as yet, {{no trace of the}} filaments supposed by some to act as branchiæ, {{at the base of the}} first pair of cirri. Nor could I perceive a trace of the testes or vesiculæ seminales: the penis is represented by a minute, apparently imperforate projection. I have already briefly described the pair of large, gut-formed bodies in the larva, into the anterior ends of which the cement-ducts ran, and evidently derived their slightly opaque, cellular contents. At a very early age, before the young Cirripede can be distinctly made out, the posterior ends of these gut-formed bodies are absorbed, so as not to pass beyond the cæca of the stomach. When the young Cirripede is plainly developed within the larva, these bodies in a relatively reduced condition are still distinct near the cæca, and at the opposite or anterior end (i. e. lower, in the position in which Cirripedes are usually figured), they have branched out into a sheet of delicate inosculating tubes; these could be traced by every stage, until, in the young perfected Cirripede, they filled the peduncle as ordinary ovarian tubes. In the larva, the two gut-formed bodies or incipient ovaria keep of equal thickness from one to the other end, but in the mature Cirripede, the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and the small, glandular, grape-like masses, near the stomach-cæca, are connected only by a delicate tube; this I failed in tracing in specimens in the very immature condition of those now under description.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a physics-based {{model of}} a {{trombone}} coupled to a lip reed is presented, with the parameter space explored {{for the purpose of}} real-time sound synthesis. A highly configurable dynamic lip valve model is reviewed and its parameters discussed {{within the context of a}} trombone model. The trombone model is represented as two separate parametric transfer functions, corresponding to tapping a waveguide model at both mouthpiece and bell positions, enabling coupling to the reed model as well as providing the instrument’s produced sound. The trombone model comprises a number of waveguide filter elements— propagation loss, reflection at the mouthpiece, and reflection and transmission at the bell—which may be obtained through theory and measurement. As oscillation of a lip reed is strongly coupled to the bore, and playability strongly dependent on the bore and bell resonances, it is expected that a change in the parameters of one will require adapting the other. Synthesis results, emphasizing both interactivity and high-quality sound production are shown for the trombone in both extended and <b>retracted</b> <b>positions,</b> with several example configurations of the lip reed. 1...|$|R

50|$|The <b>retracted</b> <b>position</b> of the slider is {{determined}} by further graphical evaluation. Now that the crank path is found, draw the crank slider arm in the position that places it {{as far away as}} possible from the slider.

The unhinged end of the follower will now be at the fully <b>retracted</b> <b>position</b> of the slider. Next, the extended position of the slider needs to be determined. From the pivot point of the crank arm, draw a new crank arm coincident with the ground level axis but in a position closest to the slider.
