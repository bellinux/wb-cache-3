40|$|Abstract: The Al-Zn-Mg-Cu (7 A 04) alloys were {{prepared}} {{by using the}} method of spraying forming and the hot extrusion. The changes of microstructure and mechanical properties of the spray deposited Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy underwent ageing, regression and <b>reageing</b> treatment (RRA) was studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and other methods. The {{results show that the}} tensile strength of the alloy aged at 120 °C for 24 hours can reach the peak value (760 MPa), but the elongation is only 4. 8 percent. The toughness of the alloy regression treated at 160 °C for 2 hours can increase to 9. 0 percent, but its tensile strength decreases greatly (680 MPa). The reaging treatment at 120 °C can make the tensile strength up to 740 MPa, while the elongation which is 8. 2 percent still keeps a higher level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{evolution}} of second phases {{and its effect}} on tensile mechanical property in artificial ageing and RRA process of super-high strength aluminum alloy is investigated. The result of tensile test shows that the samples of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Ag alloy aged at lower temperature(100 ℃) not only have higher tensile strength up to 753 Mpa but also relatively higher tensile elongation above 9 % than normal temperature(120 ℃) in artificial ageing. The sample of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy has the highest tension strength upto 788 Mpa when aged at 100 ℃ for 48 hours in single step of artificial ageing. Further more in RRA process samples of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy preaged at 100 ℃ for 24 hours retrogressed at 200 ℃ for 7 min and reaged at 100 ℃for 24 hours present the best tensile strength of 795 Mpa than others. The tensile strength of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy after RRA treated decreases with prolonging of retrogression time and <b>reageing</b> time starting from 7 mins and 24 houres respectively. SEM observation shows that crack of the samples in tensile test is created at large particles in the fracture while there are more particles of undissolved phase in Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy containing Ag. TEM observation shows that the dominant strengthening particle corresponding to the peak strength of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy containing Ag when aged at 120 ℃ for 8 hours is η ’ phase while dominant strengthening particle is G. P zone when aged at 100 ℃ for 80 hours. However, η ’ phase as th...|$|E
40|$|The {{upcoming}} Galileo system opens a {{wide range}} of new opportunities in the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) market. However, the characteristics of the future GNSS signals require the development of new GNSS receivers. In the frame of the <b>REAGE</b> project, DEIMOS and ISEL have developed a GNSS receiver targeted for aerospace applications, supporting current and future GPS L 1 and Galileo E 1 signals, based on commercial (or, in the furthest extent, industrial) grade components.

The {{dependence of the}} mechanical properties and corrosion resistance on the heat treatment condition was measured by hardness, tensile, C-ring and conductivity testing. The retrogression time for recovery of the yield strength of the alloy subjected to T 6 treatment was 20 min at 200 °C of retrogression temperature, which was longer than that of Al 7075 alloy.

40|$|The {{effects of}} nickel and nickel {{combined}} tin additions on mechanical properties and microstructural evolutions of aluminum-zinc-magnesium-copper alloys were investigated. Aluminum alloys containing Ni and Sn additives were homogenized at different temperatures conditions and then aged at 120 °C for 24 [*]h (T 6) and retrogressed at 180 °C for 30 [*]min and then <b>reaged</b> at 120 °C for 24 [*]h (RRA).

These improvements are attributed to the precipitation hardening effects of the alloying element within the base alloy {{and the formation of}} nickel/tin-rich dispersoid compounds. These intermetallic compounds retard the grain growth, lead to grain refinement, and result in further strengthening effects. The outcomes of the retrogression and <b>reaging</b> processes which were carried on aluminum alloys indicate that the mechanical strength and Vickers hardness have been enhanced much better than under the aging at T 6 temper...|$|R
