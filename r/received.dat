5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties <b>received</b> at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight <b>received</b> none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes <b>received</b> and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) <b>received</b> more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but <b>received</b> nearly the same amount of seats. More than half of PKB seats were <b>received</b> in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.|$|E
