5|$|Ten years later, Dana Scully shows Fox Mulder a {{videotape}} of a <b>religious</b> <b>service</b> led by the now-grown Samuel (Scott Bairstow), who has become an evangelical faith healer for a ministry run by Calvin. The video shows a supposed healing which later left the follower dead. The agents travel to Clarksville, Tennessee, where they attend a service featuring an enthusiastic sermon by Leonard Vance, the man whom Samuel raised from the dead a decade earlier. The agents learn from Calvin that Samuel has gone missing.|$|E

The last such service was in May 2014 and was attended by the Sovereign. The Sovereign and each knight who has been installed is allotted a stall in the choir of the chapel.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the <b>religious</b> <b>services</b> {{exemption}} to the Copyright Act. The <b>religious</b> <b>services</b> exemption {{is one of many}} exemptions that permit certain types of use without first obtaining permission from the copyright owner, or proving fair use. This article argues that the <b>religious</b> <b>services</b> exemption should be expanded to cover any work used in the course of services as well as the recording, broadcast, and transmission of the services. The first part of this article analyzes the existing <b>religious</b> <b>services</b> exemption under the Copyright Act to define the bounds that uses fall under the exemption. The article then proceeds to present a proposal for expanding the exemption to accommodate the needs of modern religious organizations. Next, the article addresses the Establishment Clause and the constitutionality of the current <b>religious</b> <b>services</b> exemption. Thereafter, the article demonstrates that the <b>religious</b> <b>services</b> exemption can defeat an Establishment Clause challenge by expanding the exemption to cover non-religious ventures, such as teaching in general. Finally, the article examines traditional fair use under copyright law, specifically how the fair use analysis will apply to works used during the course of <b>religious</b> <b>services.</b> The article concludes that the current <b>religious</b> <b>services</b> exemption is inadequate {{to meet the needs of}} a society of instant communication, which has changed the way religious organizations need to effectively communicate their religious messages. However, the proposed expansion would satisfy those needs as well as pass constitutional muster...|$|R
5|$|Ireland's largest {{religious}} group is Christianity. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism representing over 73% {{for the island}} (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most {{of the rest of}} the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland). The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census. The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic's population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said they went to a <b>religious</b> <b>service</b> more than once a week.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a <b>religious</b> <b>service.</b> However, the hypothesis predicts that {{people are more likely}} to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being though both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E
5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a <b>religious</b> <b>service</b> in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E
