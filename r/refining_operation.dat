5|$|Standard Oil {{initially}} {{chose not}} to become directly involved in oil production in Texas, and instead formed Security Oil Company as a <b>refining</b> <b>operation</b> utilizing Guffey-Gulf and Texas Company as suppliers. Following state lawsuits related to anti-trust statutes, Security Oil was reorganized into Magnolia Petroleum Company in 1911. That same year, the Humble Oil Company (today Exxon Corporation) was formed by Ross Sterling and Walter William Fondren in Humble, Texas. The headquarters were moved to Houston, and the company eventually sold half of its shares to Standard Oil of New Jersey, establishing a long-term partnership that lasted for decades. The company built the Baytown Refinery, which became Texas' largest <b>refining</b> <b>operation.</b> In the post-World War II period, Humble became the largest crude oil transporter in the United States, and built pipelines connecting Baytown to Dallas-Fort Worth and West Texas to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Husky Oil {{was born}} during the Depression {{through the efforts}} of Glenn Nielson, an Alberta farmer driven to {{bankruptcy}} when the bank called a loan on his farm. Nielson had moved to Cody, Wyoming, by the time he founded Husky as a <b>refining</b> <b>operation.</b> He turned his attention back to Canada after the second world war, and decided to set up a refinery at Lloydminster. Steel was scarce, so Husky dismantled a small Wyoming refinery constructed during the war to provide bunker fuel to the American Navy. It loaded the pieces onto 40 gondola cars and shipped them north by railway.|$|E
50|$|Europa {{was always}} {{hampered}} by the fact it had to get its supplies from other companies, often themselves in competition with Europa in the New Zealand retail market.

50|$|The Cali Cartel, whose brief roots {{began in}} {{trafficking}} marijuana, soon shifted to cocaine {{due to its}} ease of transporting and greater profit margin. The cartel would be known for innovation in trafficking and production by moving its refining operations out of Colombia to Peru and Bolivia, {{as well as for}} pioneering new trafficking routes through Panama. The Cartel also diversified into opium and was reported to have brought in a Japanese chemist to help its <b>refining</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Company's {{extensive}} {{connections in}} Europe enabled it to branch out into production of food-processing ingredients. In 1863, Erhart and Pfizer began importing crude argols — the tartar deposits formed in wine casks during the aging process—from France and Italy {{and set up}} their own <b>refining</b> <b>operation</b> for the manufacture of tartar and tartaric acid, which was used by bakers, beverage manufacturers, and in cooking.

50|$|The {{interests}} in the Lucas operation at Spindletop were purchased by J. M. Guffey and his associates, creating the Guffey Petroleum Company and Gulf Refining Company of Texas. These companies later became Gulf Oil Corporation, which decades later was bought by California's Chevron.

50|$|In February 2010, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency {{announced}} that the U.S. military {{was about to begin}} large-scale oil production from algal ponds into jet fuel. After extraction at a cost of $2 per gallon, the oil will be refined at less than $3 a gallon. A larger-scale <b>refining</b> <b>operation,</b> producing 50 million gallons a year, is expected to go into production in 2013, with the possibility of lower per gallon costs so that algae-based fuel would be competitive with fossil fuels. The projects, run by the companies SAIC and General Atomics, are expected to produce 1,000 gallons of oil per acre per year from algal ponds.|$|E

50|$|Operating {{through more}} than a dozen subsidiaries, AECOM traces its origins to Kentucky-based Ashland Oil & Refining Company, which in turn grew out of Swiss Drilling Company, founded in Oklahoma in 1910 by J. Fred Miles. He gained control of some 200,000 acres and formed Swiss Oil Company in Lexington. In 1924 Miles {{launched}} a <b>refining</b> <b>operation</b> called Ashland Refining Company, headed by an ambitious young man named Paul Blazer. While the parent company struggled, leading to the ouster of Miles, Ashland prospered under Blazer's leadership, and in 1936 he was named {{chief executive officer of the}} reorganized company, Ashland Oil & Refining Company. In 1966 Ashland acquired Warren Brothers and became involved in the highway construction and construction materials business. The company was now able to take fuller advantage of refinery byproducts used to produce asphalt. Ashland grew into one of the nation's major road-construction firms and laid a future foundation for AECOM. Through a series of acquisitions and technological developments prior to the buyout, Ashland grew to include chemical, petrochemical, highway construction, and construction materials firms within its realm, laying the groundwork for the creation of Ashland Technology in 1985.|$|E

40|$|In {{secondary}} steelmaking, the <b>refining</b> <b>operation</b> {{is typically}} {{carried out in}} a metallurgical ladle that is commonly furnished with gas injection facilities. Since gas injection plays an intrinsic {{role in determining the}} efficiency of secondary steelmaking and thus the quality of final products, a great volume of work has been conducted mostly utilizing air-water systems at room temperature. Despite a portion of the air-water correlations have been adopted in the literature, their applicability to the real argon-metal system is still questionable. The main motivation behind this paper is to present a simple mathematical model for plume hydrodynamics of metallurgical ladles based on the characteristic phenomena and underlying mechanisms of a buoyant plume, where bubble breakup and coalescence occur simultaneously. The main assumptions/simplifications and governing equations are firstly introduced. After that, the accuracy of the model is demonstrated by comparing predicted plume velocities with the ones measured in an industrial ladle. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study on}} the influence of national heavy petroleum in the corrosion of the AISI 444 and AISI 304 stainless steels in simulated <b>refining</b> <b>operation</b> conditions. The petroleum was first characterized through physicochemical analysis (density, fluidity point, viscosity, sulfur concentration). In an attempt to understand the corrosion effect of temperature and of the type of heating the referred types of steel thermal treatments were carried out at three levels of temperature (200, 300 and 400 °C). The procedure was done in conditions close to those in the distillation column. Heat was gradually increased from room temperature, and directly heated to working temperature. Each treatment took 4 hours to be completed. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and the analysis of X rays dispersive energy (EDX) were used after the trials to characterize the samples. The results show that treatment temperature, as well as the type of heating, has distinct influences on each type of steel...|$|E
