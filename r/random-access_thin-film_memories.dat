The thin-film device geometry must allow reasonable scaling down to 20 nm gate pitch. The electrical operation will need to minimize the power consumption and program/erase voltage to avoid reliability problems from temperature and migration due to heat dissipation and defect density concerns in 3 -D integration. In this dissertation, we propose new device solutions to support the 3 -D stacking memory IC technology. We will first presents the fabrication process, material and electrical characteristics of ultra thin body (UTB) thin-film transistor (TFT) metal nanocrystal memories by using in-situ doped polysilicon chemical vapor deposition (CVD) followed by the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process, where surface roughness below 1 nm is achieved. The resulting film is about 13 nm thick with 1019 cm- 3 body doping. SEM and STEM observation demonstrated that size, distribution, and density of nanocrystals could be controlled for electronic device purposes. CBED, 3 D tomographic image and EELS analyses also confirmed the physical stability of the nanocrystals. We are able to achieve memory windows of about 1. 6 V and 2. 3 V by +/- 6 V program/erase (P/E) voltages in single and double layer NCs. From these results, it is confirmed that double layer nanocrystal memories demonstrate retention and charge density improvement over single-layer metal nanocrystals due to the increased number density of nanocrystals. To obtain low contact resistance in the source and drain region, we then demonstrate the self-aligned silicidation (SAS) process. The device split without SAS is also shown where the source/drain resistance improvement by SAS can be clearly observed. Retention time characteristics were monitored in the Al 2 O 3 /Au/(Ti,Dy) xOy devices with Ni SAS, and were extracted to be well beyond 10 years. Vertical integration of Ge TFT devices is another promising method to achieve 3 D integration from the low processing temperature and smaller bandgap. We have obtained a memory window of about 1. 8 V by +/- 5 V P/E voltages for UTB Ge TFT with the gate stack of Al 2 O 3 /Au/(Ti,Dy) xOy and single layer NCs. Retention characteristics were also satisfactory. From these results, the ultra-thin planar polysilicon or Ge layer, SAS process and the gate stack design contribute to the long retention time and large memory window.

The NWs twin-TFT NVM exhibits superior gate control because its tri-gate structure provides a large memory window (DVth) and high program/erase (P/E) efficiency. Additionally, the pro-posed twin-TFT NVM scheme has effective NH 3 and H 2 plasma passivation efficiency due to its split nanowire channels structure.

In this article, we demonstrated successfully an electrically programmable-erasable memory with atomic-layer-deposited Al 2 O 3 /Pt nanocrystals/Al 2 O 3 gate stack under a maximal processing temperature of 300 oC. As the programming voltage was enhanced from 14 to 19 V for a constant pulse of 0. 2 ms, the threshold voltage shift increased significantly from 0. 89 to 4. 67 V. When the programmed device was subjected to an appropriate pulse under negative gate bias, it could return to the original state with a superior erasing efficiency. The above phenomena could be attributed to Fowler-Nordheim tunnelling of electrons from the IGZO channel to the Pt nanocrystals during programming, and inverse tunnelling of the trapped electrons during erasing.

In the first part of this thesis, we demonstrate a charge trapping memory with graphene nanoplatelets embedded in atomic layer deposited ZnO. We first introduce the fabrication process for the memory device and then investigate the memory characteristics. Our experimental analysis on the memory cell shows a large threshold voltage Vt shift (4 V) at low operating voltages (6 / − 6 V), good retention (> 10 years), and good endurance characteristics (> 104 cycles). The resulting memory behavior is also verified by theoretical computations. In the second part, we demonstrate the use of laser-synthesized indium-nitride nanoparticles (InN-NPs) as the charge trapping layer in the memory cell. We first introduce the indium-nitride nanoparticle synthesis and then detail the fabrication process of the memory device. The experimental analysis of the memory cell results in a noticeable threshold voltage Vt shift (2 V) at low operating voltages (4 V) in addition to the similar retention and endurance performance with the graphene-based memory cells. The memory behavior was also verified with theoretical computations for the InN-NPs based memory cells.

40|$|In recent years, organic {{thin-film}} electronics {{have emerged}} as a route towards flexible, low-cost, large area applications, which are unfeasible in the current silicon technology. For example, low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) tags that can be placed on any object, as envisioned by the Internet of Things, for smart labeling, security, monitoring, or tracking purposes. For these applications, a nonvolatile memory functionality is crucial for their intended operation. Therefore, simultaneous {{to the development of}} organic transistors and circuits, progress needs to be made towards a compatible nonvolatile, electrically reprogrammable memory array. In this doctoral research, we aim to realize such an organic memory array that can be integrated with the organic logic circuits on the same, flexible substrate. More specifically, we focus on the device architecture and materials of ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFET) as the basic memory unit. The objective of this work was pursued by a combination of i) technological advancements over the state-of-the-art; ii) further understanding of the device operation; iii) devising a read-and write scheme suited for an array; and iv) use of novel materials and device architectures. By optimizing the processing conditions, we demonstrate high-performance bottom gate - top contact (BG-TC) FeFETs with pentacene as the organic semiconductor, as shown in Chapter 2. These memory devices can switch within a few ms, and can be cycled for at least 10000 times. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate a long term retention data of more than one year. These results make this device highly promising for non-volatile memory applications. Unexpectedly for a bi-stable material, the BG-TC FeFET shows three reprogrammable memory states: OFF, Intermediate and ON state. Using Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy, we elucidate the device operation in this device structure in Chapter 3. These measurements show that the ferroelectric layer in the channel region of the FeFET is not fully polarized in the OFF and Intermediate states. The difference between these two states can be explained by a different injection property of the contacts, caused by the ferroelectric polarization state underneath the source-drain contacts. This refinement clarifies the peculiarities experimentally found in literature, as well as in our own results. To integrate with organic circuits, as well as to fabricate memory arrays, photolithography must be used. In addition, the bottom gate - bottom contact (BG-BC) device architecture needs to be adopted. By further technology development, we realize such a memory FeFET that can be integrated with current state-of-the-art organic circuits on flexible substrates, as demonstrated in Chapter 4. Moreover, we employ this technology to fabricate a passive NAND array, as described in Chapter 5. The NAND architecture was chosen, as it offers the highest possible density of all transistor memory arrays. Despite the fact that passive arrays are more challenging to reliably address all FeFETs, we demonstrate a non-destructive read and write operation in the NAND array. Finally, novel device architecture and materials are explored to improve the memory characteristics in Chapter 6. Replacing pentacene with novel, high mobility semiconductors alone are proven to be unsuccessful to enlarge the memory window in the BG-BC FeFET. On the other hand, by adapting a planar heterojunction structure in the device, the memory window can be significantly enlarged by 30 - 60 %. The heterojunction device architecture is promising for further improvements, as many combinations of organic semiconducting materials are possible.
