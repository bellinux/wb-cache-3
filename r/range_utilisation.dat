40|$|Reintroduction is {{used for}} re-establishing species in their former ranges {{where they had been}} extirpated. In South Africa, the growth in tourism {{industry}} in recent years has resulted in rapid establishment of wildlife reserves, where the land was historically used for livestock farming. Large carnivores are often reintroduced in these reserves for conservation and tourist attractions. However, long-term monitoring on post-release behaviour that is critical for reintroduction success remains limited. The reintroduction of lions (Panthera leo) to Dinokeng Game Reserve has provided an opportunity to investigate the behaviour of reintroduced large carnivores and their impact on prey behaviour. The early post-release period is critical for reintroduced animals to learn the locations of essential resources for fitness and survival. In this study, early post-release movement of lions was investigated. Movement patterns varied greatly between individuals. Post-release dispersal from the release site was observed, but some groups returned to the area of release while others settled further away. Rates of movements differed at different times of the day and some of the lions avoided buildings while others showed a sign of habituation over time. Despite individual variations, the movement patterns started to stabilise {{by the end of the}} first season, suggesting that the animals had been exploring the environment before settlement. To understand the space use of reintroduced lions, their second and third order of habitat selections, home <b>range</b> <b>utilisation</b> and home range resource selection, respectively, were examined. Exploratory behaviour was found in space use patterns. The rates of expansion in home range sizes were the highest after release, and declined over time. Resource selection patterns showed consistent change in trends but also stabilized over time. All lions established home ranges at their release area and selected for landscape features with low topographic roughness, high prey availability and accessibility, and low human disturbance. The locations and order of release had great impact on spatial behaviour by influencing inter-group interactions. Lions avoided the home ranges of those released earlier at the same site and their selected vegetation. The presence of predators generates a “landscape of fear” in which prey adjust anti-predatory behaviour according to the levels of perceived predation risk. Intense and routine vigilance response of wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and zebra (Equus quagga burchellii) to the “landscape of fear” topographies were tested in this study to assess the impact of predator reintroductions. Response was species-specific, but in general, intense vigilance increased with higher predator encounter rate, higher predator lethality and lower effectiveness of the vigilance behaviour. In contrast, routine vigilance response related more to the amount of time the animals could potentially spare when foraging under different environmental conditions. This study indicates the usefulness of monitoring animal movement and patterns of habitat selection in assessing post-release wildlife dynamics. It highlights the importance of adequate spatial planning of release sites when multiple releases are to occur, to minimise inter-group competition and maximise the reintroduction success; and the application of focal sampling of prey behaviour as indicator of the intensity of predator impact. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Land {{ownership}} and range resources management and utilisation in Zimbabwe spans over three distinct historical times. In pre-colonial Zimbabwe, chiefs {{together with their}} aides and subordinates were custodians of land and its encampent resources. Low livestock and human populations then, coupled with a cultural common sense of purpose within communities created a framework {{for a kind of}} common property resource management that led to sustainable <b>range</b> resource <b>utilisation.</b> The colonial era through the Land Appor- tionment Act of 1930, Native Land Husbandry Act of 1951 and the Land Tenure Act of 1969 saw the emergence of Tribal Trust Lands located in fragile environs of agro-ecological zones IV to V that became home to black Zimbabweans who had been dispossessed of resource-rich lands of agro-ecological zones I to III by the settler whites. Sustainable <b>range</b> resource <b>utilisation</b> initiatives such as the construction of mechanical conservation works, demarcation of arable from grazing land and grazing schemes in the Tribal Trust Lands failed partly due to resistance by the indigenous communities and the increases in both human and livestock populations that led to fragmentation of arable plots and subsequent encroachment into grazing lands Independence brought with it rural development programmes and legislative changes aimed at stemming range resource degradation as well as bringing equity in land ownership among different races in Zimbabwe. Having purportedly failed to access enough land for resettlement via the willing-buyer willing-seller concept as stated during the Lancaster House Conference of 1979, the Government of Zimbabwe embarked on the Land Reform Programme that degenerated in the Fast Track Land Reform Programme whereby white- owned commercial farms were occupied without any prior logistical and infrastructural arrangements for the incoming settlers. The Fast Land Reform Programme has somewhat managed to avail prime pieces of land to hitherto disadvantaged black Zimbabweans.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} and ubiquitous use of global positioning devices have revolutionised movement ecology. Scientists {{are able to}} collect increasingly larger movement datasets at increasingly smaller spatial and temporal resolutions. These data consist of trajectories in space and time, represented as time series of measured locations for each tagged animal. Such data are analysed and visualised using methods for estimation of home <b>range</b> or <b>utilisation</b> distribution, which are often based on 2 D kernel density in geographic space. These methods {{have been developed for}} much sparser and smaller datasets obtained through very high frequency (VHF) radio telemetry. They focus on the spatial distribution of measurement locations and ignore time and sequentiality of measurements. We present an alternative geovisualisation method for spatio-temporal aggregation of trajectories of tagged animals: stacked space-time densities. The method was developed to visually portray temporal changes in animal use of space using a volumetric display in a space-time cube. We describe the algorithm for calculation of stacked densities using four different decay functions, normally used in space use studies: linear decay, bisquare decay, Gaussian decay and Brownian decay. We present a case study, where we visualise trajectories of lesser black backed gulls, collected over 30 days.

Thrombin also promotes platelet activation. In the last few years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of thrombin by radiologists in a variety of clinical circumstances. It is best known for its use in the treatment of pseudoaneurysms following angiography. However, there are now a variety of cases in the literature describing the treatment of traumatic, inflammatory and infected aneurysms with thrombin in a variety of locations within the human body. There have even been recent reports describing the use of thrombin in conventional aneurysms as well as ruptured aneurysms. Its use has also been described in the treatment of endoleaks (type II) following aneurysm repair. In nearly all of these cases, treatment with thrombin requires imaging guidance.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the strategy of}} re-visioning myth within contemporary European feminist theatre, a strategy which has proved popular over time and across cultures but which has received insufficient critical attention. This study seeks to fill that gap by offering a framework through which this practice can be considered, exploring the diverse motivations of individual playwrights, and evaluating the achievements of particular plays in context. Twelve case studies are included, grouped together to demonstrate a variety of approaches to re-visioning <b>ranging</b> from <b>utilisation</b> of myth as pretext for examination of social issues, to an apparent abandonment of contemporary reality for a utopian otherworld. However, it is argued first that mythical, social and psychological strands remain intertwined, and second that the diversity of approaches reflects the importance for feminist theatre of selecting strategies to meet specific needs, and that these strategies can thus be viewed as complementary rather than in conflict. Chapter One introduces selected critical perspectives on myth, re-visioning and feminist theatre, framing these within Rita Felski's model of the feminist counter-public sphere. Chapter Two discusses plays by Hella Haasse, Franca Rame and Sarah Daniels, which examine myth as ideological narrative. Plays by Maureen Duffy, Caryl Churchill and David Lan, and Timberlake Wertenbaker, considered in Chapter Three, investigate myths of female violence. Chapter Four looks at plays by Andree Chedid and Angela Carter which use myth to confront women's complicity in maintaining the status quo. Plays by Serena Sartori, Renata Coluccini and Helene Cixous, discussed in Chapter Five, offer psychological investigations into women's relationships with myth, language and power.

The aim was to examine home <b>ranges</b> and habitat <b>utilisation</b> of the fish in the regulated River Namsen in the area of Snåsamoen and in the non-regulated tributary Mellingselva. Furthermore, comparisons in space use between day and night time and between rivers and seasons between the regulated river were investigated. A total of 90 småblank were tagged in three separate periods (Snåsamoen: autumn 2014 n = 33 and spring 2015 n = 20, Mellingselva: autumn 2015 n = 36). Of the total number of radio tagged småblank were 35 individuals randomly selected for radio tracking over a period of 4 to 5 months. The selected individuals were then used for home range analysis (Snåsamoen: autumn n = 15, Snåsamoen: spring n = 6, Mellingselva: autumn n = 16). Home ranges were significantly larger in the regulated river in both seasons, compared to the non-regulated tributary (Snåsamoen: autumn mean = 21 715 m 2 and spring mean = 29 688 m 2, Mellingselva: autumn mean = 2 362 m 2). The condition factor of fish tagged at Snåsamoen was significantly lower than of those tagged in Mellingselva, despite similar body length. The fish with same body length did in addition have significantly larger home range at Snåsamoen than Mellingselva, which can result in småblank having to utilise larger areas to obtain their body condition. The body conditions in spring were significantly lower than in autumn at Snåsamoen, which may be caused by a reduction in body mass during winter. The length of river stretch used was longer when considering only day time locations (Snåsamoen: autumn mean = 301 m and spring mean = 191 m, Mellingselva: autumn mean = 116 m) than when considering only night time locations between rivers and between seasons (Snåsamoen: autumn mean = 104 m and spring mean = 136 m, Mellingselva: autumn mean = 91 m). The fish utilised areas with larger particle sizes in Mellingselva than at Snåsamoen, resulting in more shelter availability. Mellingselva had in general faster flowing water velocities which is often more preferred to Atlantic salmon than slower velocities found at Snåsamoen. In conclusion, the area investigated in the non-regulated tributary seemed better suited for 3 and 4 years old småblank, than the regulated River Namsen at Snåsamoen. This is based on the results from home ranges, body condition of småblank and habitat availability in the two rivers...|$|R
40|$|With deregulation, {{the focus}} for dairy {{production}} in northern Australia {{has changed from}} cow production to improving efficiency to maintain profitability. This requires more effective production and utilisation of forage for greater cost efficiency. This paper summarises the growth of tropical and temperate grass pastures on dairy farms in 2 rainfall environments in south-east Queensland. Fertiliser and feed inputs and milk output were investigated, and forage utilised for milk production was calculated by the reverse application of feeding standards. Growth of tropical grass pastures in summer averaged 100 kg DM/ha/day, with greatest yields at recommended nitrogen inputs. Irrigated annual ryegrass pastures produced 40 - 50 kg DM/ha/day in winter and over 60 kg DM/ha/day in spring. West Moreton farms (800 mm rainfall) produced 7 - 10 t DM/ha/year from rain grown tropical grass. Corresponding yields for East Moreton farms (1000 mm rainfall) were 19 t DM/ha/year. Irrigated temperate pastures yielded up to 10 t DM/ha/season in both regions. Pasture <b>utilisation</b> <b>ranged</b> from 20 - 30 % for tropical grass in summer to 70 - 80 % for temperate pasture in winter.

40|$|Predicting {{the threat}} of {{extinction}} aids efficient distribution of conservation resources. This paper utilises a comparative macroecological approach to investigate {{the threat of}} extinction in Neotropical birds. Data on ecological variables for 1708 species are analysed using stepwise regression to produce minimum adequate models, first using raw species values and then using independent contrasts (to control for phylogenetic effects). The models differ, suggesting phylogeny has significant effects. The raw species analysis reveals that number of zoogeographical regions occupied, elevational <b>range</b> and <b>utilisation</b> of specialised microhabitats were negatively associated with threat, while minimum elevation and body mass were positively associated, whereas the independent contrasts analysis only identifies zoogeographical regions as important. Confining the analysis to the 582 species restricted to a single zoogeographical region reveals elevational range and number of habitats occupied to be negatively correlated with threat whether the analysis {{is based on the}} raw data or on independent contrasts. Analysis of four contrasting zoogeographical regions highlights regional variation in the models. In two Andean regions the threat of extinction declines as the elevation range across which the species occurs increases. In the presence of substantial human populations on high Andean plateaus, a species with a greater elevational range {{may be more likely to}} persist at some (relatively) unsettled altitudes. In Central South America, the strongest predictor of threat is minimum elevation of occurrence: species with a lower minimum are less threatened. The minimum elevation result suggests that lowland species experiencing an ecological limit to their minimum elevation (min. elevation > 0 m) may be more at risk than those not experiencing such a limit (min. elevation = 0 m). Finally, in southern Amazonia, where there is little altitudinal variation, the only weak predictors of threat are body size, larger species being more threatened, and number of habitats, species occupying more habitats being less threatened. These contrasting results emphasise the importance of undertaking extinction risk analyses at an appropriate geographical scale. Since the models explained only a low percentage of total variance in the data, the effects of human-mediated habitat disturbance across a wide range of habitats may be important. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} between woody cover and habitat use by sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) in Kruger National Park (KNP) are poorly documented. Previous studies of sable antelope habitat did not explicitly measure space use {{and its relationship}} to habitats attributes. Global positioning system (GPS) telemetry permits the accurate collection of animal locations, which can be used to estimate home <b>ranges</b> and <b>utilisation</b> distributions (UDs). Resource utilisation functions (i. e., functions regressing probabilistic space use by animals such as UDs on landscape attributes) were used to analyse {{relationships between}} habitat use and woody cover with historical black and white aerial photographs. The dot-grid and object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods were used to estimate woody cover from digital aerial photographs and the results validated with field collected woody cover data. The dot-grid method was used to estimate woody cover by expressing canopy hits as a percentage of total dots using a regular lattice of evenly spaced dots overlaid on digital aerial photograph sections. The OBIA approach selected homogeneous groups of pixels (i. e., objects) and incorporated image aspects such as shape, size, texture, and brightness into the woody cover classification. The size of the objects depended on the scale selected for identifying single woody plants and the resolution of the aerial images. The two woody cover estimators (i. e., the dot-grid and object-based image segmentation) produced contrasting results. However, more confidence was placed {{in the use of the}} dot-grid method. The linear regression models revealed weak/ non-significant relationships between woody cover and space use by sable antelope. However, woody cover was more abundant in the wet season home range (36 ± 1 %) when compared with the dry season home range (30 ± 1 %) (t 0. 05, 163 = 3. 8, P < 0. 001). Woody cover in the dry season non-core areas (31 ± 1 %) was significantly more than that in the core areas (28 ± 1 %) (t 0. 05, 182 = - 1. 7, P = 0. 04). The avoidance of home range areas with more woody cover during the dry season suggests that sable antelope are risk sensitive foragers that maximise the intake of available low quality food resources. The results from this study also indicate that sable antelope may be selecting for woody cover at scales larger than the one used here...|$|R

Treatments included a range of stocking rates in native pastures, legume-oversown native pasture and animal diet supplement/spring-burning pastures. Seasonal rainfall throughout this study was below the long-term mean. Mean annual pasture <b>utilisation</b> <b>ranged</b> from 13 to 61 %. Annual liveweight gains per head in native pasture were highly variable among years and ranged {{from a low of}} 43 kg/steer at 2 ha/steer to a high of 182 kg/steer at 8 ha/steer. Annual liveweight gains were consistently highest at light stocking and decreased with increasing stocking rate. Annual liveweight gain per hectare increased linearly with stocking rate. These stocking rate trends were also evident in legume-oversown pastures although both the intercept and slope of the regressions for legume-oversown pastures were higher than that for native pasture. The highest annual liveweight gain for legume-oversown pasture was 221 kg/steer at 4 ha/steer. After 13 years, annual liveweight gain per unit area occurred at the heaviest stocking rate despite deleterious changes in the pasture. Across all years, the annual liveweight advantage for legume-oversown pastures was 37 kg/steer. Compared with native pasture, changes in annual liveweight gain with burning were variable. It was concluded that cattle productivity is sustainable when stocking rates are maintained at 4 ha/steer or lighter (equivalent to a utilisation rate around 30 %). Although steer liveweight gain occurred at all stocking rates and economic returns were highest at heaviest stocking rates, stocking rates heavier than 4 ha/steer are unsustainable because of their long-term impact on pasture productivity...|$|R

Seedling recruitment was the major determinant of change in plant density, although some individual H. contortus plants did survive throughout the study. Burning in spring 1999, particularly at light stocking rate, promoted seedling recruitment above that in both unburnt native and legume oversown pasture and resulted in increased H. contortus plant density. In the legume oversown treatments, S. scabra cv. Seca density increased rapidly from 15 plants/m 2 in 1988 to 140 plants/m 2 in 2001 following a lag phase between 1988 and 1993. This increased S. scabra density was associated with an eventual decline in H. contortus plant density through reduced seedling recruitment. It was concluded that H. contortus population density is sustainable at stocking rates of 4 and 5 ha/steer (30 % pasture utilisation) and that spring burning at light stocking rate can promote H. contortus populations. Increasing densities of S. scabra need to be managed to prevent its dominance...|$|R

Fieldwork {{was comprised of}} several components: guina captured in live traps were fitted with radio collars and monitored on foot using standard radiotelemetry techniques; landcover maps were created for each study area from satellite data, aerial photography and ground truthing, and the relative abundance and diversity of potential small mammal prey were assessed by means of grid-based live-trapping studies and tree-mounted hair-traps. The behavioural data obtained from the radiotelemetry study were analysed using RANGES V to assess the area requirements of the guina and {{to determine how the}} home ranges and movements of individuals were distributed with respect to those of conspecifics. This data was also investigated with reference to the landcover maps generated for each site to identify habitat categories that were preferentially utilised or avoided by guina. The diet of this species was determined via faecal analysis. The composition of the guina diet within each site was then related to small mammal relative abundances determined in the field. Small mammals, particularly rodents represented the major component of the guina diet, and no evidence of prey selection was determined. Trapping surveys indicated both sites had abundant prey resources in the form of relatively dense rodent populations. Radiocollared guina were largely arrhythmic in their activity pattern and neighbouring individuals within both populations showed a high degree of spatial overlap, both within and between sexes. Core use areas also overlapped extensively, and no evidence was found to indicate that guina actively avoid conspecifics. These cats exhibited a consistent preference for relatively dense, thicket-forest habitat over less complexly structured vegetation, including stands of Nothofagus forest, the habitat category previously assumed to be key for this species. The results of this study are discussed within the context of conservation management for the continued survival of this endangered felid.

40|$|Wapiti (Cervus canadensis nelsonii) were {{released}} in {{the head of the}} George Sound, Fiordland National Park, New Zealand, in 1905. There has since been little research carried out on the population and study would be beneficial, as the herd is of national importance for big game hunting. International literature was reviewed to provide a background on the key drivers of habitat choice in wapiti and red deer (Cervus elaphus). Literature suggests that wapiti movements and home ranges would be greatest during winter due to limited plant growth and forage availability. Literature also suggests that wapiti would prefer habitats at edges between forest and field, where habitat transition increases plant diversity, resulting in high forage densities. A GPS collaring study was carried out in order to estimate ranging behaviour and habitat selection by wapiti in Fiordland. Six animals were captured, collared and released in early- through to mid- 2014, after which, location data was retrieved for the winter season (June, July, August). Home <b>ranges</b> and habitat <b>utilisation</b> were estimated using geographical data analysis packages. It was hypothesised that ranging behaviour would be reduced when compared to elk populations in North America due to milder winters, and better foraging, in Fiordland. Daily movement varied significantly, from 0. 2 - 6 km, however, averages suggest that wapiti typically move little more than 500 m per day during winter. Home range size varied between animals in this study, ranging from 44 - 733 ha (100 % MCP) or 58 - 1385 ha (95 % KDE). These home ranges and daily movements were significantly lower than for elk studied elsewhere and were more comparable to those of red deer in Western Europe, which is consistent with the first hypothesis. It was also hypothesised that wapiti would prefer similar, forest edge, habitat composition to that which was previously observed overseas. A wide range of selection values were produced for different habitats suggesting that habitat preference varies between individual animals. 50 % KDE core areas showed that transitional areas made up an important part of wapiti habitat choice which, is consistent with the second hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Design {{of modern}} {{powerful}} transistor generators with external exitation in meter and decameter wave <b>ranges</b> requires maximum <b>utilisation</b> of the transistor power capabilities. Transistors have no margins on the maximum permissible parameters and even minor derivations from normal mode can cause it fail. Known protection devices for band power amplifiers have a time constant greater than 20 - 30 us permissible overhead of transistor {{and can not}} protect the amplifier from short-circuit load or its failure. Helicon isolator at the output of transmitters for meter and decameter waves protects the transistor from the load mismatch and also decreases the intermodulation distortions level. The goal of this work is to study the on-turn transient of helicon isolator during the antenna break or short-circuit. Formulation of the problem. The maximum power dissipation in the helicon isolator depends on the maximum allowable temperature of the semiconductor resonator plate. In this work the transient processes in the helicon isolator after the sudden load mismatch are studied {{in order to reduce}} its sizes and weight for the given power level. Simulation. Temperature changes of the main part of helicon isolator ? helicon resonator with sizes 10 x 10 x 10 mm- 3 of indium antimonide dopped with tellurium with concentration 2. 1 1023 m- 3 are simulated in the approximation of one-dimensional model. The termal time constant was calculated. The resonator temperature variations are calculated with the different backward power levels. It is shown, that the time to reach the critical temperature 60 ?? for the isolator with 10 W dissipation power level is more than 0. 1 s and much more then required timeout for even simple emergency shutdown system of the band power amplifier for transmitters. Experimental results. Experimental study of the helicon isolator transient shows that the reverse attenuation decreases from - 23 dB to - 20 db in 0. 6 s and to - 15 dB in 1. 1 s. This timeout is enough to protect the transistor amplifier of the transmitter in emergency mode up to the power supply shutdown. Conclusion. Helicon isolators are efficient protection of transistor transmitters from load mismatch in meter and decameter wave ranges. The reflected power is adsorbed in the isolator at antenna break or short-circuits. The thermal time constant of the isolator is enough for even the very simple emergency power shutdown system to switch. ? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ? ????????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????????????????. ????????, ??? ??? ?????? ??? ???????? ????????? ????????

40|$|The African lion is {{in decline}} across its <b>range,</b> and consumptive <b>utilisation</b> and trade {{of their body}} parts and skins has been {{postulated}} as a cause for concern. We undertook a pan-African questionnaire and literature survey to document informed opinion and evidence for the occurrence of domestic and international trade and consumption in African lion body parts across current and former range states. Sixty-five people from 18 countries participated in the online questionnaire survey (run from July 2014 to May 2015), with information provided for 28 countries (including 20 out of 24 countries believed to have extant populations). Respondents were experts within their professional spheres, and 77 % had ≥ 6 years relevant experience within lion conservation or allied wildlife matters. Their opinions revealed wide sub-regional differences in consumptive use, drivers of trade, and access to lions that impact wild lion populations in different ways. Traditional medicine practices (African and Asian) were {{perceived to be the}} main uses to which lion body parts and bones are put domestically and traded internationally, and there is reason for concern about persistent imports from former lion range states (mainly in West Africa) for parts for this purpose. The domestic, rather than international, trade in lion body parts was perceived to be a bigger threat to wild lion populations. Parts such as skin, claws, teeth and bones are thought to be in most demand across the continent. The impact of international trade on wild populations was acknowledged to be largely unknown, but occasionally was judged to be 'high', and therefore vigilance is needed to monitor emerging detrimental impacts. Seventeen countries were nominated as priorities for immediate monitoring, including: South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Reasons for their selection include: prevalence of trophy hunting, 'hot spots' for poaching, active domestic trade in lion body parts, trade in curios for the tourist market, and histories of legal-illegal wildlife trade. This survey, and increased incident reports since mid- 2015 of lion poisoning and poaching in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa, and sporadic poaching events in Uganda and Tanzania, are signalling an escalating trend in the trade of lion products that is an increasing threat to some national populations. The evidence is sufficient to make more detailed investigation of this trade a conservation priority...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were(1) to analyse a data-set on cheetah home <b>range</b> size, habitat <b>utilisation,</b> prey selection and hunting behaviour in the Kruger National Park (KNP), and (2) conduct a comparative study on the above aspects of cheetah ecology {{across a variety of}} African savanna ecosystems. Cheetah home range sizes in the KNP for territorial male cheetahs were 173 km 2, 438 km 2 for a nomadic male cheetah coalition, and 193 km 2 and 179 km 2 for two female cheetahs. Cheetahs preferred open savanna habitat, although females used areas with thicker bush such as drainage lines) more than males, probably because this is the preferred habitat of their main prey. Analysis showed that while females were closely associated with drainage lines, males were closely associated with roads. A male cheetah coalition preferred scent marking along roads rather than in the bush. Impala occurred most frequently in the cheetahs’ diet, although males took larger prey than females. Cheetahs hunted and killed more frequently in open savanna, even though impala densities were higher in adjacent habitats. Mean chase distance for successful hunts was 18 l 9 m and unsuccessful hunts was 96 m. Cheetah hunting success was 20. 7 %, kleptoparasitism was 11. 8 %, mean kill retention time was 165 min, kill rated averaged 1 kill per 4. 61 days, and consumption rate of a three-male cheetah coalition was 1, 4 kg meat/cheetah/day. Across African savanna ecosystems, female cheetah home range size was determined by the dispersion patterns and biomass of medium-sized prey. Female home range size was larger in areas with migratory (833 km 2) than sedentary prey (105 km 2) and increase as prey biomass decreased in areas with sedentary prey only. Conversely, male cheetah territory size was smaller in areas with migratory (37 km 2) than sedentary prey (108 km 2). Although it was predicted that male cheetah territory size would be determined by female cheetah density, no relationship was found here. Across a range of African savannas, cheetahs showed distinct preferences for open habitats that provided some woody cover. Adults (40 %) and juveniles (20 %) of medium-sized prey made up the largest proportion in the cheetahs’ diet. There were, however, significant variations in the size and age groups of prey taken by cheetahs in different areas. Areas with the least amount of cover appeared to have the longest mean chase distance, and the greatest percentage hunting success and incidents of kleptoparasitism (%). A population viability analysis, using VORTEX, found that cheetah population viability was greater in a woodland savanna than a grassland savanna, particularly at small population sizes. While the grassland savanna population was most affected by changes in juvenile mortality the woodland savanna population with exceptionally high cub mortality may be a sink for cheetahs while the woodland population with lower cub mortality and predicted high dispersal rates may be a source. Maximum annual litter size and female mortality rates had large impacts on population persistence. Dissertation (MSc (Zoology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|The {{significant}} {{decline of}} the world fish catch has given aquaculture a promising future. Many countries, including Indonesia, are developing their aquaculture industry. Although the fish farming industry in Indonesia is dominated by small scale fish farmers, it still showed a significant growth in the last decades. Operating a fish farming business is different to other small business or other manufacturing-based businesses because it looks after live species that live in an aquatic environment. Therefore, besides mastering business skills, fish farmers also master technical fish farming skills which include water quality management, feeding management, fish parasite and disease handling. Inadequate fish farming skills can lead to business failure and even business closure. In their attempt to achieve income improvement and ensure product sustainability, small scale fish farmers carry out dedicated activities. The present research focused on entrepreneurial activities of small scale fish farmers that included fish feed production, fish seed production, market extension, fish species extension, product <b>range</b> extansion and <b>utilisation</b> of other fish parts. In carrying out fish farming activities, the fish farmers contend with endogenous and exogenous factors as well as constraints and problems. This research identified the endogenous and exogenous factors as well as constraints and problems that influence fish farmers’ income improvement and product sustainability, identified implemented entrepreneurial activitivies in Central Java, compared entrepreneurial activities between fish farmers with different demographic background and developed recommendations based {{of the findings of}} this research. This research collected data through questionnaire distribution to small scale fish farmers in Central Java. The questionnaire was distributed to two different groups of fish farmers: groups of fish farmers that had received awards {{in the last five years}} and groups that had not. The data was analysed by using exploratory factor analysis in order to group the variables into meaningful factors. This assisted in the interpretation of results and testing of hypotheses. The reliability of the eight scales was tested by using Cronbach’s Alpha test and Pearson’s correlations. The core analysis of this research used descriptive analysis, logistic regression analysis and chi-square test of association. The findings of this research showed that there was a positive correlation between income improvement and endogenous factors but not with exogenous factors. On the other hand, product sustainability was found to have positive correlation with both endogenous and exogenous factors. Results also indicated that both income improvement and product sustainability correlated positively with constraints and problems. The analyses showed that there is at least one entrepreneurial activity that was carried out by small scale fish farmers in Central Java and that there were significant differences between awardees and non-awardees in Central Java in carrying out entrepreneurial activities. Significant differences were also found between gender groups, age groups, marital status, different education level, different fish farmer group level, and different reasons to become fish farmers. Based on the findings of this research, recommendations for the aquaculture and fisheries industry, government, educational institutions and research communities in Indonesia were developed on aspects that may contribute to the success of small scale fish farmers in obtaining their income improvement and product sustainability. It is hoped that the Indonesian federal, provincial and regional governments can include promotion of entrepreneurial activities in the aquaculture development programs and future policies. Also with support from the government, it is expected the small scale fish farmers will proactively implement entrepreneurial activities to increase their income and to implement sustainable aquaculture to ensure product sustainability in their business...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the aerodynamic design and performance estimation of radial inflow turbines for renewable power generation (RPG) applications with particular focus on low (100 C) to moderate (250 C) resource temperature Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC). At a preliminary stage, Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) applications provided the main motivation to develop a novel power system. To this end, radial inflow turbines were considered as the most appropriate turbine/expander for a proof-of-concept supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2) Brayton cycle EGS application. This was based on turbine charts developed from the performance of various real-world turbomachines across their <b>ranges</b> of <b>utilisation,</b> and also by carrying out the design of several radial inflow turbines for a geothermal power plant, making use of CO 2 as the working fluid in order to achieve a high thermal cycle efficiency. These designs were used to perform Computational Fluid Dynamics, (CFD) calculations and export loading data in order to perform a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) study and determine the feasibility of the proposed designs. Different arrangements (single-stage and two-stage) were trialled and results suggested that such designs can be made feasible for a reasonable working life, if attention is given to hub and blade design as well as material selection. Furthermore, a comprehensive one-dimensional meanline design and performance estimation approach for radial inflow turbines and its integration with a thermodynamic cycle analysis procedure are presented as the core of the thesis. An original code was developed in Python that takes a novel approach to the automatic selection of feasible machines for a given application based on predefined operating conditions. It comprises a brute-force search algorithm that traverses the entire search space based on key non-dimensional parameters and rotational speed. In this study, an in-depth analysis and subsequent implementation of relevant loss models as well as selection criteria for radial inflow turbines is addressed. Real and theoretical test cases were trialled and results showed good agreement when compared to published designs as well as other (available) codes. The presented approach was found to be valid and the model was found to be a useful tool with regards to the preliminary design and performance estimation of radial inflow turbines. The model was then upgraded through the implementation of different input parameter options and real-gas formulation based on an established and validated thermodynamic and transport properties database model: NIST REFPROP (Lemmon et al., 2007). This facilitated its integration with a thermodynamic power cycle analysis code. The integration involved the creation of a MySQL database capable of accommodating and sorting large amounts of data and resulted {{in the creation of a}} model-based radial inflow turbine database for a range of ORC cycle conditions that employed a variety of working fluids. This provides a more consistent approach with regards to the estimation of the overall performance of ORCs, because conventional methods typically assume a predefined value for the efficiency of the turbomachinery used in the cycle (e. g., Marcuccilli & Thiolet, 2010). This database permitted the establishment of several model-based correlations with regards to the use of these turbines and cycles by determining relations between cycle performance (specific energy production, B from a hot resource) and typical operating point constraints, such as the resource fluid temperature and high-side pressure. The coupled cycle – radial inflow turbine calculations were performed for a set of eight fluids: R 125, R 143 a, RC 318, R 236 ea, R 152 a, R 134 a, R 227 ea and R 245 fa, across a resource fluid temperature range of 100. 0 C to 250. 0 C. R 152 a was found to yield the highest number of feasible radial inflow turbine designs and presented a decreased dependency between power output and turbine feasibility for the considered conditions. In general terms, R 143 a was found to produce the best cycle performance (B) for most resource fluid temperatures up to 210. 0 C. Results from the coupled model highlight that the overall performance (B) and power output of the cycle are strongly dependent on both the efficiency and feasibility of the turbine. These were also found to have a profound impact on the operational ranges of the entire system and cannot be disregarded for optimum system design. The CFD-based approach to performance estimation of radial inflow turbines is also investigated in this thesis. It comprised the use of different commercial codes: Fluent, CFX from ANSYS Inc. (2009); and Eilmer 3, an in-house compressible-flow code (Jacobs et al., 2010 a). This involved the selection of solvers, numerical schemes, solution initialisation, setup of boundary conditions and appropriate selection of turbulence models. The three-dimensional steady-state numerical simulations were performed considering radial inflow turbine geometries from published literature and allowed to establish a set of standard test cases for code development. The results were found to provide a fair agreement between the commercial codes by comparing loading and velocity data. Eilmer 3 was adapted for turbomachinery calculations by the addition of terms for the rotating frame of reference, programmable boundary conditions for periodic boundaries and a mixing plane interface between the rotating and non-rotating blocks. Its suitability for this type of calculations was addressed and results were found to provide a fair agreement with other codes when assuming inviscid flow. Finally, a set of CFD mesh blocking-schemes based on the relative dimensions of these machines was defined in the course of this thesis. This is applicable to high stator vane angle designs as well as to most radial inflow turbine rotor geometries. Also, it may be used or integrated to produce high-quality CFD meshes, suitable for the simulation of this type of machines. This becomes particularly useful for applications which require an automated CFD mesh generator, the target application here being the CFD-based optimisation of radial inflow turbine blades...|$|R

This book is structured in four main chapters dealing with theory and profession, function and impact, practice, and design techniques of architectural drawings between 1500 and 1650 in the German countries. While the first three chapters are concerned with the theory, design techniques, historic, and social context of the drawings, the fourth chapter presents case studies reflecting their function, use, and impact.
