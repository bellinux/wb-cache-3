500|$|A 20th-century {{modification}} of the compartment boat system was used to feed the coal-fired Ferrybridge [...] "C" [...] power station. Starting in 1967, Cawoods Hargreaves used trains of three tubs or coal pans, which were <b>rigidly</b> <b>connected,</b> and pushed by a tug when loaded. The trains were filled with coal using canalside chutes at the colliery and pushed to the power station, where a hoist lifted each pan from the canal and upturned it to drop its contents onto a conveyor belt. Nine tugs and 35 pans were employed, with each pan holding around 170 tonnes. By the time the final load left Astley colliery in December 2002, 43 million tonnes had been delivered to Ferrybridge in this way. Experiments were made with trains of four pans, which allowed copper pipes to be carried {{on top of the}} coal for delivery to Goole, but this was short-lived. Coal carrying came to an abrupt halt in 2003 when the St Aidan's opencast mine was exhausted and the coal from Kellingley colliery was found to have levels of sulphur content high above the acceptable limit. During 2008, three of the trains were used on the River Don, to transport 250,000 tonnes of limestone from a quarry at Cadeby to Hexthorpe.|$|E

The final form of the design is a low-melting-point metal pellet coupler, made from Cerrobend, in parallel with a Negator spring pack. In its solid state, the metal <b>rigidly</b> <b>connects</b> the driver (the actuator) and the driven part (the mechanism). When commanded, a strip heater wrapped around the coupler melts the metal pellet (at 60 (deg) C), allowing the driven part to turn independent of the driver.

When the metal hardens the coupler once again <b>rigidly</b> <b>connects</b> the actuator and the mechanism. The concept presented here can easily be applied to other applications. Anywhere release devices are needed, low-melting-point couplers can be considered.

However, when these issues are overcome, the resulting release mechanism can promise to be the most light, simple, power conserving alternative available...|$|R

This property <b>rigidly</b> <b>connects</b> the phase variation of the field in this mode with the azimuthal angle between the coupling locations.

50|$|Although some {{continuous}} truss bridges resemble cantilever {{bridges and}} may be constructed using cantilever techniques, there are important {{differences between the two}} forms.

However, continuous truss bridges do not experience the tipping forces that a cantilever bridge must resist, because the main span of a continuous truss bridge is supported at both ends.|$|R

40|$|In {{areas of}} high traffic, long term bridge {{construction}} can have significant {{impacts on the}} traveling public and surrounding communities. To minimize this impact, engineers and contractors prefabricate bridge elements and utilize technologies that facilitate rapid bridge assembly. This strategy is known as Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) and has gained {{the attention of the}} bridge community as information and the benefits of ABC projects has been shared. There is untapped potential in this movement as some advantages of certain bridge types, like the integral abutment bridge, have seen limited use. Integral abutment bridges were developed as a means of eliminating the expansion joint from the bridge superstructure which present long term maintenance concerns. To eliminate the joint, integral abutments <b>rigidly</b> <b>connect</b> the superstructure and foundation so that the entire structure experiences thermal expansion and contraction as one. For this reason, the integral abutment is often large and heavily reinforced which present challenges for use in ABC projects. The size of the abutment presents weight issues and mechanical splicing of the abutment to the deep foundation presents tight construction tolerances. This research investigated integral abutment details for use in ABC projects through mechanical splicing of the integral diaphragm and the pile cap. To complete this task, two ABC details were evaluated in the laboratory based on constructability, strength and durability. The construction process used to fabricate and erect the specimen was documented and is presented in this report, as this criteria often governs the design of ABC details. The specimen were tested for strength and durability by simulating thermal loads and live loads. Strain gages placed on the concrete and reinforcing steel captured the strain developed in the testing to evaluate strength. Displacement transducers placed across the precast joint measured the crack width that developed under loading in order to assess durability. The ABC details investigated are the grouted rebar coupler detail and the pile coupler detail. In order to establish baseline performances for an integral abutment, a typical cast-in-place detail was also constructed and tested. In the grouted rebar coupler detail, a plywood template was used to “match cast” the pile cap and the integral diaphragm. The template marked the locations of the spliced reinforcing steel and served as the base for the formwork in the integral diaphragm, holding the grouted couplers in position. The template proved to be simple to construct and resulted in the successful alignment of seventeen spliced steel bars and grouted couplers over the length of an eight foot specimen. A grout bed was pumped into the precast joint on the specimen, unfortunately grout leaked past two of the grouted coupler seals and obstructed the grouting of two couplers. Even with the two un-grouted rebar couplers, there was more than adequate strength created by the connection and the crack width that developed at the precast joint was comparable to that of the cast-in-place specimen. The pile coupler detail was developed to facilitate the use of a slide in bridge with integral abutments. The pile coupler reduced the number of spliced connections between the pile cap and integral diaphragm significantly in order to facilitate adequate construction tolerances. The splicing system worked well during construction; however the detail’s performance in terms of strength and durability was less than ideal. If there is a demand for the benefits of the pile coupler detail in terms of constructability, the detail should be further investigated as several lessons were learned from the testing which could improve the structural performance of the detail...|$|R
40|$|Seed depth {{consistency}} is {{a critical}} performance metric of agricultural seeding equipment. To improve productivity, equipment manufacturers have historically focused on increasing the equipment working width of hoe-opener style seeding drills (hoe drills). However, the physical limitations of hoe drill size do present a design challenge. Increasing seeding speed to improve equipment productivity {{continues to be a}} challenge for equipment designers. Most operating conditions restrict hoe-drill seeding speeds to approximately 2. 2 m/s (5 mph); depth consistency generally degrades above this speed with current hoe drill technology. This research focused on developing an understanding of why this performance degradation occurs as speed increases. The general industry hypothesis points vaguely to "excessive motion" of the components to which the soil-engaging tools connect (the row units). However, little research on the dynamics of towed agricultural implements was found in the open literature. An understanding of the mechanism(s) causing this "excessive motion" was sought during this research. A 2 -D simulation tool was developed in MATLAB to provide equipment designers with the capability to conduct performance trade-off and sensitivity studies early in the prototype stage of a project. The simulation tool was compartmentalized so that changes to equipment geometry, component-soil contact models, or hydraulic systems could be modified with little or no change {{to other parts of the}} program. Operational data were also collected using a small plot drill based on a New Holland P 2070 Precision Hoe Drill. Data were collected at multiple operating speed up to 4. 4 m/s (10 mph) to characterize depth consistency issues present at higher speeds. Various geometric seed depth and hydraulic pressure settings were also tested. Kinematic parameters (acceleration, position), force, hydraulic pressure, and video of the instrumented row unit were recorded during steady-state the operation of the machine in typical seeding conditions. Measured data aided in calibrating aspects of the simulation tool, and the tool enabled certain performance features in the measurement data to be explored further. Frequency domain acceleration power spectra revealed that row unit acceleration power was generally concentrated at two frequencies. The terrain profile of the test field contained furrows from the previous seeding operation; this resulted in acceleration power to be concentrated at a distinct speed-dependent frequency related to the furrow spacing. While somewhat expected, this indicated the general inability of the current design to attenuate terrain inputs. The small packer wheel provided little compliance between the row unit and soil, so improving the attenuation performance of the system could improve depth consistency performance in future designs. The second major acceleration spectra feature was related to the arrangement of the hoe opener and trailing packer wheel; both <b>rigidly</b> <b>connect</b> to the row unit body. The row unit position changed when the packer wheel encountered a terrain bump or dip; this resulted in a change in the vertical position of the hoe opener located in front of the packer wheel. Immediate changes in the operating depth of the hoe opener tool resulted. Also, depth changes generally modified the terrain such that a new bump or dip was created in the soil surface preceding the packer wheel, thus creating a feedback path between the hoe opener and packer wheel. Considering the simplifications of the 2 -D model, agreement between simulated and measured data was encouraging. The frequencies of the above phenomena were in reasonable agreement throughout the speed range of interest. Power spectra amplitude differences were likely due to both input terrain differences between simulation and test terrains, and simplifications made in representing soil-tire and soil-tool contact. Future work to improve these sub-models, and to further explore the observed non-linear effect of hydraulic pressure changes would improve the predictive accuracy of the model presented...|$|R
