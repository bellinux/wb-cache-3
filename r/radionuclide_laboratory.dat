40|$|Traditional {{radioxenon}} measurements {{have been}} done by ground-based fixed systems, however in recent {{years there has been}} an increased need for systems capable of quick deployment or even complete mobility. Using the Pixie- 4 data acquisition (DAQ) system can help reduce the electronics footprint of both current systems, like the radioxenon <b>Radionuclide</b> <b>Laboratory</b> 16 (RL- 16) and the Swedish Automatic Unit for Noble Gas Acquisition (SAUNA), as well as future systems. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed a Linux based Nyx graphical user interface (GUI) for Pixie- 4 cards. The Nyx software can be installed on various Linux platforms and is written in C++. This software offers a rich user interface for configuring and operating the Pixie 4 card and PNNL designed high voltage (HV) cards. Nyx allows one to quickly get a nuclear detector operational by maintaining the core diagnostic features built into the Pixie- 4 cards. First, Nyx maintains the multitude of adjustable parameters accessible in the Pixie- 4 cards, which allows one to customize settings {{to take full advantage of}} a particular detector. Nyx also maintains an oscilloscope feature which is extremely useful to optimize settings and to verify proper detector behavior and is often the first feature used in Nyx during detector setup. Finally, Nyx allows the user to collect data in several formats including full pulse shapes to basic histograms. Overall, it is the corner stone for the transition of beta-gamma systems to a state-of-the-art digitizing DAQ system...|$|E

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess factors affecting interobserver agreement in interpretation of planar thallium- 201 stress imaging in the Multicenter Study on Silent Myocardial Ischemia (MSSMI). Background. Five hundred fifty-six planar thallium- 201 images were interpreted in 24 clinical centers and in a <b>Radionuclide</b> Core <b>Laboratory.</b> The trial's Coordinating and Data Center observed that the participating clinical centers interpreted a significantly greater number of thallium- 201 stress studies as abnormal (i. e., myocardial ischemia or scar) than the Core Laboratory, and overall agreement was poor (kappa 0. 27). Methods. Agreement in image interpretation between clinical centers and the <b>Radionuclide</b> Core <b>Laboratory</b> was analyzed by kappa statistics. The reproducibility of the Core Laboratory results on 41 randomly selected test studies was excellent (kappa 0. 77). In contrast, the reproducibility of interpretation in the clinical centers on their own studies was at best fair (kappa 0. 45). It was hypothesized that the poor agreement and reproducibility in the clinical centers were caused by lack of standardization of image display and lack of objective criteria for image interpretation. To test the effect of standardization, 13 clinical investigators interpreted the same 41 test studies using 1) uniform image display, and 2) uniform quantification of images. Results. The agreement in interpretation between clinical investigators and the <b>Radionuclide</b> Core <b>Laboratory</b> improved modestly with uniformity of image display (kappa 0. 57) but improved markedly (kappa 0. 66) with quantitative circumferential profile analysis. Conclusions. Lack of standardization in image display and lack of objective criteria for interpretation of thallium- 201 images are responsible for suboptimal reproducibility and poor interlaboratory agreement in the interpretation of thallium- 201 stress imaging.

40|$|The Dutch {{government}} has laid down new limits in the Radiation protection decree (Besluit stralingsbescherming), above which <b>radionuclide</b> <b>laboratories</b> need prior authorization for emitting and discharging radioactive substances. These new limits {{were needed to}} implement the modified system for application of the individual radionuclide approach of the Euratom-directive 96 / 29 to Dutch legislation. The findings reported here give us {{a clear understanding of}} the dose received by members of the public from emissions into air and water which are equal to the new limits. The report also goes into the differences between the new and the old situations. For most of the radionuclides examined, the new limits turn out to be higher than the old limits. The increase in the limits is lowest for long-lived or alpha-radiation-emitting radionuclides, and may even represent a decrease. This is especially the result of taking into account the dose-coefficient, which is usually higher for the alpha-emitters examined than for the other radionuclides. Higher emissions are allowed in the new situation for short-lived radionuclides with a low dose-coefficient because of their low contribution to dose. As a consequence of conservative assumptions in the calculation of the dose, it is expected that, in practice, the respective doses associated with the new limits of 1 and 10 radiotoxicity equivalents for emissions into air and water will exceed the dose criterion of 0, 1 microsievert per year in only a few cases...|$|R

The LMRV consists of 48 individual gamma spectrometers (Food Monitoring System, or FMS) that require little maintenance, are hosted at food processing companies and institutes throughout the Netherlands, and are operated by local personnel. From 2010 to 2013, approximately 900 samples of milk and 500 samples of other food categories were analysed on the FMSs annually, and another 1400 in the specialized <b>radionuclide</b> <b>laboratories</b> operated by RIKILT. The anthropogenic radionuclide cesium- 137 (137 Cs) was detected in 93 out of 11, 143 samples (0. 8 %), mostly in wild mushrooms, game and honey. Two samples of wild boar exceeded the limit of 600 Bq/kg. In case of a nuclear accident the FMSs are used to validate the radioactive deposition calculated by dispersion models by measuring radionuclides in grass samples. No deposition of artificial radionuclides was measured in the Netherlands after the Fukushima nuclear incident. The precision of the FMSs is within the pre-set tolerance limits of 80 - 120 % for 137 Cs, cobalt- 60 (60 Co) and iodine- 131 (131 I). For potassium- 40 (40 K) a systematic error of + 10 % was observed. The recalibration of the FMSs in 2012 resulted in a reduction of almost 40 % in the variation of the precision for 131 I (compared to 2010 and 2011).

Smith, RadiologyThe use {{of tissue}} {{specific}} radiopharmaceuticals presents great promise for diagnostic and therapeutic applications {{in a number}} of human cancers. Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors are known to be over-expressed on a variety of malignancies including breast, gastric, colon, pancreatic, prostate, and small-cell lung cancers. Experimental work with bombesin (BBN), an amphibian analogue to mammalian GRP, has demonstrated the ability of BBN to bind, with high affinity and specificity, to the GRP receptor. The use of a bifunctional chelating agent (BFCA) allows biologically active molecules to maintain receptor affinity {{while at the same time}} complexing a radionuclide. Spacer groups separating the BFCA and biological vector allow for fine tuning of the pharmacokinetics. Bombesin conjugates effectively complexing radioactive copper (i. e. Cu- 64; t 1 / 2 = 12. 7 h, EÎ³= 1345. 8 keV, EÎ²-= 578 keV, EÎ²+= 651 keV) posses potential as imaging agents for diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET) and therapeutic applications. Recently our research group has focused efforts on developing new BBN derivatives of Triaza (1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane) or functionalized derivatives of Triaza for complexing of specific <b>radionuclides.</b> Our <b>laboratory</b> has previously reported on a series of new Triaza-BBN conjugates. A derivative of this Triaza ligand system, 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane- 1, 4, 7 -triacetic acid (NOTA), has been synthesized by alkylation of the secondary amines of triaza by Î±-chloroacetic acid prior to conjugation to the biologically active BBN targeting vector. Bombesin conjugates were derived of the form, NOTA-X-BBN (X = ÃAla, GGG, SSS). Synthesis of the unligated BBN [7 - 14] peptide with spacer group was conducted by Fmoc-protected solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The bombesin constructs were purified prior to conjugation of the ligand framework by means of reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The NOTA ligand was conjugated to the N-terminus of the peptide by means of an activated ester derived from N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide and 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide HCl in aqueous solution. The final NOTA-X-BBN derivatives were purified by RP-HPLC and confirmed via electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).

Numerous published and new results are used from comparable experimental systems and conditions. The results originate from investigations on two humic rich Gorleben groundwater/sediment systems under near-natural conditions. The conditioning time between groundwater and radionuclides vary from {{few minutes to}} four years. The migration time (residence time in the column) is varied from four hours to three days. The concentration of radionuclides added is varied between about 10 (- 12) and 10 (- 4) mol/L. Humic colloids in natural groundwater contain trace metal ions in varying concentrations. In addition to studying the behavior of radionuclides added to the groundwater in the laboratory, the dissociation behavior of these natural tetravalent trace metal ions is studied by scavenging dissociating ions with a cation exchanger. The results show a kinetic behavior of the trace metal ion interaction as frequently reported in the literature, i. e. with increasing contact time, slow dissociation modes are progressively populated resulting in an enhanced radionuclide transport. The strong dependency of the radionuclide transport on the radionuclide concentration shows that humic colloid mediated transport may be overestimated if radionuclide concentrations used in laboratory studies are too high. Dissociation of the natural inventory of humic associated tetravalent trace metal ions proceeds with a kinetics comparable to the radionuclides added. This, however, is only observed for {{a small portion of}} the inventory and extrapolation beyond the observation range is not permissible.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the number of tests done in nuclear medicine laboratories and the higher levels of administered activity of the newer, short-lived <b>radionuclides</b> handled by <b>laboratory</b> technicians raise the question of whether safety limits of radiation exposure are being reached or exceeded. Attention has been directed primarily to the internal radiation dose to the patient (1). Possible radiation affects to individuals handling 99 mTc tend to be ignored. When aamTc was first used in this laboratory, a few simple calculations of radiation exposure suggested that some attention should be directed to this factor. PLAN The investigation was planned along multiple lines; namely, (1) to calculate whole-body and local hand radiation exposure, (2) to make concurrent measure ments of whole-body exposure using a standard, commercial film badge service (Nuclear-Chicago Corp.) and of the hand exposure by ring film badges (Nuclear-Chicago Corp.) for a protracted period (10 weeks), and (3) to measure fractional hand exposure with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) * (2 Ã¢â¬â 6) in a single acute exposure. CALCULATIONS To calculate the absorbed radiation dose to the hand, several assumptions had to be made concern ing distance from source to tissue, duration of ex posure and activity of 99 mTc used. The values selected were considered to be reasonably repre sentative of ordinary laboratory conditions. Others investigating the problem might use other values more representative of their own situation. The assumptions used are: (1) the distance from hand to isotope in the syringe is 1 cm; (2) the distance from whole body to radionuclide in the syringe is 60 cm; (3) the exposure time is 5 mm; and (4) the amount of a 9 mTc used is 10 mCi, a nominal amount for a brain scan in some laboratories. The specific gamma constant for 9 amTc is quoted by Wagner (7) as 0. 56 R/mCi-hr at 1 cm. C Harshaw Chemical Company #TLD- 100; extruded lithium fluoride, 0. 25 X 0. 25 X 0. 35 in.; about 80 mg each.

40|$|The {{regulatory}} control of nuclear materials (nuclear safeguards) {{is a prerequisite}} for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Finland. In order to uphold the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation â mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) â this {{regulatory control}} is exercised by the Nuclear Materials Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). The results of STUK'âs nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2014 continued to demonstrate that the Finnish licence holders take good care of their nuclear materials. There were no indications of undeclared nuclear materials or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the licence holdersâ declarations. Safeguards are applied to nuclear materials and activities that can lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These safeguards include nuclear materials accountancy, control, security and the reporting of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities. The main parties involved in a state nuclear safeguards system are the facilities that use nuclear materials â often referred to as âlicence holdersâ or âoperatorsâ â and the state authority. A licence holder shall take good care of its nuclear materials and the state authority shall provide the regulatory control to ensure that the licence holder fulfils the requirements. The control of nuclear expert organisations, technology holders and suppliers, to ensure the nonproliferation of sensitive technology, is also a growing global challenge for all stakeholders. In Finnish legislation, all these stakeholders are dealt with as users of nuclear energy. At then end of 2013, the new STUK regulations â called YVL Guides â entered into force. All the stakeholders were requested to prepare their safeguards manuals as a part of their quality managements systems. The approval process will continue in 2015. Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared nuclear materials (uranium, plutonium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor nuclear material holders in Finland. Nuclear dual-use items and instrumentation for the third reactor under construction at the Olkiluoto site are being imported and installed. The import licences are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their site visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. The planning and design of the fourth reactor at the Olkiluoto power plant and at a new nuclear power plant site Hanhikivi in PyhÃ¤joki were authorised in 2010. The safeguards systems for these new reactors will be designed together with facility design and development. Similarly to the Olkiluoto 3 reactor that is under construction, the import licences for the new facilities are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology and sensitive information. The operators have submitted the preliminary Basic Technical Characteristics to the European Commission and obtained Material Balance Area codes for the future reactors before the vendor companies were selected. In December 2013, Fennovoima announced that the Hanhikivi reactor will be supplied by Rusatom Overseas. This was not included as an option in the application of 2009, and thus the re-evaluation of the conditions for the previous authorisation was carried out in 2014, resulting in new Decision-in-Principle endorsed by the Parliament in December 2014. In parallel with this, the TVO application to extend the time line for the fourth unit was denied by the Government. Owing to these decisions, the construction licence applications are expected in 2015. Uranium production as one of the by-products of nickel at the Talvivaara mine was given approval from the Government in accordance with the nuclear energy legislation in March 2012. In 2013, the company constructed the uranium extraction plant, but the Supreme Administrative Court rescinded the approval, owing to claims of environmental and economical issues in December 2013 before the commissioning of the plant. The difficulties continued in 2014; and, finally in November 2014 the Talvivaara Sotkamo Ltd. filed for bankruptcy. Currently, uranium residuals are extracted from the nickel at Harjavalta Nickel Refinery and at Freeport Cobalt in Kokkola, and reported to STUK. STUK maintains a central national nuclear materials accountancy system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union legislation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to guarantee that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities and materials. In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level integrated safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2014. By means of their nuclear materials accountancy and control systems, all licence holders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2014, the number in inspection days was significantly higher owing to the extensive survey campaign carried out at Onkalo, the planned geological repository. In total, 65 working days were required for the one-week long scanning of the tunnels. The application for the construction licence for the disposal facility, which consists of the encapsulation plant and the geological repository, was submitted to the government in December 2012. The licensing of the facility {{was one of the main}} topics over the year as a whole at STUK. During 2013 and 2014, the IAEA and the Commission defined the requirements for the safeguards equipment for the encapsulation plant in an interactive process with STUK and Posiva. This document will be included in the STUK statement to be finalised in 2015. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is one of the elements of the global nuclear non-proliferation effort. STUK has two roles in relation to the CTBT: STUK operates the Finnish National Data Centre (FiNDC) and one of the <b>radionuclide</b> <b>laboratories</b> (RL 07) in the CTBT International Monitoring Network (IMS). The main task of the FiNDC is to inspect data received from the International Monitoring System and to inform the national authority, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, about any indications of a nuclear weapons test. The FiNDC falls under the non-proliferation process in STUKâs organisation, together with the regulatory control of nuclear materials. A major goal of all current CTBT-related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties that it is impossible to make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task. The human resources development at the Nuclear Materials Section during 2014 was focused on nuclear material control: in particular, information security issues were addressed. This was partly due to the need to regulate the construction of the final disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto repository site. In addition, STUK contributed to educational workshops and training courses for authorities who represent nuclear newcomers: countries that aim at uranium production or nuclear power in cooperation with the IAEA. STUK and Finnish Customs continued the joint multi-year border monitoring development project. The project covers customs officers training as well as the updating of technical equipment and of operational procedures. In 2014, the partnerships programme between King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K. A. CARE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and STUK began supporting Saudi Arabiaâs nuclear energy programme. In the field of safeguards and nuclear security, STUKâs safeguards and security experts initiated practical cooperation with their colleagues at K. A. CARE...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary The {{regulatory}} control of nuclear materials (nuclear safeguards) {{is a prerequisite}} for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Finland. In order to maintain the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation â mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) â this {{regulatory control}} is implemented by the Nuclear Materials Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). The results of STUK's nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2015 continued to demonstrate that the Finnish licence holders take good care of their nuclear materials. There were no indications of undeclared nuclear materials or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the stakeholders' declarations. Safeguards are applied to nuclear materials and activities that can lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These safeguards include nuclear materials accountancy, control, security and the reporting of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities. The main parties involved in a state nuclear safeguards system are the facilities that use nuclear materials, often referred to as âlicence holdersâ or âoperatorsââ and the state authority. A licence holder shall take good care of its nuclear materials and the state authority shall provide the regulatory control to ensure that the licence holder fulfils the requirements. The control of nuclear expert organisations, technology holders and suppliers, to ensure the non-proliferation of sensitive technology, is also a growing global challenge for all stakeholders. In Finnish legislation, all these stakeholders are dealt with as users of nuclear energy. At the end of 2013, the revised STUK requirements were published as regulatory guides on nuclear safety, security and safeguards, called YVL guides. According to the Guide YVL D. 1 Regulatory Control of Nuclear Safeguards all the stakeholders were requested to prepare their safeguards manuals as a part of their quality managements systems. During 2015, in total 19 draft manuals were submitted to STUK, and 14 of those were approved. Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared nuclear materials (uranium, plutonium and thorium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor nuclear material holders in Finland. Nuclear dual-use items and instrumentation for the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction are being imported and installed. The import licences are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their site visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. The planning and design of the Olkiluoto 4 reactor and a new nuclear power plant site, Hanhikivi in PyhÃ¤joki, were authorised in 2010. The safeguards systems for these new reactors shall be designed together with facility design and development. Similarly to the Olkiluoto 3 reactor that is under construction, the import licences for the new facilities are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology and sensitive information. The operators submitted the preliminary Basic Technical Characteristics to the European Commission and obtained Material Balance Area codes for the future reactors before the vendor companies were selected. During 2015, the construction licence application for the new Hanhikivi plant was submitted to the Government. The authorisation of the Olkiluoto 4 unit expired as the operator did not apply for the construction licence within the 5 year period of validity of the authorisation, i. e. the Decision-in-Principle by the Government, so the material balance area code was also withdrawn. The research reactor was shut down in 2015 and the preparations for decommissioning continue in Espoo. On the other hand, in order to continue research activities, the new VTT Centre for Nuclear Safety was under construction at the research campus in Espoo. Uranium production as one of the by-products of nickel at the Talvivaara mine was given approval by the Government in accordance with the nuclear energy legislation in March 2012. In 2013, the mining company constructed the uranium extraction plant, but the Supreme Administrative Court rescinded the approval, owing to claims of environmental and economic issues in December 2013 before the commissioning of the plant. The difficulties continued in 2014, and finally in November 2014 Talvivaara Sotkamo Ltd. filed for bankruptcy. During 2015 a new operator, Terrafame Mining Oy took over the mining and milling activities, but no uranium extraction nor safeguards activities took place at Talvivaara. Currently, uranium residuals are extracted from the nickel at Harjavalta Nickel Refinery and at Freeport Cobalt in Kokkola, and reported to STUK and to the European Commission. STUK maintains a national nuclear materials accountancy system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union Safeguards Regulation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to verify that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities and materials. In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The application for the construction licence for the disposal facility, which consists of the encapsulation plant and the geological repository, was submitted to the Government in December 2012. During 2013 and 2014, the IAEA and the Commission defined the requirements for the safeguards equipment for the encapsulation plant in an interactive process with STUK and Posiva. These needs were included in the STUK statement and safety evaluation concerning the construction licence application finalised in February 2015. In November 2015 the Government granted the construction licence. In the meanwhile, the detailed design of the facility was updated resulting in the continuation of the planning of the safeguards system. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2015. By means of their nuclear materials accountancy and control systems, the stakeholders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. In safeguards, STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2014, the number of inspection days was significantly higher owing to the extensive survey campaign to verify the design of the planned geological repository, called Onkalo. In 2015 a concise survey campaign was carried out at Onkalo resulting in an increased number of inspection days since 2013. The number of annual inspection days for nuclear material holders has remained at 20 days per international inspectorate.
