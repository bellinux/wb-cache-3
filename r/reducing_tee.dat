40|$|Experience {{in other}} {{industries}} {{has shown that}} revenue management can increase revenue without affecting customer satisfaction. Revenue management, however, is underutilized in the golf industry, as customers are believed to perceive such practices as unacceptable and unfair. This paper explores six revenue management practices that might be suitable in a golf context and examines their perceived fairness. The results show that golfers perceive arrival duration control practices {{in the form of}} reservation fees or no-show fees as fair. In addition, it was found that golfers perceive demand-based pricing in the form of coupons (two for the price of one), time-of-day and <b>reduced</b> <b>tee</b> time intervals as fair. Conversely, time-of-booking pricing was perceived as neutral to slightly unfair. Varying price levels were seen as unfair, with potential negative consumer reactions to this practice. Furthermore, the paper explores whether framing demand-based pricing as discounts rather than surcharges would make a difference. It was found that demand-based pricing presented as discounts were generally seen as fairer and therefore less likely to {{have a negative impact on}} consumer perceptions and reactions...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:To assess left {{ventricular}} dimensions and cardiac output during thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Material and methods:Nine patients undergoing thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair using direct cross-clamping without shunt or by-pass were studied prospectively. Prior to, during cross-clamping (XC) and after declamping {{left ventricular}} cross-sectional areas were monitored with transesophageal echocardiography. A pulmonary artery catheter {{was used for}} measurements of cardiac output with the thermodilution technique. Results:Cardiac output increased 43 % from baseline during XC (p < 0. 01) and was still 55 % above baseline at declamping (p < 0. 05). Life ventricular end-systolic inner area was reduced 32 % during XC (p < 0. 01). Pulmonary artery pressures and central venous pressure increased during declamping (p < 0. 05). Heart rate increased 38 % from 66 beats/min to 92 beats/min (p < 0. 01) and was still 30 % elevated at declamping (p < 0. 01). Conclusion:During thoracic aortic XC, cardiac output is increased and left ventricular end-systolic dimension is <b>reduced.</b> <b>TEE</b> is a valuable supplement to pressure measurements {{for the evaluation of}} cardiac function during surgery of the thoracic aorta...|$|R
40|$|Background—Weight loss reduces energy expenditure, but the {{contribution}} of different macronutrients to this change is unclear. Hypothesis—We tested the hypothesis that macronutrient composition of the diet might affect the partitioning of energy expenditure during weight loss. Design—A sub-study of 99 participants from the POUNDS LOST trial had total energy expenditure (TEE) measured by doubly labeled water and resting energy expenditure (REE) measured by indirect calorimetry at baseline and repeated at 6 months in 89 participants. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} one of 4 diets with either 15 % or 25 % protein and 20 % or 40 % fat. Results—TEE and REE were positively correlated with each other and with fat free mass and body fat, at baseline and 6 months. The average weight loss of 8. 1 ± 0. 65 kg (LSmean±SE) <b>reduced</b> <b>TEE</b> by 120 ± 56 kcal/d and REE by 136 ± 18 kcal/d. A greater weight loss at 6 months was associated with a greater decrease in TEE and REE. Participants eating the high fat diet lost significantly more fat free mass (1. 52 ± 0. 55 kg) than the low fat diet group (p< 0. 05). Participants eating the low fat diet had significantly higher measures of physical activity than the high fat group. Conclusion—A greater weight loss was associated with a larger decrease in both TEE and REE. The low fat diet was associated with significant changes in fat free body mass and energy expenditure from physical activity compared to the high fat diet...|$|R
40|$|The {{menopause}} {{is accompanied}} by increased risk of obesity, altered body fat distribution and decreased skeletal muscle mass. The resulting decrease in RMR should {{be accompanied by a}} compensatory change in energy balance to avoid weight gain. We aimed to investigate habitual energy intake and expenditure in pre- and postmenopausal women matched for abdominal obesity. We recruited fifty-one healthy Caucasian women, BMI >  18 · 5 and < 35  kg/m(2), aged 35 - 45 years (premenopausal, n 26) and 55 - 65 years (postmenopausal, n 25). Energy intake was measured using 3 d diet diaries and dietary fat quality assessed using adipose tissue fatty acid biomarkers. RMR was measured using indirect calorimetry, and total energy expenditure (TEE) and activity energy expenditure using a combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor. Postmenopausal women had lower RMR and TEE and spent significantly less time undertaking moderate exercise than premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women had a tendency for a lower energy intake, and a similar macronutrient intake but a significantly lower adipose tissue n- 6 :n- 3 ratio (24 · 6 (se 1 · 6) v. 37 · 7 (se 3 · 1); P <  0 · 001). The main lifestyle determinant of bone mineral density (which was significantly lower in postmenopausal women) was TEE for premenopausal women, and dietary n- 6 :n- 3 ratio for postmenopausal women. The present results suggest that weight maintenance is achieved in the post- compared with premenopausal status through a combination of reduced energy intake and <b>reduced</b> <b>TEE</b> in a regimen that compromises micronutrient intake and has a negative impact on lean tissue mass. However, lower n- 6 :n- 3 fatty acid intake in postmenopausal women is associated with greater bone mineral density...|$|R
40|$|The acute {{dissection}} of the {{ascending aorta}} requires prompt and reliable diagnosis {{to reduce the}} high risk of mortality; in addition, prognosis is influenced by longterm complications. The aim {{of this article is}} to discuss transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and (1) its diagnostic accuracy in the presurgical evaluation of patients, (2) its role in reducing time of diagnosis and surgery, and (3) its ability to <b>reduce</b> hospital mortality. <b>TEE</b> has also been tested as a screening method in the postsurgical follow-up of these patients. The retrospective investigation concerns a sample of 80 cases of acute dissection of the aorta, submitted for surgical intervention from April 1986 to February 1999. TEE has allowed a precise estimation of aortic diameters and optimal visualization of intimal flap and tear entry with a fine distinction between true and false lumen. A direct comparison of the results of TEE and of transthoracic echocardiography has demonstrated that some elements (visualization of flap and diameters in descending aorta, sites of entry and reentry, direction of let trough intimal tears, phasic intimal flap movement, diastolic collapse of flap on the valvular plane, false lumen thrombosis, coronary involvement, intramural hematoma, and aortic fissuration) were identified only by TEE, whereas other additional diagnostic elements (cardiac tamponade, aortic valve insufficiency, left ventricular function) show a similar pattern of significance. Routine employment of this method has confirmed a reduction of hospitalization time (about 1. 5 hours of waiting time), and hospital mortality has changed from 42. 8 % to 17. 3 %. In the follow-up of patients operated on for aortic dissection, fundamental information may be obtained from TEE (assessment of the progression of thrombosis in the false lumen with its complete obliteration and modifications in aortic diameter with a consequent, possible worsening of aortic valve insufficiency). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TEE may provide fast and efficient detection of acute aortic dissection. In the postsurgical follow-up, TEE has confirmed detection of major complications that can influence long-term prognosis and may be proposed as a method with easy access-one that is repeatable and inexpensive for the screening of aortic dissection surgical patients.

40|$|Les réservoirs volgiens ont pour but de retenir les eaux de fonte de printemps pour les redistribuer {{dans le cadre de}} l'année hydrologique (avril-mars). Cette {{fonction}} implique des variations de niveau des lacs de retenue et ceci est à l'origine de conséquences négatives. Le remplissage de printemps peut être une menace hydrologique sérieuse pour l'agriculture. Le déstockage qui suit est mené en saison de navigation (il intéresse donc tous les secteurs impliqués dans l'aménagement) ou en hiver (il n'intéresse plus que l'hydroélectricité). D'après les règles établies, le déstockage devrait être mené selon un rythme précis et devrait être régulier d'une année sur l'autre pour ne pas porter préjudice à la pèche dans les réservoirs et pour ne pas entretenir l'érosion sur les rives. Depuis vingt ans, la pèche attribue toutefois ses mauvais résultats au non-respect des règles. D'autres ministères se plaignent du même fait. Les règles sont-elles respectées? Seule l'étude des niveaux réels des réservoirs {{permet de}} répondre à cette question. Elle fait apparattre depuis vingt ans des remplissages de printemps anarchiques, d'importantes et imprévisibles variations de niveau en saison de navigation, des déstoclcages massifs d'hiver. Cette pratique est partiellement responsable du développement en URSS d'un puissant mouvement de contestation écologique. Since 1962, the Volga River {{has become a}} series of cascades of eight reservoirs. Initially, the main object of the development was hydro-electricity but fishing, irrigation and transport became more and more important. Sine 1962, the function of Volgian reservoirs has been to retain spring water for its redistribution during the navigation season - for all the sectors involved in the management - and during the winter - only for hydro-electricity. This function implies lake level variations, which can generate negative environmental effects. According to Soviet economic principles, each Ministry manages its own equipment, which means that the Volga development is controlled from Moscow by different Ministries. The Ministry of Energy, controlling dams and turbines, has an enormous power. Hence, there are rules for defending the interests of the other economic sectors. The Ministry of Energy, allegedly, is concerned only about its own plans and does mot comply with the rules, which naturally it denies. These ruses have mot been published but their main lines are well-known as they are largely referred to in scientific publications concerning the Volga management problem. The only way to check is to compare the rules with the available hydrological data on lake levels. The most significant part of annual Volgian runoff proceeds from the spring melting of snow. This water must be used to fill the Volgian reservoirs and to satisfy the Lower-Volga artificial flood (110 km 3). Actual data about Kuybyshev dam water discharge shows that the lower-Volga water requirements are mot satisfied. The true data about Kuybyshev and Rybinsk lakes shows disorganized fillings : the reservoirs are filled up to different levels every year, which contributes to activate bank erosion and prevents the constitution of aquatic vegetation. Bank erosion supplies a lot of sediments which, certain years, obstruct access to storm shelters or, sometimes, to harbours (Dimitrovgrad, for example). The lack of aquatic vegetation reduces the possibilities of fish reproduction. By raising the level of groundwaters around the reservoirs, this spring filling jeopardizes agriculture, so it is mot allowed to full reservoirs over the maximum water level. Yet, the data shows that the Kuybyshev reservoir, {{right in the middle of}} the agricultural zone of the USSR, was filled more than 16 years out of 26. The drawdown must be carried out with moderation and according to a specific rhythm particularly before winter in order to force the fish to leave the shallows. During the winter it is better to avoid massive drawdowns. The study of winter levels reveals very deep drawdowms. In This case the lake surfaces <b>reduce</b> and the <b>tee</b> collapses down to the lake bottom causing very important prejudice to the aquatic fauna. According to the numerous scientific publications by Soviet fishing Institutes, the non-observation of the rules accounts for the poor production of fish. (500 - 600 kg a year per km 2 on Kuybyshev and Kybinsk lakes) and for the increase of bank erosion. The study of the lake levels shows that the Volgian water is used only in the interest of hydro-electricity and without any care for the other users (agriculture, fishing, navigation) or for the effects on the environment. The Energy lobby is so strong that 25 years of scientific protest bas not changed anything. Such inconsistent management bas played a great part in the determination of an environmental movement In the USSR. Over the last forty years significant areas of territory have been submerged under the large reservoirs (on the Volga alone more than 300, 000 people have been resettled on account of submersion) so the scientific protest met with the approval by a show of hostility to hydro-energy. Since the instauration of the « glasnost », the protest against the « hydro-lobby » has taken a symbolical value, a facet of the opposition to the « old order », and the poor management of Volga development largely contributed to this...|$|R
