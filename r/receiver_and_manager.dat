50|$|The {{common law}} has long {{recognised}} {{the concept of}} a receiver. Following the development of the floating charge creditors were effectively able to take security over a company's entire business by means of a floating charge over the undertaking. Security documents generally contained very wide powers of appointment such that on default the creditor could take over the business immediately and without the input of any court. A receiver appointed to the entire business became known as a <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>manager.</b> The <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>manager</b> would typically have extensive powers over the business, including the power to sell it at a time and on terms that suited the appointing creditor.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ability to}} appoint a <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>manager</b> was a very {{powerful}} remedy, but {{it came to be}} considered unsatisfactory that it was entirely a creature of the contract between the creditor and the borrower. There was no general ability {{on the part of the}} borrower or any other party to review the actions of the receiver (who would generally be acting on behalf of the borrower under the security document) or seek the supervision of the court. A general review of UK insolvency law in the 1980s began with the Cork Report and culminated in the Insolvency Act 1986. It put forward two major reforms. First, it put the <b>receiver</b> <b>and</b> <b>manager</b> on a statutory footing: a receiver appointed to all or substantially all of a company's property was now an administrative receiver and subject to some statutory responsibilities. Second, it introduced an [...] "administration order" [...] as an equivalent process to administrative receivership—but available to any company by court order independent of any particular security arrangement.|$|E
