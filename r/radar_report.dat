5000|$|On 19 June 1944, {{during the}} last major carrier air battle of the War in the Pacific, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the battleship, {{operating}} with Task Group 58.7, provided the first confirmed radar warning to Task Force 58 of the incoming Japanese attackers. The Japanese aircraft were initially detected by shipboard radars {{at a distance of}} about 190 mi, but that detection was thought to be a radar anomaly. Alabama formally reported its radar's detection of the attack at the distance of about 140 mi, and [...] confirmed this <b>radar</b> <b>report</b> soon afterwards. Beginning at 1046 hours, and continuing {{over the course of the}} next five hours, the Japanese carried out repeated air strikes against the Fast Carrier Task Force commanded by Vice Admiral Mitscher. These totaled seven attacking groups in all on that day. Three of these Japanese attacks were aimed at Task Group 58.7, and two of them caused Alabama to open up with anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this ‘radar report’ is to give an {{overview}} {{of the state of the}} art concerning indicators of energy innovation systems and their dynamics. As part of this, it is the aim to discuss current challenges and efforts made by researchers and other professionals working in the field. Through this, the <b>radar</b> <b>report</b> shall contribute to the discussion of how the field might develop in the future; both for the sake of understanding the dynamics of energy innovation systems in general and, more specifically, for the sake of understanding the role energy innovation systems play for moving towards more climate-friendly and sustainable energy systems. The analysis behind the <b>radar</b> <b>report</b> builds on a search and review of research literature, databases, statistics schemes, etc., on indicators of energy innovation systems as such and on relevant connected issues. In addition, it builds on assessment and insights from experienced researchers in the field. It is the intention with the report to communicate knowledge from researchers to other interested parties; not only to other researchers, but also to stakeholders more broadly, e. g. interest organisations, policy makers, statisticians, etc. However, a one-way communication picture is not entirely correct. Not only do researchers in many cases build on nationally or internationally recognized indicator schemes and databases established by governmental bodies, statistics agencies or international organizations like the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and the IEA (International Energy Agency). Researchers are also in a number of cases involved in establishment and development of official indicator schemes for example by acting as advisors or carrying out background studies. The interaction between research and practitioners is complex, and it makes little sense to address scientific research activities only, without taking into consideration the broader picture of indicator schemes. What we researchers most obviously can contribute with compared to other professional bodies in the field, is an explicit theoretical analysis perspective, in this case based on innovation system theory. Through this we can hopefully point out issues and raise questions that would otherwise not have been addressed...|$|E

40|$|Maneuver {{tracking}} {{is complicated}} because radar cannot directly measure target acceleration. Radar measures a target’s range and bearing, and its radial velocity {{with respect to}} radar position. Tracking algorithms use radial velocity to associate <b>radar</b> <b>reports</b> to tracks, but not to update track state estimates. In this paper, a new statistic of centripetal acceleration based on the radial velocity measurement is developed.

50|$|In British service a radar troop {{normally}} comprised a radar command post, three radars, three listening posts (LPs) and a reconnaissance party led by {{the troop}} sergeant major. Radars and LPs were normally commanded by sergeants. The task of the LPs was to report mortars firing and the area they were in. Radars were only switched on in response to reports of hostile mortar fire, and so thereby avoiding continuous transmission in order to minimise the risk of detection. <b>Radars</b> <b>reported</b> the hostile mortar locations to the radar command post, from where they were reported to the Brigade Artillery Intelligence Officer and regimental headquarters for rapid counter-fire.|$|R
