40|$|Frequently, the {{dynamics}} of a compressor’s mechanism can be simplified and better understood by analyzing compressor’s equivalent linkage. Although the equivalent linkage of a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> is well known, the equivalent linkages {{of other types of}} compressors are not. For example, it is not well understood that the equivalent linkage of a rolling piston compressor is also the same slider-crank mechanism as the one of a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor.</b> The difference between <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> and the rolling piston compressor is that it is the connecting rod that compresses gas in the cylindrical chamber. If the contact between the rolling piston and the vane is flat, the equivalent linkage is the Scotch-Yoke mechanism. The difference between the two equivalent linkages of the same type of compressor is in the type of contact between the vane and the rolling piston. The equivalent linkage of a rotary vane compressor is the rocker arm mechanism. The equivalent linkage of a scroll compressor has two degrees of freedom and it has Oldham Ring. The equivalent linkages of other types of compressor mechanisms can be readily found by using approach presented in the paper. Under usual assumption of constant angular velocity, the dynamic analysis of the equivalent linkage can be done in vector form. Thus, the vectors of velocities and accelerations may be projected into the direction of a chosen coordinates. Therefore, one will only need to know geometry of the linkage {{as a function of the}} angle of crank rotation. This approach enables to avoid cumbersome time derivatives...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas is an {{alternative}} fuel of choice in the market today due {{to the increase in}} the price of petroleum, as well as out of environmental concerns. Pressure requirement for a natural gas vehicle (NGV) storage tank is 3000 psig (206 bars). Thus, at NGV refueling facilities, the natural gas need to be stored at a higher pressure in order to refuel the NGV at the pressure required. Compressors are needed in the compression process at the refueling facilities. A new compressor design for natural gas refueling appliance has been developed which is the symmetrical multistage wobble-plate compressor. This compressor design is the newest variation of the axial <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor.</b> The success of the compressor design in compressing gas depends on the piston ring assembly design. Through this paper, the process of designing the piston ring assembly and considerations taken for this new compressor design were explained.

Real tests on natural gas are to be organised utilising all the experience and lesson learnt from that on air...|$|E
40|$|The multi-piston axial {{reciprocating}} compressor using the Sanderson-Rocker Arm Motion (S-RAM) mechanism {{is expected to}} have less leakage from the cylinder to the shell space due to the vertical motion of the piston assembly in the cylinder. The main frictional power loss is located at the ball-socket joints connecting the piston with the wobble plate of the S-RAM mechanism. The stroke of the compressor can be changed by altering the inclined angle between the connecting shaft and machine driving shaft, to change the delivered refrigerant mass flow rate to match the capacity requirement in industry. ^ A comprehensive simulation model for a prototype {{reciprocating compressor}} using the S-RAM mechanism has been developed. The natural refrigerant carbon dioxide (CO 2) is used as the working fluid. The comprehensive model is comprised of a kinematics model, compression process model, dynamics model and an overall energy balance model. In the kinematics model, the movement of the piston is given including its displacement, velocity and acceleration. It is found that the moving path of the center of the ball in the ball-socket joint is moving around a corresponding cylinder centerline with a ‘figure 8 ’ motion instead of moving along the cylinder centerline. In the compression process model, the system of governing equations is solved, which incorporates a valve sub-model and a leakage sub-model. The variable step size RKF 45 method and Broyden’s method are employed to solve the non-linear system of equations to find the in-cylinder refrigerant state (instantaneous temperature and pressure) at each rotational angle of the machine driving shaft. The variations of suction and discharge valve movements with respect to driving shaft rotational angle are also given. The values of the cylinder wall temperature, the actual suction and discharge temperatures in the connecting pipes are required to initiate the solving of the compression process model. These temperatures are solved simultaneously by incorporating the overall energy balance model with the compression process model. A lumped temperature assumption is employed in the overall energy balance model to assume there is no temperature gradient in each compressor component at steady-state. The dynamics model, which focuses on the frictional power loss, runs based on the in-cylinder refrigerant pressure determined in the solution of the compression process model. ^ The presented modeling methodology is validated by modeling a conventional <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> instead of the S-RAM compressor since there are no test data available for the prototype S-RAM compressor. The simulation model was updated to predict the performance of a conventional reciprocating compressor. Required modifications are made to account for the difference between these two compressors. The simulation results are validated using test data obtained from a hot-gas bypass test stand and the data from the published compressor map. ^ Using this validated methodology, the simulation results for the S-RAM compressor are given. Moreover, the effects of different parameters on the compressor performance are investigated in the parametric studies (such as the effect of the valve spring stiffness and the effect of stroke-to-bore ratio) so that proper parameters are chosen to optimize the compressor. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of expanders is of prime importance for various clean energy technologies. Once mechanical losses (e. g. through valves) are minimized, losses due to unsteady heat exchange between the working fluid and the solid {{walls of the}} containing device can become the dominant loss mechanism. In this device, gas spring devices are investigated numerically in order to focus explicitly on the thermodynamic losses that arise due to this unsteady heat transfer. The specific {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the behaviour of real gases in gas springs and compare this to that of ideal gases in order to attain a better understanding of the impact of real gas effects on the thermally losses in <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> expanders and <b>compressors.</b> A CFD-model of a gas spring is developed in OpenFOAM. Three different gas models are compared: an ideal gas model with constant thermodynamic and transport properties; an ideal gas model with temperature-dependent properties; and a real gas model using the Peng-Robinson equation of state with temperature and pressuredependent properties. Results indicate that, for simple, monoand diatomic gases like helium or nitrogen, there is a negligible difference in the pressure and temperature oscillations over a cycle between the ideal and real gas models. However, when looking at a heavier (organic) molecule such as propane, the ideal gas model tends to overestimate the temperature and pressure compared to the real gas model, especially if no temperature dependency of thermodynamic properties is taken into account. Additionally, the ideal gas model (both alternatives) underestimates the thermally induced loss compared to the real gas model for heavier gases. Real gas effects must be taken into account in order to predict accurately the thermally induced loss when using heavy molecules in such devices...|$|R

40|$|A liquid piston {{concept is}} {{proposed}} to improve the efficiency of gas compression and expansion. Because a liquid can conform to an irregular chamber volume, the surface {{area to volume ratio}} in the gas chamber can be maximized using a liquid piston. This creates near-isothermal operation, which minimizes energy lost to heat generation. A liquid piston eliminates gas leakage and replaces sliding seal friction with viscous friction. The liquid can also be used as a medium to carry heat {{into and out of the}} compression chamber. A simulation is presented of the heat transfer and frictional forces for a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> and a liquid piston. In the application of an air compressor, with a pressure ratio of 9. 5 : 1 and a cycle frequency of 20 Â Hz, the liquid piston decreased the energy consumption by 19 % over the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston.</b> The liquid <b>piston</b> and the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>piston</b> exhibited a total efficiency of 83 % and 70 % respectively.
