In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases.

40|$|Although {{the belief}} is widely {{held that a}} high protein diet is {{deleterious}} to the hypertensive patient, a careful survey of the literature discloses {{that this is not}} a generally substantiated point of view. Some clinicians (1 - 4) in particular Newburgh (5), have insisted that the withdrawal of protein from the diet of patients with hypertension results in the reduction of their blood pressure and the elimination of the concomitant symptoms. Others have maintained that the amount of protein in the diet generally has little or no relation to the blood pressure (6, 7). It has even been suggested that a continued low protein diet may be pathogenic (8, 9). The relationships between <b>renal</b> excretory <b>insufficiency</b> and diet have been studied experimentally by numerous investigators (10), but the recent development of a satisfactory method for the experimental production of persistent renal hypertension (11) has made possible studies on the relationship between the factors of diet, <b>renal</b> excretory <b>insufficiency</b> and hypertension of renal origin in animals (12, 13) ...|$|R
40|$|Persistent {{hypertension}} {{has been}} {{produced in the}} goat and sheep by constriction of the main renal arteries.

25|$|Celecoxib was {{the first}} {{specific}} inhibitor of COX-2 approved to treat patients with rheumatism and osteoarthritis. A study showed that the absorption rate, when given orally, is moderate, and peak plasma concentration occurs after about 2–4 hours. However, the extent of absorption is not well known. Celecoxib has the affinity to bind extensively to plasma proteins, especially to plasma albumin. It has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 455 +/- 166 L in humans and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases proportionally to increased oral doses, between 100 and 800mg. Celecoxib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 isoenzyme to carboxylic acid and also by non-CYP-dependent glucuronidation to glucuronide metabolites. The metabolites are excreted in urine and feces, with {{a small proportion of}} unchanged drug (2%) in the urine. Its elimination half-life is about 11 hours (6–12 hours) in healthy individuals, but racial differences in drug disposition and pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly have been reported. Patients with chronic <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> appear to have 43% lower plasma concentration compared to healthy individuals, with a 47% increase in apparent clearance, and it can be expected that patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment have increased steady-state AUC.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Japan was {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to approve a {{pharmacological}} treatment for ADPKD followed by Canada and Europe, which approved the drug tolvaptan for ADPKD patients in the beginning of 2015. Tolvaptan, an aquaretic drug, is a vasopressin receptor 2 (V2) antagonist. Pre-clinical studies had suggested that the molecule cAMP could be involved in the enlargement of ADPKD cysts, and studies on rodents confirmed the role of vasopressin in increasing the levels of cAMP in the kidney, which laid the basis for the conduction of clinical studies. Because data from the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) led by Mayo Clinic showed that total kidney volume (TKV) predicted the risk of developing <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in patients with ADPKD, the TEMPO 3:4 trial, which enrolled patients from 129 sites worldwide from 2007 to 2009, evaluated TKV as a primary end-point to test the efficacy of tolvaptan in ADPKD patients. That study showed a significant decrease in the ratio of TKV increase and deterring of renal function decline in ADPKD patients after treatment with tolvaptan; however, because laboratory test results regarding liver function appeared elevated in a percentage of patients enrolled in that study, the approval of the drug was either delayed by regulatory agencies or, as in case of the US, altogether denied.|$|E

25|$|Etoricoxib, that is {{used for}} {{patients}} with chronic arthropathies and musculoskeletal and dental pain, is absorbed moderately when given orally. A study on its pharmacokinetics showed that the plasma peak concentration of etoricoxib occurs after approximately 1 hour. It has shown to be extensively bound to plasma albumin (about 90%), and has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 120 L in humans. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases in proportion to increased dosage (5–120mg). The elimination half-life is about 20 hours in healthy individuals, and such long half-life enables the choice to have once-daily dosage. Etoricoxib, like the other coxibs, is excreted in urine and feces and also metabolized in likewise manner. CYP3A4 is mostly responsible for biotransformation of etoricoxib to carboxylic acid metabolite, but a non CYP450 metabolism pathway to glucuronide metabolite is also at hand. A very small portion of etoricoxib (<1%) is eliminated unchanged in the urine. Patients with chronic <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{do not appear to}} have different plasma concentration curve (AUC) compared to healthy individuals. It has though been reported that patients with moderate hepatic impairment have increased plasma concentration curve (AUC) by approximately 40%.

MethodsBetween February 2002 and October 2007, we performed 148 total laparoscopic AAA repairs, including a subset of 13 patients who underwent a laparoscopic JAAA repair. Median age was 70 years (range, 50 - 81 years). Median aneurysm size was 55 mm (range, 50 - 80 mm). Eight patients were in American Society of Anesthesiologist class II, and five were in class III. We used laparoscopic transperitoneal left retrorenal approaches and suprarenal clamping in all patients. ResultsWe implanted tube grafts in nine patients and bifurcated grafts in four. No conversions to open repair were required. Median operative time was 260 minutes (range, 180 - 355 minutes). Total median aortic clamping time was 77 minutes (range, 36 - 105 minutes). Median suprarenal clamping time was 24 minutes (range, 9 - 37 minutes). Median blood loss was 855 mL (range, 215 - 2100 mL). No patients died. One patient had a postoperative coagulopathy with hemorrhagic syndrome. Five patients had moderate systemic complications, including four <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiencies</b> without dialysis and one grade I ischemic colitis. Liquid diet was reintroduced after 1 day (range, 1 - 7 days). Most patients were ambulatory by day 3 (range, 2 - 17 days).

2500|$|Renal tubular {{acidosis}} (RTA) is {{a medical}} condition that involves an accumulation of acid in the body due to {{a failure of the}} kidneys to appropriately [...] the urine. In renal physiology, when blood is filtered by the kidney, the [...] passes through the tubules of the nephron, allowing for exchange of salts, acid equivalents, and other [...] before it drains into the bladder as urine. The metabolic acidosis that results from RTA may be caused either by failure to reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron (the proximal tubule) or by insufficient secretion of hydrogen ions (which are acidic) into the latter portions of the nephron (the distal tubule).

2500|$|Other {{court cases}} have {{concerned}} the rights for patients, or of minor patients' legal guardians, to refuse medical treatment {{even if there}} is a risk of death. For example, in a 2001 case, doctors at a French public hospital who gave blood products to a patient with an acute <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> were found not to have committed a mistake of a nature to involve the responsibility of the State. The Council stated that [...] "there does not exist, for the doctor, an abstract and unalterable hierarchy between the obligation to treat the patient, and that to respect the will of the patient," [...] concluding that faced with a decision to treat patients against their will, doctors do not have a legally predefined obligation to treat the patient, nor do they have a legally predefined obligation to abide by their wishes. One year later, after the adoption of the Kouchner Law on patients' rights and quality of the health system, the Council of State recalled that not respecting the patient's wishes violates his individual freedom, but the doctor did not commit a fault if under extreme conditions he performs an intervention “necessary and proportionate to its state” {{in order to try to}} save the patient's life.|$|E
30|$|Sepsis and {{septic shock}} remain a {{main cause of}} death in {{intensive}} care units despite numerous therapeutic trials [1]. If they survive the early shock phase [2], most patients die from sepsis-induced multiple organ failure [3]. Although liver failure occurs after pulmonary and <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiencies</b> [4, 5], it had been shown that hepatocellular dysfunction occurs early in the course of sepsis and persists during the late hypodynamic stage of sepsis [6 – 8]. The early depression of hepatocellular function has been ascribed to a liver microcirculatory alteration or to a release of proinflammatory cytokines [8]. Whereas the link between the initial inflammatory activation and the hepatocellular dysfunction leading to a liver failure remains elusive, mitochondrial dysfunctions are thought to play a major role. Mitochondrial dysfunctions are associated with severe abnormalities in tissue oxygen extraction and utilization [9, 10] which may ultimately lead to a critical depletion of cellular ATP and thus sepsis-mediated injury [11]. Due to an early downregulation of glycolysis pathways [12 – 14], cellular energetic adaptation to septic shock requires an increase in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity and/or efficiency (i.e., the amount of ATP produced per atom of oxygen consumed) to maintain mitochondrial ATP generation [15] and prevent bioenergetic failure and death. To adjust mitochondrial activity to ATP demand in stress conditions such as septic shock, the activity and/or efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation have to be fine-tuned [16]. This fine-tuning involves the control of (i) the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability (which regulates proton leakage), (ii) the activity and/or content of the mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and ATP synthase, as well as (iii) the mechanisms preventing over-generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Among these steps, changes in the cytochrome c oxidase stoichiometry and/or activity [17, 18], the proton leak activity or the transcription of the UCP 2 gene, and an increase in mitochondrial non-coupled respiration with phosphorylation are thought to play special roles [19, 20].|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the protective effects of ethanolic saffron stigma extract (Crocus sativus L.) on early hepatic and renal injuries in alloxan-induced diabetic rats.  For this purpose, 72 male wistar rats were randomly assigned to six different groups of 12 rats each, including healthy control rats, healthy control rats receiving ethanolic saffron extract, mild diabetic (MD) rats, mild diabetic rats receiving ethanolic saffron extract, severely diabetic (SD) rats and severely diabetic rats receiving ethanolic saffron extract. The most effective dose of the extract in reducing blood glucose (40 mg/kg), dissolved in normal saline solution (10 ml/kg) was administered intraperitoneally to treatment groups receiving the extract for 30 consecutive days. Control groups received normal saline solution in the same manner. Four hours after the last extract injections, all rats were euthanized simultaneously by cervical dislocation. Tissue specimens were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and 5 micron thick sections were prepared using routine hitopathological techniques. Histopathology of the liver and kidney in diabetic rats showed a spectrum of changes including periportal degeneration, membranoproliferative glomerulitis, enlargement of lining cells of tubules, lymphocytic infiltration, hyperemia and hemorrhage. These injuries were more prominent in SD rats. The histopathological appearance of liver and kidneys in ethanolic extract treated diabetic rats was near normal. The findings of the present study indicate that ethanolic extract of Crocus sativus L. stigma has protective effects on early diabetic nephropathy and hepatopathy in experimentally induced diabetes. Therefore, ethanolic extract of Crocus sativus L. stigma is recommended for prevention of early renal and hepatic injuries in diabetes mellitus, after randomized clinical trials...|$|R

Material and methodsBetween February 2002 and September 2003, we performed 30 total laparoscopic AAA repairs in 27 men and 3 women. Median age was 71. 5 years (range, 46 - 85 years). Median aneurysm size was 51. 5 mm (range, 30 - 79 mm). American Society of Anesthesiologists class of patients was II, III and IV in 10, 19, and 1 cases, respectively. We performed total laparoscopic endoaneurysmorrhaphy and aneurysm exclusion in 27 and 3 patients, respectively. We used the laparoscopic transperitoneal left retrocolic approach in 27 patients. We operated on 2 patients via a tranperitoneal left retrorenal approach and 1 patient via a retroperitoneoscopic approach. ResultsWe implanted tube grafts and bifurcated grafts in 11 and 19 patients, respectively. Two minilaparotomies were performed. In 1 case, exposure via a retroperitoneal approach was difficult and, in another case, distal aorta was extremely calcified. Median operative time was 290 minutes (range, 160 - 420 minutes). Median aortic clamping time was 78 minutes (range, 35 - 230 minutes). Median blood loss was 1680 cc (range, 300 - 6900 cc). In our early experience, 2 patients died of myocardial infarction. Ten major nonlethal postoperative complications {{were observed in}} 8 patients: 4 transcient <b>renal</b> <b>insufficiencies,</b> 2 cases of lung atelectasis, 1 bowel obstruction, 1 spleen rupture, 1 external iliac artery dissection, and 1 iliac hematoma.

With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 0. 5 - 20 months), patients had a complete recovery and all grafts were patent. ConclusionThese preliminary results show that total laparoscopic AAA repair is feasible and worthwhile for patients once the learning curve is overcome. However, prior training and experience in laparoscopic aortic surgery are needed to perform total laparoscopic AAA repair. Despite these encouraging results, a greater experience and further evaluation are required to ensure the real benefit of this technique compared with open AAA repair...|$|R
