The constant increases in the values of change in consumer prices, foreign exchange reserves (FERs), ratio of foreign direct investment to gross domestic product (GDP), ratio of domestic credits to GDP, and ratio of monetary base to FERs were found to shorten the <b>recession</b> <b>periods</b> of economies. On the other hand, a steady increase in real effective exchange rates, economic openness, and lending-to-deposit ratio can lead to longer recessions. Moreover, economies were found to diverge after currency crises, whereas no apparent differences in economies were observed before crises; and this is attributed to some economies access to financing opportunities, whereas others have lesser and even faced enforceability problems...|$|R

The conclusion about a power law distribution of <b>recession</b> <b>periods</b> seems better though the matter is not entirely settled. The case of prosperity duration is also studied and is found to follow a power law. Universal but also non universal features between recession and prosperity cases are emphasized.

30|$|Results {{suggest that}} {{when using the}} Routinization Index as the regressor, {{there seems to be}} a {{negative}} impact of the index on the change in the share of employment; this is only significant for the <b>recession</b> <b>period.</b> When separating out the different task intensities, there is no significant correlation between the change in the share of employment and the “Abstract Intensity” of occupations.

On the other hand, “Routine Intensity” of occupations exhibits a clearly negative correlation with the change in the share of employment in the <b>recession</b> <b>period.</b> Finally, “Non-routine Service Intensity” of occupations is positively and significantly correlated with the change in the share of employment.

The Global Economic Slowdown had a recessionary impact on the financial market leading to decline in share prices and indices in India. A significant decline in activity across the economy, lasting longer than a few months. A global {{recession is}} a period of global economic slowdown. The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare the impact of fundamental factors on Stock prices of BSE 200 companies in normal period and <b>recession</b> <b>period.</b> A sample of eighty companies has been selected for the purpose of the study. The panel data techniques, viz. Fixed Effects model and Random Effects model have been employed to investigate the objective. The empirical results reveal that Earning per Share has positive and significant impact on the share price at five percent level in the normal period (pre <b>recession</b> <b>period).</b> PER has positive and significant impact while Growth has a negative and significant impact on the share price at five percent level during <b>recession</b> <b>period.</b> While PER and ROCE have positive and significant impact on the share price at five and ten percent level.

Nevertheless, there is a distinct pattern of polarization between 1997 and 2007 and the <b>recession</b> <b>period.</b> During the first 10 years and coinciding with the expansionary period, low-paying occupations expanded in employment terms relative to average-paying occupations but also with respect to high-paying occupations.|$|E

In order to pursue this aim, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) {{has been applied to}} the Burt matrix obtained by merging the 1998 and 2000 Surveys on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) of the Bank of Italy, that is the expansion phase surveys, and setting as supplementary individuals the rows of the Burt matrix obtained by merging the 2002 and 2004 surveys (SHIW) of the Bank of Italy, that is the recession phase surveys. Through this double merging, it has been possible to analyse jointly the surveys conducted in two different but homogeneous years as far as macroeconomic trends are concerned. The analysis of the above mentioned data has highlighted that, on the whole, the socio-economic profile of indebted Italian households has undergone, in the <b>recession</b> <b>period</b> with respect to that of expansion, noteworthy changes, partly due to the gradual transformation of instruments used in the payment of instalments on more favourable terms and partly due to the high uncertainty with regard to the general economic perspectives which characterize the <b>recession</b> <b>period.</b> Keywords: household debt, purchasing behaviour, business cycle, multiple correspondence analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{deregulation}} of airline industry of Thailand has allowed three low cost airlines (LCAS) {{to operate in}} domestic routes. This study explored the impact of LCAS to three stakeholders in airline industry, full-service airlines, airports and passengers. The main question was who gained or lost from LCAS. In answering the question, the demand for airline industry was estimated. The change in revenue of airlines and airports were considered as private benefits. The change in consumer's surplus, {{amount of money that}} passengers were willing to pay for the airfare but did not pay, was regarded as the social benefit. Comparison of benefits between the expansion and recession periods o f the airline industry were examined. Moreover: the change in traveling pattern ffom Thailand to Laos was also investigated. This study proved that, in the expansion period, LCAs were not harmful to fill-service airlines. In turn, they were important to the growth of the industry. However in the <b>recession</b> <b>period,</b> LCAs were growing at the expense of full-service airlines. For passengers, consumer's surplus was increased in the expansion period but decreased in the <b>recession</b> <b>period</b> due to higher airfare. Airports gained in both expansion and <b>recession</b> <b>period.</b> LCAS encouraged tourists to change their traveling pattern from Thailand to Laos via an indirect route, Bangkok - Udorn Thani - Nongkai - the Friendship Bridge instead of the direct route from Bangkok to Vientiane...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{analysis}} of hydrograph recessions {{can be used}} to identify the parameters of a conceptual catchment storage irnodel and, with the advent of large-scale digital data storage and automated logging systems, it has become desirable to automate recession curve analysis. Various studies have thus reported algorithms used to infer 'baseflow' storage models automatically from recession data. Such algorithms commonly operate by maximising the fit of measured recession data to some a priori function. Here, an alternative approach is taken in which the appropriate form for a catchment saturated zone store is investigated by combining observed recession data to form a Master Recession Curve (MRC). This is done within a software package that offers automated functions to help select <b>recession</b> <b>periods</b> suitable for inclusion within the MRC. These <b>recession</b> <b>periods</b> are combined automatically to form a "prototype" MRC, which can be modified interactively to overcome problems such as unrepresentative or sparse data. The master recession for a catchment is used to calculate an empirical catchment-averaged discharge-relative storage (Q?S) relationship. The method is considered to be general because the Q?S relationship may be of arbitrary form. Examples are given, showing the derivation for three catchments of different Q?S functions...|$|R
