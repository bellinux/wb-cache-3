40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to develop the {{theoretical}} foundations of <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> and to determine its prospects on the basis of cluster formation. The authors use such research methods as systematization, comparative and complex analysis, synthesis, statistical method. Within the framework of the research, the concept of <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> is specified, and its integration core – cluster – is allocated. The authors work out an algorithm of regional clustering, which will ensure the growth of economy and tax income. Measures have been proposed to optimize the organizational mechanism of interaction between the participants of the territorial cluster and the authorities that allow to ensure the effective functioning of clusters, including taxation clusters. Based on the results of studying the existing methods for assessing the effectiveness of cluster policy, the authors propose their own approach to evaluating the consequences of implementing the <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>policy,</b> according to which the list of quantitative and qualitative indicators is defined. The present article systematizes the experience and results of the cluster policy of certain European countries, that made it possible to determine the prospects and synergetic effect from the development of clusters as an integration foundation of regional policy in the Russian Federation. The authors carry out the analysis of activity of cluster formations using the example of the Rostov region – a leader in the formation of conditions for the cluster policy development in the Southern Federal District. 11 clusters and cluster initiatives are developing in this region. As a result, the authors propose measures for support of the already existing clusters and creation of the new ones...|$|E

The static version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model shows that countries that are initially more protected (such as India) are likely to capture the lion’s share of the gain from the liberalization scheme. Countries that maintain status quo are the losers; prominent among them are the EU 25 and the North America region.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{selected}} pieces from the growing literature on international migration to Europe from a regional and policy-making perspective. The analysis identifies lessons from the European experience with respect to two issues: the relationship between <b>policies</b> of <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> and international migration, and {{the conditions under which}} a common (regional) policy of incorporation of immigrants into the host societies might be agreed upon. The purpose is twofold: to provide a critical assessment {{of the state of the}} art and to advance the debate through the suggestion of new research venues. We argue that most of the selected literature misses the relation of mutual causation between migration and <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>policies,</b> partly due to an overemphasis on the benefits of supranational institutionalization, and partly due to the difficulties of conceptualizing the hybrid character of the EU institutional supranationality and the peculiar nature of its politics of migration. We also suggest exploring a distinctive process that characterizes the migration policy area: ‘hauled’ policy convergence; that is, the development of a common policy which occurs largely because it is necessary for other dimensions of the <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> process to continue, but which countries are reluctant to engage in. In other words, hauled convergence is the minimum policy harmonization needed in a very sensitive policy area (such as migration) for <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> to advance deeper and further in other areas...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} monopolistically {{competitive}} model of trade with firm heterogeneity - {{in terms of}} productivity differences - and endogenous differences in the ‘toughness’ of competition across markets - {{in terms of the}} number and average productivity of competing firms. We analyze how these features vary across markets of different size that are not perfectly integrated through trade; we then study the effects of different trade liberalization policies. In our model, market size and trade affect the toughness of competition, which then feeds back into the selection of heterogeneous producers and exporters in that market. Aggregate productivity and average markups thus respond to both the size of a market and the extent of its integration through trade (larger, more integrated markets exhibit higher productivity and lower markups). Our model remains highly tractable, even when extended to a general framework with multiple asymmetric countries integrated to different extents through asymmetric trade costs. We believe this provides a useful modeling framework that is particularly well suited to the analysis of trade and <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>policy</b> scenarios in an environment with heterogeneous firms and endogenous markups. market structure, market size, productivity heterogeneity, endogenous markups, trade liberalization...|$|E

The goal {{of this paper is}} to bridge this gap by disclosing the social inequalities -and therefore the specific social risks- experienced by immigrants in Europe and particularly in Italy. In this respect, working poverty, labour market segregation in low qualified jobs, migrant women’s conciliation needs and, in general, the difficult social mobility of second generations come to the fore. In order to find out to what extent public policies take into account the social risks encountered by immigrants, the paper analyses the <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>policies</b> in eight Italian regions, since they are central actors in the definition of the social policies aimed at dealing with immigrant social vulnerability. The research points out that the social risks associated to the migrant background are poorly recognized and however addressed with an old policy approach, i. e. with measures that on the overall reproduce existing gaps into the Italian welfare system, such as lack of attention for women’s conciliation needs and for young generations weak status in the labour market.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to quantify the}} effects of removing trade taxes and instituting some necessary fiscal reform on poverty and income distribution in Cote d'lvoire. It first analyses income distribution for various homogenous socioeconomic groups using an absolute poverty line based on the constant basic needs approach.

The results show that poverty increases for all households, but depending on the simulations the situation is diversified among socioeconomic groups. Liberalizing trade by removing tax on exports leads to an increase in domestic prices of agricultural and industrial goods, resulting in an increase in the consumer price index and a decrease in households' disposable income and thus in their consumption.

Climate change is also negatively impacting on the region’s {{water and energy}} resources. As the majority of SADC’s population lives in poverty, <b>regional</b> development and <b>integration</b> are underpinned by water and energy security as the watercourses {{in the region are}} transboundary in nature. This paper reviews the region’s water and energy resources and recommends policies based on the water–energy nexus approach. This is achieved by reviewing literature on water and energy resources as well as policy issues. Water resources governance provides a strong case to create a water–energy nexus platform to support <b>regional</b> planning and <b>integration</b> as SADC countries share similar climatic and hydrological conditions. However, there has been a gap between water and energy sector planning in terms of policy alignment and technical convergence. These challenges hinder national policies on delivering economic and social development goals, as well as constraining the regional goal of greater <b>integration.</b> <b>Regional</b> objectives on sustainable energy and access to clean water for all can only be achieved through the recognition of the water–energy nexus, championed in an integrated and sustainable manner.
