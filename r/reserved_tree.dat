40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to {{demonstrate}} forest thinning techniques that should be used beginning in 2011 for the ultimate purpose of timber production by analyzing the stand structure of unthinned natural Asian White Birch forests aged 10 - 25 years in Manhanshan National Forest Park. The results of the study led to the following three observations: (1) among dominant trees, those with relatively good characteristics should be selected as <b>reserve</b> <b>trees.</b> Any trees obstructing the growth of the <b>reserve</b> <b>trees</b> must be removed as thinned trees. In addition, dominated trees which do not have an impact on the growth of <b>reserve</b> <b>trees</b> are left unthinned to prevent the occurrence of epicormic shoots in <b>reserve</b> <b>trees.</b> (2) The forest at 8 - 15 year-old should preferably be thinned for the first time.

40|$|Abstract-In {{recent years}} foresters {{managing}} hardwoods in the Southem Appalachians have been investigating {{a variety of}} regeneration methods {{that lead to the}} development of a two-aged stand. The <b>reserved</b> <b>trees</b> that make up the older age class usually meet a variety of objectives such as timber, wildlife food and cover, and aesthetic values. A series of 20 operational cuts in Appalachian hardwood stands was evaluated 2 to 5 years post-logging.

40|$|Ecological {{forestry}} {{methods that}} include growing trees to very large diameter, retention of permanent legacy trees, {{and maintenance of}} large coarse woody debris (CWD) can have significant beneficial effects on biological diversity and ecosystem processes, but {{little is known about}} the potential impacts on timber production rates. To address this need, we used the CANOPY model, a crown-based individual-tree model calibrated with data from mature and old-growth stands, to simulate 7 treatments over a span of 150 years in a second-growth northern hardwood stand. Treatments included an untreated control, standard single-tree selection cutting with maximum retained dbh of 60, 70, or 80 cm, and retention of permanent legacy trees at densities of 7, 15, or 22 per ha. Raising the maximum dbh to 70 or 80 cm reduced net harvestable production by 15 - 24 % but resulted in higher residual stand volumes. Retention of permanent legacy trees in the 60 cm maximum dbh trial reduced production by 9 - 33 % depending on <b>reserve</b> <b>tree</b> density. <b>Reserve</b> <b>trees</b> generally did not increase CWD levels above those obtainable under a no-reserve treatment with a 70 or 80 cm maximum dbh. The different treatments had highly variable effects on the degree to which the size distribution of live trees approached old-growth conditions. Some treatments merely maintained mature forest structure, and two of the reserve-tree treatments had structures that vacillated between mature and borderline old-growth conditions. The 80 cm maximum diameter treatment was the only one that promoted negative exponential size distributions with large trees similar to those in the later stages of old-growth development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} several {{components of}} a multi-disciplinary project de-signed to evaluate the ecological and biological effects of two innovative silvicultural treatments coupled with prescribed fi re {{in an attempt to}} both manage fuel profi les and create two-aged stand structures in lodgepole pine. Two shelterwood silvicultural treatments were designed to replicate as well as enhance the existing multi-aged stand structure on the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest in central Montana: the fi rst, with <b>reserve</b> <b>trees</b> evenly distributed; the second, with reserves contained within small (1 / 10 - 1 / 4 acre) groups. Retention of <b>reserve</b> <b>trees</b> was targeted at 50 %, without regard to diameter or species. Eight even distribution and eight group-retention treatments were applied on 16 units totaling 649 acres. Half of the units were broadcast burned following harvest using a common burn prescription on all units. Allowable overstory mortality specifi ed in the prescribed fi re plan was 50 %. Plot-based fuel inventories and fi re effects observations were performed at permanent plot locations prior to and following harvest, and after burning. Fuel moisture samples were acquired immediately prior to ignition. Data from four prescribed-burned treatment units were evaluated for this paper: two even-retention units and two grouped retention units. Harvest activities resulted in signifi cant increases in fi ne-fuel loading (1 -, 10 -, and 100 -hour fuel), which was subsequently reduced by prescribed fi re to near pre-harvest levels. Consumption of large woody fuel was similar for both treatment types. The fi re-induced mortality of overstory trees was greater in the even distribution than in the grouped distribu-tion. Despite careful execution of a relatively conservative burn plan, mortality in the even treatments exceeded the prescription threshold of 50 % by an additional 28 %. Additional data collected at the plots include trees per acre, residual tree mortality, residual tree growth, regeneration, windthrow, hydrologic responses, soil impacts, and beetle activity. A comprehensive summary of the treatments will follow subsequent monitoring scheduled to occur fi ve and ten years after burning...|$|R

Acorn production from 11 to 15 years and regeneration accumulation, canopy cover and light regimes were monitored 15 years after treatment.
