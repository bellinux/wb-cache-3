40|$|A {{physical}} {{model has been}} developed to simulate the flows and mixing of gases in the waste of a longwall <b>retreat</b> <b>coalface.</b> The model is {{used in conjunction with}} computational modelling, and the distributions of permeability and gas emission in the model waste fotlow those in Computer simulations (Pokryszka et al 1996). The {{physical model}} represents at 1 / 70 th scale a 200 m long, 3 m high coalface with a waste extending up to 280 m to the face start line. The model is tilted to the same seam slopes äs the real face, e. g. 22 ° ascensional Ventilation along the face and 7 ° slope to the dip. The purpose is to investigate the flow of three components: Ventilation seepage flow through the waste; meth-ane; and nitrogen injected to quell spontaneous combustion. A heavier-than-airSurrogate gas (SFg) is used in place of methane, and therefore the model is inverted so that gas layers form along the "rooP. The main forces driving the flows in the waste (pressure gradients due to Ventilation and the density difference of gas lay-ers) are kept in proportion by appropriate scaling of the permeabil-ity. Calibration and validation used data from a coalface at a mine in the Lorraine coalfield. The model is now in operational use...|$|E
40|$|In HBL (Lorraine coalfield), {{large amounts}} of air are used in order to dilute methane in <b>retreat</b> <b>coalfaces.</b> A {{parasite}} flow of air exists in the goaf, leading {{to the risk of}} spontaneous combustion of remaining coal as well as to a diminution of firedamp drainage efficiency. The evaluation of various means for reducing this flow has been done through the use of models : a physical model and a numerical model based on a CFD package. The efficiency on air leakage reduction, decrease of methane concentration in the air return or increase of methane concentration of drainage has been quantified for one or more stoppings set up in the abandoned gates or for their backfilling. The influence is small but positive as regards drainage efficiency improvement but almost zero on risk mitigation of spontaneous combustion in the goaf...|$|R
30|$|High {{static stress}} (σ_s). During deep mining, the coal-rock mass around roadways and coalfaces {{presents}} high original stress. Moreover, the roadway excavation or <b>coalface</b> <b>retreating</b> {{results in the}} high stress concentration. In this condition, the stress level has not reached the critical stress state inducing the dynamic failure of coal-rock. However, under the minor dynamic stress increment caused by far-field mine tremor, the total stress field formed by the dynamic and static stresses superposition exceeds the critical stress level and thus a rockburst occurs. In this case, the dynamic stress induced by mine tremor plays an inducing role in the coal rock failure. This {{is the most common}} form in deep mining.|$|R
