25|$|Banks are {{susceptible}} to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises. These include liquidity risk (where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds), credit risk (the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it), and interest rate risk (the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable, if <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans).|$|E
25|$|Further {{adding to}} the {{financial}} pressure on the debt situation, in May 1994, Moody's downgraded Canada's debt, citing the high debt levels and concerns about a lack of political will {{to deal with the}} deficit. A vicious circle had been created. The underwhelming 1994 budget was taken as a sign that the Liberals were not serious about eliminating the deficit, which in turn created severe doubts amongst investors holding or considering buying government of Canada bonds that they would be repaid when the bonds matured. As a result, investors cease buying government of Canada bonds, which forced the Bank of Canada to raise the interest rates in order to attract buyers of Canada bonds. The <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> besides for hindering economic activity and thus hurting the government's ability to collect taxes, raised the costs of servicing the existing national debt, which in turn created further doubts amongst investors that they would be repaid, and thus started the circle all over again. As the vicious circle caused by the lack of investor confidence and <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> continued into the fall of 1994, the 3% target became increasingly unlikely to be achieved, and thus Martin became more and more influenced by Dodge's advice that something more drastic needed to be done than achieving the 3% target.|$|E
25|$|International Harvester never {{recovered}} from the strike. In November 1981, IH asked the UAW for $100 million in wage and benefit concessions. <b>Rising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> demand weakened by the early 1980s recession, and high manufacturing costs pushed the company's total debt to a whopping $4.5 billion. On December 23, 1981, the company reached an agreement with 200 of its lenders to refinance $4.15 billion of its debt {{in a bid to}} avoid bankruptcy. On January 20, 1982, the UAW rejected Harvester's request for concessions because McCardell had just given $6 million in bonuses to salaried employees. But with the firm's financial condition rapidly worsening, the UAW opened negotiations in March 1982. Negotiators reached a tentative agreement nearly two years to the day after the 19791980 strike ended, giving Harvester $200 million in wage, benefit, pension, and other savings over three years.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{money market}} mutual fund {{to break the}} buck was First Multifund for Daily Income (FMDI) in 1978, liquidating and restating NAV at 94 cents per share. [...] An {{argument}} has been made that FMDI was not technically a money market fund as at the time of liquidation the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years. [...] However, prospective investors were informed that FMDI would invest [...] "solely in Short-Term (30-90 days) MONEY MARKET obligations." [...] Furthermore, the rule restricting which the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in, Rule 2-a7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, was not promulgated until 1983. Prior to the adoption of this rule, a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a money market fund, which FMDI did. [...] Seeking higher yield, FMDI had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities, and <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> negatively impacted the value of its portfolio. [...] In order to meet increasing redemptions, the fund was forced to sell a certificate of deposit at a 3% loss, triggering a restatement of its NAV and the first instance of a money market fund [...] "breaking the buck".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1995, The Wall Street Journal had {{published}} an editorial written by John Fund entitled [...] "Bankrupt Canada?" [...] strongly {{critical of the}} Chrétien government's deficit-fighting amid a crisis atmosphere caused {{by the collapse of}} the Mexican economy in late 1994, the Canadian dollar in steep decline, and soaring interest rates, which put strong pressure on the Chrétien government to do more to reduce the deficit. The Wall Street Journals editorial [...] "Bankrupt Canada?" [...] attracted much media attention in Canada and was taken as a sign that all was not well with the national finances. In particular by early 1995 the <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> started to make achieving the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP more and more impossible to achieve, and thus pressured the government to introduce a budget that would assure the markets that the deficit would be eliminated, not reduced in the near-future. Through not directly impacting on the Canadian economy very much, the Mexican economic meltdown in December 1994 served as a graphic and terrifying example of what happened when a nation did not manage its finances properly, and perhaps made elements of the Canadian public more open to the goal of eliminating the deficit despite the short-term pain than what they would have otherwise been. Further applying pressure on Canada was a warning from Moody's that Canada's debt rating would downgraded again if the 1995 budget did not contain a credible deficit elimination plan. Martin went on a tour of various world financial centers in early 1995 to drum up interest in buying Canadian bonds, and found that investors had no such interest, telling him that Canada had promising since the 1970s to deal with the deficit, and they wanted action, not words this time.|$|E
