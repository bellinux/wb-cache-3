5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them <b>recognises</b> her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she <b>recognises</b> Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|Article8 <b>recognises</b> {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be {{restricted}} {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, or government administrators.

Wages for foreign workers vary, depending on the position, although in general Saudis holding similar positions earn more.|$|E
5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell <b>recognises</b> a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E
5|$|As Diane {{has missed}} her flight, she {{suggests}} to Ric that they visit his father's grave. At the graveside, Ric tells Diane about his troubled {{relationship with his}} father, and confesses that he has feelings for her. They see a woman nearby who Diane <b>recognises,</b> having seen Paulina giving her money the day before. Ric confronts her, and discovers she is Esi Griffin (Gloria Acheampong), his father's last wife and widow. She has a son who is not in school, but will not explain her circumstances and tells Ric to speak to Kumi.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, the IFNA <b>recognises</b> only women's netball. Men's netball teams {{exist in}} some areas but attract less {{attention}} from sponsors and spectators. Men's netball started to become popular in Australia during the 1980s, and the first men's championship was held in 1985. In 2004, New Zealand and Fiji sent teams {{to compete in the}} Australian Mixed and Men's National Championships. By 2006, mixed netball teams in Australia had as many male participants as rugby union. Other countries with men's national teams include Canada, Fiji, Jamaica, Kenya, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Unlike women's netball at elite and national levels, men's and mixed gendered teams are largely self-funded.|$|E
5|$|At Strangways' house, Bond sees a {{photograph}} of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named Quarrel, whom he <b>recognises</b> as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, Felix Leiter, a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica, but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially <b>recognises</b> 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses {{can be a problem}} in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) {{returns to}} his team in {{spectacular}} fashion, walking {{into the middle of}} a hostage situation involving his team and an alien Blowfish, shooting the intoxicated Blowfish in the head. At the Hub, his team question why he left them, and he simply responds that he had found his Doctor and that he belongs at Torchwood. The team is then alerted to a death near a multi-storey car park, where the team detect energy from the Rift on the corpse. Jack, to even his surprise, gets a hologram message on his vortex manipulator from a person he <b>recognises,</b> and leaves the team to talk to him.|$|E
5|$|Christine, now {{pregnant}} and married, awakens on a May bank holiday. Thirteen months later, it is Father's Day and Adam tends to their son Jack (played variously by Joel Little and Dexter Little) in the night. Christine hears the Stranger's voice, but eventually finds Jack with Adam. Christine celebrates her birthday thirteen months later. Ernie no longer <b>recognises</b> Christine, while Adam {{is more interested}} in his colleague Zara (Ellerby). Marion blindfolds Christine for a game of blind man's buff. Christine hears noises from behind a door and removes her blindfold to step through. Thirteen months later, Adam is packing a case for a family holiday. Ernie has died, and Christine's relationship with Adam is strained.|$|E
5|$|Current {{taxonomy}} <b>recognises</b> four subspecies: M. s. splendens in Western Australia, M. s. musgravei {{in central}} Australia (subspecies previously recognised as M. s. callainus), M. s. melanotus in inland eastern Australia and M. s. emmottorum in southwestern Queensland. Initially, {{the three were}} considered separate species as they were described far from their borders with other subspecies. However, as the interior of Australia was explored, it became apparent there were areas of hybridisation where subspecies overlapped. Thus in 1975, the first three forms below were reclassified as subspecies of Malurus splendens.|$|E
5|$|Dosanjh and {{his wife}} Raminder have three sons. In April 2000, his middle son, Aseem, was charged with assaulting an Ontario police officer during a bar brawl, but was found not guilty. Dosanjh has {{travelled}} back to India several times, on official state business and for personal reasons, since emigrating. In January 2003, {{he was awarded the}} Pravasi Bharatiya Samman (Expatriate Indian Honour) from Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New Delhi. The award <b>recognises</b> individual excellence in various fields for persons of Indian origin across the world.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} his weekly squash game, a traffic {{diversion}} reminds Perowne of the anti-war protests occurring that day. After being allowed through the diversion, he collides with another car, damaging its wing mirror. At first the driver, Baxter, tries to extort money from him. When Perowne refuses, Baxter {{and his two}} companions become aggressive. Noticing symptoms in Baxter's behaviour, Perowne quickly <b>recognises</b> the onset of Huntington's disease. Though he is punched in the sternum, Perowne manages to escape unharmed by distracting Baxter with discussions of his disease.|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, Robbie Reyes and Daisy Johnson, the vigilantes Ghost Rider and Quake, plan {{to visit}} the former’s uncle in prison {{to talk to him}} about his past working at Momentum Energy labs, which they are investigating. However, another {{blackout}} hits that city, and the pair race to get Robbie’s brother Gabe. Fighting off some looters, Johnson injures her arms, so when they get Gabe to safety, Robbie goes to get her medical supplies. While he is gone, Gabe tells Johnson that he <b>recognises</b> her as Quake, and asks her to leave his brother to keep him out of trouble.|$|E
