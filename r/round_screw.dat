50|$|Over 3,000 dolmens {{and other}} {{structures}} {{can be found}} in the North-Western Caucasus region in Russia, where more and more dolmens are discovered in the mountains each year. These dolmens are related to the Maykop culture. This great city of dolmens was built along the shores of the Black Sea from Maykop down to Sochi. The inhabitants were metal workers. The dolmens were vaults or safes of stone, with a narrow circular entrance that could be tapped with a <b>round</b> <b>screw</b> of stone. Supposedly the dolmens were used to hide and protect metal objects: gold, silver, bronze, jewels and some other treasure. Trade of these objects was done with Persia, Assyria, Egypt and Crete. The Dolmen City was pillaged and sacked by Scythian invaders in the early first millennium BC. The metal workers were enslaved.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{experimental}} {{study on the}} self-tapping screw’s pullout resistance in the wood structure was conducted. Domestic ordinary screws were used together with imported or domestic wood to fabricate 6 screw connection specimens in wooden walls. Then monotonic loading tests were conducted {{and it can be}} concluded that, the common <b>round</b> <b>screw</b> connection strength mainly depends on the failure mode, the lack of cooperation effect significantly influences the strength of screw connections, and the dispersion of screw connection stiffness is high. So, to obtain formulae for the self-tapping screw connection strength and stiffness by further experimental study will be very necessary...|$|E

40|$|A lateral tibial head {{buttress}} plate designed {{for human beings}} was used to repair a highly comminuted tibial fracture in a two-year-old male labrador retriever caused by a gunshot wound. The plate {{was placed in a}} bridging fashion to provide minimal disruption of the fracture site and minimise surgical time. THE lateral tibial head buttress (LTHB) plate is a tibial plate used in human beings. It has an expanded metaphyseal section to improve the fixation of the tibial plateau. It has also been used to repair supracondylar femoral fractures (Schatzker and Tile 1996) and distal humeral shaft fractures (Levy and others 2005). It is 3 · 8 mm thick and 14 mm wide. The plate is available with a curved right or left proximal flare with a maximum width of 26 mm. The flared portion of the plate is designed to correspond to the proximal aspect of the human tibia, and contains one oval and three <b>round</b> <b>screw</b> holes so that the plate can be applied in compression. The plate is available with five to 13 shaft holes. Its use in dogs has been reported in the repair of supracondylar and distal femoral fractures (Dueland and VanEnkevort 1995, Glyde and others 2003). Gunshot injuries can cause extensive bony and soft tissue trauma as a result of crushing and laceration, the generation of shock waves, cavitation, and the formation of secondary missiles consisting of bone fragments. These cause major vascular and soft tissue damage, resulting in long healing times. The fixation of gunshot fractures requires rigid, long-lasting stabilisation. This paper reports the use of an LTHB plate in the repair of a tibial fracture in a dog...|$|E

Based on SNI 01 - 3545 - 2004 standards for foodstuffs honey, determined the content of water is allowed a maximum of 22 % and capped at a maximum processing temperature at 40 oC so that other content in honey is not damaged. Evaporating the water at low temperatures {{can be done by}} the method of vacuum systems. By lowering the pressure below 1 atm or in accordance with the graph of temperature versus pressure, where to evaporate water at a temperature of 40 oC, the pressure required is 7, 4 kPa.

This study makes a planning vacuum evaporator engine control system for controlling the process. The temperature at 40 oC honey processing predefined SNI can be achieved by creating a temperature control system with a controller and use of sensors, so that the temperature treatment process is maintained to keep the content contained in the honey.
