25|$|Every {{person with}} a Swedish {{national}} identification number must register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered to that person once they reach the <b>registered</b> <b>address.</b> As an example, Swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang got a Betalningsanmärkning since a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the Stockholm congestion tax. At the time, {{he was living in}} the USA training for his first Space Shuttle mission and had an old invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.|$|E

50|$|LL/SC has two {{advantages}} over CAS when designing a load-store architecture: reads and writes are separate instructions, {{as required by}} the design philosophy (and pipeline architecture); and both instructions can be performed using only two <b>registers</b> (<b>address</b> and value), fitting naturally into common 2-operand ISAs. CAS, on the other hand, requires three <b>registers</b> (<b>address,</b> old value, new value) and a dependency between the value read and the value written. x86, being a CISC architecture, does not have this constraint; though modern chips may well translate a CAS instruction into separate LL/SC micro-operations internally.|$|R
