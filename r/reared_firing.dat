The Navy believes it to be a portion of the port side <b>rear</b> <b>fire</b> control tower support mast. It was flown to Tinker Air Force Base then delivered to the Muskogee War Memorial Park in Muskogee, Oklahoma in 2010, where the 40 foot m, 25,000 lb, barnacle-encrusted mast section is now on permanent outdoor display.|$|R
5000|$|The Schlastas {{nevertheless}} {{remained a}} force to be reckoned with. Their aircraft remained highly agile two-seat fighters fitted with <b>rear</b> <b>firing</b> gun turrets and were no easy target for an Entente fighter pilot. The Junkers J.I in particular acquired a reputation for being almost impossible to shoot down. Schlastas made substantial contributions towards the success of the Kaiserschlacht, the German Spring Offensive of 1918 and fought numerous defensive actions until the end of the war.|$|R

500|$|The Dornier Do 17Z {{series was}} the most {{recognised}} and mass-produced variant, and saw more combat service than the E-U types. The type was modified {{as a result of}} combat experience during the Spanish Civil War. The forward fuselage was redesigned, with the cockpit area being [...] "dropped", or extended further to enable a <b>rear</b> <b>firing</b> gunner position to be installed, and the canopy extended aft, until it was nearly parallel with the leading edge and wing root.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} compartmentalised from the crew, and the turret {{structure}} included forward and <b>rear</b> <b>firing</b> machine guns. Of a planned (shared production) of 1,500 each, a single British prototype was finished {{by the end}} of the war. The British built just 24, the Americans completed 100 between September 1918 and 1920, at the Rock Island Arsenal, at a cost of $35,000 £8,750 apiece ($430,000 £226,000 in 2006). About 40 hulls for the U.S Liberty were produced by the Manchester Tank Syndicate, 11 British Type Mark VIII by the North British Locomotive Co.|$|R

50|$|Although {{most of the}} Bradley AFV's ports {{have since}} been removed, these weapons are maintained, and are used by crews for self-defense, close-quarters situations, and for <b>firing</b> from the <b>rear</b> door <b>firing</b> ports as intended.|$|R
5|$|The Do 17F-1 was a {{long-range}} reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. The Do 17 prototype V8 {{was used to}} test the configuration of the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper <b>rear</b> <b>firing</b> position, C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 would see service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the Galaxy Federation {{learns that}} ORN houses Plealos deep below Nebula's surface {{when not in}} use and takes the {{opportunity}} to plan an operation to take it down. They send the next iteration of their Fire Leo series of fighter craft, the FIRE LEO-02 Exceliza, to destroy ORN bases on Nepura and eventually find and destroy Plealos. The player controls the Exceliza and travels through a variety of stages to accomplish this goal.The cover image for the Thunder Force II Sega/MD/G package by Illustrator Marc Ericksen describes the attack of the advanced FIRE LEO-02s on Nepura utilizing its forward and <b>rear</b> <b>firing</b> ordinance (above right).|$|R

50|$|The , in {{the front}} line {{at the time of}} its construction, was found in the third line after the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which reunited the Ubaye Valley with France, was defended by two invalid {{companies}} to the Revolution, and a reduced garrison during the period between 1790-1815. The restoration added an advanced battery or hornwork, a rebuilt door (1821), and added some casemates for <b>rear</b> <b>firing</b> and caponiers. It was decommissioned in 1866, then occupied by a single guard from 1887 to 1907 before being sold. Passed from hand to hand, the commune bought it in 1977, and has since begun restoration work. The enclosure is a listed historic monument.|$|R
25|$|The Su-6 {{fitted with}} a second cockpit with <b>rear</b> wards <b>firing</b> machine-gun. Testing {{revealed}} better performance and armour than the Il-2, but despite recommendations, production was not carried out due to the M-71 engine not enterring production.|$|R

5000|$|Heathcote, {{commanding}} , {{took his}} ship in and at 12:34 pm passed the French <b>rear,</b> <b>firing</b> on {{them with her}} port guns, as the French stood in for Toulon on the starboard tack. The rest of the squadron, joined by the 74-gun [...] from Pellew's fleet, followed in succession. The British ships then turned about and tacked across in the opposite direction, cannonading the fleeing French with their starboard batteries. At 1:00 pm the advance ships of Pellew's fleet, , [...] and [...] arrived and opened fire on the rear-most French ship, the Wagram. The British ships tacked and wore, exchanging fire with the French until the wind carried Cosmao-Kerjulien's squadron under {{the safety of the}} shore batteries covering the approach to Toulon.|$|R
60|$|The {{wind was}} now rising. Lord Howard sent off a fast boat with letters to Lord Henry Seymour, telling him how things had gone so far, and bidding him be {{prepared}} for the arrival of the Spanish fleet in the Downs. As the afternoon went on the wind rose, and a rolling sea came in from the west. Howard still hung upon the Spanish <b>rear,</b> <b>firing</b> but seldom in order to save his powder. As evening fell, the Spanish vessels, huddled closely together, frequently came into collision with one another, and in one of these the Capitana, the flagship of the Andalusian division, commanded by Admiral Pedro de Valdez, had her bowsprit carried away, the foremast fell overboard, and the ship dropped out of her place.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{physical}} model we {{developed in a}} previous work (Balbi et al., 2007) predicts fire behaviour with a computational time that is faster than real time. However it has the inconvenient of introducing an empirical law (McCaffrey, 1979) which provides flame height according to heat release rate. The present study introduces two improvements of this model: the triangular flame hypothesis and a modification {{taking into account the}} air cooling on the <b>rear</b> <b>fire</b> front. To test this variant of our simplified model, it was compared with important experimental results (Viegas, 2004). The experiments were performed in homogeneous and plane fuel beds made with dead Pinus pinaster needles under high values of wind and slope. In spite of these high values this {{physical model}} provides a good approximation of the fire front perimeter...|$|R

5000|$|Early {{in their}} career, Gannon and Hands joined a city task force, the Sanitary Investigations Committee, and went the extra step {{of living in}} a New York {{tenement}} in order to better understand urban living conditions for the poor. Calling New York's tenements [...] "a reproach to the humanitarianism of this enlightened century," [...] they set to work to find better solutions to urban housing for the poor. The firm quickly became noted for designing innovative apartment buildings that were affordable, sanitary, well-ventilated, and practical. One of their model tenements was designed around a central court (for light and air), with balconies for each apartment, front and <b>rear</b> <b>fire</b> escapes, and ash chutes and garbage receptacles for refuse management. Some were specifically designed for the rising class of young urban working women, and the partners were elected to the Women's Health Protective Association of New York.|$|R
5000|$|MWS-M - MWS with altered {{sides of}} the hull. On the left side, two {{handrails}} were removed (the center lower and the rear lower) and a stowage box was added in the center. On the right side, two handrails were removed (the center upper and lower), a new handrail {{was added to the}} upper <b>rear.</b> The <b>firing</b> ports were removed on both sides.|$|R
50|$|The fire {{began with}} the {{ignition}} of two 23-litre drums of diesel fuel in the building's foyer. The drums were thrown into the foyer, then ignited by a lit torch thrown through the open door. When ignited the burning diesel sent carbon monoxide up to the club's main room on the first floor. Large quantities of grease had been smeared over the stairs of the building's <b>rear</b> <b>fire</b> escape. The door of the fire escape had also been greased. The fifteen people killed had died of asphyxiation as they struggled to open the greased fire escape doors. Police believed that had they been able to open the doors they would have slipped and fallen down the steel stairs. A fire brigade officer reported hearing screams from behind the closed door as firemen tried to smash it down. Other reports indicated that fuel seeped from the two 23-litre drums into the carpet of the foyer, causing a fireball to engulf the stairway.|$|R
