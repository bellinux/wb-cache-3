5|$|In the 1920s, {{government}} censorship was commonplace. Magazines {{were routinely}} confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; {{and virtually all}} anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally.|$|E

Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E

25|$|As Part Two begins, it {{is assumed}} that the literate classes of Spain have all <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> part of the story. Cervantes's meta-fictional device was to make even the {{characters}} in the story familiar with the publication of Part One, as well as with an actually published, fraudulent Part Two. When strangers encounter the duo in person, they already know their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Pressed into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three ragged peasant girls and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends (reversing some incidents of Part One) that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment.|$|E

[...] "I was offered credit on the film for screenwriting by the Writers Guild of America," [...] Handler continued, [...] "but I didn't take it because I didn't write it. I felt like it would be an insult to the guy who did." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Burton {{dropped out}} of Mary Reilly over Columbia's {{decision}} to fast track the film and their interest with Julia Roberts {{in the title role}} instead of Ryder. This prompted Burton to becoming interested in directing Ed Wood himself, on the understanding it could be done quickly. Lehmann said, [...] "Tim wanted to do this movie immediately and direct, but I was already committed to Airheads." [...] Lehmann was given executive producer credit. Alexander and Karaszewski delivered a 147-page screenplay in six weeks. Burton <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites. Ed Wood gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, [...] "On a picture like this I find you don't need to storyboard. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's best to be more spontaneous." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{had wanted}} to bring the Borg into Voyager, which resulted in numerous pitches {{from a variety of}} writers. There were concerns from some of the crew that the events of the film [...] effectively destroyed the Borg, but executive producer Rick Berman clarified both that the death of the Borg Queen in the film did not mean the destruction of the entire collective and that there were other Borg remaining in the Delta Quadrant. The alien race had made their first appearance in the [...] episode [...] "Q Who" [...] and, {{at the time of the}} original broadcast of [...] "Unity", had recently appeared in First Contact. The idea of Borg being separated from the collective had previously been seen in the episode of The Next Generation entitled [...] "I, Borg" [...] with the resultant effect seen in the two-part [...] "".

500|$|A {{number of}} Hollywood studios had {{contacted}} George R.R. Martin about possible adaptation {{of his book}} series A Song of Ice and Fire into a film, however Martin expressed the opinion the books could not {{be made into a}} film as too much would have to be cut from the books, but thought it could be made into a television series. In January 2006, David Benioff spoke to Martin's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption, and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to David Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, called D. B. Weiss and said: [...] "Maybe I'm crazy, but I haven't had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years. So take a look because I think it might make a great HBO series." [...] Weiss, who then <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> book in two days, was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books. They arranged a meeting with Martin, who asked them if they knew who Jon Snow’s real mother might be, and was satisfied with their answer.|$|E
500|$|Murray's {{first contact}} {{when he moved}} to London was William Hamilton, a Scottish-born {{barrister}} who was said to be the first Scot to practise at the English Bar, {{and one of the few}} people who was qualified to act as a barrister in both England and Scotland. Hamilton had been one of Murray's sponsors when he joined Lincoln's Inn in 1724, and when Murray came to London, Hamilton helped find him a set of chambers at No. 1 Old Square. At this time, there was no formal legal education, and the only requirement for a person to be called to the Bar was for him to have eaten five dinners a term at Lincoln's Inn, and to have <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> sentence of a paper prepared for him by the steward. Thus, most of Murray's practical training came from reading the papers in Hamilton's chambers and listening to Lord Raymond speak in court, along with tutoring by Thomas Denison on how to write special pleadings. Murray also studied various texts, including the French Ordinance de la Marine (a predecessor to the Napoleonic Commercial Code), the works of Bracton and Littleton and [...] "crabbed and uncouth compositions" [...] on municipal law.|$|E
