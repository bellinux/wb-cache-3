40|$|The {{emanation}} of thoron (Rn/sup 220 /) from sintered UO/sub 2 / powders {{and plates}} was measured {{as a function}} of temperature. The uranium oxide samples were indexed with <b>radiothorium</b> by coprecipitation and coevaporation techniques. The emanation measurements were performed in a flow system, using an alpha scintillation detector and a helium-hydrogen carrier gas mixture. Both the <b>radiothorium</b> concentration (5 to 100 mu C/g UO/sub 2 /) and the uranium oxide density (71 to 99 percent TD) were varied. The surface areas and densities of the UO/sub 2 / plates were measured by krypton gas adsorption and liquid immersion techniques, respectively. Assuming a diffusion mechanism, diffusion coefficients for thoron in sintered UO/sub 2 / were calculated {{as a function of}} temperature. The data were represented by an equation of the form, D = D/sub O/ exp (-Q/RT). An apparent increase in both activation energy (Q) and D/sub O/ with density was observed for the 1100 to 1450 deg C temperature range. For some samples the thoron emanating power could be measured at temperatures as low as 400 deg C. Log D versus 1 /T plots from 400 to 1450 deg C gave intersecttng straight lines with different activation energies. One intersection occurred near the Tammann temperature. The emanation of Rn/sup 220 / from UO/sub 2 / apparently involves several types of diffusion processes. (auth...|$|E

40|$|A {{report of}} the direct {{observation}} of positrons ejected from lead by hard gamma-rays has been published. (1) A source of <b>radiothorium</b> with its disintegration products was used. To obtain a well-defined beam the gamma-rays were collimated {{by allowing them to}} pass through a half-inch hole in a series of lead blocks totaling 18 inches in length. That the beam actually was well defined is shown by {{the fact that most of}} the observed tracks appeared to originate within a rather narrow region, about 3 cm wide. In this series of photographs the beam passed vertically downward through the side wall of a Wilson chamber across which were placed a 2 mm lead sheet, and below this a 0. 5 mm sheet of aluminum. A magnetic field of 430 gauss normal to the face of the chamber and uniform to within 10 percent was used...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{research}} {{during the}} latter half of 2011 has indicated that significant and potentially hazardous radon concentrations can arise from radium-dial watches stored in the built environment. Radium (226 Ra) decays via alpha-particle emission to radon (222 Rn); in addition, mesothorium (228 Ra) and <b>radiothorium</b> (228 Th) were also used in such watches and decay to thoron (220 Rn). In the main experiments conducted to date, a set of radium-dial watches representative of a small private collection, was placed in a controlled access room, of volume 67 m 3, that is continuously ventilated to the external environment. Prior to placing the watches in the room, the radon level at the maximum ventilation rate was ca. 10 Bq/m 3. This rose to ca. 190 - 230 Bq/m 3 following the placing of the watches in the room, again under conditions of maximum ventilation. When the ventilation rate decreased to a ‘standby’ setting, the radon concentration increased rapidly to ca. 2 - 3 kBq/m 3, then decreased rapidly to the lower concentration when the ventilation rate returned to maximum. Extrapolation of results of monitoring a single watch under zero-ventilation conditions indicates that the zero-ventilation equilibrium concentration in the room arising from the set of watches exceeds 5 kBq/m 3 and Monte-Carlo simulation indicates this could exceed 10 kBq/m 3, both of which are greatly in excess of the UK Action Levels. Observation of such levels is largely unreported in the literature and our preliminary conclusion is that whilst collectors might be aware of the radiation hazard that arises directly from the radioactive material content of such watches, they are probably not aware of the large radon (and thoron) hazard that can arise, particularly if the watches are kept in a poorly ventilated room in a private house...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{geochemistry}} of thorium isotopes in the hydrosphere, particularly in the ocean, a method has been worked out by which Th- 232 (thorium) λ, Th- 230 (ionium), Th- 228 (<b>radiothorium),</b> and Th- 227 (radioactinium) can be determined separately. Eight samples of 20 to 40 litres of sea-water, from 23 · 0 % to 34 · 97 %, salinity, were collected in November 1953, in the Skagerak and the Gullmarfjord (Sweden). Thorium was isolated by the following procedure: just after collection, the samples were brought to pH 2 and a given amount of Th- 234 (UX 1) was added as tracer. Thorium was first precipitated with Fe(OH) 3 as carrier. Further purification was obtained by ion-exchange column chromatography followed by solvent extraction; the final fraction was obtained as the citric complex, a form suitable to incorporation in the photographic emulsion. The total yield varied from 8 to 23 % according to the sample, {{as determined by the}} β-activity of the tracer. The various thorium isotopes were measured through their α-activity, using nuclear photographic emulsions, more precisely the double-emulsion technique. RdTh and RdAc both generate five-branched stars; more than 90 % of these originated from RdTh, as indicated by the length of the tracks: while Io and Th only yield single tracks of range 18 · 8 μ and 15 μ respectively in the emulsion. Most samples showed a much lower activity than expected; this did not make it possible to discriminate between Io and Th through the range distribution of their tracks, thus we could only ascertain upper limits of Io and Th concentrations. Average concentrations corresponding to a total volume of 140 litres of water are as follows (in grams per ml) : RdTh = (4. 0 ± 1. 4). 10 - 21 Th 4. We can only account for this surprising result by supposing that the excess RdTh results from an excess of its parent MsTh, (Ra- 228) brought in by rivers or redissolved from the sediments. Owing to the short half-life of both these nuclides, such a RdTh excess should be found only {{in the vicinity of the}} shore or the bottom. 4. (4) RRdAc/U- 235 < 0 · 1. More than 90 % of the RdAc from U- 235 in the ocean cannot be accounted for. Considering the short half-life of RdAc, this suggests that actinium or protactinium are precipitated with the sediments together with the Io. 5. (5) In both U- 238 and Th- 232 families, a radium isotope (Ra and MsTh) appears to be in excess over its parent thorium-isotope (Io and Th). The presence in the ocean of unsupported Ra(T = 1600 years) and MsTh (T = 6 · 7 years) is of great interest. A study of the distribution of these isotopes should yield valuable data on their diffusion rates and on deep currents. As far as radioactive geochemistry is concerned, the ocean is characterized by extremely low concentrations of nuclides of all three radioactive families and by the total disruption of the radioactive equilibrium in these families. A calculation of the geochemical balance of radioactive elements in the hydrosphere from the above data is given in the last part of the paper. © 1957.
