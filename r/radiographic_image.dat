25|$|X-rays {{with high}} photon {{energies}} (above 5–10 keV, below 0.2–0.1nm wavelength) are called hard X-rays, while those with lower energy are called soft X-rays. Due to their penetrating ability, hard X-rays {{are widely used}} to image the inside of objects, e.g., in medical radiography and airport security. The term X-ray is metonymically {{used to refer to}} a <b>radiographic</b> <b>image</b> produced using this method, in addition to the method itself. Since the wavelengths of hard X-rays are similar to the size of atoms they are also useful for determining crystal structures by X-ray crystallography. By contrast, soft X-rays are easily absorbed in air; the attenuation length of 600 eV (~2nm) X-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.|$|E

The exchange of <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> and electronic patient health information/records (ePHI/R) for diagnostic purposes has the risk of confidentiality, ownership identity, and authenticity. In this paper, a data hiding technique for ePHI/R is proposed. The color information in the cover image is used for key generation, and stego-images are produced with ideal case. As a result, the whole stego-system is perfectly secure. This method includes the features of watermarking and steganography techniques. The method is applied to <b>radiographic</b> <b>images.</b> For the <b>radiographic</b> <b>images,</b> this method resembles watermarking, which is an ePHI/R data system. Experiments show promising results for the application of this method to <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> in ePHI/R for both transmission and storage purpose...|$|R

It is based on Chan-Vese model, curve evolution, partial differential equations and binary level sets method. The proposed model uses the piecewise constant approximation of Chan-Vese model to compute Signed Pressure Force (SPF) function, this one attracts the curve to the true object(s) ’s boundaries. The implemented model is used to extract weld defects from weld <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> in the aim to calculate the perimeter and surfaces of those weld defects.

Several regions were investigated in parts as Master’s theses to prepare teaching modules to supplement self-directed learning of several regions, i. e., the brain, the heart, the pelvic floor, and knee vascularization [1 – 4]. A comparison of <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> with corresponding tissue slices and three-dimensional (3 D) reconstructions of CT scans, {{as well as the}} dissection of corresponding anatomic areas, allows a transposition and interpretation of <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> by comparison of virtual images with the real anatomic structures...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{inspection}} ofweldedmaterials {{is important}} in relation to achieve acceptable standards. Radiography, a non-destructive test method, is commonly {{used to evaluate the}} internal condition ofa material with respect to defect detection. Thepresence ofnoise in low resolution ofradiographic images significantly complicates analysis; therefore attaining higher quality <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> makes defect detection more readily achievable. This paper presents a study pertaining to the quality enhancement of <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> with respect to different types of defects. A series of digital <b>radiographic</b> weld flaw <b>images</b> were smoothed using multiple smoothing techniques to remove inherent noise followed by top and bottom hat morphological transformations. Image quality was evaluated quantitatively with respect to SNR, PSNR andMAE. The results indicate that smoothing enhances the quality ofradiographic images, thereby promoting defect detection with the respect to original <b>radiographic</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

The primary objective of the study involved the identification and quantification of systematic errors associated with the measurement of sacral obliquity on <b>radiographic</b> <b>images.</b> A secondary objective was to provide an estimate of true sacral obliquity derived from measurements made on <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> of the spine that culd {{be used in a}} clinical setting to correct or reduce frontal plane obliquity. Methods used in the study included graphical, radiographic and mathematical models. They were used to evaluate the measurement of dihedral angles such as structural asymmetry of the sacral base and vertebral endplates in the frontal plane. A <b>radiographic</b> phantom was <b>imaged</b> using plain film, CT, and slot scan (scout) views. The variation of measurements using different views was compared to the known sacral obliquity value of the phantom. Results obtained from the studies demonstrate that different radiographic and analytical methods produced significant differences in the measurements of sacral obliquity for each of the imaging modalities and analytical methods. The study developed, tested and validated algorithms to calculate true dihedral angles from angles measured on <b>radiographic</b> <b>images.</b> The algorithms were designed to be employed when the protocols developed to ensure reliable measurement of angular relationships were not met or were unable to be adhered to. The measurement of sacral obliquity on <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> was used in the development of algorithms to calculate the amount of correction needed to level the sacral base in upright standing and sitting postures. Trigonometric techniques were developed and applied to measurements of sacral obliquity obtained from <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> of the erect spine to provide accurate dimensions of ischial or foot orthotics that would be required to level the sacral base in sitting or standing posture respectively.

5000|$|The [...] "static" [...] {{image is}} similar to the {{conventional}} <b>radiographic</b> <b>image</b> in most cases; however, there could be a significant difference if the studied object is moving. In this case, the [...] "static" [...] image is less affected by the motion noise than the ordinary calculated <b>radiographic</b> <b>image.</b> The reason is that the E(D) values are calculated by averaging the series of attenuation values computed from the corresponding series of photon numbers (from the underexposed images) and converted into a logarithm. On the other hand, the attenuation values of common radiographs are calculated from a single summed up photon number converted into a logarithm. Averaging and converting the attenuation values into logarithms are possible only if the attenuation does not vary over time. Thus, for relatively small variances, the difference is small but for large variances, the difference is significant.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{automatic}} registration-fusion scheme {{based on}} similarity measures is proposed in this paper. It utilises the geometrical configuration between the X-ray source, the CCD sensor and the target tissue using the appropriate geometric transformations, {{as well as the}} calculation of similarity measures between two dental <b>radiographic</b> <b>images</b> to be registered. Moreover, a fusion process has been developed to combine information from registered dental images. Result on clinical data reveals the advantageous performance of the proposed automatic registration method compared to the manual one using an independent evaluation criterion such as the mutual information criterion. Furthermore, the automatic registration approach outperforms despite the fuzzy dental boundaries and the lack of characteristic edges of the <b>radiographic</b> <b>images.</b> These preliminary findings may be used in order to establish the use of the proposed automatic method relieving the expert from the tedious and time-consuming task of defining analogous markers between the two <b>radiographic</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

50|$|Differentiating an enchondroma from a bone infarct on plain film may be difficult. Generally, an enchondroma {{commonly}} causes endosteal scalloping {{while an}} infarct will not. An infarct usually has a well-defined, sclerotic serpentine border, while an enchondroma will not. When differentiating an enchondroma from a chondrosarcoma, the <b>radiographic</b> <b>image</b> may be equivocal; however, periostitis {{is not usually}} seen with an uncomplicated enchondroma.|$|E

50|$|Triplane {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} at the epiphyseal plate of the tibia in early adolescence with {{involvement of the}} epiphysis and metaphysis of the tibia. The link presents two types of imaging. The first four images (figures 1-4) are radiographic images while the last 3 are CT scans of the left distal tibia and fibula. The first <b>radiographic</b> <b>image</b> is an anterior-posterior view of the distal third of the left tibia and fibula. The image presents a fracture of the distal epiphyseal plate of the tibia and fibula. The primary imaging (radiograph) identifies the abnormality in the anatomy of subject’s left distal tibia and fibula. However, {{it is difficult to}} view the extent of the fracture and classify the fracture based on <b>radiographic</b> <b>image.</b> Figure four is a CT scan of the posterior aspect of the left distal tibia and fibula. Note that in this image the extent of the fracture is more visible extending to the epiphysis and metaphysis. The type of fracture is a Salter-Harris type IV. The CT scan was an appropriate choice of advance imaging which helps clinicians determine the extent of the fracture and enable us to address the problem appropriately.|$|E
