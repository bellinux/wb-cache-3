50|$|This {{process is}} very similar to {{phytoextraction}} in that it removes contaminants by trapping them into harvestable plant biomass. Both phytoextraction and <b>rhizofiltration</b> follow the same basic path to remediation. First, plants are put in contact with the contamination. They absorb contaminants through their root systems and store them in root biomass and/or transport them up into the stems and/or leaves. The plants continue to absorb contaminants until they are harvested. The plants are then replaced to continue the growth/harvest cycle until satisfactory levels of contaminant are achieved. Both processes are also aimed more toward concentrating and precipitating heavy metals than organic contaminants. The major difference between <b>rhizofiltration</b> and phytoextraction is that <b>rhizofiltration</b> is used for treatment in aquatic environments, while phytoextraction deals with soil remediation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rhizofiltration</b> {{is a type}} of phytoremediation, {{which refers}} to the {{approach}} of using hydroponically cultivated plant roots to remediate contaminated water through absorption, concentration, and precipitation of pollutants. It also filters through water and dirt.|$|E
50|$|This {{treatment}} method has its limits. Any contaminant that {{is below the}} rooting depth will not be extracted. The plants used {{may not be able}} to grow in highly contaminated areas. Most importantly, it can take years to reach regulatory levels. This results in long-term maintenance. Also, most contaminated sites are polluted with many different kinds of contaminants. There can be a combination of metals and organics, in which treatment through <b>rhizofiltration</b> will not suffice.Plants grown on polluted water and soils become a potential threat to human and animal health, and therefore, careful attention must be paid to the harvesting process and only non-fodder crop should be chosen for the <b>rhizofiltration</b> remediation method.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rhizofiltration</b> is {{cost-effective}} {{for large}} volumes of water having low concentrations of contaminants that are subjected to stringent standards. It is relatively inexpensive, yet potentially more effective than comparable technologies. The removal of radionuclides from water using sunflowers was estimated to cost between $2 and $6 per thousand gallons of water treated, including waste disposal and capital costs.|$|E
50|$|The most {{promising}} plants for <b>rhizofiltration</b> are sunflowers. They {{are able to}} remove up to 95% of uranium of contaminated water in 24 hours, and experiments in Chernobyl have demonstrated that they can concentrate on 55 kg of plant dry weight all the cesium and strontium radioactivity from an area of 75 m2 (stabilized material suitable for transfer to a nuclear waste repository).|$|E
50|$|Sunflowers {{can be used}} in {{phytoremediation}} {{to extract}} toxic ingredients from soil, such as lead, arsenic and uranium, and used in <b>rhizofiltration</b> to neutralize radionuclides and other toxic ingredients and harmful bacteria from water.

It is the most efficient strategy for bioremediation technologies in wetlands, but must have a continuous and rigorous control of pH to make it an optimal process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rhizofiltration</b> is a {{treatment}} method {{that may be}} conducted in situ, with plants being grown directly in the contaminated water body. This allows for a relatively inexpensive procedure with low capital costs. Operation costs are also low but depend {{on the type of}} contaminant. This treatment method is also aesthetically pleasing and results in a decrease of water infiltration and leaching of contaminants.After harvesting, the crop may be converted to biofuel briquette, a substitute for fossil fuel.|$|E
5000|$|Bioremediation {{is a waste}} {{management}} technique that {{involves the use of}} organisms to neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. According to the United States EPA, bioremediation is a [...] "treatment that uses naturally occurring organisms to break down hazardous substances into less toxic or non toxic substances". Technologies can be generally classified as in situ or ex situ. In situ bioremediation involves treating the contaminated material at the site, while ex situ involves the removal of the contaminated material to be treated elsewhere. Some examples of bioremediation related technologies are phytoremediation, bioventing, bioleaching, landfarming, bioreactor, composting, bioaugmentation, <b>rhizofiltration,</b> and biostimulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rhizofiltration</b> may be {{applicable}} {{to the treatment of}} surface water and groundwater, industrial and residential effluents, downwashes from power lines, storm waters, acid mine drainage, agricultural runoffs, diluted sludges, and radionuclide-contaminated solutions.Plants suitable for <b>rhizofiltration</b> applications can efficiently remove toxic metals from a solution using rapid-growth root systems. Various terrestrial plant species have been found to effectively remove toxic metals such as Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr6+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ from aqueous solutions. It was also found that low level radioactive contaminants can successfully be removed from liquid streams. A system to achieve this can consist of a “feeder layer” of soil suspended above a contaminated stream through which plants grow, extending the bulk of their roots into the water. The feeder layer allows the plants to receive fertilizer without contaminating the stream, while simultaneously removing heavy metals from the water. Trees have also been applied to remediation. Trees are the lowest cost plant type. They can grow on land of marginal quality and have long life-spans. This results in little or no maintenance costs. The most commonly used are willows and poplars, which can grow 6 - 8’ per year and have a high flood tolerance. For deep contamination, hybrid poplars with roots extending 30 feet deep have been used. Their roots penetrate microscopic scale pores in the soil matrix and can cycle 100 L of water per day per tree. These trees act almost like a pump and treat remediation system.|$|E
40|$|Phytoremediation {{has been}} defined as the use of green plants and their {{associated}} rhizospheric microorganisms to remove, degrade, or contain contaminants located in soisl, sediments, groundwater, surface water, and even the atmosphere. Categories of phytoremediation include - phytoextraction or phytoaccumulation, phytotransformation, phytostimulation or plant-assisted bioremediation, phytovolatilization, <b>rhizofiltration,</b> pump and tree, phytostabilization, and hydraulic control. Phytoremediation of heavy metal contaminated soils basically includes phytostabilization, phytoextraction, <b>rhizofiltration</b> and phytovolatilization.

30|$|It {{signifies the}} removal of {{pollutants}} from the environment {{by the use of}} plants. The technology involves different mechanisms, viz. phytoextraction, <b>rhizofiltration,</b> phytostabilization, phytotransformation/phytodegradation (Rai 2009). Phytoextraction involves metal accumulation into the harvestable parts of the roots and the above ground shoot. <b>Rhizofiltration</b> indicates the absorption, precipitation and concentration of toxic metals from polluted effluents. Phytostabilization is a process in which mobility of heavy metals is reduced through the use of tolerant plants, whereas phytotransformation/phytodegradation is the process in which contaminants can be eliminated via phytodegradation or phytotransformation by plant enzymes or enzyme co-factors.|$|E
40|$|The macrophytes {{have the}} ability accumulating {{multiple}} metals/metalloids species from the terrestrial and aquatic environments. The environmental-friendly phytoremediation technologies via these plant species have been applied for non-degradable pollutants removal. The macrophytes derived <b>rhizofiltration</b> is a major and efficient technology for metals/metalloids removal, especially in aquatic environments (e. g. wetland). Comparing with the common metals/metalloids often studied, aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration</b> via macrophytes has been just considered recently. In this study, the field investigation in a U tailing basin wetland showed that the <b>rhizofiltration</b> was crucial for aquatic U retention via Phragmites australis Trin ex Steud. (water to root bioconcentration factor (BCF) : 670 to 1556). The aquatic U retention efficiency in aboveground biomass of P. australis was insufficient (BCF: 0. 4 to 5. 3), comparing with the <b>rhizofiltration.</b> However, the high productivity (1. 2 to 1. 9 kg•m- 2 per growing season) of P. australis still resulted in a notable yearly U accumulation in the areal total aboveground biomass (0. 04 to 0. 35 mg•m- 2 per growing season). It was potentially promoted by the enhanced aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration.</b> The U within aboveground biomass could be released to submerse soil with the degradable or recalcitrant fallen litters. It enhanced the organic carbon supply in rhizosphere together with the root litter, and potential water to root U translocation within mobilized organic compounds. Hence the <b>rhizofiltration</b> stood in the crucial position of the plant-litter-water-soil U recycling in aquatic environment. The results from field investigation and mesocosm experiment further suggested that the Fe plaque (IP) on root surface was crucial for aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration.</b> The IP contained most of root retained U in both environments (proportion of U within IP: 55. 8 to 82. 6 % in field and 66. 7 to 86. 0 % in mesocosm). However, the efficiency of IP assisted aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration</b> was affected by the redox state gradient (- 179 to 220 mV) related redox processes. Field investigation suggested that high content of dissolved oxygen (up to 8. 2 mg•l- 1) was capable to rapidly oxidize soluble Fe(II) as sparingly soluble Fe(III) oxides precipitated in subhydric soil. It consequently limited the aquatic Fe availability for root uptake and precipitation as IP. However, the strong oxidation ability also relatively increased aquatic U(VI) availability incorporated with inorganics and degradable organic matters. It was adverse for controlling the aquatic U concentration (66. 7 to 92. 0 μg•l- 1 in field). On the other hand, it also benefited the U uptake by inner root tissue and upward translocation to aboveground biomass of P. australis. The different inorganic N species also significantly influenced IP assisted aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration.</b> The aquatic NH 4 + sustained the reduction and acidification (via nitirification) potential for Fe(III) and U(VI) bioreduction in rhizosphere (- 87 to 21 mV in NH 4 + cultured mesocosm pots). It improved the root uptake (mainly within IP) of Fe and U (2992. 9 to 5010. 7 mg•kg- 1 Fe and 45. 7 to 62. 8 mg•kg- 1 U in NH 4 + cultured root). On the contrary, the NO 3 - depended strong oxidation ability (23 to 224 mV in NO 3 - cultured mesocosm pots) inhibited the IP formation and the related aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration</b> efficiency (1568. 5 to 2569. 5 mg•kg- 1 Fe and 26. 2 to 49. 6 mg•kg- 1 U in NO 3 - cultured root). The aquatic U availability in rhizosphere was also increased via NO 3 - depended oxidation processes (aquatic U concentration in mesocosm: 1. 6 to 589. 3 μg•L- 1 (NO 3 -) vs. 1. 4 to 58. 2 μg•L- 1 (NH 4 +)). The sufficient nitrogen supply is also a significant driving force for high biomass productivity of P. australis. The higher biomass of P. australis increased the U accumulation capacity for root and aboveground tissues. The nitrogen related high biomass accumulation of P. australis also potentially enhanced the share of organic bound U in subhydric soil via plant litters supply. The IP assisted aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration</b> was also affected by the co-existing metals/metalloids in rhizosphere. The field investigation indicated that high As availability (aquatic As/U ratio: 0. 7 to 1. 6) inhibited the U retention within IP through the competitive absorption, due to its high affinity to IP. The Ca improved the aquatic U(VI) availability by forming the soluble Ca-uranyl-carbonate compounds. The Ca also potentially competed with hydrated Fe(III) oxides within IP by incorporating with U and encourage the U retention within inner root tissue. The P was beneficial for U retention within IP possibly in form of U-Fe-phosphate complexes. However, it was {{still need to be}} proofed in further studies. Despite of the biogeochemical conditions in rhizosphere, the aboveground transpiration of P. australis also affected the IP formation and related aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration.</b> The higher transpiration rate (TR) of P. australis (3. 3 ± 1. 2 mm•d- 1 in field, 4. 5 ± 2. 0 mm•d- 1 (NH 4 +) / 5. 0 ± 2. 2 mm•d- 1 (NO 3 -) in mesocosm) increased the aquatic nutrient/non-essential elements availability for root uptake. For this reason, the aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration</b> of P. australis (21. 8 ± 3. 1 mg•kg- 1 in field, 62. 1 ± 1. 0 mg•kg- 1 (NH 4 +) / 47. 6 ± 1. 8 mg•kg- 1 (NO 3 -) in mesocosm) was enhanced under higher TR. The higher TR also promoted the formation of IP and its U retention capacity. Furthermore, the U translocation from root to above ground biomass (mainly in leaves) of P. australis was also enhanced under higher TR. It was potentially benefited by the increased transpirational pull and root uptake of other active mediator (e. g. Ca). The effect of transpiration was also coupled with the different N species on IP assisted aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration.</b> The higher TR depended strong root uptake and assimilation of N increased the biomass accumulation of P. australis. Furthermore, the higher TR also potentially increased the share of root in biomass partition of P. australis. Consequently, the stronger transpiration resulted in the higher aquatic U accumulation in area related root biomass (up to 84. 0 ± 3. 6 mg•m- 2 (NH 4 +) and 86. 4 ± 5. 8 mg•m- 2 (NO 3 -) U per season in mesocosm). In conclusion, it was possible for eutrophic P. australis stands to retain the aquatic U via <b>rhizofiltration.</b> The IP on root surface was a crucial mediator contributing the aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration,</b> especially in iron rich milieu. The efficiency of IP assisted aquatic U <b>rhizofiltration</b> could be further improved under suitable environmental conditions. In this study, these conditions might include: i) reductive rhizosphere environment with active reducers (e. g. NH 4 +) encouraging Fe(II) generation for IP formation and U retention within it; ii) limited competitive elements (e. g. As and Ca) co-existed with Fe and U in rhizosphere; iii) sufficient nutrients (e. g. N) supply and related high biomass productivity of plant; iv) strong transpiration effect improved the nutrient assimilation of root and also the aquatic U/Fe availability for root uptake. By adjusting these conditions (also include other potential factors not discussed in this study), an effective <b>rhizofiltration</b> technology was supposed to be applied for aquatic U removal...|$|E

The metal contaminant extraction along with plant growth and water uptake rates from a wastewater having varying Pb concentration is studied experimentally for 2 wk. The temporal distribution of the metal concentration in the wastewater and the accumulated metal in different compartments of C. pendula at the end are analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometry. Parameters of the metal uptake kinetics are deduced experimentally for predicting the metal removal by root biomass. Further, mass balance equations coupled with the characterized metal uptake kinetics are used for simulating the metal partitioning from the wastewater to its accumulation in the plant biomass. The simulated metal content in wastewater and plant biomass is compared with the observed data showing a good agreement with the later. Results show that C. pendula accumulates considerable amounts of lead, particularly in root biomass, and can be considered for the cleanup of lead contaminated wastewaters in combination with proper biomass disposal alternatives.

Higher Cu concentration in BME or subsequent repetitions of treatment cycle must be tested to achieve at least 1000 mg Cu kg− 1 DW in roots (threshold value for Cu-ecocatalyst) whereas the biofilm role must deserve more attention...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{elaboration}} of novel bio-sourced ecocatalysts for the Ullmann coupling reaction. Ecocatalysis {{is based on the}} recycling of metals issued from phytoremediation or rehabilitation, and an innovative chemical valorization of the subsequent biomass in the field of catalysis. Here, we describe efficient copper accumulation by plants via phytoextraction and <b>rhizofiltration.</b> These phytotechnologies were revisited to demonstrate a novel potential of these natural resources for green chemistry. Taking advantage of the remarkable ability of the selected plants to accumulate Cu(ii) species into their roots or leaves, the latter can be directly used for the preparation of ecocatalysts, called Eco-Cu®. The formed Eco-Cu® catalysts are thoroughly characterized via ICP-MS, IR studies of pyridine sorption/desorption, TEM, XRD, SM and model reactions, in order to elucidate the chemical composition and catalytic activity of these new materials. Significant differences of properties and activities were observed between Eco-Cu® and conventional Cu catalysts. Eco-Cu® are highly active catalysts in Ullmann coupling reactions with lower Cu quantities compared to known copper catalysts. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Presence {{of heavy}} metals and other {{pollutants}} in the aquatic systems {{has become a}} serious problem {{in many developing countries}} for environmental scientists and also for agencies engaged in environmental production. In this regard, there has {{been a great deal of}} attention given to new technologies for removal of heavy metals from contaminated water because conventional technologies to provide safe and clean water to living beings are not so far implemented. In this manner, the use of plants to remove heavy metals and other pollutants known as “phytoremediation ” from the water is relatively cheaper as compared to other expensive engineering operations as plants remove pollutants from water and render them harmless. Five main subgroups of phytoremediation have been identified by the environmental scientists as “Phytoextraction, Phytodegradation, <b>Rhizofiltration,</b> Phytostabilisation and Phytovolatilisation”. The identification and selection of plants that are suitable for successful remediation of water pollution is a matter of great concern. It is recommended that plants that have long and extensive root system should be planted at sites which are polluted due to industrial and sewage water...|$|E
40|$|Bioremediation is an ecologically {{sound and}} {{state-of-the-art}} technique that employs natural biological processes to completely eliminate toxic contaminants. Any process that uses microorganisms, fungi, green plants or their enzymes {{to return the}} natural environment altered by contaminants to its original condition. Bioremediation technologies can be generally classified as in situ or ex situ. In situ bioremediation involves treating the contaminated material at the site while ex situ involves {{the removal of the}} contaminated material to be treated elsewhere. Some examples of bioremediation technologies are bioventing, land farming, bioreactor, compositing, bioaugmentation, <b>rhizofiltration,</b> and bio-stimulation. Microorganisms which perform the function of bioremediation is known as bioremediators. Not all contaminants, however, are easily treated by bioremediation using microorganisms. For example, heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are not easily absorbed or captured by organisms. The assimilation of metals such as mercury into the food chain may worsen matters. This manuscript gives an idea of what is bioremediation, principles of bioremediation, factors of bioremediation strategies, types, genetic engineering approaches, monitoring bioremediation and advantages or disadvantages of bioremediation...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2015. Major: Earth Sciences. Advisor: Emi Ito. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvi, 94 pages. Mercury (Hg) is a naturally occurring element {{that can be}} taken up by microbes, converted into toxic, organic methylmercury (MeHg), and exported into surrounding sediment. The MeHg can then be taken up by plants through <b>rhizofiltration.</b> In Minnesota, 2 - 4 million lbs of Wild Rice is harvested each year and 1 lb yield 10. 5 cups of rice. This study involves sampling surface water, surface sediment, and wild rice grains from 6 lakes on the White Earth Reservation, Fond du Lac Reservation, and 1854 Treaty Area in Minnesota. This was done in order to assess a possible toxicity risk from the consumption of Wild Rice. Finished and unfinished rice grains were analyzed, and all samples were consistent for the six lakes. Using a chronic exposure formula and the highest THg and MeHg concentrations in finished rice grains, it was determined that the toxicity in wild rice grains in Minnesota is extremely low...|$|E
