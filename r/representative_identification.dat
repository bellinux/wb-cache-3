40|$|The {{auditory}} {{system has}} two primary functions: identification and {{localization of sound}} sources. A major cue for determining the location of low-frequency sounds is the interaural time difference (ITD) created by the unequal path lengths that a sound must travel to reach each ear. This dissertation examined how ITDs are coded in the inferior colliculus (IC) of the unanesthetized rabbit. ^ The basic anatomy and physiology of the IC have been well characterized. Counter to physiological and structural evidence for integration, a common assumption is that separate populations of neurons exist to code identification and localization cues. The coding of identification cues and localization cues are often studied separately. Here, amplitude modulation, a <b>representative</b> <b>identification</b> cue, was combined with ITDs. Neurons were able to simultaneously code modulation and ITDs. Modulation had a graded effect on firing rate from extreme enhancement to extreme suppression. Mechanisms to explain these effects were then studied. Physical differences in the modulated and unmodulated signals, including the interaural correlation, energy, and spectrum did not provide clear answers. Subsequently, the convergence of monaural and binaural inputs on single cells was tested by adding modulation to each ear separately. The results were consistent with adaptive mechanisms. The population of ITD-sensitive neurons differentially codes modulation by independently decreasing and increasing their firing rate to modulation while leaving ITD tuning unaffected. ^ Also addressed was the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory projections to the IC. The role of GABAergic inhibition in sharpening ITD tuning curves in the IC was studied using iontophoresis. The most salient effect GABA-antagonists was to substantially increase discharge rate. Blocking GABA caused the ITD tuning curves of many neurons to broaden. Therefore, GABA may keep a neuron at its optimal activity level, improving the signal-to-noise ratio and sharpening ITD tuning curves. Functionally, sharper ITD tuning curves may require fewer neurons to achieve a given level of acuity. ^ In summary, common neural mechanisms used to process a natural environment were explored. The structure of the IC and its place an obligatory stop in the auditory pathway make it an ideal nucleus for transforming the neural code. ...|$|E

40|$|The Torlesse {{composite}} terrane is {{an important}} geological unit in Canterbury, New Zealand, making up {{the backbone of the}} Southern Alps. It consists of a large group of rock that exhibits a range of engineering geological conditions. This study has been undertaken to characterise the range in engineering geological conditions throughout the Torlesse of Canterbury in order to develop a rock mass classification scheme specific to this abundant and complex rock type. The classification is aimed to aid in TBM tunnelling assessment in the Torlesse, which enables sub-division of an area or tunnel alignment into rock mass domains. Furthermore the classification enables the prediction of rock masses through geological controls in areas of poor outcrop coverage. Four sites throughout Canterbury were selected for mapping to represent Torlesse terrane types, metamorphic facies and a range of regional fault settings: the Elliott Fault, Hurunui River, Ashley River Gorge and Opuha Dam. A preliminary desktop study was carried out with a landscape lineation analysis to develop 1) a conceptual geological model at each study site and 2) field mapping sheets to provide a check list to ensure consistency of information collected between outcrops and sites. Lineations and conceptual models identified a series of structural blocks within sites, which were further validated by field mapping. Outcrop field mapping was carried out across selected extents of study sites using the field sheets from the desktop study. Using NZGS (2005) and ISRM (1978) derived parameters, rock mass characteristics, including lithology and defect information, were recorded on the field sheets. A laboratory testing programme on selected outcrop intact rock was undertaken to support field work and later classification development. Data from field work was plotted to derive rock mass trends. Trends were used to develop a classification framework. It was found the rock mass could be defined by bedding thickness, degree of fracture and the combination of discontinuities such as persistent jointing and shearing, which defined dominant rock mass control. The rock mass could therefore be classified based on: blockiness, defined by bedding thickness and density of non-systematic jointing (fractures); and defect structure, defined by the combination of systematic discontinuities such as persistent jointing and shearing. The two principle rock mass governing controls were related together on an XY plot to form the conceptual Torlesse rock mass classification (TRC). Six classes encompassing the range of conditions observed in the Torlesse were devised for blockiness and defect structure. Blockiness classes range from: thickly bedded to massive sandstone with slight to moderate fracture, to very thin to thin bedded sandstone that is fragmented. Defect structure classes range from rock masses defined by: dominant systematic, persistent jointing with rare faulting, to rock masses typical of major shear zones, where material geotechnically behaves as a soil with no principle defect sets. Individual outcrop plotting then allowed rock masses typical of each site to be grouped on the TRC. Clusters of each study sitesâ€™ outcrops were overlaid to characterise all rock mass types observed throughout this research. This allowed <b>representative</b> <b>identification</b> of eight distinctive rock mass types (Types 1 - 8) that are indicative of the Torlesse composite terrane of Canterbury. Each type has a series of geological controls that influence the nature of the rock mass. Geological controls can aid in the prediction of rock mass conditions for tunnel alignment selection. Lithostructure and proximity to major structures were defined as major rock mass type controls. Lithostructure defines the effect of lithology on bedding thickness and fracturing by non-systematic jointing. Medium to massive bedding as part of rock mass Types 1 and 2 result in the best rock mass. In the sandstone-rich rock mass, systematic jointing dominates with less shearing and faulting and a lower occurrence of short, discrete, non-systematic jointing. Conversely, the thinly bedded Torlesse represented by rock mass Type 5 lacks persistent jointing. This type, being mudstone dominant, fractures more easily, is characterised by short, discrete jointing, and tends to localise faulting, shearing and some folding. Modern tectonic stress fields are also a major control. The size of the tectonic structure can impact different volumes of rock. Rock outside the direct fault zone can also be impacted giving rise to rock mass Type 6. For example, increased levels of shearing are observed in adjacent rock at both the Elliott and Opuha Dam Faults. Rock mass Types 7 and 8 represent the rock masses directly affected by large tectonic structures. Sub-dividing proposed tunnel alignments by rock mass type allows assessment of tunnelling parameters. Dependant on project specific rock mass types expected, different TBM design will be suited. This has significant implications on support measures. Open gripper TBMâ€™s are likely to be suited to rock mass Types 1 and 2. This rock mass is expected to represent the best rock mass stability but will be the hardest to excavate. As a result, rock bolt, mesh and shotcrete will likely prevent significant block failure through gravity release. Rock mass Types 3 and 4 are expected to represent a favourably interlocked rock mass, resulting in increased penetration rate but whose advance rate is likely to be hindered by the need for more extensive support. As rock mass Types 5 - 8 increase in abundance, shielded TBMâ€™s will likely be best suited due to questionable thrust generation and support requirements toward the poorer rock masses. Penetration rates will be high but advance rates are expected to be low. Significant potential for failure exists in the poorer rock mass types without adequate support, including running ground. The selection of a shielded or gripper TBM will depend on the proportion and lengths of each TRC rock mass type anticipated along a tunnel alignment. The opportunity exists for future work to refine and validate the TRC classification through increased data input, more extensive laboratory testing and its application to tunnelling projects. Furthermore it is hoped the TRC can be used for other types of geotechnical applications, at a variety of scales where Torlesse is concerned. To do this the TRC interpretations with respect to rock mass behaviour must be adapted to different scales...|$|E

The bigger islands or island groups and the Asian mainland certainly deserve their own keys to facilitate the identification process...|$|R
40|$|The locusta species - Locusta migratoria and Schistocerca gregaria - are {{responsible}} for the cyclic devastating hopper bands and swarm in many parts of Africa up to the Eurasian region. Present day locust swarms can be predicted but still most accurate control is based on post outbreak insecticide treatment resulting in high risks for resistancedevelopment and major pollution concerns. Hitherto the need for sustainable alternative bio-control agents, though more expensive, become realistic. Such biological control agent most probably will be entomopathogen based. However, for optimal efficacy of such approach, the innateimmune system of the locust needs to be turned down or at least be compromised. We believe that cytokines are important physiological player inthe locust cellular immune system. It is because the cellular immune system of the locust needs cytokines to keep up with high speed multiplication of hemocytes that are needed either for phagocytosis, encapsulationor nodula formation. Therefore, we will carry out the following research activities in the next four years. i) Since no locust cell line is available today, we start the development of a locust derived cell line from hemocyte progenitor cells (blood stem cells). This will result in a cell line that is most <b>representative</b> for the <b>identification</b> of cytokines involved in the innate immune response. As a suitable alternative approach, we will also consider developing an embryo derived stable cell line. ii) We will do in vivo and in vitro identification of importantcytokines in the locust innate immune system, the cellular immune system in particular. iii) We will target encoding mRNA of the identified cytokines for degradation by RNA interference and study the locust response towards immunological challenges with locust specific pathogens, i. e. bacteria (gram positive and negative), fungi and nematods.
