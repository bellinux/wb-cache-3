5|$|<b>Residential</b> <b>land</b> {{makes up}} more than 50,000 acres, or one fifth, of Juniata County's area. The bulk of <b>residential</b> <b>land</b> is single-family dwellings, but {{seasonal}} homes and mobile homes also make up significant portions of it. The county's <b>residential</b> <b>land</b> is concentrated along in its boroughs, but occurs along roads and in villages throughout the county. Multi-family <b>residential</b> <b>land</b> is comparatively rare. Less than 1% of the county's land (430 acres) is used for manufacturing purposes. Only approximately 370 acres are used for transportation and utilities. Roughly 300 acres are used for transportation and communication and 70 acres are used for other utilities. Businesses make up 0.21% of the county's land, or 525 acres. 490 acres are devoted to retail businesses, while 35 acres are devoted to wholesale businesses. Services occupy 0.67% of the county's area.|$|E
5|$|On average, the {{population}} of Canberra {{increased by more than}} 50% every five years between 1955 and 1975 as the development of the capital became more concerted. To accommodate the influx of residents, the NCDC oversaw the release of new <b>residential</b> <b>land</b> though the creation of new town centres: Woden opened in 1964, followed by Belconnen in 1966, Weston Creek in 1969 and Tuggeranong in 1973. The NCDC was disbanded in 1988, its planning authority transferred to the newly created ACT government and the new National Capital Authority, which was established to oversee Commonwealth interests in development of the national capital. Canberra has continued to grow with the further release of <b>residential</b> <b>land</b> in Gungahlin in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The {{automobile}} {{is by far}} {{the dominant}} form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed <b>residential</b> <b>land.</b> In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.|$|E
5|$|This {{prompted}} {{the development of}} the Parliamentary Triangle, a core part of Griffin's design, and since then various buildings of national importance were constructed on the lakefront.

5|$|In {{response}} {{the residents}} formed the Vigilance Association {{with the intent}} of protecting their interests during the establishment of the new capital territory. Legal challenges to the resumption of the land were unsuccessful, but the Vigilance Association did win some concessions: the government agreed to pay for the improvements to the land, and did so at the value when the land was acquired; and the landowners gained the right of first refusal on their old properties when they were put up for lease. As of 2010 all <b>residential</b> <b>land</b> in the ACT is held on a 99-year crown lease.|$|E

The essence of “limited property house” is whether Chinese farmers have the ownership, right of disposition, and right of profitability of the <b>residential</b> <b>lands.</b> The emergence of “limited property house” is also a chance for China starting a new land system reform.

Other land uses include high-density <b>residential</b> <b>land</b> and downtown commercial land. Major roads in the watershed include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690.

Major roads in the stream's drainage basin include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. Mills and forges were built along the stream in the late 1700s and early 1800s. During the 19th century, there was a substantial coal and iron industry in the watershed. Several railroads were also built in the stream's vicinity. Numerous bridges, including the Harrison Avenue Bridge (which is on the National Register of Historic Places) have been built across the stream as well.
