40|$|Force Sensing Resistors (FSRs) are {{manufactured}} by sandwiching a Conductive Polymer Composite (CPC) between metal electrodes. The piezoresistive property of FSRs {{has been exploited}} to perform stress and strain measurements, but the rheological property of polymers has undermined the <b>repeatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> causing creep in the electrical resistance of FSRs. With the aim of understanding the creep phenomenon, the drift response of thirty two specimens of FSRs was studied using a statistical approach. Similarly, a theoretical model for the creep response was developed by combining the Burger’s rheological model with the equations for the quantum tunneling conduction through thin insulating films. The proposed model and the experimental observations showed that the sourcing voltage has a strong influence on the creep response; this observation—and the corresponding model—is an important contribution {{that has not been}} previously accounted. The phenomenon of sensitivity degradation was also studied. It was found that sensitivity degradation is a voltage-related phenomenon that can be avoided by choosing an appropriate sourcing voltage in the driving circuit. The models and experimental observations from this study are key aspects to enhance the <b>repeatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> and the accuracy of FSRs...|$|E

40|$|Body {{temperature}} (Tb) is {{a valuable}} parameter when assessing the physiological state of animals, but its widespread measurement is often constrained by methods that are invasive or require frequent recapture of animals. Alternatives based on automated remote sensing of peripheral Tb show promise, but {{little is known about}} their strengths and limitations. We measured peripheral Tb in great tits (Parus major L.) with subcutaneously implanted passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) and externally attached radio transmitters to determine <b>repeatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements,</b> sensitivity of each method to variation in ambient temperature (Ta) and wind speed, the relationship between methods, and their ability to capture circadian variation in Tb. <b>Repeatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> by radio transmitters was high (> 80 %) when readings were taken within 20 min, but reduced to 16 % when measures were spaced 3. 5 h apart.

Data were affected by Ta with a stronger effect on the externally attached transmitters, but the influence of wind speed was small for both methods. There was a significant positive relationship between transmitter- and PIT tag temperature during both days and nights [...] Both methods were equally suited to detect diel changes in peripheral Tb. However, transmitters offered longer detection distance and better temporal resolution. These qualities should be considered when deciding how to collect Tb data remotely.

To {{evaluate}} the <b>repeatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> central corneal thickness (CCT) by spectral domain optical coherence (SD-OCT) in premature infants {{and compare it}} to CCT measurement by ultrasonic pachymetry (USP).

40|$|Objective - To compare <b>repeatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of {{gastrointestinal}} tract motility in healthy dogs obtained {{by use of}} a wireless motility capsule (WMC) and scintigraphy. Animals - 6 healthy adult dogs (mean ± SD body weight, 21. 5 ± 1. 8 kg). Procedures - A radiolabeled test meal was offered immediately after oral administration of a WMC. Serial static scintigraphic abdominal images were acquired for 270 minutes. A dedicated remote receiver was used for data collection from the WMC until the WMC was expelled in the feces. Each dog was evaluated 3 times at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks. Results - Mean gastric emptying half-time measured by use of scintigraphy (T 1 / 2 -GES) for each dog ranged from 99. 9 to 181. 2 minutes. Mean gastric emptying time (GET) measured by use of the WMC (GET-WMC) in each dog ranged from 385. 3 to 669. 7 minutes. Mean coefficient of variation was 11. 8 % for T 1 / 2 -GES and 7. 8 % for GET-WMC. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 69 % for T 1 / 2 -GES and 71 % for GET-WMC. Results for a nested analysis of covariance suggested that both methods were comparable {{for the evaluation of}} gastric emptying. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Scintigraphy and a WMC system had similar variation for assessment of gastric emptying. Moderate intraindividual variability was detected for both methods and must be considered when interpreting test results for individual dogs. <b>Repeatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained by use of the WMC was equivalent to that obtained by use of scintigraphy.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{reliability}} of corneal topographic data {{through the development of}} a method to estimate the magnitude of misalignment between successive corneal videokeratography (VK) maps and eliminate the effect of misalignment on the repeatability of topography data. Anterior and posterior topography maps were recorded twice for 124 healthy eyes of 124 participants using a Pentacam, and the <b>repeatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> was assessed by calculating the differences in elevation between each two sets of data. The <b>repeatability</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> was re-assessed following the determination of the magnitude of misalignment components (translational displacements: x 0, y 0 and z 0, and rotational displacements: α, β and γ) between each two data sets and using them to modify the second data set within each pair based on an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The method simultaneously considered the anterior and posterior maps taken for the same eye since they were assumed to have the same set of misalignment components. A new parameter, named Combined Misalignment parameter (CM), has been developed to combine the effect of all six misalignment components on topography data and so enable study of the association between misalignment and the data repeatability test results. The repeatability tests resulted in average root mean square (RMS) differences in elevation data of 8. 46 ± 2. 75 μm before ICP map matching when simultaneously considering anterior and posterior surfaces. With map matching and misalignment correction, the differences decreased to 7. 28 ± 2. 58 μm (P = 0. 00). When applied to only the anterior maps, misalignment correction led to a more pronounced reduction in elevation data differences from 4. 58 ± 1. 84 μm to 2. 97 ± 1. 29 μm (P = 0. 00). CM was found {{to be associated with the}} repeatability error (P = 0. 00), with posterior maps being responsible for most of the error due to their relatively lower accuracy compared to anterior maps. The ICP algorithm can be used to estimate, and effectively correct for, the potential misalignment between successive corneal videokeratography maps...|$|E

A manually operated, electronic reflex hammer was applied that enabled <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the strength of tendon taps. Reflex responses were recorded by surface electromyography.
