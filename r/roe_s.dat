40|$|Semi-analytic {{reconstruction}} {{uses the}} analytic {{solution to a}} second-order, steady, ordinary differential equation (ODE) to simultaneously evaluate the convective and diffusive flux at all interfaces of a finite volume formulation. The second-order ODE is itself a linearized approximation to the governing first- and second- order partial differential equation conservation laws. Thus, semi-analytic reconstruction defines a family of formulations for finite volume interface fluxes using analytic solutions to approximating equations. Limiters are not applied in a conventional sense; rather, diffusivity is adjusted {{in the vicinity of}} changes in sign of eigenvalues in order to achieve a sufficiently small cell Reynolds number in the analytic formulation across critical points. Several approaches for application of semi-analytic reconstruction for the solution of one-dimensional scalar equations are introduced. Results are compared with exact analytic solutions to Burger s Equation as well as a conventional, upwind discretization using <b>Roe</b> <b>s</b> method. One approach, the end-point wave speed (EPWS) approximation, is further developed for more complex applications. One-dimensional vector equations are tested on a quasi one-dimensional nozzle application. The EPWS algorithm has a more compact difference stencil than <b>Roe</b> <b>s</b> algorithm but reconstruction time is approximately a factor of four larger than for Roe. Though both are second-order accurate schemes, <b>Roe</b> <b>s</b> method approaches a grid converged solution with fewer grid points. Reconstruction of flux in the context of multi-dimensional, vector conservation laws including effects of thermochemical nonequilibrium in the Navier-Stokes equations is developed...|$|E
40|$|Phantom is a {{computer}} code intended primarily for real-fluid turbomachinery problems. It is based on Corsair, an ideal-gas turbomachinery code, developed by the same authors, which evolved from the ROTOR codes from NASA Ames. Phantom is applicable to real and ideal fluids, both compressible and incompressible, flowing at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic speeds. It utilizes structured, overset, O- and H-type zonal grids to discretize flow fields and represent relative motions of components. Values on grid boundaries are updated at each time step by bilinear interpolation from adjacent grids. Inviscid fluxes are calculated to third-order spatial accuracy using <b>Roe</b> <b>s</b> scheme. Viscous fluxes are calculated using second-order-accurate central differences. The code is second-order accurate in time. Turbulence is represented by a modified Baldwin-Lomax algebraic model. The code offers two options for determining properties of fluids: One is based on equations of state, thermodynamic departure functions, and corresponding state principles. The other, which is more efficient, is based on splines generated from tables of properties of real fluids. Phantom currently contains fluid-property routines for water, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, kerosene, methane, and carbon monoxide as well as ideal gases...|$|E

Furthermore {{the importance of}} ligands, including phosphines and N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC), in such cross-coupling reactions is explored. Chapter 2 provides a background to the reductive lithiation of phosphines, followed by an account of our investigation of BINAP functionalisation by means of reductive elimination. 1 The reaction was examined by experimental means and {{through the use of}} density functional theory to predict 31 P NMR chemical shifts. Chapter 3 provides background on the Heck reaction and selected developments over the years, with particular reference to the use of aryl chlorides in the reaction. A brief discussion of NHC based palladium complex sets the scene for our investigation of a new class of (NHC) -Pd catalysts developed by the Navarro group. Complexes of type (NHC) PdCl 2 (TEA) (TEA = triethylamine) have been tested for their activity in the Heck reaction, focusing on the scope of the reaction with electron-deficient aryl chlorides and electron-rich aryl bromides. 2 Chapter 4 gives an account of the discovery and developments of the Sonogashira reaction. Particular attention is paid to non-classical systems such as palladium-only and copper-only protocols. Herein our investigation into the use of collaborative (NHC) -Pd and (NHC) -Cu in Sonogashira reactions is presented. 3 Notable features of this system are the low catalyst loadings and the synthetically convenient conditions in which the reaction can be carried namely non-anhydrous solvents and in air.

40|$|The initial water {{impact of}} a free-falling object is {{primarily}} related to the fluid forces on the wetted surface of the object. The shape-dependent added-mass coefficients express the fluid forces integrated over the body, and thus physically represent the additional inertia of water accelerated with the body. The field of hydrodynamic impact has been primarily concerned with estimating the added-mass coefficients of various types of bodies for different water impact types, such as seaplane landings, torpedo drops, and ship slamming. In this study, a numerical model has been constructed to estimate the hydrodynamic impact loads of a REMUS dropped in free-fall from a helicopter in a low hover. Developed by von Alt and associates at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the REMUS (Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS) is a small, man-portable, torpedo shaped Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) that is normally operated from small boats {{for a variety of}} scientific, industrial, and military applications. Finite-element method software and computer aided drafting tools were used to create a simplified model of REMUS without fins, propeller, or transducers. (cont.) This axisymmetric REMUS model was cut by a flat free surface at various pitch angles and submergence values, and a panel mesh of the wetted surface of the vehicle was created using an automatic mesh generator. Surface boundary conditions are enforced for the free surface by reflecting the body panels using the method of images. Each panel mesh was evaluated for its added- mass characteristics using a source collocation panel method developed by Dr. Yonghwan Kim, formerly of the Vortical Flow Research Laboratory (VFRL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

It had been noted by surveyor-general John Septimus Roe in 1837 as [...] "a safe, well protected boat anchorage" [...] and he gave it the appropriate name of Safety Bay. In the mid-1830s, Thomas Peel became interested in Safety Bay as a potential harbour to establish a base for whaling operations as well as a point from which inland stands of jarrah could be exported. After initial approval by Governor Stirling and Surveyor-General J. <b>S.</b> <b>Roe</b> for the founding of ‘Liverpool’ - as Peel’s port-town was to be known - in 1842 a town site was marked out and planned by surveyor Thomas Watson. Peel’s venture did not go ahead at this time, however.Roe recorded depths of 7 fathoms (12.8m) in what was later named [...] "Peel Harbour". In 1846, Roe undertook a more detailed investigation of the potential of Safety Bay as the site for a port.

The harbour (or basin) disappeared over time, and was last recorded on maps of the area in 1890.

40|$|Controversy lingers in {{academic}} circles surrounding the merit that diversity brings to an organisation s board directorate construct, particularly the influence {{it has on}} firm performance. Director fiduciary responsibilities prescribe the provision of direction and governance, representative of and accountable to, company shareholders and its stakeholders. The question then avails itself, if the extent of board diversity, in respect to human and social capital, facilitates enriched decision-making through varied experience and backgrounds to proficiently serve their constituency, and if positive, have organisations reaped the improved benefits owing to the positive effect expected of diversity through desegregation? This research report was conducted {{with the intention of}} understanding the effects of board composition diversity on company performance. The research commenced with a robust interrogation of literature exemplifying diversity, in particular, that of board diversity and its impact on company performance. A quantitative methodology was employed in the evaluation of company performance relative to the level of diversity of the board. The ratios, Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (<b>ROE)</b> and Tobin <b>s</b> q, were employed to assess both financial and market performance across 130 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, for the 2014 financial year. The attributes of diversity in this analysis embodied nationality, gender and race. The findings show that board diversity has an impact on company performance and that the full benefits thereof have not yet been realised. Diversity is an enabler of company performance yet the status quo of homogenous board directorates is evident in the minimal female representation on company s boards within South Africa, demonstrating the slow adoption of change. Quotas imposed upon companies impede the benefits of diversity as in certain instances, this is seen as window dressing and is not embraced in the spirit in which it was intended. This paper, however, does not paint a picture of doom and gloom but instead shows diversity as being positive and encourages the early adoption thereof, specifically within a South African context.

40|$|Rectal {{cancer is}} common a disease. For {{patients}} with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is commonly given prior to surgical resection to optimize local control and improve long-term outcome. Still, {{a substantial number}} of patients will develop metastatic disease. Tumor hypoxia is an important hallmark of solid tumors and is recognized as a common determinant of resistance to radiotherapy and metastatic disease progression. In this thesis, methods from experimental and clinical cancer research were used to detect and counteract hypoxic tumor mechanisms involved in poor radiation response and metastasis, with the ultimate goal of improving the outcome for rectal cancer patients. Recognizing that adaptive cellular responses to hypoxic stress involve kinase signaling pathways contributing in the metastatic process, tumor kinase activity was studied in LARC patients participating in a prospective CRT study. Dysfunctional angiogenic tumor signaling, particularly the signaling activity mediated by PDGFR receptor tyrosine kinases, was associated with early systemic disease dissemination. Next, the molecularly targeted agent vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was found to enhance radiation response of experimental colorectal carcinoma models when examined both under hypoxic conditions and in combination with standard CRT. Biomarkers of vorinostat activity were quested by gene expression profiling in patients participating in a prospective study of vorinostat in combination with pelvic radiotherapy. Finally, in the prospective CRT study for LARC patients, neoadjuvant chemotherapy led to substantial tumor volume reduction with particularly good response in the less advanced cases and without compromising CRT response. The biological principle was confirmed in experimental models. Taken together, treatment of rectal cancer should be further individualized by tailoring the multimodal therapy to the specific tumor biology of each patient. List of papers.

40|$|Background: The infant {{mortality}} rate (IMR), defined {{as the number of}} deaths in children under 1 year of age per 1000 live births, is regarded as a sensitive measure of population health (Blaxter). This reflects the overlap between those societal factors that impact {{infant mortality}} and those that affect the health of the larger community, such as SES, nutrition, living conditions, education, employment and access to health care. In 2003, Reidpath et al showed a strong linear relation between IMR and the disability adjusted life expectancy (DALE), a more comprehensive measure of population health. They concluded that either the IMR or the DALE could stand as a proxy for the measurement of population health. Objectives: We proposed to study historic trends in the IMR of the city of Worcester, MA, the second largest city in New England with a population of 181, 045 (census 2010), over a 100 year period. We evaluated trends in the overall {{infant mortality rate}} as well as by specific causes of death. We further looked at known changes in medical innovation as well as community living conditions that may have had an effect on these rates. Methods: From August through September 2012, infant death certificates housed in the Worcester City Hall, Office of the City Clerk, were reviewed and entered into an Excel spreadsheet. The first year, 1906, was selected due to a particularly high IMR. Following 1906, years were chosen at 10 -year intervals through 1976. Beginning in 1986, data was available through a downloadable file. Data collected included the record number, the date of death, the age of the infant in months and years, cause of death, city of residence, and place of birth of mother. Specific causes of death were transformed into 13 general categories. A subsequent comparative analysis was performed. Results: A total of 2929 hard copy death certificates were reviewed and an additional 116 records were added through downloadable files. Because 1956 was the last year to include stillbirth in infant mortality records, analysis was conducted excluding numbers of stillbirths. In 1906, the overall IMR was 143 (per 1000 live births). By 1936, the total IMR had already dropped significantly to 52, a drop of 64 %. By 2006, the IMR had dropped to 4. 6, a decrease of almost 97 %. Much of this drop reflected changes in the IMR due to infection, which dropped from 75 in 1906 to 15 in 1936 and to. 4 by 2006. In total, the decrease in IMR due to infection was responsible {{for more than half of}} the total decrease in IMR, with 80 % of the drop in infection-related IMR occurring before 1936. Over this time period, the IMR due to congenital malformations also slowly decreased from 8 in 1906, to 7. 3 in 1976 and then to 2. 0 in 1986 and. 8 in 2006. Interestingly, 83 % of the decreases in IMR due to malformation occurred after 1976. IMR due to prematurity was 34 in 1906, decreased to 14. 7 in 1976 and further decreased to 6. 4 in 1986 and to 3. 1 in 2006. Again, 89 % of the decreases in IMR due to prematurity occurred after 1976. Conclusions: The IMR in Worcester has undergone a dramatic reduction over the past 100 years, driven in large part by great reductions in number of deaths from infectious causes. Interestingly, a large part of the reduction in IMR secondary to infection occurred by 1936, prior to the development and widespread availability of antibiotics and vaccines against infectious diseases starting in the 1940 s. Changes in public health infrastructure, changes in hygiene, including water, sewage and housing, and access to better nutrition and education likely played a significant role in decreased infant mortality due to infection prior to the development of medical interventions. A number of medical developments are likely responsible for decreased rates of infant mortality due to malformations and prematurity seen after 1976. These include the advent of neonatal surgery in the 1950 s, the introduction of Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) in the 1960 s, the use of fetal heart monitors and fetal distress as an indication for delivery by cesarean section in the 1960 s to 1970 s, the development of amniocentesis (for lung maturity and genetic testing) and ultrasound (for dating) in the 1970 <b>s,</b> <b>Roe</b> vs. Wade in 1973, the advent of alpha fetoprotein testing and folic acid supplementation in the 1980 s, and corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity in the 1980 s- 1990 s. The large decrease in IMR due to infectious causes over the last 100 years highlights IMR’s sensitive relationship to societal factors and suggests that deteriorations in living conditions during recent difficult economic times could result in high and increasing IMRs among vulnerable subpopulations. We propose that interventions addressing societal factors could have the greatest impact in preventing infant mortality in Worcester...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Shoulder pain is a common, {{persistent}} and disabling disease. The restoration of abnormal movement-patterns {{is often an}} important goal {{in the treatment of}} patients with shoulder pain. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a conceptual framework and classification that has been developed by the World Health Organisation. The ICF is a common, multi-disciplinary language that allows identification of condition-specific codes (ICF categories), comparison between patient-experiences of functioning and assessment tools and development of new measures. Aims: The aims of this thesis are to identify the ICF categories that reflect the concepts used in assessment of shoulder pain and identify the ICF categories that reflect problems related to functioning and interactions with the environment in patients with shoulder pain. As an extension of this aim, whether patient experiences of functioning are captured by the present assessment tools is also investigated. Moreover, the ICF categories that reflect the patientexperiences of functioning and the content of the assessment tools are used to create a preliminary list of ICF categories for shoulder pain. Finally, a clinician-rated activity measure to capture abnormal movement patterns in the upper extremities is developed and tested. Methods: The present work is based on three studies: a literature review of measures, a cross-sectional study with patient interviews and a test-retest study. In addition, the datasets from the literature review of measures and the cross-sectional study with patient interviews constitute the material used for the comparison of the patient-experiences of functioning and the content of measures, and {{for the development of a}} preliminary list of ICF categories for shoulder pain. In the literature review, articles that were written in English, published in peerreviewed journals and based on clinical studies that included patients with shoulder pain aged 18 years and older were included. Studies on patients with fractures, joint replacement, complete dislocation, malignant condition, rheumatic diagnosis and stroke were excluded. The measures extracted from the articles were linked to ICF categories according to standardised rules. The frequency of the identified ICF categories was calculated and reported for categories with a frequency of at least 1 %. In the cross-sectional study, patients in the outpatient clinic at the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Ullevaal University Hospital, were included. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those in the literature review. The patients were interviewed with a condition-adapted ICF checklist that contained 154 categories. The presence of a functional problem or environmental factor according to these ICF categories was registered. The ICF categories that were registered with a frequency of at least 5 % were reported. The correspondence between these two datasets was investigated using the following criteria: (1) categories included in both datasets with similar rankings, (2) categories included in both datasets with different rankings, and (3) categories included in only one of the datasets. In addition, the match between high frequent patient-derived ICF categories (reported by = 50 %) and the content of frequently cited condition-specific measures (identified with = 10 citations) was investigated. The preliminary list of ICF categories for shoulder pain was constituted from all the ICF categories that were reported in the cross-sectional study with patient interviews and the literature review of measures. Finally, a simple, clinician-rated activity measure was developed and reliability tested. The development process was based on identification of eligible items in the literature, pilot-testing and statistical analyses. The test-retest study was conducted at the Department of Physiotherapy at Martina Hansens Hospital, Baerum. Patients aged 18 years and older with a main diagnosis of subacromial impingement syndrome were included. The exclusion criteria were similar to those from the literature review and the cross-sectional study. Item-reduction was based on item-to-sum correlations. In the further testing of the final scale, inter- and intra-rater reliability were calculated with the Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and a 95 % Confidence Interval (CI). The minimal detectable change was calculated from the standard error. The content of the scale was linked to ICF categories according to the established rules. Results: In the literature review, 40 ICF categories were identified in 475 measures. Of these, 28 belonged to activities and participation, 11 to body functions and structures and 1 to environmental factors. In the cross-sectional study with patient interviews, 165 patients with a mean age of 46. 5 years (SD = 12. 5) were included. A total of 61 ICF categories were identified. Of these, 19 covered body functions and structures, 34 activities and participation, and 8 environmental factors. The correspondence between the two datasets was high for activities and participation, and lower for body functions and structures and environmental factors. In particular, patient-derived mental- and muscle body functions and environmental social support were not present in the measures. Moreover, 6 high frequent patient-derived categories are not matched by the content of any of the most frequently selected conditionspecific scales. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Form for Assessment of the Shoulder (ASES) and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale match the highest number of high frequent patient-derived categories. The preliminary list of ICF categories for shoulder pain contains a total of 68 second-level ICF categories. Of these more than half belong to activities and participation. In the test-retest study, a total of 63 patients, aged 53. 3 (SD = 12. 9) and diagnosed with subacromial impingement syndrome, were included. A clinician-rated activity measure, the Shoulder Activity Scale, with 3 items and a summed score ranging from 3 to 15 was developed. The inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability were ICC = 0. 80 (95 % CI = 0. 51 - 0. 90) and ICC = 0. 74 (95 % CI = 0. 58 - 0. 84), respectively. The minimal detectable change of the scale was calculated as 3. 32. The scale covers the ICF categories lifting and carrying objects (d 430), dressing (d 540), hand and arm use (d 445) and control of voluntary movement (b 760). Conclusions: The patient experiences of shoulder pain are multi-faceted, covering the ICF body functions sensation of pain, movement-related functions and mental functions and the activity and participation functions mobility, self-care, domestic life, interpersonal interactions and relationships, work and leisure activities. Except for social support from immediate family and friends, environmental factors were scarcely represented. The assessments of patients with shoulder pain only partially capture the patient experiences of functioning and there is large variation in the content of condition-specific measures. These findings have implications for clinicians and researchers in the selection of measures. The Shoulder Activity Scale is a simple and reliable measure that fills a gap in the assessment of patients with shoulder pain. Before it is applied in clinical settings, it needs to be validated. For the first time, a preliminary list of ICF categories for shoulder pain is presented. The preliminary list should be further developed with contributions from qualitative patient interviews, an expert survey and a formalised decision process. List of papers.
