25|$|A 2001 study, {{conducted}} by Aagaard et al., utilized MRI, ultrasonography and muscle biopsy techniques {{to examine the}} relationship between muscle architecture, contractile strength and pennation angle in the human quadriceps muscle after 14 weeks of <b>resistance</b> <b>training.</b> Upon completion of the training program, Aagaard et al. noticed a symmetrical increase in quadriceps CSA and volume, as each increased 10.2 and 10.3 percent respectively; however, these parameters increased disproportionately to quadriceps PCSA, which grew 16 percent. The rapid increase in PCSA was accompanied by a 35.5% increase in the fascicle pennation angle of the vastus lateris, one of the major quadriceps muscles, as well as a 16% increase in myofiber CSA. The increase in pennation angle in the vastus lateris resulted in an increase to the muscle’s PCSA, a measure proportional to the contractile force a pennate muscle is capable of producing. Work by Azizi et al. suggests this increase in pennation angle of the vastus lateris following <b>resistance</b> <b>training</b> generates an increase in the muscle’s AGR, a property which allows the whole muscle to contract with a higher velocity.|$|E

No {{significant differences were found between}} experienced and novice <b>resistance</b> <b>trained</b> individuals. For the upper trapezius and anterior deltoid muscles, shoulder press activation was significantly greater than incline press which in turn was significantly greater than bench press across both phases. The bench and incline presses promoted significantly greater pectoralis major sternal activation compared to the shoulder press (both phases). While pectoralis major clavicular activation during the incline press eccentric phase was significantly greater than both the bench and shoulder presses, activation during the bench press concentric phase promoted significantly greater activation than the incline press which in turn was significantly greater than the shoulder press.

40|$|Abstract Background Dietary {{supplements}} containing L-arginine are {{marketed to}} improve exercise performance, but {{the efficacy of}} such supplements is not clear. Therefore, {{this study examined the}} efficacy of acute ingestion of L-arginine alpha-ketoglutarate (AAKG) muscular strength and endurance in <b>resistance</b> <b>trained</b> and untrained men. Methods Eight <b>resistance</b> <b>trained</b> and eight untrained healthy males ingested either 3000 mg of AAKG or a placebo 45 minutes prior to a resistance exercise protocol in a randomized, double-blind crossover design. One-repetition maximum (1 RM) on the standard barbell bench press and leg press were obtained. Upon determination of 1 RM, subjects completed repetitions to failure at 60 % 1 RM on both the standard barbell bench press and leg press. Heart rate was measured pre and post exercise. One week later, subjects ingested the other supplement and performed the identical resistance exercise protocol. Results Our data showed statistical significant differences (p 0. 05) between supplementation conditions for either <b>resistance</b> <b>trained</b> or untrained men in the bench press or leg press exercises.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{research}} has indicated that short term administration of glycine propionyl-L-carnitine (GPLC) significantly elevates levels of nitric oxide metabolites at rest and in response to reactive hyperaemia. However, no scientific evidence exists that suggests such supplementation enhances exercise performance in healthy, trained individuals. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of GPLC on the performance of repeated high intensity stationary cycle sprints with limited recovery periods in <b>resistance</b> <b>trained</b> male subjects. Methods In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, twenty-four male <b>resistance</b> <b>trained</b> subjects (25. 2 ± 3. 6 years) participated in two test sessions separated by one week. Testing was performed 90 minutes following oral ingestion of either 4. 5 grams GPLC or 4. 5 grams cellulose (PL), in randomized order. The exercise testing protocol consisted of five 10 -second Wingate cycle sprints separated by 1 -minute active recovery periods. Peak (PP) and mean values (MP) of sprint power output and percent decrement of power (DEC) were determined per bout and standardized relative to body masss.

25|$|The {{ratio of}} {{testosterone}} to cortisol can both increase and decrease during <b>resistance</b> <b>training,</b> depending on intensity of exercise. A study comparing {{young and old}} subjects showed acute increases in GH and testosterone for both, although the latter increased less in older men. Testosterone rises in late hours of sleep after anaerobic exercise. Androgen receptor expression increases with acute exercise in correlation to free testosterone. When comparing {{men and women in}} the 30, 50 and 70 year age groups, young and middle aged men showed increased testosterone after exercise, with the latter also having increased cortisol. Elderly men showed no change. Other studies have also shown with age there is a downtrend of testosterone and attenuated growth hormone response. Young men have shown no acute change in testosterone with <b>resistance</b> <b>training,</b> with increase in cortisol and growth hormone depending on intensity. One study in young men showed testosterone acutely stable, with increase in GH and IGF-1. Similarly, a study showed testosterone did not increase in young men, women, and pubescent boys unaccustomed to weight training when corrected for plasma volume. Extreme intensity of strength training may trigger the stress response, resulting in lower testosterone levels, an effect accentuated by energy deprivation. A separate study comparing different ages, however, found no difference in acute testosterone and cortisol levels between groups, but attenuated growth hormone response in the elderly. Acutely, other studies have shown testosterone to increase. In a small group of anaerobically trained athletes, stressful training acutely even decreased serum testosterone and its ratio to cortisol and SHBG, with an increase in LH. With subsequent decompensation, testosterone was stable, but cortisol and SHBG decreased. Another case control showed with intense training followed by rest, testosterone dropped and LH increased initially.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Both acute {{bouts of}} prior {{exercise}} (preconditioning) and antioxidant nutrients {{have been used}} in an attempt to attenuate muscle injury or oxidative stress in response to resistance exercise. However, most studies have focused on untrained participants rather than on athletes. The purpose of this work was to determine the independent and combined effects of antioxidant supplementation (vitamin C + mixed tocopherols/tocotrienols) and prior eccentric exercise in attenuating markers of skeletal muscle injury and oxidative stress in <b>resistance</b> <b>trained</b> men. Methods Thirty-six men were randomly assigned to: no prior exercise + placebo; no prior exercise + antioxidant; prior exercise + placebo; prior exercise + antioxidant. Markers of muscle/cell injury (muscle performance, muscle soreness, C-reactive protein, and creatine kinase activity), as well as oxidative stress (blood protein carbonyls and peroxides), were measured before and through 48 hours of exercise recovery. Results No group by time interactions were noted for any variable (P > 0. 05). Time main effects were noted for creatine kinase activity, muscle soreness, maximal isometric force and peak velocity (P Conclusion There appears to be no independent or combined effect of a prior bout of eccentric exercise or antioxidant supplementation as used here on markers of muscle injury in <b>resistance</b> <b>trained</b> men. Moreover, eccentric exercise as {{used in the present study}} results in minimal blood oxidative stress in <b>resistance</b> <b>trained</b> men.

2500|$|A {{number of}} studies have looked at effects of {{anaerobic}} exercise over months to years, showing it to be constant or slightly increased. A small case-control of anaerobic training in young untrained males over six weeks found decline in free testosterone of 17 percent.

A study over 21 weeks in male strength athletes showed basal hormone levels to be constant, despite strength increase. A follow up study looked at a larger group of weight trainers over 24 weeks, with 12-week decompensation. Training caused no change in total testosterone, but there were decreases in free testosterone, progesterone, androstendione, DHEA, cortisol, transcortin, and in the [...] ratio, suggesting androgen turnover increased with training intensity, without change in total testosterone.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of <b>resistance</b> exercise <b>training</b> on BP and baroreceptor sensitivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Method: Rats SHR (n = 16) and Wistar (n = 16) at 8 weeks of age, {{at the beginning of the}} experiment, were randomly divided into 4 groups: sedentary control (CS, n = 8); trained control (CT, n = 8); sedentary SHR (HS, n = 8) and trained SHR (HT, n = 8). <b>Resistance</b> exercise <b>training</b> was performed in a stairmaster-type equipment (1. 1 × 0. 18 m, 2 cm between the steps, 80 ° incline) with weights attached to their tails, (5 days/week, 8 weeks). Baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate (HR) was tested by loading/unloading of baroreceptors with phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside. Results: <b>Resistance</b> exercise <b>training</b> increased the soleus muscle mass in SHR when compared to HS (HS 0. 027 ± 0. 002 g/mm and HT 0. 056 ± 0. 003 g/mm). <b>Resistance</b> exercise <b>training</b> did not alter BP.

Maximal torque, rate of torque development, {{and measures of}} central motor output and peripheral muscle fatigue were recorded at two matched volumes of exercise, and after a final contraction performed to exhaustion. Central motor output was quantified from changes in voluntary activation, normalized surface electromyograms (EMG), and V-waves.

Central motor output during the exercise protocols was estimated from EMG and interpolated twitches applied during the task (VA(sub)). Greater reductions in maximal torque and rate of torque development were observed during the 40 % protocol (p< 0. 05). Maximal central motor output did not change for either protocol. For the 40 % protocol reductions from pre-exercise in rate and amplitude variables calculated from the Q.
