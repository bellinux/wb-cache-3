Shortly after his term ended, the office of Chief Minister of Delhi was abolished for 37 years until December 1993, when the Bharatiya Janata Party's Madan Lal Khurana was sworn in. In 1998 Sheila Dikshit's 15-year reign as chief minister began, the longest by an Indian woman.

The text does state that the deceased man, who was probably the father of the sponsors, was bæztr smiða or the [...] "best of smiths." [...] This is the only surviving runestone that mentions that a person was a blacksmith. Gästrikland is known to have been a center of ironmaking during the Viking Age. One <b>rule</b> <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> craving runes in stone was that two consecutive identical letters were represented by a single rune, even when the two identical letters end one word and start a second word.

Because one <b>rule</b> <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> craving runes in stone was that two consecutive identical letters were represented by a single rune, even when the two identical letters are {{at the end of one}} word and the start of a second word, and word divider punctuation marks were not always used consistently, Rundata recognizes two possible transliterations of the runic text as being valid. The first, designated as [...] "P" [...] below, recognizes possible double letters and spaces and transcribes the runes from the end of the text as : i it : in ik : anti, meaning i ætt, en ek ændi ("and I ended (it)").

This paper analyzes theoretically if price competition between risk [...] averse market [...] makers leaves room for implicit collusive behavior. We compare the spread and risk [...] sharing efficiency arising in several market structures differing in terms of i) the priority <b>rule</b> <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> case of ties, and ii) the type of schedules market makers may use, namely: general schedules, linear schedules, or limit orders. In general, competitive pricing does not arise in equilibrium, {{and there is a}} conflict between risk sharing efficiency and the tightness of the spread. This conflict can be mitigated by an appropriate market structure design. The limit order market is the only market structure in which the competitive equilibrium is the unique equilibrium. ...|$|E

40|$|This Paper {{examines}} {{some recent}} monetary policy debates, {{in light of}} commentary on those issues contained {{in some of the}} work of Milton Friedman. The specific aspect of Friedman’s work considered here is the commentary on monetary policy in his Newsweek magazine columns from 1966 to 1984. My conclusions from this examination include: (1) In contrast to claims made in the VAR literature, the analysis of monetary policy and the business cycle by Friedman and other critics of monetary policy in the 1960 s and 1970 s did not assume that the money supply was exogenous, or contend that monetary policy shocks were the dominant source of cyclical fluctuations. Rather, the criticism was of the destabilizing tendency of the monetary policy feedback <b>rule</b> <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> those decades. (2) There is support for the argument of Orphanides (2000 a) that many monetary policy prescriptions by commentators in the 1970 s were based on over–optimistic estimates of the growth rate of productive potential. Friedman’s Newsweek discussions, like his other work, were unusual for not making policy prescriptions based on output gap estimates. monetary aggregates; monetary policy shocks; output gap...|$|E

I will also appeal to William James and Jacob Needleman's account of the difference between an emotional reaction and the authentic emotive cognition brought about by the touch of the Divine, as well as considerations of other relevant philosophers.

Abstract. – The instability introduced {{in a large}} scale-free network by the triggering of node-breaking avalanches is analyzed using the fiber-bundle model as conceptual framework. We found, by measuring {{the size of the}} giant component, the avalanche size distribution and other quantities, the existence of an abrupt transition. This test of strength for complex networks like Internet is more stringent than others recently considered like the random removal of nodes, analyzed within the framework of percolation theory. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our results and their relevance in forecasting cascading failures in scale-free networks. The recent months have witnessed a great effort devoted to the unraveling of the proper-ties of complex networks [1, 2]. These properties include the <b>rules</b> <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> the process of formation of the net, the resulting connectivity distribution of the networks and their robust-ness under unfavorable circumstances like the presence of acting damaging agents, etc. [3 – 5].

40|$|Background An {{effective}} health workforce {{is essential}} for achieving health-related new Sustainable Development Goals. Odisha, one of the states in India with low health indicators, faces challenges in recruiting and retaining health staff in the public sector, especially doctors. Recruitment, deployment and career progression {{play an important role}} in attracting and retaining doctors. We examined the policies on recruitment, deployment and promotion for doctors in the state and how these policies were perceived to be implemented. Methods We undertook document review and four key informant interviews with senior state-level officials to delineate the policies for recruitment, deployment and promotion. We conducted 90 in-depth interviews, 86 with doctors from six districts and four at the state level to explore the perceptions of doctors about these policies. Results Despite the efforts by the Government of Odisha through regular recruitments, a quarter of the posts of doctors was vacant across all institutional levels in the state.

In addition, there were no explicit <b>rules</b> <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> placement and transfer. More than half (57...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a study regarding preschool teachers’ skills and competencies in teaching science and mathematics. The {{aim of the}} project was twofold; one to find out the preschool teachers’ knowledge about mathematics and science concepts and then to develop support material to empower them with skills and competencies to teach these concepts in preschools. A qualitative approach was adopted, and a case study method was used. Data were collected through two workshops and focus group discussions with preschool teachers. The study revealed that the preschool teachers had content knowledge, but lacked pedagogical knowledge that is crucial in teaching of preschool children, and they provided science and mathematics experiences in preschools scarcely. A resource book of 33 local games and rhymes thus was developed as a support material to empower the teachers with skills and competencies to use play to teach science and mathematics in preschools. The resource book developed consists of 33 local games/rhymes and is packaged with the games’ illustrations, steps and <b>rules</b> <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> the games, science and mathematics concepts and competencies that could be taught to children, along with probing questions that would help in teaching of science and mathematics concepts to children...|$|R
