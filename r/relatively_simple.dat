5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
5|$|Among the few {{remains of}} {{buildings}} {{from the interior}} of the town, most notable are a large monumental staircase and a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast. The church was of <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> construction, but of unusual size, and A. Bon proposes its identification with the church of the Franciscans, where assemblies of the nobles of Achaea were held in 1276 and 1289. The remaining portions of the church's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E

5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|As {{support for}} {{multiple}} instruction set architectures complicates symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support, DragonFly BSD now limits its {{support to the}} x86-64 platform. DragonFly originally ran on the x86 architecture, however as of version 4.0 {{it is no longer}} supported. Since version 1.10, DragonFly supports 1:1 userland threading (one kernel thread per userland thread), which is regarded as a <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> solution that is also easy to maintain. Inherited from FreeBSD, DragonFly also supports multi-threading.|$|E
5|$|Francium has no {{commercial}} applications, {{but because}} of francium's <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> atomic structure, among other things, {{it has been used}} in spectroscopy experiments, leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles.

30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Figure 3, the Lower Bound B is more {{accurate}} than the other bounds. Furthermore, it is <b>relatively</b> <b>simpler</b> than the other bounds, making its adoption quite attractive.

5|$|Mecoptera {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> mouthparts, {{with a long}} labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the more primitive true flies.

5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is <b>relatively</b> <b>simple,</b> involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E

5000|$|Generally {{the term}} [...] "ohmic contact" [...] implicitly {{refers to an}} ohmic contact of a metal to a semiconductor, where {{achieving}} ohmic behaviour is possible but requires careful technique. Metal-metal ohmic contacts are <b>relatively</b> <b>simpler</b> to make, by ensuring direct contact between the metals without intervening layers of insulating contamination or oxidation; various techniques are used to create ohmic metal-metal junctions (soldering, welding, crimping, deposition, electroplating, etc.). This article focuses on metal-semiconductor ohmic contacts.|$|R
5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E
5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk {{properties}} to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is <b>relatively</b> <b>simple.</b> The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E

40|$|Inspired by Kobayashi’s type {{system for}} lock freedom, we define a {{behavioral}} type system for en-suring progress {{in a language}} of binary sessions. The key idea is to annotate actions in session types with priorities representing the urgency with which such actions must be performed and to verify that processes perform such actions with the required priority. Compared to related systems for session-based languages, the presented type system is <b>relatively</b> <b>simpler</b> and establishes progress for {{a wider range of}} processes. ...|$|R
30|$|A <b>relatively</b> <b>simpler</b> {{physical}} phenomenon constraint is the “physical device constraint” which arises {{within a}} component of a system. That is, it is a “local constraint.” Since it indicates the physical property of the component, each domain has its specific physical device constraints (for example, Ohm’s law constrains the values of current and voltage in an electric device). In contrast, there are “global constraints” which indicate the behavior of multiple components or the whole system. Global constraints are classified as follows.|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{a review}} of all well-preserved {{specimens}} including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of Archaeopteryx could be supported: A. lithographica (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens), and A. siemensii (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in A. lithographica (the claws of A. siemensii specimens being <b>relatively</b> <b>simple</b> and straight). A. lithographica also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. A supposed additional species, Wellnhoferia grandis (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from A. lithographica except in its larger size.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) elicited during motor imagery (MI) of complex and familiar actions could be more reliably detected with electroencephalography (EEG), and subsequently classified on a single-trial basis, than those elicited during <b>relatively</b> <b>simpler</b> imagined actions. Methods: Groups of healthy volunteers, including experienced pianists and ice hockey players, performed MI of varying complexity and familiarity. Their electroencephalograms were recorded and compared using brain-computer interface (BCI) approaches and spectral analyses. Results: Relative to simple MI, significantly more participants produced classifiable SMR for complex MI. During MI of performance of a complex musical piece, the EEG of the experienced pianists was classified significantly more accurately than during MI of performance of a simpler musical piece. The accuracy of EEG classification was also significantly more sustained during complex MI. Conclusion: MI of complex actions results in EEG responses that are more reliably classified for more individuals than MI of <b>relatively</b> <b>simpler</b> actions, and familiarity with actions enhances these responses in some cases. Significance: The accuracy of SMR-based BCIs in non-communicative patients may be improved by employing familiar and complex actions. Increased sensitivity to MI may also improve diagnostic accuracy for severely brain-injured patients in a vegetative state...|$|R
