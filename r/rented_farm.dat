25|$|Annie's {{parents were}} Quakers of English descent from Hollidaysburg, Blair County, Pennsylvania: Susan Wise, age 18, and Jacob Mosey, born 1799, age 49, married in 1848.

2500|$|Gehringer {{was born}} on May 11, 1903 on a <b>rented</b> <b>farm</b> in Iosco Township, south west of Fowlerville, Michigan, in southwestern Livingston County, Michigan. He was the second son of Leonard Gehringer and Theresa (Hahn) (Eisele) Gehringer, both German Catholic immigrants. Both of his parents had been married previously, and Charlie had eight half-siblings from Leonard's first marriage, and a {{half-sister}} from his mother's first marriage. As a young boy {{the family moved to}} a different <b>rented</b> <b>farm</b> just south of Fowlerville, Michigan in Handy Township, Michigan. [...] In 1922 after graduating from Fowlerville High School, he enrolled at the University of Michigan, about 30 miles from the family farm. [...] Gehringer took physical education classes and played basketball and baseball. [...] Gehringer later recalled that he lettered in basketball but not baseball.|$|E
6000|$|The {{cabin on}} this <b>rented</b> <b>farm</b> {{was a mere}} shanty, a shell of pine boards, which needed re-enforcing to make it {{habitable}} and one day my father said, [...] "Well, Hamlin, I guess you'll have to run the plow-team this fall. I must help neighbor Button wall up the house and I can't afford to hire another man." ...|$|E

50|$|Bak Jungyang {{was born}} on May 3, 1874/2 in Yangju county, Gyeonggi {{province}} or Daegu. The origin of his family is unknown. His father supervised a <b>rent</b> <b>farm</b> and leased it out as well.|$|R

60|$|This {{house in}} which the McClintocks were living at this time, belonged to a <b>rented</b> <b>farm.</b> Grandad had sold the {{original}} homestead on the LaCrosse River, and David who had lately married a charming young Canadian girl, {{was the head of}} the family. Deborah, it seems, was also living with him and Frank was there--as a visitor probably.|$|E
60|$|One of the interludes, and {{a lovely}} one, was {{given over to}} {{gathering}} the hay {{from one of the}} wild meadows to the north of us. Another was the threshing from the shock on the <b>rented</b> <b>farm.</b> This {{was the first time we}} had seen this done and it interested us keenly. A great many teams were necessary and the crew of men was correspondingly large. Uncle David was again the thresher with a fine new separator, and I would have enjoyed the season with almost perfect contentment had it not been for the fact that I was detailed to hold sacks for Daddy Fairbanks who was the measurer.|$|E
60|$|For seventy days I walked {{behind my}} plow {{on the new}} farm while my father {{finished}} the harvest on the <b>rented</b> <b>farm</b> {{and moved to the}} house on the knoll. It was lonely work for a boy of eleven but there were frequent breaks in the monotony and I did not greatly suffer. I disliked cross-cutting for the reason that the unrotted sods would often pile {{up in front of the}} coulter and make me a great deal of trouble. There is a certain pathos in the sight of that small boy tugging and kicking at the stubborn turf in the effort to free his plow. Such misfortunes loom large in a lad's horizon.|$|E
50|$|The area {{is mostly}} {{agricultural}} and {{is dotted with}} privately <b>rented</b> <b>farms.</b> A permissive footpath allows limited access to the public between Little Twycross and Shackerstone. The A444 Ashby to Nuneaton road also leads to a canal wharf on {{the western edge of}} the estate.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} five centuries the English {{agricultural}} economy grew but struggled to support the growing population, and then suffered an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. By {{the end of the}} period, England would have an economy dominated by <b>rented</b> <b>farms,</b> many controlled by the rising class of the gentry.|$|R
60|$|It {{remains to}} say that, though {{conditions}} have changed somewhat since that time, {{yet for the}} hired man and the <b>renter</b> <b>farm</b> life in the West is still a stern round of drudgery. My pages present it--not as the summer boarder or the young lady novelist sees it--but as the working farmer endures it.|$|R
6000|$|His {{father was}} a poor crofter, a hard working, God fearing man of [...] the Covenanter type, who labored unceasingly {{to earn a living}} from [...] the soil of a <b>rented</b> <b>farm.</b> The {{children}} went barefoot in all [...] seasons, almost from the time they could walk they were expected to [...] labor and at thirteen Bobbie was doing a man's work at the plow or [...] the reaping. The toil was severe, the reward, at best, was to [...] escape dire poverty or disgraceful debt, but there was yet a [...] nobility in the life which is finely reflected in [...] "The Cotter's [...] Saturday Night," [...] a poem which ranks with Whittier's [...] "Snow Bound" [...] among the best that labor has ever inspired.|$|E
6000|$|Roosevelt {{considered}} {{me something}} of a Populist, (as I was), and I well remember a dinner in Senator Lodge's house where he and Henry Adams heckled me {{for an hour or}} more in order to obtain a statement of what I thought [...] "ailed" [...] Kansas, Nebraska and Dakota. They all held the notion that I understood these farmer folk well enough to reflect their secret antagonisms, which I certainly did. I recall getting pretty hot in my plea, but Roosevelt seemed rather proud of me as I warmly defended my former neighbor. [...] "The man on the <b>rented</b> <b>farm</b> who is raising corn at fifteen cents per bushel to pay interest on a mortgage is apt to be bitter," [...] I argued.|$|E
60|$|No sooner did I {{reach my}} little desk in Jamaica Plain than I began to write, {{composing}} {{in the glow}} of a flaming conviction. With a delightful (and deceptive) sense of power, I graved with heavy hand, as if with pen of steel on brazen tablets, picture after picture of the plain. I had no doubts, no hesitations about the kind of effect I wished to produce. I perceived little that was poetic, little that was idyllic, and nothing that was humorous in the man, who, with hands like claws, was scratching a scanty living from the soil of a <b>rented</b> <b>farm,</b> while his wife walked her ceaseless round from tub to churn and from churn to tub. On the contrary, the life of such a family appealed to me as an almost unrelievedly tragic futility.|$|E

60|$|The {{events of}} this harvest, even {{the process of}} moving into the new house, are {{obscured}} in my mind by the clouds of smoke which rose from calamitous fires all over the west. It was an unprecedentedly dry season so that not merely the prairie, but many weedy cornfields burned. I had {{a good deal of}} time to meditate upon this for I was again the plow-boy. Every day I drove away from the <b>rented</b> <b>farm</b> to the new land where I was cross-cutting the breaking, and the thickening haze through which the sun shone with a hellish red glare, produced in me a growing uneasiness which became terror when the news came to us that Chicago was on fire. It seemed to me then that the earth was about to go up in a flaming cloud just as my grandad had so often prophesied.|$|E
60|$|It {{is strange}} but I cannot recall how my mother looked on this trip. Even my father's image is faint and vague (I {{remember}} only his keen eagle-gray terrifying eyes), but I can see every acre of that <b>rented</b> <b>farm.</b> I {{can tell you}} exactly how the house looked. It was an unpainted square cottage and stood bare on the sod {{at the edge of}} Dry Run ravine. It had a small lean-to on the eastern side and a sitting room and bedroom below. Overhead was a low unplastered chamber in which we children slept. As it grew too cold to use the summer kitchen we cooked, ate and lived in the square room which occupied the entire front of the two story upright, and which was, I suppose, sixteen feet square. As our attic was warmed only by the stove-pipe, we older children of a frosty morning made extremely simple and hurried toilets. On very cold days we hurried down stairs to dress beside the kitchen fire.|$|E

50|$|Rural {{administration}} remained {{primarily the}} preserve {{of the large}} landholders and of a few law-enforcement officials. In 1733, low crop prices caused the introduction of adscription, an effort by the landlords to obtain cheap labor. The effect of this was to turn the previously free Danish peasantry into serfs. The adscription system tied rural laborers to their place of birth and required them to <b>rent</b> <b>farms</b> on the estates.|$|R

50|$|In English and Irish law, a {{fee farm}} grant is a hybrid type of land {{ownership}} typical {{in cities and}} towns. The word fee is derived from fief, meaning a feudal landholding, and a fee farm grant {{is similar to a}} fee simple {{in the sense that it}} gives the grantee the right to hold a freehold estate, the only difference being the payment of an annual <b>rent</b> (<b>farm</b> being an archaic word for rent) and covenants, thus putting both parties in a landlord-tenant relationship.|$|R

50|$|In 1980, Circle {{received}} federal {{recognition as}} a church, and moved to another <b>rented</b> <b>farm</b> in Black Earth, Wisconsin. The first Litha gathering was held, a precursor for the Pagan Spirit Gathering that made its debut in 1981. Fundraising for a land purchase began in 1980, and the land was purchased in 1983.|$|E
50|$|In 1766 {{the family}} moved from Alloway near Ayr to their first <b>rented</b> <b>farm,</b> Mount Oliphant.

5000|$|The early {{efforts in}} {{establishing}} a free common school system for all in Ohio were haphazard and met with resistance. An act {{to provide for the}} [...] "Regulation and Support of common Schools" [...] was passed in 1821. The law committed the state to the idea of taxation, but it was permissive, not compulsory, and not designed to make [...] "free public schools". Therefore, only the more affluent that could afford to pay a subscription could attend. Some enterprising teachers were paid in [...] "trade". This included trading educational services for lodging, house <b>rent,</b> <b>farm</b> products, and clothing.|$|R
