5|$|American {{black bears}} were a common {{attraction}} by the 1930s, but in 1929 alone 81people required treatment for bear-related injuries. Troublesome bears were marked with white paint before being relocated {{to other parts}} of the park, and <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders</b> were killed. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940, but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 were put down between 1960 and 1972.

5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders.</b> He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870 election, {{the first}} state in which blacks were allowed to vote, Stevenson warned that {{violence}} against them would not be tolerated. Although he relied on local authorities to suppress any incidents, he offered rewards for the apprehension of perpetrators of election-related violence. Stevenson also recommended that the carrying of concealed weapons be outlawed. The General Assembly passed the requested legislation on March 22, 1871. The law imposed small fines for the first offense, but the amount rapidly increased for subsequent infractions in order to deter <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders.</b>|$|E

5|$|Field {{punishment}} (FP) {{had replaced}} flogging (abolished {{at home in}} 1868 and on active service in 1881, although still used in military prisons until 1907). FP No.1 (in which the man was shackled to fixed object, e.g. a large wheel) was awarded to 60,210 cases, equivalent to one man in 50 (although in practice there were many <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders).</b> FP No.1 could be very unpleasant depending on the weather, was abhorred by some as barbaric, and in some units was ritualised (e.g. by locking {{a man in a}} shed and throwing the handcuffs in with him); there were also cases of Australian troops releasing British troops whom they found tied up, although in other units it was regarded as a necessary sanction for serious offences. FP No.2 meant that a man was shackled but not fixed in place.|$|E

25|$|In August 2013, a 22-year-old photojournalist, who was interning with an English-language {{magazine}} in Mumbai, was gang-raped by five persons, including a juvenile, {{when she had}} gone to the deserted Shakti Mills compound, near Mahalaxmi in South Mumbai, with a male colleague on an assignment. This caused protests throughout the country since Mumbai with its very active nightlife was previously considered a safe haven for women.

25|$|In the United States, {{the first}} federal law to ban the for-profit {{production}} and distribution of child pornography was the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977. In response to New York v. Ferber, , a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing the prohibition of child pornography {{even if it did}} not meet the obscenity standard established in Miller v. California, Congress passed the Child Protection Act of 1984, broadening the definition of child pornography and criminalizing nonprofit child pornography trafficking. The 1986 Meese Report found that child pornography was a cause of serious harm; this led to the passage of the Child Sexual Abuse and Pornography Act of 1986, which increased penalties for <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders.</b>|$|E
25|$|In August 2013, the Saudi cabinet, for {{the first}} time, {{approved}} a law making domestic violence a criminal offence. The law calls for a punishment of {{up to a year}} in prison and a fine of up to 50,000 riyals (â‚¬11.500/US$13,000). The maximum punishments could be doubled for <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders.</b> The law criminalizes psychological, sexual as well as physical abuse. It also includes a provision obliging employees to report instances of abuse in the workplace to their employer. The move followed a Twitter campaign. The new laws were welcomed by Saudi women's rights activists, although some expressed concerns that the law could not be implemented successfully without new training for the judiciary, and that the tradition of male guardianship would remain an obstacle to prosecutions.|$|E

40|$|The Diploma Thesis, The <b>repeated</b> <b>offenders</b> in the {{execution}} of a punishment who are in prison, is {{about the people who}} have been punished at least once by imprisonment and now they are in prison again. These people have already passed the treatment which should have had a positive influnence on their behaviour after their release from prison. However, there has been a criminal activity again for some reasons. The thesis investigates the attitude and opinions of the final participants of resocializing programmes, the employees of tertiary prevention and the <b>repeated</b> <b>offenders.</b> The aim of this thesis is to find out the reasons of their behaviour...|$|R

25|$|At {{this moment}} most prisons in Tonga still abide {{with the old}} laissez-faire attitude. Usually having no fences, no iron bars and so forth, that makes it very easy for the inmates to escape. This system may be {{required}} to change, adapting for the influx of foreign born/raised criminals who may treat such a system with contempt, alternatively a minimum/maximum security prison system may need to be developed placing escapists or <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders</b> into closed prisons, but for the moment the jailors can trust on the goodwill of the inmates. Some are glad to be in prison, not to be bothered by demanding family members. There is no social stigma on being in prison (although that may change now too), but then of course it also does not serve as a deterrent against crimes.|$|E
25|$|The school {{continues}} to maintain strong discipline with a strict {{set of rules}} and regulations. Disciplinary measures {{are based on the}} Raffles Online Discipline system, introduced in 2011 and adapted from the Year 5 - 6 Section. Prior to the present system, student records were maintained based on a demerit point system, with Reformative Work Order and detention sessions for <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders.</b> These systems are primarily targeted at petty offences. Current school rules include prohibitions on eating and possessing sweetened drinks outside the canteen, physical activity in school uniform (as opposed to PE attire), and changing in class. The discipline framework is administered by the Discipline Master, in collaboration with the RIPB, for Year 1-4 students, and the Assistant Department Head (ADH) for Discipline for Year 5-6 students. For more serious offences, all male students are liable to receive corporal punishment in the form of caning if necessary.|$|E
25|$|The convicts {{who arrived}} with Bowen's {{expedition}} had been dispatched {{to assist with}} necessary labour {{in the establishment of}} the colony. However, it was soon decided that the growing population of convicts in Sydney could be better managed by breaking them up into smaller groups. Some were sent to Norfolk Island, and others to Hobart Town. Early in 1804 whilst the settlers were still camped at Risdon Cove, a strike occurred amongst the soldiers who were guarding the convicts, as they were too few to be effective in controlling the increased convict population. An agreement was made that the ratio of soldiers to convicts would be increased, and they returned to duties. Whilst some convicts were kept in gaol within Hobart Town, secondary sites such as Sarah Island and Port Arthur were later created to spread the convict labour to more isolated regions, and for the purpose of stricter confinement for <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders.</b>|$|E

500|$|Between 1533 and 1540, the Tudor King Henry VIII {{took control}} of the English Church from Rome, the start of several decades of {{religious}} tension in England. [...] English Catholics struggled in a society dominated by the newly separate and increasingly Protestant Church of England. [...] Henry's daughter, Elizabeth I, responded to the growing religious divide by introducing the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, which required anyone appointed to a public or church office to swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the Church and state. The penalties for refusal were severe; fines were imposed for recusancy, and <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders</b> risked imprisonment and execution. [...] Catholicism became marginalised, but despite the threat of torture or execution, priests continued to practise their faith in secret.|$|E
500|$|Scouting {{sex abuse}} cases are {{situations}} where youth involved in Scouting {{programs have been}} sexually abused by someone who is also involved in the Scouting program. J.L.

[...] Several reports have surfaced over the years regarding incidents of sexual abuse within the Boy Scouts of America to include incidents of <b>repeat</b> <b>offenders.</b> There have also been several high-profile court cases that resulted in convictions and settlements involving such incidents. [...] On October 19, 2012, the Boy Scouts of America were forced by court order to release over 20,000 pages of documentation on 1200 alleged child sexual abuse cases within the organization from between 1965 and 1985.|$|E

50|$|Another {{study that}} looked at public attitudes toward {{transferring}} juveniles to adult {{court found that}} {{the seriousness of the}} crime is {{the most important factor in}} public attitudes shifting toward approval of transfer. The two other most important factors include age of offender and the offender's criminal history. However, seriousness of offense and age of offender outweigh whether the juvenile is a 1st time or a <b>repeat</b> <b>offender</b> in attitudes toward transfer. Whether <b>repeat</b> <b>offender</b> or not the psychological and mental state of the child has everything to do with whether the child will repeat the offense over again. transferring from juvenile to criminal can make the matter worse and can cause more psychological damage from the isolation and the oppressed feelings of not being able to be redeemed.|$|R
