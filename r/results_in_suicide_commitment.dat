40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to determine how different print media styles portray cyber-bullying reported to have <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>suicide.</b> Analysing how the print media portray the issue is essential because of the research, which evidences the influence the print media have, on individuals and their perceptions, as well as understandings of phenomena. For instance, some of the risks relating to how the print media report cases of suicide are outcomes, such as, copycat or imitation suicides. This is noted, particularly, in instances where the newspaper sensationalises the story. The findings of this study are a valuable resource for future research. Future studies can utilise the media's portrayals, which this study has evidenced, to then investigate how individuals in society interpret these portrayals. The thematic analysis of the two most-read tabloids and two most-read broadsheets reveal through comparison four key themes; word choice, stylized presentation, anonymity and the technology age gap. Each theme suggests that the broadsheets and tabloids differently portray cyber-bullying reported to have <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>suicide...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the factors and process underlying agrarian distress in Kerala by undertaking {{the case studies}} of three villages situated in Wayanad and Idukki districts namely, Cherumad, Kappikkunnu and Upputhara. The impact of distress on household livelihoods and indebtedness and how they cope up with the situation are examined with entire village and intra village analysis of data. The process of agrarian distress which <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>suicides</b> were analysed through a few in-depth studies. Decline in crops yield, coupled with sharp fall in their prices, created severe distress in all sections of agricultural population. Many household cope with these distresses by reducing household expenditure, diversifying their household incomes and searching for jobs in other places. Meanwhile, government interventions in terms of PDS, health care provision, education and supply of drinking water gave some relief to the affected persons. However, these measures could not completely prevent the occurrence of suicides {{among the members of}} agrarian households. The paper shows that the villages in which household income are more diversified and social networks much stronger, the distress conditions did not <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>suicides.</b> Mitigation of agrarian distress requires not only for debt relief but also implementation of long term strategies containing policies to promote price stability, ecological sustainability of agriculture, strengthening of formal rural credit and support networks, and income and employment generation programmes.

Also, in suicidal behaviour, a proinflammatory state has been suggested to be of importance for the pathophysiology. There is a genetic susceptibility to suicidal behaviour, but studies with respect to genes related to inflammation are sparse. We have previously reported an association between a polymorphism located in the CRP gene, + 1444 C>T (rs 1130864), and the personality trait impulsiveness in women assessed using the Karolinska Scales of Personality.

5000|$|Honor {{killing is}} a form of {{domestic}} violence, a traditional practice involving the murder of a woman for bringing shame upon the family, often for reasons such as the refusal to enter an arranged marriage, attempt to leave a marriage, adultery, becoming a victim of rape, or for disobeying social norms. Dowry violence is another variation, denoting violence out of a husband's family's dissatisfaction with dowry provided by a wife. Dowry violence has often <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>suicides</b> and bride burning. While the practice is more prevalent in cultures where women are regarded by religion as second class citizens, honor killing occurs worldwide. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the United Nations estimated that almost 5000 women fall victims to honor killings every year.|$|R

Behavioral psychologist Friedrich V. Wenz measured seasonal effects on suicide rates and researched the association between seasonal effects and psychopathology. Wenz [...] "investigated the relation of 2 components of loneliness, present and future loneliness, to seasonality of suicide attempts". Wenz’s empirical literature states that suicide attempts from feelings of loneliness were highest in spring and summer and lowest in winter. On the other hand, “The mean scale scores for present and future loneliness were greatest for spring and winter, the peak seasons for the timing of suicide attempts…persons may actually postpone acts of attempted <b>suicide</b> <b>in</b> order to participate and become emotionally involved in important annual ceremonies”.|$|R
