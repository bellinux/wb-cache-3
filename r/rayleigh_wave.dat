5000|$|The term Rayleigh-Lamb waves {{embraces the}} <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>wave,</b> {{a type of}} wave that propagates along a single surface. Both Rayleigh and Lamb waves are {{constrained}} by the elastic properties of the surface(s) that guide them.|$|E
50|$|The elastic {{constants}} often {{change with}} depth, {{due to the}} changing properties of the material. This means that the velocity of a <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>wave</b> in practice becomes dependent on the wavelength (and therefore frequency), a phenomenon referred to as dispersion. Waves affected by dispersion have a different wave train shape. Rayleigh waves on ideal, homogeneous and flat elastic solids show no dispersion, as stated above. However, if a solid or structure has a density or sound velocity that varies with depth, Rayleigh waves become dispersive. One example is Rayleigh waves on the Earth's surface: those waves with a higher frequency travel more slowly than those with a lower frequency. This occurs because a <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>wave</b> of lower frequency has a relatively long wavelength. The displacement of long wavelength waves penetrates more deeply into the Earth than short wavelength waves. Since the speed of waves in the Earth increases with increasing depth, the longer wavelength (low frequency) waves can travel faster than the shorter wavelength (high frequency) waves. Rayleigh waves thus often appear spread out on seismograms recorded at distant earthquake recording stations. It is also possible to observe <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>wave</b> dispersion in thin films or multi-layered structures.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{nonlinearity}} in earthquake is {{investigated for}} the propagating seismic waves instead of linear waves. Assuming {{the presence of}} nonlinear effects in this earthquake modeling, the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves</b> are formed by incorporating the nonlinear sine-Gordon equation into the linear asymptotic governing equations for finding similarity reduction. The existence of reduction to the modified asymptotic governing equations is demonstrated and is consequently shown to give both the linear and nonlinear <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves</b> solutions. The related velocity and amplitude dependent <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves</b> are obtained and also the nonlinear form of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves.</b> Multiple nonlinear surface displacements are identified. These nonlinear waves are shown to leave the trails of crucial surface displacements...|$|R
50|$|Because <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves</b> are surface waves, the {{amplitude}} of such waves generated by an earthquake generally decreases exponentially with {{the depth of}} the hypocenter (focus). However, large earthquakes may generate <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves</b> that travel around the Earth several times before dissipating.|$|R
30|$|Since both {{body and}} <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves</b> may {{contribute}} to the Green function in this frequency range, there is no direct evidence to distinguish that which is dominant in the observed ACF. If we assume the backscattered <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves</b> to be a cause of the temporal change, a possible location of the velocity change should be at around the ground surface. Isochrones for <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves</b> at lag times of 6, 8, and 10 s are located at a horizontal distance of 6, 8, and 10 km from the station, respectively, assuming 2 km/s as a group velocity of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves.</b> Due to the sensitivity of <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves</b> in depth, the maximum depth of velocity change is limited to about 1 km in this frequency range. If the constituents of the ACF are <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>waves,</b> the non-linear effect in the sediment layer at just above of the hypocenter could be one reason for the velocity change. However, the location of velocity change is 6 – 10 km from the station; this may be too far from the epicenter, especially for the second activity that occurred at beneath the OITA 2 station.|$|R

After assuming a free surface boundary where no stresses or strains cross, the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>wave</b> equation is simplified.

5000|$|The zero-order antisymmetric mode (designated a0) {{is highly}} {{dispersive}} {{in the low}} frequency regime where it is properly called the [...] "flexural mode" [...] or the [...] "bending mode". For very low frequencies (very thin plates) the phase and group velocities are both proportional to the square root of the frequency; the group velocity is twice the phase velocity. This simple relationship {{is a consequence of}} the stiffness/thickness relationship for thin plates in bending. At higher frequencies where the wavelength is no longer much greater than the plate thickness, these relationships break down. The phase velocity rises less and less quickly and converges towards the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>wave</b> velocity in the high frequency limit. The group velocity passes through a maximum, a little faster than the shear wave velocity, when the wavelength is approximately equal to the plate thickness. It then converges, from above, to the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>wave</b> velocity in the high frequency limit. In experiments that allow both extensional and flexural modes to be excited and detected, the extensional mode often appears as a higher-velocity, lower-amplitude precursor to the flexural mode. The flexural mode is the more easily excited of the two, and often carries most of the energy.|$|E
