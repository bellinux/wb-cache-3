40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the processes of}} eye movements during simple sight-reading tasks, concentrating on the processing of melodic groups separated by larger intervals {{and the effects of}} metrical placement of such groups. Thirty-two participants with varying musical background sight-read eight short melodies in two separate sessions. Eye movements during playing were recorded using an eye-tracker, and the performances on an electric piano with sequencer software. The melodies in question were of two types: melodic groupings were either aligned with the metrical divisions or made to overlap with them. The results indicate that <b>reinspections</b> to previously fixated notes during sight-reading increased with previous musical experience. During the performance of a single melody, the alignment of melodic groups with metrical units led to a gradual decrease of <b>reinspections.</b> Within the melodic groups themselves, the second notes of the groups received the largest total processing times. In addition, processing differences for notes involved in larger melodic intervals emerged depending on the visual placement of the notes within, or below, the staff system. Possible explanations of these findings as well as implications for future sight-reading studies will be discussed...|$|R

The inhibition-of-return (IOR) phenom-enon indexes the tendency to avoid <b>reinspections.</b> Two accounts of IOR, that it is due to inhibition {{and that it is}} due to expectation, are generally regarded as incompatible. The relevant evidence to date, however, has been indirect: Inhibition or expectation has been inferred from response times or similar indirect measures. This article reports the first direct measure of IOR, obtained by asking observers to predict the location of the next target in a display containing eight possible locations on an imaginary circle. On any given trial, the previously cued locationwas chosen less frequently (impairment) —and the opposite location was chosen more frequently (facilitation) —than chanc...|$|R

40|$|Software {{inspection}} play {{a crucial}} role in achieving high quality software right from the beginning. Especially for requirements documents inspections are beneficial as defects can be detected and removed at an early point in time before they can leak into subsequent phases of the development process, where those defects can cause high rework cost and quality problems [Boehm and Basili, 2001]. In order to fully exploit the beneficial aspect of inspections it is necessary to control them: Based on an analysis of the inspection effectiveness (e. g., what type or number of defects have been detected and what type and number might be remaining) it has to be decided whether development can proceed as planned or controlling actions, such as <b>reinspections,</b> have to be performed. Defect classification is a technique that can support this activity. Using appropriate defect classification schemes it is possible to get a quantitative statement of the inspection effectiveness (i. e., what type of defects have been found). Examples in the literature demonstrated beneficial applications but are hard to adopt without tailoring the underlying defect classification scheme to the environment. In this report a defect classification scheme is developed that is to support the control of the inspection of QUASAR requirements documents. In particular we discuss our approach to define the scheme, its underlying rationale, the scheme itself, and our experience from using it in a case study. The scheme consist of two defect attributes that are to be used when inspecting use cases and recording defects in these documents, and three attributes for state chart documents...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{products}} {{have become more}} and more talked- about in today’s industrial world. The demand for organic products is increasing and the market is continuing to grow bigger. It is important to maintain what these products stand for, being environmental friendly, and to do so strict certification policies are needed. EU has today an international certification body called Regulation (EC) 834 / 2007 that needs to be followed for export to and within EU. Parts of Tanzania today have certification of some organic products but not in Babati, that lies in the northern of Tanzania in Manyara region where this case study was done. In Babati most of the farmers are smallholder farmers and many of them, founds it difficult to afford an international certification. For the smallholder farmers to get a certification there are two alternatives. One is to go together with other smallholder farmers and apply for a certification like EUs Regulation (EC) 834 / 2007 as a group and then get to pay lower fees. The other alternative is to go together and start local certification bodies that have fees that are adjusted to local farmers’ income. This case study was conducted between February and March of 2010 in villages around Babati and Babati town. Interviews were held with both organic- and non organic farmers. My goal was to find out if it was possible for Babati to develop the organic agriculture and have an organic market in the future. My conclusion ends up by perceiving that Babati has a very good chance of fulfilling the Regulation (EC) 834 / 2007 standards. However the farmers’ economical status is an obstacle for the farmers to get an international certification, because of the high cost in inspections and <b>reinspections.</b>  But through a local certification body that is adjusted to the smallholder farmers and the environment the farmers can get their certificate and the organic market can be developed in Babati. ...|$|R

Rapp; 1 {{computer file}} (PDF); vi, 104 pages, appendices A-B. The {{question of how}} interesting but irrelevant textual information (i. e., seductive details) in a multi-topic scientific text influences the processes and products of comprehension was explored in three experiments. In Experiment 1, participants read a multi-topic informational text on lightning and tornado formation and rated each sentence for importance and interest. In Experiment 2, participants read the text with or without seductive details and completed a free recall. Participants who received the seductive details version of the text demonstrated a seductive details effect (e. g., Harp & Mayer, 1998; Peshkam, Mensink, Putnam, & Rapp, 2011), in which they recalled significantly less important information compared to controls. In Experiment 3, participants read the seductive details version of the text while wearing a head-mounted eye tracker. Prior to reading the text, participants also received prereading questions designed to focus their attention on one topic (e. g., lightning formation) over the other (e. g., tornado formation). In addition, participants completed a test of their working memory capacity (WMC) {{in the form of}} a reading span test (RSPAN), and recieved either a general instruction to freely recall the text or two specific recall instructions for each topic. In terms of online processes, the results indicated that participants allocated additional attention to information introduced by the prereading instructions, in the form of increased <b>reinspections</b> and look-backs. However, attention to seductive details was not reduced by these instructions. In terms of offline products, participants recalled significantly more information from the text that was introduced by the prereading instructions, compared to information that was not mentioned in those instructions. Seductive details were also well recalled for participants receiving free recall instructions. Yet, production of seductive details was significantly reduced when participants received specific recall instructions. In addition, participants with high working memory capacities also produced significantly less seductive content as compared to participants with low working memory capacities. These findings suggest that although seductive details are irresistibly alluring during comprehension, that allure might not be similarly demonstrated upon recall-driven reflection...|$|R

40|$|After a {{software}} inspection the project manager {{has to decide}} whether a product has sufficient quality {{to pass on to}} the next software development stage or whether a second inspection cycle, a <b>reinspection,</b> is likely to sufficiently improve its quality. The <b>reinspection</b> decision of recent research focused on the estimation of product quality after inspection, which does not take in to account the effect of a <b>reinspection.</b> Thus we propose to use estimation models for the quality improvement during <b>reinspection</b> and the cost and benefit of a <b>reinspection</b> as basis for the <b>reinspection</b> decision.

The main finding of the investigation is that the product-quality criterion is likely to force products to be reinspected, if a large number of defects were detected in the first inspection. Further the product-quality criterion is especially sensitive to an underestimation of the number of defects in the product and will let bad products pass as good. The cost-benefit criterion is less sensitive to estimation error than the product-quality criterion and should in practice be used as second opinion, if a product-quality criterion is applied...|$|E
