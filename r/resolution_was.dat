5|$|The hard X-ray and {{low-energy}} gamma-ray SIGMA {{telescope was}} {{a collaboration between}} CESR (Toulouse) and CEA (Saclay). It covered the energy range 35–1300keV, with an effective area of 800cm2 and a maximum sensitivity field of view of ~5°5°. The maximum angular <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> 15arcmin. The energy <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> 8% at 511keV. Its imaging capabilities were derived from the association of a coded mask and a position sensitive detector based on the Anger camera principle.|$|E
5|$|This <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> outlawed and {{replaced}} by Law N 288-З on May 18, 2004.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{a simple}} <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> a {{legislative}} measure passed by only either the Senate or the House. As {{they have been}} passed by only one house, simple <b>resolutions</b> <b>are</b> not presented to the President, {{and do not have}} the force of law. The <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> used for matters such as establishing the rules under which each body will operate. This type of <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> used to act or speak on behalf of only one chamber of congress.|$|R
5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was split {{on whether to}} purge its leadership of communists. Norman Thomas, John Haynes Holmes, and Morris Ernst were anti-communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from communism; opposing them were Harry Ward, Corliss Lamont and Elizabeth Flynn who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateElizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> {{considered by many to}} be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> not {{as strong}} as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to {{threaten}} to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would take him from Gunston Hall.|$|E
5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, Romania also agreed {{to resolve the issue}} of Jewish Emancipation. The {{government}} pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E
50|$|Display <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> {{the number}} of {{distinct}} pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. For a given display size, maximum <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> limited by dot pitch.|$|R
30|$|Inside the B 0 {{field at}} 2.0 V {{overvoltage}} the energy <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 11.45 % (FWHM) and the CRT is 250 ps (FWHM). At 2.5 V overvoltage, the energy <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 11.15 % (FWHM) and the CRT is 240 ps (FWHM). During the heavy z-gradient sequence the energy <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> degraded by 4.1 % at 2 V and 9.2 % at 2.5 V. The {{degradation of the}} CRT is 25 % at 2 V and 52 % at 2.5 V OV. During standard TSE and EPI sequences the CRT and energy <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> not influenced.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{hypothesis}} that a numerical model with variables of mixed spatial <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> {{as accurate as}} one having variables of equally high <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> tested using a global, barotropic, free-surface primitive-equations model and the spectral formulation of Bourke. It is found that models with some variables of high resolution and others of low <b>resolution</b> <b>are</b> superior to one having uniformly medium resolution...|$|R
5|$|HMS <b>Resolution</b> <b>was</b> a Royal Sovereign-class pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the Royal Navy. The {{ship was}} built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, starting with her keel laying in June 1890. She was launched in May 1892 and, after completing trials, was commissioned into the Channel Squadron the following December. She was armed with a main battery of four 13.5-inch guns and a secondary battery of ten 6-inch guns. The ship had {{a top speed of}} 16.5 knots.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Congress {{passed a}} {{resolution}} authorizing President George Washington to establish a mint. Feeling that the <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> inadequate, President Washington asked legislators to pass a comprehensive law which would govern the new facility. The result was the Mint Act of 1792, which prescribed the specifications of the new US coins, the highest denomination being the eagle, or ten-dollar piece.|$|E
5|$|In March 1898, a <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} in Congress for {{a commission to}} erect a monument to Lafayette in Paris {{on behalf of the}} United States. The bill passed the Senate, and hearings were held before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Chicago businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Peck testified in support of the bill, which though favored by the committee was not considered by the House due to higher priorities during the Spanish–American War.|$|E
30|$|It {{follows that}} {{frequency}} shifts which are multiples of the FFT resolution (FFT bin spacing) {{can be implemented}} through shifting the FFT of the input signal. If this <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> not sufficient in the Doppler search, then improved <b>resolution</b> can <b>be</b> reached by taking the FFT for the received baseband signal with partial Doppler removal. In the GPS case, the FFT <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> commonly 1 kHz, while 500 -Hz Doppler <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> targeted at the acquisition stage.|$|R
5000|$|... 5K <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> {{horizontal}} <b>resolution</b> {{of about}} 5,000 pixels. The most common 5K <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 5120 × 2880, {{which has an}} aspect ratio of 16:9 and is about 14.7 million pixels (just over seven times as many pixels as 1080p Full HD). This <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> typically used in computer monitors, {{and is not a}} standard format in digital television and digital cinematography, which feature 4K resolutions and 8K resolutions.|$|R
50|$|In particular, {{information}} on <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> essential to understand quantum mechanical systems, and in scale relativity, <b>resolutions</b> <b>are</b> included in coordinate systems, {{so it seems}} a logical and promising approach to account for quantum phenomena.|$|R
5|$|International governments, {{leaders and}} public figures also convey their {{greetings}} on the occasion. Overseas dignitaries are invited as chief guests in ceremonies, while foreign military contingents often participate in parades. National flags are displayed on major roads and avenues such as Shahrah-e-Faisal, Shahara-e-Quaideen, and Mazar-e-Quaid Road, {{leading up to}} Jinnah's mausoleum in Karachi. Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore, where the Pakistan <b>Resolution</b> <b>was</b> passed in 1940, is fully illuminated {{on the eve of}} the independence day to signify its importance in the creation of Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The ART-S X-ray spectrometer, {{also built}} by the IKI, covered the energy range 3 to 100keV. Its field of view was 2° by 2°. The {{instrument}} consisted of four detectors based on spectroscopic MWPCs, making an effective area of 2,400cm² at 10keV and 800cm² at 100keV. The time <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> 200 microseconds.|$|E
5|$|The adverse results {{momentarily}} {{put a stop}} to Republican {{calls to}} impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E
50|$|The Ninety-Two <b>Resolutions</b> <b>were</b> {{drafted by}} Louis-Joseph Papineau {{and other members}} of the Parti patriote of Lower Canada in 1834. The <b>resolutions</b> <b>were</b> a long series of demands for {{political}} reforms in the British-governed colony.|$|R
30|$|The {{influence}} of <b>resolution</b> reduction <b>is</b> smallest on long wave-length components and is largest for Y 1 in both elevation and slope cases. Table 5 and Figure 3 {{a show that}} in the elevation case, the sill value of Y 1 reduced to 72.6 % of the 5 m case when <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 50 m. Y 2 and Y 3 seem to have be stable and the reduction of sill when the <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 50 m is less than 5 % of the 5 m case. Table VI and Figure 3 b show that in slope case, the sill value of Y 1 reduced to 18.1 % of the 5 m case when <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 50 m. The sill value of Y 2 reduced to 82.2 % of the 5 m case when the <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 50 m and the sill value of Y 3 reduced to 99.5 % of the 5 m case when the <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 50 m.|$|R

5|$|The {{resolution}} {{called on}} the North to immediately halt its invasion and to move its troops back to the 38th parallel. Seen as a diplomatic victory for the United States, the <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> completely ignored by North Korea. This brought the UN and the US to take further action, setting the state for massive international involvement {{and the expansion of}} the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|The {{resolution}} {{requires that}} Syria eliminate its chemical stockpile and allow complete access to UN and OPCW chemical weapons inspectors. If {{it does not}} comply with either demand, the Security Council would need to adopt a second resolution regarding imposition of military or other actions against Syria under the UN Charter's Chapter VII. The vote on the <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> delayed until 27 September because the OPCW needed to vote first on its detailed implementation plan. Syria vowed {{to abide by the}} resolution.|$|E
5|$|The <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> {{unanimously}} {{recommended by}} the City Council's Police and Fire Committee on October 6, 1997 and passed unanimously by the full City Council on October 28, 1997.

40|$|Evaluation of the Rapid-Sampling Vertical Profiler, {{which was}} {{developed}} for sampling the hydrophysical fields in the upper ocean from a moving vessel, shows that the instrument is useful for near-microscale measurements of temperature and salinity and also for turbulent kinetic energy dissipation measurements with airfoil probes. A depth of 200 meters is reached from a ship moving at 6 knots. The vertical <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 3 cm, the temperature <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 0. 5 millidegrees, the salinity <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 0. 6 parts per million, and the sigma-t <b>resolution</b> <b>is</b> 0. 0004. (The estimates given for <b>resolution</b> <b>are</b> 99 percent confidence limits on series of 3 -cm samples.) The instrument falls with a speed uniform within 20 percent in an orientation within a few degrees of vertical. Vibrations within the dissipation range of turbulence are sufficiently small to permit the measurement of turbulence with airfoil probes in many regions of the ocean...|$|R

5|$|By May 1947, {{authorities}} in Vojvodina {{noted that there}} was a dispute between them and the {{authorities in}} Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and that the federal authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further attention as its <b>resolution</b> <b>was</b> discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E
