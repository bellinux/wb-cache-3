40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} are to develop and evaluate advanced processing technologies that can {{reduce the cost of}} upgrading sub quality natural gas to pipeline standards. The successful application of cost-effective, new technologies will facilitate the production of sub quality natural gas that otherwise would be too expensive to produce. The overall program is focused on the following activities: evaluation of the potential of structured packing for the removal of acid gases from natural gases, and expansion of the currently available database of the fluid dynamics of rotating gas liquid contactors. The natural gas sweetening, structured packing field tests are scheduled to be conducted in calendar year 1995. Design, procurement and construction of the field test unit. Expansion of the available data base on the hydraulic characteristics of a rotating gas-liquid contactor is being pursued through a series of laboratory experiments. A 100 GPM, low pressure <b>rotary</b> <b>contactor</b> system has been assembled at IGT`s Energy Development Center to examine the fluid dynamic behavior of this type of contactor. The studies are determining the effects of liquid viscosity, liquid surface tension and operating conditions on liquid residence times and flooding limits...|$|E
40|$|The mass {{transfer}} and hydrodynamic {{characteristics of a}} packed <b>rotary</b> <b>contactor</b> with a continuous liquid phase for the de-oxygenation of water using a stripping gas has been investigated. The primary purpose {{of this research was}} to gain a clearer understanding of the physical processes that occur within packings between the gas and liquid phases in an increased gravitational environment. The eventual aim is to design and develop a more efficient and cost effective industrial piece of equipment for the removal of dissolved oxygen from river or sea water. The {{mass transfer}} between two phases {{is directly related to the}} interfacial area which, in turn, is dependant on the gas bubble size. The use of centrifugal acceleration to generate increased gravitational environments leads to smaller bubbles being produced, with subsequent improvements in the mass transfer. In order to produce this increased gravitational environment, a one metre diameter rotor filled with a torus shaped packing was rotated between 200 and 400 rpm, with the gas phase dispersed in the liquid phase and passing through counter-currently. An examination of the overall gas and liquid flow through the packing in the rotor using visual and tracer techniques has been made which shows that the gas nozzle design and liquid flowrate are the two dominant parameters in achieving an effective and uniform distribution throughout. The gas bubble sizes produced have been visually analysed throughout the packing, and found to range from between 0. 4 - 1. 0 mm. in diameter. The mass transfer achieved in the rotor showed general trends of increasing with the gas flowrate and rotational speed, whilst falling as the liquid flowrate increased. For the entire range of rotor opemting conditions, the number of mass transfer units achieved was found to be in the range 1. 5 - 4. 5, and the corresponding height of a transfer unit between 4. 5 - 12 cm.

25|$|Static and {{agitated}} {{cultures are}} conventional ways to produce bacterial cellulose. Both static and agitated cultures are not feasible for large-scale production as static cultures {{have a long}} culture period as well as intensive manpower and agitated cultures produce cellulose-negative mutants alongside its reactions due to rapid growth. Thus, reactors are designed to lessen culture time and inhibit the conversion of bacterial cellulose-producing strains into cellulose-negative mutants. Common reactors used are the rotating disk reactor, the <b>rotary</b> biofilm <b>contactor</b> (RBC), a bioreactor equipped with a spin filter, and a reactor with a silicone membrane.|$|R
40|$|Regarding the {{important}} role of static hold-up in both hydrodynamic and mass transfer rate in extraction columns, average static hold-up has been studied in a <b>Rotary</b> Disc <b>Contactor</b> (RDC) as a function of rotor speed, average mother drop size and number of stages using several chemical systems. In the light of the promising potential of nanofluids in mass transfer applications, in a quite novel investigation, nanofluids were applied as dispersed phases to the RDC column. Two types of SiO 2 nanoparticles with different hydrophobicities were employed in nanofluids preparation, which stabilities were appraised by sedimentation method and UV-vis spectrophotometry. Transmission Electron Microscopy was also applied to examine {{the size and shape of}} SiO 2 nanoparticles...|$|R

Besides, domestic wastewater contains high total solid causing turbidity and decrease penetration of sunlight for organism photosynthetic. So that needs processing that can be removed by reactor <b>Rotary</b> Biological <b>Contactor</b> (RBC) for standard environment. RBC a reactor that consists of several discs rotates with certain rotation speed. At the discs rotate, part of the discs removes the organic material from wastewater. At the discs contact with the air biomass adsorbs oxygen so that reached aerobic condition.

40|$|An {{integrated}} system of simultaneous fermentation-adsorption {{for the production}} and recovery of fumaric acid from glucose by Rhizopus oryzae was investigated. The system was constructed such that growing Rhizopus mycelia were self-immobilized on the plastic discs of a <b>rotary</b> biofilm <b>contactor</b> during the nitrogen-rich growth phase. During the nongrowth, production phase, the biofilm was alternately exposed to liquid medium and air upon rotation of the discs in the horizontal fermentation vessel. The product of fermentation, fumaric acid, was removed simultaneously and continuously by a coupled adsorption column, thereby moderating inhibition, enhancing the fermentation rate, and sustaining cell viability. Another beneficial effect of the removal of fumaric acid is release of hydroxyl ions from a polyvinyl pyridine adsorbent into the circulating fermentation broth. This moderates the decrease in pH that would otherwise occur. Polyvinyl pyridine and IRA- 900 gave the highest loading {{for this type of}} fermentation. This fermentation system is capable of producing fumaric acid with an average yield of 85 g/liter from 100 g of glucose per liter within 20 h under repetitive fed-batch cycles. On a weight yield basis, 91 % of the theoretical maximum was obtained with a productivity of 4. 25 g/liter/h. This is in contrast to stirred-tank fermentation supplemented with calcium carbonate, whose average weight yield was 65 % after 72 h with a productivity of 0. 9 g/liter/h. The immobilized reactor was operated repetitively for 2 weeks without loss of biological activity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Cells grow on high area foam and, when {{a screen}} is put around the foam, {{it is made}} heavier {{so it can be}} fluidized. When foam is rotated in a half full RBC (<b>rotary</b> {{biological}} <b>contactor),</b> drops are formed and mass transfer of oxygen to drops is much faster. Most fungi and some mammalian cells need oxygen. Corrugated fibers with holes in the valleys also produce drops. White rot fungus needs oxygen and it degrades many chlorine compounds, azo dyes, PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), and TNT. Old cardboard boxes are readily available and when buried in soil, oxygen is entrapped. In a lake, the boxes expose high area. Celite entrapped in fibers provides even more area. Fibers have high surface area for immobilizing cells and, when the fibers are rotated, fast reactions occur, converting one chemical to another. Sugar has been fermented to alcohol in 10 - 15 minutes. Ethanol has high octane and does not need lead. Old cars and trucks still use lead, and high levels have been found in the drinking water of several large cities. Bacteria on fibers can remove lead in a few seconds. When an RBC of plain fiber discs is rotated and a light shone in the top, the light hits a thin moving film to degrade chlorine compounds and sterilize water. Titania can be fused to the fiberglass discs. Microbes and light remove sulfur from oil. Calcium magnesium acetate is a non-corrosive road deicer.
