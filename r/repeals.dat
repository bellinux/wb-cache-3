5|$|It {{is true that}} <b>repeals</b> by {{implication}} are not favored, but we cannot escape the conclusion that, tested by its scope, its obvious purpose, and its terms, the act of March 3, 1891, covers the whole subject-matter under consideration, and furnishes the exclusive rule in respect of appellate jurisdiction on appeal, writ of error or certificate.|$|E
50|$|A <b>repeal</b> is {{the removal}} or {{reversal}} of a law. There {{are two basic}} types of <b>repeal,</b> a <b>repeal</b> with a re-enactment (or replacement) of the <b>repealed</b> law, or a <b>repeal</b> without any replacement.|$|R
5000|$|If a {{campaign}} for the <b>repeal</b> of a particular law gains particular momentum, an advocate of the <b>repeal</b> might become known as a [...] "repealer". The <b>Repeal</b> Association in 19th-century Ireland advocated Irish independence through <b>repeal</b> of the Acts of Union 1800.|$|R
50|$|The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act was <b>repealed</b> by the Discriminatory Legislation {{regarding}} Public Amenities <b>Repeal</b> Act, 1990, and the Population Registration Act was <b>repealed</b> by the Population Registration Act <b>Repeal</b> Act, 1991, but {{the racial}} classifications {{remained on the}} population register until 1992.|$|R
5|$|The Act {{includes}} {{a number of}} miscellaneous points, mainly in Sections 5 and 6. The Act and its provisions are taken to extend to The Crown, which can be held tortiously liable to the extent {{laid out in the}} Crown Proceedings Act 1947. It <b>repeals</b> Section 4 of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, replacing it with Section 4 of this Act, and unlike the 1957 Act does not allow any provisions or duties to be excluded or restricted.|$|E
5|$|Under Section 16, the Act {{applies to}} {{servants}} of the crown, while Section 17 <b>repeals</b> all previous common law and statutory offences relating to bribery, {{replacing them with}} provisions of the Act. Section 18 provides that the Act applies to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; while the separate consent of the Scottish Parliament is usually required in such cases, as is made clear in Section 19, a Legislative Consent Motion was passed on 11 February 2010, allowing {{for the application of}} the Act within Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar <b>repeals</b> in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E
60|$|First, then: If {{that country}} was {{in need of}} a {{territorial}} organization, could it not have had it as well without as with a <b>repeal?</b> Iowa and Minnesota, to both of which the Missouri restriction applied, had, without its <b>repeal,</b> each in succession, territorial organizations. And even the year before, a bill for Nebraska itself was within an ace of passing without the <b>repealing</b> clause, and this {{in the hands of the}} same men who are now the champions of <b>repeal.</b> Why no necessity then for <b>repeal?</b> But still later, when this very bill was first brought in, it contained no <b>repeal.</b> But, say they, because the people had demanded, or rather commanded, the <b>repeal,</b> the <b>repeal</b> was to accompany the organization whenever that should occur.|$|R
50|$|Council members M.C. Keegan-Ayer and Jessica Fitzwater {{introduced}} a bill to <b>repeal</b> an ordinance designating English as the county's official language. Rather than <b>repeal</b> the ordinance altogether, Chmelik suggested keeping the ordinance in place while asking Council members to only <b>repeal</b> offensive parts of it. The Council did not approve Chmelik's idea. The bill to <b>repeal</b> the ordinance passed; Chmelik voted against the <b>repeal.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a 2000 Alabama {{referendum}} on <b>repealing</b> the 1901 state constitutional ban on interracial marriage, over 40% {{of the participating}} electorate voted against <b>repealing</b> the ban. While the ban was rendered unenforceable following Loving v. Virginia, the 40.51% of the populace voting against the <b>repeal</b> [...] In 1998, South Carolina voters voted 61.95%-38.05% in favor of <b>repealing</b> their own constitutional ban. Harvard University professor Werner Sollors intimated that the laws took so long after Loving to be <b>repealed</b> because of the complex clauses which required large majorities in order to <b>repeal</b> them.|$|R
5|$|The Bribery Act 2010 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} the {{criminal}} law relating to bribery. Introduced to Parliament in the Queen's Speech in 2009 after several decades of reports and draft bills, the Act received the Royal Assent on 8 April 2010 following cross-party support. Initially scheduled to enter into force in April 2010, this was changed to 1 July 2011. The Act <b>repeals</b> all previous statutory and common law provisions in relation to bribery, instead replacing them with the crimes of bribery, being bribed, the bribery of foreign public officials, {{and the failure of}} a commercial organisation to prevent bribery on its behalf.|$|E
5|$|The act {{has also}} faced {{challenges}} and opposition. In 2009, Senator Ted Kennedy died, {{and the resultant}} special election cost the Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof Senate majority before the ACA had been fully passed by Congress. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in 2012 that states could choose {{not to participate in}} the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole. The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial <b>repeals</b> of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim plurality of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained plurality support by 2017.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{the task}} force unit, she fights the head of Tower's {{security}} forces Kutō, killing him after he uses a vial of Saya's blood to transform into an Elder Bairn hybrid. Finding Fumito in the building's basement, she also finds Kuroto with him, before succumbing to a drug given by Kuroto. Fumito and Kuroto were working together, with each killing the others' families {{to take control of}} Tower and Seventh Heaven, and Saya also learns that the Elder Bairn who tried to kill Mana was Mana's father. Fumito reveals he intends to dissolve Shrovetide with Saya's help as the ratio of humans to Elder Bairns has shifted drastically due to the Elder Bairn seemingly dying out. When Kuroto attempts to kill him for abandoning his role, Fumito stabs him with a phial of Saya's blood, transforming Kuroto into an Elder Bairn seed. As Saya recovers from the drug, Fumito fuses with the seed, which hatches into a giant Elder Bairn which Saya slays. A weakened Fumito reveals that he transformed himself into an Elder Bairn hybrid to become closer to Saya and free her from her oath not to feed on humans. Accepting that he has lost their wager, he impales himself on Saya's sword. Saddened at being left alone again, Saya does not return to SIRRUT, instead opting to disappear. In the aftermath, Yūka becomes Tokyo's governor and <b>repeals</b> the Youth Ordinance Bill, the members of SIRRUT return to a normal life, and Mana begins searching for Saya.|$|E
