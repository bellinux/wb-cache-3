5|$|In their 2002 book Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management authors {{orthopedic}} surgeon Edward S. Rachlin and physical therapist Isabel Rachlin <b>recommended</b> <b>use</b> of the Magic Wand for self-treatment by patients with myalgia. They wrote that {{continued use of}} the Magic Wand on myofascial trigger points or tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount of discomfort felt by patients. Rachlin and Rachlin suggested that such treatment {{could be done in}} one's residence outside of a clinical setting.|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities, authors Kate Naphtali and Edith MacHattie of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the {{supervision}} of doctors Andrei Krassioukov and Stacy L Elliott <b>recommended</b> <b>use</b> of the Magic Wand in sexual activity for people with disabilities. The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities.|$|E
500|$|In a 2004 article {{published}} in Dermatology Online Journal, authors reported on use of the Magic Wand to help alleviate pain before cosmetic and dermatologic techniques performed by clinicians. The authors described use of the device to decrease discomfort before procedures including supplementing anesthesia with the injection of triamcinolone acetonide into the proximal nail fold for psoriasis, decreasing discomfort during a Restylane injection of the nasolabial fold, making an intense pulsed light (IPL) facial treatment easier by reducing pain during the procedure, and throughout axillary hyperhidrosis treatment with botulinum toxin. They <b>recommended</b> <b>use</b> of the device with the [...] "Wonder Wand" [...] attachment to provide vibration to a decreased surface area on the patient. Lead researcher Kevin C. Smith explained to Skin & Allergy News that the vibrations when delivered {{to the area of}} the patient's mandible can give relief from discomfort by negating feelings of pain from being sent through the sensory system. Smith and Francisco Perez-Atamoros further elaborated on use of the Magic Wand in Chapter 7 [...] "Other Dermatologic Uses of Botulinum Toxin" [...] of the 2006 compilation book Botulinum Toxin in Clinical Dermatology. They emphasized the beneficial uses of the Magic Wand with the [...] "Wonder Wand" [...] attachment and showed how its vibrations can reduce pain if given just before an injection of Restylane within [...] from the injection site.|$|E

2500|$|Methylisothiazolinone {{and other}} isothiazolinone-derived {{biocides}} {{are used for}} controlling microbial growth in water-containing solutions. [...] Two {{of the most widely}} used isothiazolinone biocides are 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (chloromethylisothiazolinone or CMIT) and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (methylisothiazolinone or MIT), which are the active ingredients in a 3:1 mixture (CMIT:MIT) sold commercially as Kathon. Kathon is supplied to manufacturers as a concentrated stock solution containing from 10-15% of CMIT/MIT. For applications the <b>recommended</b> <b>use</b> level is from 6 ppm to 75 ppm active isothiazolones. Biocidal applications range from industrial water storage tanks to cooling units, in processes as varied as mining, paper manufacturing, metalworking fluids and energy production.|$|E
