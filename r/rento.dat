5000|$|January 7, 2015 {{marked the}} inaugural National Bobblehead Day. In 2016 the Guinness Book of World Records mark for world's largest bobblehead {{was set at}} 15 feet tall. Named [...] "Goldie", it {{was the result of}} a {{collaboration}} between Dino <b>Rentos</b> and BobbleHeads.com.|$|R
5000|$|His first mature {{publication}} was {{the poem}} [...] "El Náufrago" [...] in 1895, although he later disowned it. Greater success came {{with his first}} play, which had been inspired by linguistic considerations. Outraged at the way local dialect had been used as comic relief in Carnival celebrations, Medina had set about to write a serious work in the local Murcian Spanish; the result was El <b>Rento,</b> first performed in 1898. It was very well received by national critics and also by writers such as Miguel de Unamuno and Clarín, and the response encouraged him to explore the possibilities of dialect literature further. Medina gathered the series of poems that he had composed in preparation for El <b>Rento</b> and released them as Aires murcianos, which would become his most famous and successful work. A study of the poorest members of Murcia's rural community, it combined social criticism with inventive use of local language, and led the critic Azorín to write that, if Medina wrote nothing else, that book would be [...] "enough to place him among the great poets of our Parnassus".|$|E
50|$|<b>Rento</b> Hofstede Crull (1863-1938) Dutch {{electrical}} pioneer {{who first}} studied at Mittweida {{and then at}} the Hannover Technische Hochschule (now the University of Hanover) in the 1880s, came first to the United States in the 1890s to work for Elihu Thomson and Thomas Alva Edison,then briefly left for Moscow to establish its first power station, and thereafter came back to the Netherlands to create its power grid and several companies, among then the N.V. Heemaf which was responsible for the invention of the first no brake motor in 1921; he perfected the process for making the manufacturing of rayon viable (See AkzoNobel and the American Enka Company).|$|E
50|$|After his {{retirement}} from racing Medaaly stood as a breeding stallion at the Haras du Logis in Normandy. He was exported to South Africa in 2004 and {{moved back to}} Europe in 2008 to stand in Ireland. The best of his flat performers included Daly Daly (Grand Prix de Vichy) and the Listed race winners Tocopila and <b>Rento.</b> His offspring did better under National Hunt rules and included Medermit (Scilly Isles Novices' Chase, Haldon Gold Cup), Sky's the Limit (Coral Cup) and Shekira (Prix Renaud du Vivier). In March 2011 he suffered a cardiac arrest after covering a mare at the Badger Hill Stud in County Galway and {{died at the age}} of 17.|$|E
50|$|In 1929 Vereinigte Glanzstoff Fabrike (Est. 1899) and Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek (Est. 1911) merged, forming Algemene Kunstzijde Unie (AKU). The latter, {{known as}} the ENKA, is universally {{acknowledged}} as the parent of AkzoNobel, which faced along with others technical problems in the manufacturing of synthetic fibers. Jacques Coenraad Hartogs, {{the founder of the}} Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek (ENKA), turned to Dutch industrialist and friend, <b>Rento</b> Hofstede Crull for a solution for which Hofstede Crull provided the answer. They created a joint venture, the NV I.S.E.M. whose success and profits laid the foundation for the ENKA's subsequent acquisitions and mergers, resulting in the AkzoNobel of today. NV I.S.E.M. was absorbed by the AKU in 1938 with Hofstede Crull's death.|$|E
5000|$|Before Hendrik-Jan Spijker's death, he and {{his brother}} had {{developed}} a special relationship with Dutch electrical pioneer, <b>Rento</b> Hofstede Crull. [...] The Spijker brothers had known Hofstede Crull already {{when he was a young}} man racing on the velocipede circuits in the Netherlands and in Germany while he was an engineering student first in Mittweida and later in Hannover at the Technische Hochschule in the 1880s. Hofstede Crull had already owned his first automobile in the 1890s. In the first decade, he had accumulated a collection of automobiles which included a number of the Spijker racing models. He housed the collection in one of the wings of the [...] N.V.Heemaf, one of the companies he had founded. Although this was all a hobby for him initially, he began assembling Spijkers at Heemaf with the approval of the Spijker brothers and subsequently with that of those who had taken over SPIJKER. He provided them with improvements on the automobiles. Heemaf's board of directors complained that Hofstede Crull was using a part of the factory as his personal garage and auto park. To circumvent the criticism, he established the Spijker Automobiel Verhuur Maatschappij which along with Amsterdam's Trompenburg Bedrijf became the first auto rental companies in the Netherlands. [...] One of his other companies was the American Refined Motor Company which helped improve mechanical motor parts. This all stemmed from an automobile accident that he, Hofstede Crull, and his chauffeur, a man named Poorthuis, had in 1909 when he subsequently discovered a defect in the Spijker's steering mechanism which he improved.|$|E
5000|$|The Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek (ENKA) was {{a member}} of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce's heavy {{industry}} division whose president at the time was <b>Rento</b> Hofstede Crull, the Dutch electrical pioneer who already had founded several companies. Hartogs and Hofstede Crull had become friends over the years; and Hartogs turned to him about the problem with the spinning devices. By May 1925, Hofstede Crull already had formulated a solution for the problem - Driving Device For A Centrifugal Spinning Machine and filed for patents in the Netherlands on May 6, 1925 and in the United States on May 3, 1926; thereafter it became fully patented in the United States on March 31, 1931 by the United States Patent office, (Patent No: 1,798,312; inventor R.W.H.H. Crull; by his international law firm, Marks & Clerk-Electric motor-INT SPINPOT EXPLOITATIE MIJ NV) [...] Thereafter, one of Hofstede Crull's companies, De Vijf and the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek formed a joint venture, De Internationale Spinpot Exploitatie Maatschappij(ISEM) to manufacture and market Hofstede Crull's machines. This solution in the mid twenties for the rayon manufacturing problem was the means for the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek to enter the American market with its subsidiary, the American Enka Company in 1928 and with its creation thereby simultaneously circumventing trade protectism (See AkzoNobel). Two years later, the American Enka Company would become a free standing one. With the death of Hofstede Crull in 1938, the ISEM was fully integrated with the AKU, the Algemene Kunstzijde Unie which had resulted when the German Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken merged with the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek in 1929.|$|E
