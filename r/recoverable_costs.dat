This paper provides a rigorous proof that 'recoverable cost' is the observed measurement property underlying financial accounting measurement. This analysis draws upon: (a) the concept of recovery underlying the investment decision and (b) the distinction between decision theory and measurement theory.

The court case will be heard at an international court based in the United States and could have serious ramifications for Uganda if lost; Uganda’s membership at the World Bank depends on its maintenance of “multi-lateral investments treaties and associated guarantees”. There is also a possibility that the country could be sanctioned by the World Bank if found in breach of trade and investment agreements signed bilaterally with the United Kingdom. The Ugandan government insists that Tullow cannot claim taxes on supplies as <b>recoverable</b> <b>costs</b> before oil production starts.

40|$|In January 2017 {{there were}} three {{significant}} developments presenting real challenges for access to justice for those injured {{as a result of}} negligence. First, the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls issued a joint statement endorsing the Final Report of Lord Justice Briggs’ Civil Courts Structure Review, which they described as ensuring ‘that the overall system for civil justice is improved for its users in a coherent as well as comprehensive manner. ’ Chapter 6 of the Report recommended the introduction of an Online Court, eventually to be made compulsory for cases within its jurisdiction, and with a fixed <b>recoverable</b> <b>costs</b> model. On the same day, the Ministry of Justice closed its consultation on ‘Reforming the Soft Tissue (‘Whiplash’) Claims Process’ which included controversial proposals to remove the right of injured people to claim damages for some types of pain, suffering and loss of amenity, the introduction of a fixed tariff for damages for other injuries and an increase in the scope of the small claims track. The Government’s stated aim was to implement the reforms as soon as possible. Finally, Lord Justice Jackson commenced his review of fixed <b>recoverable</b> <b>costs</b> as an extension of his previous Review of Civil Litigation Costs, commissioned by the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls. In an earlier speech, Lord Justice Jackson had proposed an extension of fixed <b>recoverable</b> <b>costs</b> to claims with a value of up to £ 250, 000. How will this concatenation of reforms impact on access to justice in personal injury and clinical negligence claims, where individuals face well-resourced tortfeasors, in what {{has been described as a}} ‘paradigm instance of litigation in which the parties are in an asymmetric relationship’?

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} {{the methods of}} {{experimental}} economics pioneered by 2002 Nobel Prize winner Vernon Smith {{to the study of}} the effects of several proposed tort reform options. Specifically, we study the effects of fee shifting and discovery on the efficient use of the courts. Because it is difficult, if not impossible, to measure efficiency in the real world, we believe that controlled experiments offer valuable contributions to the debate on tort reform. The experiments presented in this paper point to the following main conclusions: First, a symmetric cost-shifting rule, as embodied in Section 998, California Code of Civil Procedure (similar to proposed changes to Rule 68 of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure), produces no difference in pre-trial settlement rates when compared to an environment without cost-shifting. Second, the inclusion of attorneys’ fees as <b>recoverable</b> <b>costs</b> under Section 998 improves settlement rates. Third, liberal discovery rules, which improve information symmetry, cause an improvement in pre-trial settlement rates. Finally, when efficiency is measured relative to the final bargaining positions in pre-trial negotiations, we find a much greater inefficiency in the use of the courts when attorneys’ fee are included over when they are not. This last conclusion suggests that policies directed towards tort reform are in fact ignoring an important feature of tort settlements, i. e., the hardening of positions as parties attempt to reduce their disagreement over a reasonable settlement...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the course}} of this report, we analyse both quantitatively and qualitatively the impact of the 2010 ­ 2013 reforms {{undertaken}} at the former Patents County Court (PCC), now the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court (IPEC). The reforms introduced a number of changes staggered over the period 2010 ­ 2013, including a cap on <b>recoverable</b> <b>costs</b> and damages, a reduction of the length as well as complexity of court actions, and a reconstitution of the PCC as the IPEC. In our quantitative case counts we find {{that there has been a}} large increase in the quantity of cases filed at the IPEC, post-reforms, while through a comparative study of the High Court (HC) and Patents Court (PHC) we show that with the exception of patent cases, there has not been a corresponding increase in cases at the higher level. We find quantitative and qualitative evidence that the costs cap and active case management by the IPEC judge have been the most influential reforms with respect to the large increase in cases filed at the IPEC post-reforms. We also note that case filings by SMEs have increased substantially following the reforms, fulfilling one of the key aims of the reforms. Importantly, we find that this effect is driven by changes at the extensive (more claimants) and intensive (more cases per claimant) margins of litigation behaviour at the IPEC. Finally, we provide a theoretical model that allows us to gauge the effect of the reforms on those IP disputes that never reach a court. Our theoretical predictions suggest that in addition to encouraging more IPEC case filings, the reforms have had the effect of increasing the quantity of out-of-court settlements as well...|$|E
40|$|In its Conceptual Framework (CF), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has not {{identified}} the observable phenomena {{and was not}} able to identify a single measurement property in financial accounting. While identifying aspects of the observable phenomena in financial accounting, the FASB has indicated that there are five measurement attributes which are used in financial accounting and the result is a mixed-attributes model. Lacking a critical underlying theory, the FASB’s Conceptual Framework is feeble at best in providing guidance for accounting measurement. Devoid of the critical theory, the FASB focuses on prediction rather than explanation and, thereby, has adopted an ‘information perspective’ as opposed to a ‘measurement perspective’ for financial accounting standards.

It utilized a combined quantitative/qualitative methodological approach. ^ Symptomatology presented by reported cases corresponded to the clinical picture of the mild form of the dengue virus. The social impact of the outbreak was greater for the female head of the households and their children, and households in the urban and semi-rural areas. Female heads of households experienced the greatest loss of time. Their own illness and the illness of other family members disrupted and delayed their activities at home and outside. Social expectations and the family 2 ̆ 7 s demands for their role as caretakers superseded those of their own sick role. In addition to the stress induced by {{the experience of being}} ill, female heads of households experienced other stressors. Mobilization of sources of social support within and outside the household minimized the consequences of its impact on the household. ^ The economic impact for households was estimated in work time lost, income lost and health care expenses. Loss of income was the main consequence of time lost from salaried work for both personal illness and for providing care to sick household members. The main consequence of the unsalaried work activities not trad itionally remunerated with money such as housework, was the inability of female heads to perform their routine activities to maintain family life. The monetary costs of health care absorbed a significant percentage of the household weekly income. The consequence of the economic impact appeared to be more significant for households in marginal urban communities with scarce economic resources, already struggling for economic survival. ^ In sum, although the outbreak was experienced for {{a relatively short period of}} time, it interfered with the family, work and social life of the households affected. The impact of the outbreak, however, had reversible consequences and <b>recoverable</b> <b>costs</b> which are also probably associated with other common viral infections.

40|$|The {{amount of}} uranium {{available}} {{to support the}} world's nuclear power programs depends on the price which users are prepared to pay for its recovery. As the price is raised, it is attractive to recover uranium from lower grade deposits, thereby increasing the total quantity available. About 3. 5 million tonnes of uranium {{is estimated to be}} available to the Western World in deposits which could be recovered for present day costs of less that $A 30 per kilogram. This amount is believed to be sufficient to meet the nuclear power program until the turn of the century. There are good prospects for the discovery of further deposits (particularly in Africa, Canada, South America and Australia) which could extend these resources. If the Fast Breeder Reactor is introduced by about 1990, it could ultimately decrease the uranium from about 2020 onwards. The total amount of uranium required to support the Light Water Reactor power program until this happens would be about 7 million tonnes. On present evidence, this could be available from high grade deposits, together with some low grade deposits and by-product sources at costs less than $A 60 per kilogram. If the Fast Breeder Reactor is not introduced as expected, the demand for uranium will continue to increase and it could be necessary to recover uranium from black shales or ultimately from sea water at costs ranging up to $A 300 per kilogram. Australia has about 19 % of the reasonably assured resources of uranium in the Western World <b>recoverable</b> at <b>costs</b> of less than $A 20 per kilogram, or about 9 % of the resources (reasonably assured and estimated additional) <b>recoverable</b> at <b>costs</b> of less than $A 30 per kilogram. Australia's potential for further discoveries of uranium is good. Nevertheless, if Australia did not export any of these resources it would probably have only a marginal effect on the development of nuclear power; other resources would be exploited earlier and prices would rise, but not sufficiently to make the costs of nuclear power unattractive. On the other hand, this policy could deny to Australia real benefits in foreign exchange earnings, employment and national development...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{utilities}} industry, the Prudent Investment Rule {{refers to a}} series of state standards which determine the fiscal soundness of a utility in the course of rate recovery for <b>recoverable</b> capital <b>costs</b> to be determined by that state’s Public Service Commission (PSC). The determination is established through a series of filings from the utility to the PSC and hearings conducted by the PSC. This occurs during a prudency hearing. [...] The PSC follows these standards to determine if the capital costs were a [...] "prudent investment". To determine the prudency of the investment, the PSC applies the prudent investment test or standard, determining if the costs were reasonable at the time they were incurred, and given the circumstances and what was known or knowable at the time, are {{to be included in the}} firm's rates. [...] It is commonly used as an oversight tool by the government to ensure that money invested into a project is being spent as it was intended so the utility may recoup some costs in construction through a recovery in rates, hence the title prudent investment rule. Regulators can consider cases of hidden imprudence, but are required to consider what was known or knowable at the time the decision was made by the PSC. The term Prudent Investment Rule, and the associated standards, have been established through a series of legal precedents. The first case to set precedent was the United States Supreme Court case of Munn v. Illinois in 1877, which allowed states to have a say in rates. [...] Once the nature of <b>recoverable</b> capital <b>costs</b> was defined, a second question remained as to the rate at which that capital could be recovered. This issue was reasonably addressed in 1935 in Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the efforts of}} the UK National Digital Archive of Datasets (NDAD) to reconstruct information about a major series of UK education datasets, the Schools' Census. Data from this annual survey of schools in England and Wales had been preserved by the Department for Education and Skills and its predecessors, but without the documentation required to place the data in context. Moreover, the data dictionaries which accompanied the datasets were incomplete, and failed to adequately explain the functions of many fields. NDAD circumvented these problems by reconstructing metadata for the datasets using examples of completed Census forms, published statistics, and other outside sources. The paper argues that NDAD's efforts are an example of what Ross and Gow (1999) have called 'digital archaeology': the rescue of neglected and damaged data resources, including cases where the threat is not to the data but to our ability to understand the data. The paper concludes that while 'data intelligibility' may indeed be <b>recoverable,</b> the <b>cost</b> {{in the case of the}} Schools' Census was high, and illustrates the practical limitations of 'digital archaeology'. This paper is a case study of the problems encountered by the UK National Digital Archive of Datasets (NDAD) when preserving a series of datasets known the Schools' Census, and how NDAD dealt with those problems.

Although we were not aware of it at the time, our approach to recovering the Schools' Census metadata was an example of what has been called 'digital archaeology'. The paper explores the concept of 'digital archaeology', and shows how NDAD's work on the Schools' Census is a case study of digital archaeology in practice. In so doing, it addresses the need identified by Ross and Gow (1999) for more case histories about data loss and rescue...|$|R

Psychological studies have repeatedly proven that the human brain is limited in both its short-term memory capacity and its determination ability to seven to nine “things” (Forman and Shelly 2001). Saaty (1980) also argued that maintaining a reasonable consistency when deriving priorities from paired comparisons requires the number of criteria being considered to be equal or less than nine. Therefore, this research paper has chosen to use eight criteria as the basis for prioritizing the oilfields. By filling out Questionnaire 1, each SME initially provided a list averaging 12 items (minimum of 5 and maximum 32). The researchers produced an aggregate list and sent it back to the SMEs for further review and comment. Multiple Delphi rounds followed, resulting in a hierarchy that included around 90 items classified as a goal, objectives, and attributes, which was constructed according to Kidd et al. (1977) composition of decision problems. A list of 38 criteria was then derived from the hierarchy and sent back to the SMEs to prioritize i.e., assignment of a score between 0 and 100 to each criterion. The researchers calculated the arithmetic mean of each criterion’s scores provided by all SMEs and the following eight criteria, which scored the highest, were selected: (1) size of proven reserves (<b>recoverable</b> oil), (2) <b>costs,</b> (3) plateau production period, (4) distance from existing infrastructure, (5) size of reservoir (original oil in place), (6) plateau production, (7) known reservoir characteristics (historical data), and (8) need for secondary recovery.|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Janssen, {{the company}} {{manufacturing}} abiraterone acetate (AA; tradename Zytiga(A (R))), to submit {{evidence for the}} clinical and cost effectiveness of AA in combination with prednisone/prednisolone (AAP) compared with watchful waiting (i. e. best supportive care [BSC]) for chemotherapy-na <ve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents {{a summary of the}} company submission (CS), the ERG report, subsequent addenda, and the development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the Appraisal Committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of AAP based on the CS. An important question in this appraisal was, according to the ERG, whether AAP followed by docetaxel is more effective than BSC followed by docetaxel. In the COU-AA- 302 trial, 239 of 546 (43. 8 %) AAP patients and 304 of 542 (56. 1 %) BSC patients received docetaxel as subsequent therapy, following AA or placebo. The results for this specific group of patients were not presented in the CS; therefore, the ERG asked the company to provide these data in the clarification letter; however, these data were presented as commercial-in-confidence and cannot therefore be reported here. The ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns, including (a) not using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population; (b) inconsistencies in estimating prediction equations; (c) not fully incorporating the impact of adverse events; (d) incorrectly incorporating the new patient access scheme (PAS); and (e) the assumption that AA non-compliance leads to <b>recoverable</b> drug <b>costs.</b> Although some of these issues were adjusted in the ERG base case, the ERG could not estimate the impact of all of these issues, and thus acknowledges that there are still uncertainties concerning the cost-effectiveness evidence. With the exception of the ERG's preference for using the ITT population, the AC agreed with the approach taken in the ERG base case. The original company and ERG base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were A 46, 722 pound and A 57, 688 pound per QALY gained, respectively; these changed to A 28, 563 pound and A 38, 061 pound per QALY gained, respectively, in the revised base cases applying a new PAS. Regarding the end-of-life criteria, after 24 months approximately 63 % of patients in the control group of the COU-AA- 302 trial were still alive, and the median survival was 30. 1 months (95 % CI 27. 3 - 34. 1). Therefore, it is unlikely that life expectancy would be less than 24 months. The AC stated that the most plausible ICER is likely between A 28, 600 pound and A 32, 800 pound per QALY gained, and concluded that AAP at this stage in the treatment pathway did not meet the end-of-life criterion for short life expectancy. Moreover, in March 2016, the AC produced the final guidance, stating that AAP is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating mCRPC...|$|R
40|$|The major {{objective}} of this research effort is the temperature driven growth of protein crystals in large batches in the microgravity environment of space. Pharmaceutical houses are developing protein products for patient care, for example, human insulin, human growth hormone, interferons, and tissue plasminogen activator or TPA, the clot buster for heart attack victims. Except for insulin, these are very high value products; they are extremely potent in small quantities {{and have a great}} value per gram of material. It is feasible that microgravity crystallization can be a <b>cost</b> <b>recoverable,</b> economically sound final processing step in their manufacture. Large scale protein crystal growth in microgravity has significant advantages from the basic science and the applied science standpoints. Crystal growth can proceed unhindered due to lack of surface effects. Dynamic control is possible and relatively easy. The method has the potential to yield large quantities of pure crystalline product. Crystallization is a time honored procedure for purifying organic materials and microgravity crystallization could be the final step to remove trace impurities from high value protein pharmaceuticals. In addition, microgravity grown crystals could be the final formulation for those medicines that need to be administered in a timed release fashion. Long lasting insulin, insulin lente, is such a product. Also crystalline protein pharmaceuticals are more stable for long-term storage. Temperature, as the initiation step, has certain advantages. Again, dynamic control of the crystallization process is possible and easy. A temperature step is non-invasive and is the most subtle way to control protein solubility and therefore crystallization. Seeding is not necessary. Changes in protein and precipitant concentrations and pH are not necessary. Finally, this method represents a new way to crystallize proteins in space that takes advantage of the unique microgravity environment. The results from two flights showed that the hardware performed perfectly, many crystals were produced, and they were much larger than their ground grown controls. Morphometric analysis was done on over 4, 000 crystals to establish crystal size, size distribution, and relative size. Space grown crystals were remarkably larger than their earth grown counterparts and crystal size was a function of PCF volume. That size distribution for the space grown crystals was a function of PCF volume may indicate that ultimate size was a function of temperature gradient. Since the insulin protein concentration was very low, 0. 4 mg/ml, the size distribution could also be following the total amount of protein in each of the PCF's. X-ray analysis showed that the bigger space grown insulin crystals diffracted to higher resolution than their ground grown controls. When the data were normalized for size, they still indicated that the space crystals were better than the ground crystals...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that international trade {{is a major}} pathway for the spread of invasive species. International agreements and domestic legislation aim to reach a balance between facilitating trade and providing nations {{with the right to}} protect their environmental, public and economic health. This is achieved through the development of standards that prescribe procedures that must be followed before a commodity is imported. Under Section 22 of the Biosecurity Act (1993) Biosecurity New Zealand of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) develops import health standards for the importation of commodities and sea containers and for the approval and management of transitional facilities. Under current regulations, before being allowed to enter New Zealand, a sea container must first be accompanied by appropriate documentation for the sea container itself and any contents (this includes cargo manifests, any required treatment certificates for the cargo and cleaning certificates for the sea container itself). Upon arriving in New Zealand the sea container is transported to a transitional facility for inspection and unloaded once biosecurity clearance has been obtained. There are approximately 7, 000 transitional facilities (both on and off wharf) throughout New Zealand and inspections are conducted by persons that have obtained accreditation from MAF for inspections (MAF accredited persons). Based on current importation procedures and other information made available, mathematical models were developed for three sea importation pathways (sea containers, woodpackaging and used vehicles) that involved the inspection of imported units by MAF accredited persons. These models were designed to predict the effectiveness of the current border inspection policies and procedures. Inspection accuracy was found to have the most influential impact on slippage (the rate at which contamination passes through border procedures undetected) along the measured pathways. Under current conditions, an estimated 5. 75 % of all sea containers, 4. 12 % of all sea containers containing woodpackaging and 1. 63 % of all used vehicles that enter New Zealand annually are contaminated in some manner despite having biosecurity clearance. A 3 % increase in inspection efficiency reduced slippage to 0. 5 % of sea containers, 2. 16 % of woodpackaging and 0. 001 % of used vehicles entering New Zealand annually. Given that the accuracy of the inspection was the most influential aspect of the border management procedures, mathematical models were develop to predict the cost of compliance recovered by MAF if all inspections were conducted by MAF inspectors as apposed to MAF accredited persons. Under current regulations the cost of compliance (if MAF inspector conducted inspections of all imported units) was estimated to be $ 117. 36 million for sea containers, $ 35. 16 million for woodpackaging and $ 5. 44 million for used vehicles. Increasing the inspection accuracy to the ideal 100 % increased the cost of compliance by 75. 36 %, 61. 96 % and 61. 92 % for sea containers, woodpackaging and used vehicles respectively. These findings indicate that Government investment in the training of inspectors throughout New Zealand would improve current border detection rates. Under current regulations, the cost incurred by MAF inspectors inspecting all imported units is <b>recoverable.</b> Currently the <b>cost</b> of compliance is approximately 1 % of the value of annual imports. These costs are seen by the import sector as part of their daily business and understand that these measures are in place for the long term sustainability of their businesses (Anon. 2005) ...|$|R
