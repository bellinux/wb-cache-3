40|$|This {{interesting}} {{paper by}} Dr. Hodge [l] presents {{the thesis that}} variations in <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>ascent</b> rate can be utilized to delineate areas of clear air turbulence. The reader {{may be interested in}} a slightly different treatment of these same data (turbulence reports and rawinsonde ascents for November 8 - 10, 1963), which were made available through the kindness of Dr. Hodge. Following Dr. Hodge, the <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>ascent</b> rate was estimated at 2000 -ft. intervals from the aneroid. The change in ascent rate for successive 2000 -ft. layers was compared‘with the mean ascent rate for the entire flight, and a ratio was formed. These ratios were smoothed by forming overlapping averages of three with respect to height, and then graphed as a function of height. Turbulence reports received from aircraft within 100 n. mi. o...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{communication}} a novel method {{is presented to}} derive the altitude profile of Brunt-Väisälä period from the ascent rate profile of sounding balloons. The basic premise of the present method is that the oscillations in the ascent rate of the balloon will have the signature of Brunt-Väisälä frequency, which can be retrieved by using sophisticated spectral tools. We employ wavelet transforms {{to arrive at the}} Brunt-Väisälä period profile. Comparison of retrieved Brunt-Väisälä periods with the values derived from the temperature data available from the same radiosonde ascent shows good agreement. Retrieving the atmospheric temperature from the height profile of Brunt-Väisälä period is also discussed in the present communication. We have shown {{that it is possible to}} estimate the Brunt-Väisälä period and temperature profiles from the <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>ascent</b> rate data alone where temperature sounding is not available...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 48 -hour {{experiments}} performed quarterly in 1977 to study radar {{returns from the}} lower stratosphere is described. Current theories of stratospheric scatter of radio waves are presented and the radar equation pertinent to the large array at Jicamarca, Peru is derived. Observational and data reduction techniques are discussed. Experimental results concerning scattered power, mean wind velocities and velocity fluctuations are presented. It is found that isotropic turbulent scatter {{is not the only}} scattering mechanism operating in the stratosphere, and modifications to the radar equation which arise from turbulent rolls or thin layers of refractive index variation are needed. Mean winds measured by radar are comparable to those determined by <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>ascent.</b> Velocity oscillations of approximately 5 -minute periods are interpreted as buoyancy oscillations with 2 km horizontal wavelength and phase velocity of 6 m/s. Tidal oscillations with periods of 24 and 12 hours are also observed. Suggestions for future measurements at Jicamarca and other institutions are offered...|$|E
40|$|In March and April of 1969 and 1970, lidar (laser radar) {{observations}} of the atmospheric structure {{were made in the}} lee of the Sierra Nevada during the occurrence of mountain lee waves. <b>Rawinsonde</b> <b>ascents</b> and, on some occasions, research aircraft flights supported the lidar observations. The objective of the program was to explore the applicability of the lidar technique to atmospheric turbulence detection. The observations demonstrate that a ground-based lidar can delineate significant features of the atmospheric flow pattern by monitoring echoes from concentrations of particulate matter that characterize the airflow structure in the form of either visible or subvisible clouds and dust...|$|R
40|$|Upper tropospheric cloud motion vectors and {{commercial}} aircraft wind reports have enabled a detailed {{definition of the}} motion field. These two data sets have enhanced our observational capability since the launch of 4 to 5 geostationary satellites around the globe and {{the implementation of the}} ASDAR program. A sample is illustrated of recent commercial aircraft wind reports at the 300, 250, and 200 mb surfaces over parts of the Pacific Ocean, North America, and Atlantic Ocean. This data coverage is impressive. The rms difference between these data and those obtained from <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>ascents</b> (colocated) is around + or - 4 m/s. In a recent study of the cloud winds, from geostationary satellites, Johnson (1984) noted almost 15 m/s vector wind differences between estimates from GMS, GOES, and METEOSAT with respect to the rawinsonde observations. These results are illustrated based on the assessment of Johnson (1984). Overall, the commercial aircraft winds are the more accurate of these two observing systems. However, it is apparent that because of the sparcity of airline routes across southern oceans, one has to rely rather heavily on the cloud winds as a primary data source over the tropical southern oceans. The operational rawinsonde coverage over the tropics is generally very poor. The overall data coverage based primarily on the collections at the ECWMF are shown...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the atmospheric boundary layer above the Agulhas Current using shipboard meteorological measurements and <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>ascents.</b> The juxtaposition {{of the warm}} Agulhas Current and cool shelf waters is shown to have far-reaching effects on the overlying atmosphere. Air-sea fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat and resultant boundary layer characteristics demonstrate high horizontal inhomogeneity. The results suggest that this inhomogeneity is permanent. The spatial heat flux gradient {{is reflected in the}} overlying atmosphere by a transition in stability of the boundary layer and potential cumulus formation from the cool shelf to the warm current. For airflow perpendicular to the Agulhas Current an internal boundary layer was observed to develop at the inshore sea surface temperature front. Onshore-moving air accumulated a significant quantity of moisture during its trajectory over the current. When airflow is parallel to the current an atmospheric moisture front exists along the axis of the inshore sea surface temperature front. The mean thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere was investigated. An inversion capped the boundary layer whilst a second, higher-level subsidence inversion was found which acts to limit the vertical development of cumulus clouds and therefore the redistribution of heat and moisture above the boundary layer. The results presented in this thesis are useful in two ways. The Agulhas Current has frequently been linked to South African climate. This is the first dedicated study which quantifies and characterizes the atmospheric boundary layer in this region. Secondly, maritime airmasses are dramatically modified above the Agulhas Current. The resultant large horizontal inhomogeneity, its vertical extent and permanence suggest that its inclusion is vital to any successful climate model. Atmospheric general circulation models have been criticized for not taking into account regions of strong horizontal inhomogeneity. The results of this thesis support this argument and highlight the need for similar studies. Bibliography: pages 116 - 123...|$|R
40|$|FIGURE 2. -Based on the 12 {{rawinsonde}} {{stations in}} figure 1, the average variability in <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>ascent</b> rate for cases of “no turbulence ” and various categories of turbulence. Inasmuch as these preliminary {{results suggest that}} an in-being observational system may give some clue as to the occurrence of clear air turbulence, I would concur with Dr. Hodge that further studies along this line appear justified. However, these same results suggest that even more useful information could be obtained from a horizontal sounding system. For example, a superpressured, constant-volume balloon with a high drag coefficient would more clearly delineate the vertical air motions involved, and would possess the additional advantage of remaining within the turbulent area for a considerable time. Although {{there is no doubt}} that there are difficulties involved in precise radar positioning of such balloons for long time intervals, the constant-volume balloon still seems a logical probe for research into the mechanism of clear air turbulence...|$|E
40|$|Space launch {{vehicles}} develop day-of-launch steering commands {{based upon}} the upper-level atmospheric environments in order to alleviate wind induced structural loading and optimize ascent trajectory. Historically, upper-level wind measurements to support launch operations at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Kennedy Space Center co-located on the United States Air Force's Eastern Range (ER) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station use high-resolution rawinsondes. One inherent limitation with rawinsondes consists of taking approximately one hour to generate a vertically complete wind profile. Additionally, rawinsonde drift during ascent by the ambient wind environment can result in the balloon being hundreds of kilometers down range, which results in questioning whether the measured winds represent the wind environment the vehicle will experience during ascent. This paper will describe the use of balloon profile databases to statistically assess the drift distance away from the ER launch complexes during <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>ascent</b> {{as a function of}} season and discuss an alternative method to measure upper level wind environments in closer proximity to the vehicle trajectory launching from the ER...|$|E
40|$|The icehouse {{effect is}} a {{hypothesized}} climate feedback mechanism which could result in human-caused surface cooling trends in polar regions. Once understood in detail, it becomes apparent that these trends, which are discernable in the literature, but have been largely dismissed, do not conflict with the consensus assessment of the evidence, which infers century-scale Arctic warming. In fact, confirmation of the hypothesis would substantially strengthen the argument {{that there is a}} detectable human influence on today's climate. This apparent enigma is resolved only through careful attention to the detail of the hypothesis and the data supporting it. The posited surface cooling is entirely dependent on the existence of climate warming in layers capping the stable boundary layer. Also, the cooling is not pandemic, but is selective. It is readily revealed in properly sorted data by making use of the principles of micrometeorological similarity. Specifically, the cooling is manifest under a range of favorable turbulence conditions which can develop and disappear locally on time scales of minutes to hours because of the intrinsically intermittent nature of stable boundary layer turbulence. Because of the fine-scale nature of the processes which produce the cooling, modeling it is a difficult proposition. Vertical resolution on the order of 1 meter is required. Adequate models of intermittent surface fluxes coupled with radiation exchange do not currently exist, not as parameterizations for aggregated systems, nor in large eddy simulation (LES) models. This presentation will introduce the theory. An important testable null hypothesis emerges: the icehouse effect produces a unique signature or "fingerprint" which could not be produced by any other known process. The presence of this signature will be demonstrated using nearly all available Arctic temperature observations. Its aggregate effect is clearly found in Arctic monthly surface temperature trends when sorted by climatological stability. Using all available Arctic <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>ascents</b> - about 1. 1 million profiles, "frozen moments" of the icehouse processes are captured in various states. Because turbulent time scales are so short in the stable boundary layer. each of these snapshots can be treated as independent [...] their chronology is irrelevant. Micrometeorological similarity is invoked to reassemble the soundings into bins of similar stability and it is in a wide, coherent range of these stability bins where the cooling effect is revealed...|$|R
