5|$|DJ Hero 2 is {{a rhythm}} video {{game and a}} sequel to DJ Hero, a spinoff of the Guitar Hero series. DJ Hero 2 uses a special turntable-controller, the same as {{introduced}} in DJ Hero, to simulate turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using <b>record</b> <b>players</b> and sound effect generators. The game is developed by FreeStyleGames and is published by Activision, and was released worldwide in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero is a {{music video}} game, {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames {{and published by}} Activision as a rhythm game spin-off of the Guitar Hero franchise. It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using <b>record</b> <b>players</b> and sound effect generators, and features 94 remixes of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of its notable players, {{generally}} {{this means}} players that have played 100 or more first-class matches for the club. However, some players who have played fewer matches are also included; players from the club's pre-Football League days, when they played fewer matches in a season than the present day, and club captains are included. Players who hold club records have footnotes describing the <b>record.</b> <b>Players</b> are listed according to the date of their first-team debut for the club. Appearances are for first-team competitive matches only including those as a substitute; wartime matches are excluded.|$|E
50|$|<b>Recorded</b> <b>players</b> {{included}} Maol Ruanaidh Cam Ó Cearbhaill (murdered 1329). Finn Ó Haughluinn (died 1490) was {{the last}} <b>recorded</b> <b>player</b> of the instrument.|$|R

In the <b>Record</b> <b>Player</b> Orchestra the <b>record</b> <b>player</b> becomes an instrument in which engagement with stylus being physically placed on the vinyl is key. No prior skill or expertise is needed to do this and, as with most aspects of the <b>Record</b> <b>Player</b> Orchestra, all participants are beginners at playing this instrument and all become more adept during their playing. By discovering {{how to play the}} <b>record</b> <b>player,</b> participants can start to understand the qualities and particularities of this instrument, what kind of playing might be possible and what might be more problematic...|$|R

25|$|In the 1990s Rhino Records {{issued a}} series of boxed sets of 78rpm reissues of early rock and roll hits, {{intended}} for owners of vintage jukeboxes. The records were made of vinyl, however, {{and some of the}} earlier vintage 78rpm jukeboxes and <b>record</b> <b>players</b> (the ones that were pre-war) were designed with heavy tone arms to play the hard slate-impregnated shellac records of their time. These vinyl Rhino 78's were softer and would be destroyed by old juke boxes and old <b>record</b> <b>players,</b> but play very well on newer 78-capable turntables with modern lightweight tone arms and jewel needles.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 2002 CD {{release of}} the album {{did not include a}} front insert, but rather a clear film sheet that had a picture of a <b>record</b> <b>player</b> arm. The disc itself was designed to look like a vinyl record, and the inside tray included a picture of a <b>record</b> <b>player.</b> The overall product is supposed to look like a vinyl record being played on a <b>record</b> <b>player.</b> The album was reissued {{for the first time on}} vinyl format in 2011 for Record Store Day. The record was packaged in a clear plastic sleeve with a picture of a <b>record</b> <b>player</b> arm printed on the front of the sleeve. It also included a sheet with the picture of the <b>record</b> <b>player</b> printed on it. The vinyl version was reissued again in 2014, with 1,000 copies pressed on clear vinyl.|$|R
50|$|Other Victor {{products}} {{included the}} Electrola (an electrified <b>record</b> <b>player),</b> Radiola (a radio often {{paired with a}} <b>record</b> <b>player</b> which was {{a joint venture with}} RCA prior to their acquisition of the company), and musical instruments (including the first electronic instrument, the theremin).|$|R

25|$|Developments {{in early}} {{recording}} technology paralleled that of electronic instruments. The first means of recording and reproducing audio {{was invented in}} the late 19th century with the mechanical phonograph. <b>Record</b> <b>players</b> became a common household item, and by the 1920s composers were using them to play short recordings in performances.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of electrical recording in 1925 {{was followed by}} increased experimentation with <b>record</b> <b>players.</b> Paul Hindemith and Ernst Toch composed several pieces in 1930 by layering recordings of instruments and vocals at adjusted speeds. Influenced by these techniques, John Cage composed Imaginary Landscape No. 1 in 1939 by adjusting the speeds of recorded tones.|$|E
25|$|Rumble {{filters are}} high-pass filters {{applied to the}} removal of {{unwanted}} sounds near to {{the lower end of}} the audible range or below. For example, noises (e.g., footsteps, or motor noises from <b>record</b> <b>players</b> and tape decks) may be removed because they are undesired or may overload the RIAA equalization circuit of the preamp.|$|E
50|$|In addition, as stereo {{equipment}} {{was still a}} relatively new phenomenon, they didn't have any when the record was released and were quite angry at how bad the album sounded on their mono <b>record</b> <b>player.</b> Modrego actually had to rent a stereo <b>record</b> <b>player</b> so they could hear it properly.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} other types of input {{transducers}} which may be used occasionally, including magnetic pickups used in electric guitars and electric basses, which are plugged first into a DI box {{and then into the}} snake, contact microphones used on stringed instruments, and pianos and phonograph pickups (cartridges) used in <b>record</b> <b>players.</b> As well, some electronic instruments such as synthesizers can have their output signal routed to the mixing console.|$|E
25|$|In some {{consumer}} electronic equipment, {{notably in}} television sets {{in the era}} of valves (vacuum tubes), but also in some low-cost <b>record</b> <b>players,</b> the vacuum tube heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full mains voltage, it was necessary to provide a ballast to drop the excess voltage. A resistor was often used for this purpose, as it was cheap and worked with both AC and DC.|$|E
25|$|Piezoelectric devices found {{homes in}} many fields. Ceramic {{phonograph}} cartridges simplified player design, were cheap and accurate, and made <b>record</b> <b>players</b> cheaper {{to maintain and}} easier to build. The development of the ultrasonic transducer allowed for easy measurement of viscosity and elasticity in fluids and solids, resulting in huge advances in materials research. Ultrasonic time-domain reflectometers (which send an ultrasonic pulse through a material and measure reflections from discontinuities) could find flaws inside cast metal and stone objects, improving structural safety.|$|E

25|$|The 45rpm discs {{also came}} in a variety known as {{extended}} play (EP), which achieved up to 10–15 minutes play {{at the expense of}} attenuating (and possibly compressing) the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were cheaper to produce, and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue LP albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45rpm players. LP albums could be purchased one EP at a time, with four items per EP, or in a boxed set with three EPs or twelve items. The large center hole on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. EPs were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the U.S. as three- and four-speed <b>record</b> <b>players</b> replaced the individual 45 players. One indication of the decline of the 45rpm EP is that the last Columbia Records reissue of Frank Sinatra songs on 45rpm EP records, called Frank Sinatra (Columbia B-2641) was issued on December 7, 1959. The EP lasted considerably longer in Europe, and was a popular format during the 1960s for recordings by artists such as Serge Gainsbourg and the Beatles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of hip hop, the DJs were the stars, as they created new music and beats with their <b>record</b> <b>players.</b> While DJing and turntablism {{continue}} to be used in hip hop music in the 2010s, the star role has increasingly been taken by MCs since the late 1970s, due to innovative, creative MCs such as Kurtis Blow and Melle Mel of Grandmaster Flash's crew, the Furious Five, who developed strong rapping skills. However, a number of DJs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years. Famous DJs include Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, Mr. Magic, DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Scratch from EPMD, DJ Premier from Gang Starr, DJ Scott La Rock from Boogie Down Productions, DJ Pete Rock of Pete Rock & CL Smooth, DJ Muggs from Cypress Hill, Jam Master Jay from Run-DMC, Eric B., DJ Screw from the Screwed Up Click and the inventor of the Chopped & Screwed style of mixing music, Funkmaster Flex, Tony Touch, DJ Clue, Mix Master Mike, Touch-Chill-Out, DJ Red Alert, and DJ Q-Bert. The underground movement of turntablism has also emerged to focus on the skills of the DJ. In the 2010s, there are turntablism competitions, where turntablists demonstrate advanced beat juggling and scratching skills.|$|E
25|$|The {{preparation}} for the next season for Žalgiris began during the 2016 LKL finals, with Žalgiris signing point guard Léo Westermann to replace the departing Jerome Randle. After the season, Pocius, Hanlan, Vougioukas, and long time Žalgiris players Siim-Sander Vene and Kaspars Vecvagars, all left the team, while Žalgiris choose to retain the services of Seibutis and Motum. Žalgiris also re-signed Edgaras Ulanovas. One of {{the main stories of}} the off-season became the situation of head coach Jasikevičius, who was pursued by FC Barcelona Bàsquet to become their new head coach, but in the end decided to remain with Žalgiris. During the entire previous season, the main problem for the team was the lack of a good shooter – to fix the problem, Žalgiris signed Kevin Pangos, and to replace Vougioukas at center, Žalgiris took Augusto Lima from Real Madrid on loan. Žalgiris also signed the returning Artūras Milaknis to a 3-year deal. Isaiah Hartenstein, a very talented prospect from Germany, who was signed during the previous season, is also scheduled to make his debut in the upcoming season. In August, Žalgiris signed Antanas Kavaliauskas, the captain of Lietuvos Rytas, in a rather controversial decision, as Kavaliauskas had previously promised to never play for Žalgiris, with Kavaliauskas apologizing to fans soon after the signing was announced. With the signing of Kavaliauskas, the formation of the team was complete. In February, Žalgiris won the first title of the 2017 season, winning the King Mindaugas Cup by defeating BC Neptūnas in the first round 81:58, BC Vytautas in the semi-finals 76:55, and BC Lietkabelis in the finals 84:63, while rival and 2016 champion Lietuvos rytas was eliminated in the first round. Edgaras Ulanovas won the tournament MVP. In the Euroleague, Žalgiris exceeded all expectations – many pre-season experts believed that Žalgiris will finish in last place, which motivated the team. Under leadership of coach Jasikevičius, Žalgiris finished in 10th place, just 2 games out of the playoffs, with wins over teams like PBC CSKA Moscow, the defending champion, playoff teams like Saski Baskonia, Anadolu Efes S.K. and Panathinaikos B.C., and beating and actually finishing ahead of FC Barcelona Bàsquet and Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C., with a 14–16 <b>record.</b> <b>Players</b> like Brock Motum, Léo Westermann, Edgaras Ulanovas and Lukas Lekavičius blossomed and shined, and team captain Paulius Jankūnas played one of his best seasons of his career, leading the team in scoring and rebounding. The LKL became a formality, as Žalgiris easily finished in 1st place with just a few losses, and easily crushed and swept long tome rival Lietuvos rytas. In the LKL playoffs, Žalgiris beat BC Dzūkija in the quaterfinals 3:0, beat BC Neptūnas 3:1 in the semi-finals, and faced BC Lietkabelis in the finals, as Lietkabelis beat Rytas in the semi-final. The only team to give Žalgiris some trouble in the regular season, Lietkabelis fought hard, but a win in Game 2 would be the only win of the series – Žalgiris won the series 4:1, their 7th consecutive LKL championship and finished a very good season. The 2016–2017 season is considered {{as one of the best}} in modern Žalgiris history.|$|E

500|$|Billboards {{editorial}} changed {{focus as}} technology in {{recording and playback}} developed. It covered [...] "marvels of modern technology" [...] like the phonograph, <b>record</b> <b>players</b> and wireless radios. It began covering coin-operated entertainment machines in 1899 and created a dedicated section for them called [...] "Amusement Machines" [...] in March 1932. Billboard began covering the motion picture industry in 1907, but ended up focusing on music due to competition from Variety. It created a Billboard radio broadcasting station in the 1920s.|$|E
500|$|Mechanical-electrical analogies {{are useful}} in general where the system {{includes}} transducers between different energy domains. [...] Another area of application is the mechanical parts of acoustic systems such as the pickup and tonearm of <b>record</b> <b>players.</b> [...] This was of some importance in early phonographs where the audio is transmitted from the pickup needle to the horn through various mechanical components entirely without electrical amplification. [...] Early phonographs suffered badly from unwanted resonances in the mechanical parts. [...] It was found that these could be eliminated by treating the mechanical parts as components of a low-pass filter which {{has the effect of}} flattening out the passband.|$|E
500|$|Dugan {{changed from}} {{lighting}} design to sound design in 1967. The state of sound design {{at the time}} was mostly occasional sound effects performed live or played back on <b>record</b> <b>players</b> or tape machines. Dugan's first efforts in sound involved designing sound solutions for the Shakespeare festival in San Diego and for the American Conservatory Theatre (ACT) in San Francisco. Dugan's complex and atmospheric theatrical soundscapes led to a new title: during ACT's 1968–69 season, he was the first regional theatre person to be called a [...] "sound designer". He presented a paper about his sound design to the Audio Engineering Society (AES) at their 37th convention, and his paper was published in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society in December 1969. Dugan described a system in which the signals from three stereo tape players were routed to ten loudspeaker zones in the theater.|$|E
