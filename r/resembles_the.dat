50|$|Eventually {{from such}} {{linguistic}} analyses, {{it appears that}} while astī (is-ness) would <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> world of Heraclitus, hastī (existence) would rather approaches a metaphysical concept <b>resembling</b> <b>the</b> Parmenidas's interpretation of existence.|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} King Vajra first had three idols of Krishna carved {{but he had never}} seen Krishna, so they were then carved from the {{description}} of Uttara, the mother of Maharaja Parikshit. He had three different images carved, but none of them were perfect. Govindaji <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> face, Madana Mohan <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> navel down to the lotus feet, and Gopinath <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> trunk of the body, from the navel to the neck.|$|R
5000|$|A W {{engine is}} a type of {{reciprocating}} engine arranged with its cylinders in a configuration in which <b>the</b> cylinder banks <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> letter W, in the same way those of a V engine <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> letter V.|$|R
5|$|During Act I, {{the player}} assumes {{command of the}} Knights of St. John, which <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Spanish civilization (even though the faction played is {{actually}} Maltese). The Spanish had numerous colonies in the area played throughout the Act.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma austroprunicolor <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> European species E.queletii, but the cap of {{the latter}} species fades to an ochre colour, {{and it has a}} white fibrillose stipe. Microscopically, its gill edges have well-differentiated cheilocystidia.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> {{various species}} of true morel, {{although}} {{the latter are}} more symmetric and look more like pitted gray, tan, or brown sponges. Its cap is generally darker and larger.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the {{correlation}} diagram for any 4n electrocyclic reaction will <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> diagram for the 4 electron cyclization of 1,3-butadiene, while {{the correlation}} diagram any 4n+2 electron electrocyclic reaction will <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> correlation diagram for the 6 electron cyclization of 1,3,5-hexatriene.|$|R

5|$|The Congo serpent eagle is superficially {{similar in}} plumage and size to Cassin's hawk-eagle, {{which has an}} {{overlapping}} range with the serpent eagle. It {{has been suggested that}} the Congo serpent eagle evolved to mimic the Cassin's hawk-eagle, which could give the serpent eagle several advantages, possibly including the ability to trick its reptilian prey into not fleeing, lowering its own predation, and/or minimizing mobbing by birds through its resemblance to a predator of birds. D. s. spectabilis more closely <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> immature Cassin's hawk-eagle, while D. s. batesi <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> adult. This is one of very few suspected examples of avian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|The cantata {{is opened}} by a Sinfonia, marked adagio assai, which <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> slow {{movement}} of an oboe concerto, with an expressive and plaintive solo.|$|E
5|$|The female {{has mostly}} pale brown upperparts, and pale grey underparts, so it <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> female house sparrow. It {{differs from the}} house sparrow in its {{slightly}} darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head, and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and buff. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, though more pale and sandy. As the male reaches its first winter, it <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib.|$|E
50|$|In the Otis Chalk assemblage, Triopticus lived {{alongside}} {{a number of}} other archosauriforms including the allokotosaurs Trilophosaurus and Malerisaurus; the doswelliid Doswellia; the phytosaurs Parasuchus and Angistorhinus; the aetosaurs Longosuchus, Lucasuchus, and Coahomasuchus; the shuvosaurid Effigia; the silesaurid Silesaurus; the lagerpetid dinosauromorph Dromomeron, and the coelophysoid theropod dinosaur Lepidus. Some of these also exhibit evolutionary convergence upon archosaurs living after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event - <b>the</b> phytosaurs <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> thalattosaurs and spinosaurids, <b>the</b> aetosaurs <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> ankylosaurs, and <b>the</b> shuvosaurids <b>resemble</b> <b>the</b> ornithomimosaurs.|$|R

5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela closely <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> scarlet myzomela, {{though there}} is only a small overlap in their respective ranges, in eastern Cape York Peninsula. The latter species lives in woodlands rather than mangroves. The dusky myzomela <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> female red-headed myzomela, but is larger and darker brown, and lacks the red markings around the bill. The Sumba myzomela is similar but slightly smaller than the red-headed myzomela and has darker upper parts and a broad black pectoral band.|$|E
5|$|The smooth coat type of {{the breed}} closely <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> Pražský Krysařík breed of the Czech Republic. The Pražský on average {{is a little}} shorter on leg and a little heavier than the Russian Toy.|$|E
5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look {{darker than the}} pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young {{may not be as}} fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.|$|E
50|$|The A9, {{designed}} by Bertone, {{was the last}} prototype of Anadol. It was a 4-door sedan with a very modern design for the early 1980s. The rear parts of <b>the</b> car <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> future Peugeot 405, while <b>the</b> overall form <b>resembled</b> <b>the</b> Volvo sedans of the mid-1980s.|$|R

5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the results}} of an Ipsos Pulse of the People survey {{published}} in February 2014, the DA is the most multi-racial party while the ANC has 96% black supporters and the EFF has 99% black supporters, relative to 76% black survey respondents. The age profile of ANC supporters closely <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> age profile of voters, while DA supporters are slightly older overall and EFF supporters are significantly younger overall.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum closely <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> {{other species}} in the A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E

5|$|Ampelosaurus sp. is a {{distinct}} sauropod {{as it is known}} from just a braincase.

5|$|An edited {{version of}} the musical cue from the Tar Sequence (where the inmates are energetically paving the road) {{has been used for}} years as the theme music for local {{television}} stations' news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by ABC in the United States. Although the music was written for the film, it became more familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> sound of a telegraph.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which <b>resembles</b> <b>the</b> turkey vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E
