40|$|The {{metabolism}} and clinical analysis of Indocyanine Green (ICG), a derivative of Tricarbocyanines in hepatic disorders are reported. ICG disappearance rate from serum (K) : was 0. 186 ± 0. 056 in normal person, 0. 133 ± 0. 026 in patient with acute hepatitis, 0. 155 ± 0. 032 in chronic hepatitis and 0. 059 ± 0. 015 in cirrhosis. Both extra and intrahepatic obstructive jaundice showed remarkably low rate. The rate was almost normal in Gilbert disease with some exceptions and was normal in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, however, it was conspicuously decreased in Rotor type. To simplify the examination procedure blood specimen was collected only once and its result was studied. It {{was found that}} specimen at 15 min. after injection was the most suitable in separating normal and abnormal groups. By this method, normal rate was 6. 09 ± 0. 54 % and over 10 % indicated abnormal condition. Correlation between ICG disappearance rate and BSP (30 min.) retention rate showed positive and r was - 0. 67 (p< 0. 01). There was no clear correlation observed with other liver function test. ICG and BSP dissociation was also observed in some instances. ICG turned normal more rapid than BSP, ICG sharply reflected the pathological status of cirrhosis comparing with BSP. Transport maximum (Tm) and <b>relative</b> <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> (S) in the liver cell were 0. 96 mg/min. and 104. 2 mg/mg% respectively. In chronic hepatitis, Tm was 0. 69 and S was 117. 2. Dubin-Johnson syndrome showed decreased Tm and increased S and Rotor type showed remarkably low Tm and S as well as K. It is clearly apparent that ICG test is the most excellent method to differentiate Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor type...|$|E
40|$|Brazil is at a {{crossroad}} {{with regard}} to its sustainable energy future. Despite currently boasting one of the world’s cleanest energy supplies, a number of current trends are pointing towards a deterioration of the country’s sustainable energy performance, {{measured in terms of}} renewable energy use, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Firstly, declining emissions from land use and increasing demand for fossil fuels are turning energy into a key driver of Brazil’s domestic GHG emissions. Secondly, the electricity sector, dominated by large-scale hydropower, is facing challenges in meeting the growing demand. Worrying trends include the shrinking <b>relative</b> <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> in the system and the growing use of natural gas in lieu of cleaner sources. Thirdly, demand for transport fuels is growing fast, prompted by rising living standards and a long-term policy of favouring road transport. Expanding volumes and shares of oil are of particular concern and are intimately interlinked with the present troubles of the bioethanol sector. Furthermore, despite low levels of carbon and energy intensity, the country’s energy efficiency performance remains stagnant. In this paper, Mari Luomi provides an evaluation of the prospects and potential for sustainable energy in Brazil in the medium and long term, based on an analysis of current energy-related dynamics, existing government policies and plans, and domestic and international projections of energy supply and demand through 2035. She argues that there is still plenty of room for increased ambition and warns that, unless current trends are reversed with determined policy and implementation, Brazil will place at risk the decarbonization of its energy supply at a time in which global attention is turning to resource-efficient low-carbon transitions. Policy recommendations for achieving a diversion from current plans and projected trajectories include: a diversification into non-large scale hydro renewables in the electricity sector, a sustainable expansion of bioethanol production, increased attention to energy efficiency across the economy, and an ambitious post- 2020 climate change mitigation policy. </p...|$|E

The test was conducted to five types of sim cards along with a ladder-shaped aluminum profile. Photography radiology was performed energy 50 kv. Then the analysis of image quality was done by using software of new image analyzer 2007.   Image calibration process was done by using the results of aluminum profile image.

In six dogs, storage capacity, Tm, and fractional transfer rates from plasma to liver, liver to bile, and liver to plasma were measured during 0 - 15 M NaCL infusion and the measurements were repeated under a dehydrocholate infusion of 95 mumol. min- 1, ie, an infusion rate approaching the known biliary Tm of bile salts. It was found that: (a) storage capacity and fractional transfer rates from plasma to liver significantly lower during dehydrocholate infusions (respectively 18 - 0 plus or minus SD 9 - 0 mg-mg- 1. 100 ml- 1 and 0 - 120 plus or minus SD 0 - 035 min- 1) than during NaCL infusions (respectively 47 - 0 plus or minus 21 - 0 mg. mg- 1. 100 ml- 1 and 0 - 280 plus or minus SD 0 - 055 min- 1; P smaller than 0 - 001); (b) Tm and fractional transfer rates from liver to bile were also significantly lower during dehydrocholate infusion (respectively 3 - 2 plus or minus SD 1 - 1 mg. min- 1 and 0 - 013 plus or minus SD 0 - 004 min- 1) than during NaCl infusion (4 - 8 plus or minus SD 1 - 1 mg. min- 1 and 0 - 033 plus or minus SD 0 - 017 min- 1; P smaller than 0 - 02); (c) in three additional experiments, taurocholate had similar effects on storage capacity and Tm.

This study aimed at identifying markers of the brain abnormalities underlying vSTM reductions in adult ADHD. We combined behavioral parameter-based assessment with electrophysiology in groups of adult ADHD patients and healthy age-matched controls. Amplitudes of ERP markers of vSTM <b>storage</b> <b>capacity,</b> the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and the P 3 b, were analyzed according to (i) differences between individuals with higher vs. lower <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> K and (ii) differences between ADHD patients and control participants.

Furthermore, the P 3 b was larger in ADHD patients relative to control participants. These electrophysiological findings indicate altered brain mechanisms underlying visual <b>storage</b> <b>capacity</b> in ADHD, which are characterized by deficient encoding and maintenance, and increased recruitment of control processes.
