40|$|Background: Aim: To {{update the}} {{incidence}} of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> related complications after different modes of hysterectomy and their management. Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} Jingzhou central hospital, Jingzhou, Hubei, China. Patient's case files were reviewed who had undergone Hysterectomy from 1 st Jan. 2013 - 31 st Dec. 2014. The incidence of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> related complications were retrospectively evaluated by different approaches. Data were collected according to our inclusion criteria and statistically analyzed its significance (P < 0. 05). Results: 887 patients underwent hysterectomy during 2 years of study period. Mean age was 54 +/- 4 years. Overall incidence of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> related complications were 34 (3. 83 %) which included <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> bleeding 12 (1. 35 %), <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> infections 16 (1. 80 %) and <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence 6 (0. 67 %) without evisceration. Laparoscopic hysterectomy had higher incidence (6. 12 %), than open abdominal (2. 56 %) and vaginal (3. 22 %) hysterectomy. Incidences were significant (P = 0. 032) to approaches of hysterectomy. The Incidence of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence between Laparoscopic and Open abdominal hysterectomy were significant (P = 0. 015) but {{the incidence of}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> bleeding (P = 0. 90) and <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> infection (P = 0. 74) were not significant. Over all incidences were higher in malignancy (61 %) than benign (20 %). Conclusions: Study suggests that <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> bleeding, cuff infection, cuff dehiscence and evisceration are rare but not negligible which may lead into catastrophic conditions. Early diagnosis and appropriate management reduces further complications. Partial cuff dehiscence can be managed conservatively without surgical repair with satisfactory outcome.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the safety and efficacy of the barbed unidirectional suture in a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective and descriptive study was conducted, which included all of the patients that have undergone laparoscopic hysterectomy and closure of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff,</b> using barbed sutures (V-loc™ 90 Device, CovidienTM), during the period between May 2011 and December 2014. We have analyzed the general characteristics, indications, history of previous surgery {{and the presence of}} fever or surgical re-intervention due to pelvic abscesses. The appearance of a <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> hematoma, active bleeding and <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence were also taken into account. Results: A hundred and twenty-one laparoscopic hysterectomies with <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> closure, using barbed sutures, were performed. There was a report of one case of bladder lesion and another case of ureter lesion. Of all patients, four (3. 3 %) of them presented fever while one (0. 8 %) presented paralytic ileus.

30|$|Introduction: Hysterectomy is {{the most}} {{frequent}} major gynaecologic surgical procedure and can be executed by laparoscopic, laparotomic or <b>vaginal</b> route. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence represents a serious post-hysterectomy complication. Several studies have been published about the rate of dehiscence based on different surgical approaches. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the rate of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence and other complications in patients undergone to total laparoscopic hysterectomy, comparing laparoscopic and vaginal closure of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff.</b>|$|R
30|$|Introduction: <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> {{dehiscence}} is {{an uncommon}} event following hysterectomy. With an incidence of 0.03 % to 4.1 %, {{it is more}} frequent after total laparoscopic or robotic assisted hysterectomy compared to the trans-vaginal or trans-abdominal approaches. Despite several reports of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence after laparoscopic or robotic assisted hysterectomy – sometimes with evisceration of different intraabdominal organs - to our knowledge, there are no reported cases of recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence in a non-oncologic patient.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> {{dehiscence}} after hysterectomy {{is a rare}} complication and {{occurs in}} less than 1 % of patients. It can present with serious complications, such as bowel evisceration and peritonitis. Presentation of case: A 51 -year-old multigravida Korean woman underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy for leiomyoma. Six months later, she reported lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Physical examination revealed rebound tenderness in the lower abdomen, and pelvic examination showed {{a small amount of}} vaginal bleeding with an evisceration of the small intestine through the vagina that exhibited healthy peristalsis. The eviscerated bowel, which seemed {{to be a part of}} the ileum, was carefully manually reduced transvaginally into the abdominal cavity. Laparoscopic observation revealed adhesions between the omentum, small intestine, and the peritoneum. Specifically, the small intestine was adhered around the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff.</b> An abdominal abscess was found in the left lower abdominal cavity. An adhesiotomy was performed and the abdominal abscess was removed and irrigated. Complete separation of the anterior and posterior <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> edges was obtained. The <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> was closed with interrupted 0 -polydioxanone absorbable sutures without bowel injury. A 6 -month follow-up examination revealed complete healing of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff.</b> Discussion: In this case, we were able to make use of both laparoscopic and transvaginal methods to perform a successful repair with a minimally invasive and safe technique. Conclusion: Laparoscopically assisted <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> suturing for <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence after total laparoscopic hysterectomy was found to be effective, safe, and minimally invasive...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> {{dehiscence}} after hysterectomy can be life-threating condition. Vaginal evisceration of bowel {{may lead}} to intestinal ischemia and intraabdominal infection. Immediate recognition and surgical repair are crucial for succesful management. Case report: Herein, we report a case of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence with small bowel evisceration in a 32 -year old woman who underwent laparoscopic type II hysterectomy for stage IA 2 cervical cancer.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> {{dehiscence}} {{is a rare}} complication following hysterectomy. The condition coexisting with intraabdominal organ evisceration occurs even rarer. Nevertheless {{this should}} not be neglected owing to high morbidity and mortality. Case presentation: The reported case is a 48 -year-old widow presenting with <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence and small bowel evisceration after undergoing a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) in the past 14 months due to myoma uteri. She denied having a history of sexual intercourse after the operation. The exposed bowel, 60 cm in length, appeared viable and no peritoneal sign was observed. There was a <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> defect approximately 3 cm in length. An exploratory laparotomy was then carried out. Eviscerated bowel was reduced back in the abdominal cavity and the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> defect was repaired. No complications such as recurrent dehiscence were observed during one year follow-up. Conclusion: To minimize the incidence of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence after hysterectomy, surgical techniques should be of concern. Patient instructions, including delaying sexual intercourse and avoiding all possible causes of increased intra-abdominal pressure should be provided postoperatively...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{complications}} that can arise from hysterectomy is <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence with subsequent bowel evisceration. Treatment via vaginal approach has been utilized in early cases of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence where the need for bowel resection is less likely. Our case examines the treatment of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence through a vaginal approach approximately 36 hours after apparent vaginal dehiscence with subsequent bowel evisceration. In this case, we chose a vaginal approach even in the setting of possible bowel obstruction and a significant leukocytosis. We utilized CT scan findings to help guide our surgical approach. Although the subjective appearance of the bowel protruding through the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> was reassuring, this played little role in guiding our decision with regard to surgical approach. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence with evisceration can be managed successfully via a vaginal approach even with prolonged exposure of the bowel to vaginal flora. CT scan should be utilized to evaluate bowel integrity when considering a vaginal dehiscence repair. A high index of suspicion is warranted as these cases can present up to many years after hysterectomy...|$|R
30|$|Discussion: <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> {{dehiscence}} occurs {{most commonly}} {{during the first}} three months after surgery. Both sexual intercourse prior to complete vaginal healing and the colpotomy/colporrhaphy techniques represent risk factors for <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence. In the reported case we emphasize the concomitant cardiovascular conditions possibly indicative of a connective tissue disorder.|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{report a}} rare case of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> {{dehiscence}} with small bowel evisceration at 7 months post robotic-staging surgery. Case Report: A 41 -year-old woman {{was sent to}} the emergency room with sudden onset of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and vaginal protruding mass after sexual activity. She had a history of synchronous uterine and ovarian cancer treated with robotic-staging surgery 7 months before. Then she received six courses of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, and the last chemotherapy ended 1 month ago. At the operation room, some small bowel loops were noted in the <b>vaginal</b> tip with <b>cuff</b> dehiscence and bleeding. After repositioning of the small bowel, a 2. 5 -cm <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence was repaired transvaginally. The patient recovered well, and is free of disease and has normal sexual activity 2 months after repairs. Conclusion: Unusual delayed-type <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence hints the possibility that a combination of robotic surgery and postoperative chemotherapy might result in delayed healing of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: The aim of {{our study}} is to {{evaluate}} the role of electrosurgery and vaginal closure technique {{in the development of}} postoperative <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence. Methods: From prospective surgical databases, we iden-tified 463 patients who underwent total laparoscopic hys-terectomy (TLH) for benign disease and 147 patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) for cancer. All TLHs and LAVHs were performed entirely by use of electrosurgery, including colpotomy. Colpotomy in the TLH group was performed with Har-monic Ace Curved Shears (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincin-nati, OH, USA), and in the LAVH group, it was performed with a monopolar electrosurgical pencil. The main surgi-cal difference was <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> closure—laparoscopically in the TLH group and vaginally in the LAVH group. Results: Although patients in the LAVH group were at increased risk for poor healing (significantly older, higher body mass index, more medical comorbidities, higher blood loss, and longer operative time), there were no <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscences in the LAVH group compared with 17 <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscences (4 %) in the TLH group (P. 02). Conclusion: It does not appear that the increased <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence rate associated with TLH is due to elec-trosurgery; rather, it is due to the vaginal closure tech-nique...|$|R
30|$|Complications {{requiring}} surgical {{intervention in}} general anesthesia occurred in 3 patients (0.8 %): 1 (0.3 %) hydroureteronephrosis, 1 (0.3 %) bowel adhesions, and 1 (0.3 %) port side hernia; complication requiring surgical intervention without general anesthesia occurred in 6 patients (1.6 %): 2 (0.6 %) hydroureteronephrosis, 1 (0.3 %) <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence, and 3 (0.8 %) <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> bleeding.|$|R
30|$|During the {{follow-up}} at 6  months from surgery, {{the patient was}} free of malignancy (cytology of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> and pelvic examination). Eleven months after surgery, routine follow-up examination revealed a 12 [*]×[*] 19 [*]×[*] 13 mm asymptomatic nodule in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff,</b> which was confirmed by pelvic ultrasound. Fine needle aspiration of the tumor was positive for malignant cells and the biopsy confirmed a recurrent adenocarcinoma similar to the patient’s primary endometrial tumor.

40|$|Background. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> {{dehiscence}} after hysterectomy has varying incidence {{according to}} surgical approach, with highest rates associated with laparoscopic surgery. Comparative data on timing of diagnosis describe {{a wide range}} of clinical presentation from weeks to years after hysterectomy. Limited reports have focused specifically on delayed presentation of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence. Cases. All cases of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence at our institution between 2005 and 2015 were collectively reviewed and three cases were identified of women who presented with cuff dehiscence greater than 180 days from index surgery. Diagnosis occurred at 342 to 461 days after operation. One patient presented with abdominal pain, a second case presented with vaginal discharge, and the third case lacked clinical symptoms altogether. Prior to diagnosis, one case received chemotherapy and external beam radiation for Stage IB 1 cervical cancer and another case received external beam radiation alone for Stage II endometrioid adenocarcinoma. All cuffs were repaired vaginally with interrupted, early absorbable suture. Conclusion. Robotic total laparoscopic hysterectomy may be associated with increased risk of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence. Further studies are needed to determine risk factors and patient characteristics associated with delayed presentation of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence in robotic total hysterectomy as well as all surgical approaches...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The current {{literature}} suggests that robotic procedures appear to incur the greatest risk of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the clinical outcomes in relation to <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence in patients undergoing total robotic hysterectomy (TRH) compared to conventional total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and the use of bidirectional barbed suture. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was performed including women undergoing either conventional total robotic hysterectomy (TRH) or total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2011 performed by a single surgeon. Age, weight, BMI, surgical procedure, EBL, <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> complication, dehiscence, DVT, and PE were evaluated. Chi square tests were used to determine associations in the contingency tables while for the continuous variables we used Student t test when appropriate or the Wilcoxon nonparametric test. All comparisons were two-sided where we used a Type I error of 0. 05. Results. A total of 437 patient charts were evaluated, with TRH group n = 243 and TLH group n = 194. There was a lower estimated blood loss and slightly higher uterine weight (184. 3 vs 183 g) in the TRH. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence = 1. 3 %, which was less among TRH (0. 41 %) vs TLH (2. 58 %), p = 0. 053. Bidirectional barbed suture was used more often in the TRH group (46. 5 % in TRH vs 0. 52 % in TLH). 23 There was no significant decrease in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence when a bidirectional barbed suture was used, (p = 0. 92). Yet, among the TRH group the risk of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence was 2. 5 times higher when conventional suture (2. 1 %, 1 / 47) was used vs quill suture (0. 8 %, 1 / 114). Conclusion. Although there is a reported increased risk of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence after robotic hysterectomy compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, our study found that the incidence doubled among those undergoing a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.

30|$|Our {{findings}} suggest that the increased risk of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence following TLH and RAH may not be entirely explained by the surgical characteristics inherent to these procedures, as has been previously theorized in the literature. Instead, we have shown that patient characteristics may account for, at least partially, the increased rate of dehiscence following a laparoscopic approach. We hypothesize that obesity is protective against dehiscence following TLH and RALH secondary to both structural and physiologic properties. Act of first coitus following total hysterectomy has been a commonly identified inciting event for <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence [4, 5, 8, 10, 11]. Physical forces at the apex of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> during intercourse may be decreased in more obese women, thus providing a protective effect. Similarly, positioning during intercourse may be different in obese patients as compared to normal weight individuals (i.e., as in pregnant patients), which may also confer decreased physical force along the healing <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff.</b> Older women may experience decreased postoperative activity, including intercourse, which may explain the protective effect demonstrated in this study. However, such proposed theories need to be further examined through studies involving detailed patient questionnaires to better elucidate specific postoperative activity patterns.|$|R
30|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> {{dehiscence}} {{was defined}} as partial or complete separation of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> with or without evisceration. TLHs and robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomies (RAHs) in our study were defined as hysterectomies performed entirely through a laparoscopic or robotic approach, including colpotomy and cuff closure [17]. Hysterectomies performed laparoscopically but with a <b>vaginal</b> colpotomy and/or <b>cuff</b> closure were categorized as laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). As a separate diagnostic code did not exist to distinguish TLH and RAH from LAVH {{for a majority of}} the study period, appropriate classification of hysterectomy type was confirmed by operative note review.|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> {{dehiscence}} is a rare, {{but potentially}} morbid, complication of total hysterectomy and refers to {{separation of the}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> closure. The term <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> dehiscence is frequently interchanged with the terms of cuff separation or cuff rupture. All denote the separation of a vaginal incision that was previously closed at time of total hysterectomy. After dehiscence of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff,</b> abdominal or pelvic contents may prolapse through the vaginal opening. Bowel evisceration, outside the vulvar introitus, can lead to serious sequelae, including peritonitis, bowel injury and necrosis, or sepsis. Therefore, although prompt surgical and medical intervention is required to replace prolapsed structures, the main problem remains the reconstruction of vaginal vault. In case of recent hysterectomy, vaginal reparation only requires the approximation of vaginal walls, including their fascia, while if dehiscence occurs after a long time from hysterectomy, the adequate suspension of the vaginal vault {{has to be taken}} into consideration. In this report we describe the case of a postmenopausal patient, undergoing surgical emergency because of the evisceration of an intestinal loop through a dehiscence of vaginal vault, after numerous reconstructive vaginal surgeries for vaginal prolapse.

30|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> open vs. closed are the {{two options}} once the corpus and the cervix are removed.

Though they differed in how they closed the cuff and the primary outcomes, two of three RCTs noted {{a significant decrease in}} the operative time when the cuff was closed, possibly due to the hemostasis at the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> obtained during closure with staples or sutures [23, 26]. Using staples to close the cuff [23], there was significant improvement in intraoperative hemostasis and granulation at 6  weeks postoperative. Compared to when the cuff is open, the amount of fluid in the pelvis with a closed cuff is significantly higher on postoperative day 5 [26]. This, however, was not associated with improved febrile morbidity (recommendations, C; certainty, moderate).|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> in various lesions in the female genital tract. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six FNAs of <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> lesions were performed at our institution from 1994 to 1998. All cases were reviewed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a known {{risk factor}} for {{postoperative}} infection following abdominal hysterectomy. Vaginal bacterial flora scored as intermediate {{has been shown to}} have the same risk of postoperative infection as BV. METHODS: Women undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy for benign diseases were open-randomized according to Zelen to either treatment with metronidazole rectally for at least 4 days or no treatment. At the preoperative gynecological examination a vaginal smear was collected and Gram stained. Women with BV or intermediate flora were merged to one group called abnormal vaginal flora. RESULTS: In total 213 women were randomized to treatment or no treatment. After exclusion of 71 women, 142 women were eligible for analysis. Among the 59 women diagnosed with abnormal vaginal flora there were no <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> infections in the treated arm, compared with 27 % in the 'no treatment' arm (p < 0. 01). Treatment also reduced the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cuff</b> infection rate from 9. 5 to 2 % among the 83 women with lactobacilli flora. However, this difference was not statistically significant.

Therefore, although prompt surgical and medical intervention is required to replace prolapsed structures, the main problem remains the reconstruction of vaginal vault. In case of recent hysterectomy, vaginal reparation only requires the approximation of vaginal walls, including their fascia, while if dehiscence occurs after a long time from hysterectomy, the adequate suspension of the vaginal vault {{has to be taken}} into consideration. In this report we describe the case of a postmenopausal patient, undergoing surgical emergency because of the evisceration of an intestinal loop through a dehiscence of vaginal vault, after numerous reconstructive vaginal surgeries for vaginal prolapse. This paper analyzes clinical circumstances, risk factors, comorbidity, and clinical and surgical management of this complication. 1...|$|R
