5000|$|Revolving debt: This is credit <b>card</b> debt, <b>retail</b> <b>card</b> {{debt and}} some {{petroleum}} cards. And while home equity {{lines of credit}} have revolving terms the bulk of debt considered is true unsecured revolving debt incurred on plastic. The most important measurement from this category is called [...] "Revolving Utilization", which {{is the relationship between}} the consumer's aggregate credit card balances and the available credit card limits, also called [...] "open to buy." [...] This is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the aggregate credit card balances by the aggregate credit limits and multiplying the result by 100, thus yielding the utilization percentage. The higher that percentage the lower the cardholder's score will likely be. This is why closing credit cards is generally not a good idea for someone trying to improve their credit scores. Closing one or more credit card accounts will reduce their total available credit limits and likely increase the utilization percentage unless the cardholder reduces their balances at the same pace.|$|R
