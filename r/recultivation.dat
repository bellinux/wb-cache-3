40|$|Abstract: Microsatellites {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in plant genomes and comprise unstable regions that undergo mutational changes at rates {{much greater than}} that observed for non-repetitive sequences. They demonstrate intrinsic genetic instability, manifested as frequent length changes due to insertions or deletions of repeat units. Detailed analysis of 1600 clones containing genomic sequences of Vicia bithynica revealed the presence of microsatellite repeats in its genome. Based on the screening of a partial DNA library of plasmids, 13 clones harbouring (GA/TC) n tracts of various lengths of repeated motif were identified for further analysis of their internal sequence organization. Sequence analyses revealed the precise length, number of repeats, interruptions within tracts, as well as sequence composition flanking the repeat motifs. Representative plasmids containing different lengths of (GA/TC) n embedded in their original flanking sequence were used to investigate the genetic stability of the repeats. In the study presented herein, we employed a well characterised and tractable bacterial genetic system. <b>Recultivations</b> of Escherichia coli harbouring plasmids containing (GA/TC) n inserts demonstrated that the genetic instability of (GA/TC) n microsatellites depends highly on their length (number of repeats). These observations are in agreement with similar studies performed on repetitive sequences from humans and other organisms...|$|R
40|$|To conduct complex research, {{the system}} of {{classification}} of biological objects was developed and adapted for different nature conditions and forms of anthropogenic impacts. The experience of organization of biological investigations at coal mine dumps and gold-mining polygons, pollutant emissions, operating and developing hydropower station reservoirs {{was used in the}} work. The general structure of development of the classification schemes of anthropogenic lands is presented with three generalized specific levels distinguished. The form and intensity of the anthropogenic impacts were used for zoning. Spatial extrapolation and forecast of the anthropogenic impacts are made with respect to the geomorphological state and succession’ dynamics of the anthropogenic habitats. Monitoring and resource estimation are carried out by the succession stages. Quantitative estimation {{of the structure of the}} anthropogenic lands is made with a use of moderate- and high- resolution satellite data in GIS. Types of mountain <b>recultivations</b> of coal mine dumps determine three post-anthropogenic succession series/classes: erosion, forest, and steppe. They are divided by groups of types depending on succession stage – from juvenile to closed corresponded to the zonal standards. The type shows stage that is determined by the dominant vegetation. For Norilsk anthropogenic region where there is constant pollutants impact, five classes/zones, four groups of types by geomorphological characteristics and two additional indicators which estimate the presence of dead ground vegetation as well as six types by dominant vegetation were defined. Classification scheme of the impact of hydropower station reservoirs is characterized by three levels of generalization for water and coast surfaces. The basin is divided by classes depending on the width and direction of the dominant winds (open, closed), groups of types depending on depth (deep-, shallow-water), types depending on flowage and stagnation. The coastline is divided by classes of constant marginal erosion, periodical impoundment and climate impact, group of types and types by well-known succession series and stages typical for the coast vegetation. ...|$|R

By contrast, the <b>recultivation</b> of older sites, that {{as early as the}} Napoleonic and royal Prussian eras were valued and mapped due to their above-average land prices. Many of these sites are stand out due to the unusual stock of vines and wider terraces; instead of the closely spaced individual stakes with the traditional curvature, new vines are increasingly trained using espalier wires and are spaced more widely apart. In the Moselweisser Hamm area, shortly before Koblenz, the <b>recultivation</b> and terracing of old vineyards was carried out using sloping, grassed embankments instead of stone walls.

50|$|The first {{plans of}} János Kóka, Minister of the Economy and Transport, were more radical, abandoning 26 lines (or 12% {{of the entire}} network), but they were met with strong {{opposition}} from the local municipalities, parliamentary opposition parties and civil organizations. The main opposition party claimed that these measures were directed against more rural areas, especially small villages. The issue was heavily politicized. People considered the buses less safe or fast especially in winter. Since the government wanted to avoid costly environmental protection and <b>recultivation</b> regulations, the railway lines will not be formally ceased, with the tracks removed, just the service suspended indefinitely. However, because of widespread scrap metal theft in Hungary, this effectively means the tracks are written off.|$|E

Archaeologists suggest that between 800 and 1000 AD drought, desertification and expansion of sand dunes on Guadeloupe led to a period with no active habitation based on the scarcity of remains from the period; this period coincides historically with the droughts and subsequent collapse of the Mayan civilizations in Mesoamerica. Gradual resettlement and <b>recultivation</b> of the land on Guadeloupe occurred between 1000 AD {{and the arrival of}} Columbus.|$|E
