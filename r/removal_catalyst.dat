40|$|Growing {{concern about}} sulfur dioxide (SO 2) {{poisoning}} NOx <b>removal</b> <b>catalysts</b> {{has resulted in}} the development of desulfurization materials for SO 2 trap. In this study, a series of high-specific-surface-area manganese oxide (HSSA MnO 2) were selected as desulfurization materials and characterized by nitrogen adsorption and SEM. HSSA MnO 2 has good SO 2 capture performance over a wide temperature range. At low temperature, SO 2 capture capacity and adsorption rate increase with the specific surface area and HSSA MnO 2 showed high SO 2 capture performance. The effect of temperature on sulfate rate of HSSA MnO 2 {{can be explained by the}} grain model. The gradient of sulfate rate constant decreases with increasing the reaction temperature, and there is a sudden drop at 500 degrees C. The SO 2 capture performance of regenerated HSSA MnO 2 decreases sharply because of physical damage by calcination at high temperature. (c) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|Overviewing the {{previous}} literatures {{show that there}} have been quite a lot of studies on the removal of odour sulfur compound using the adsorption method [18, 19]. However, so far, very few publications have been reported on the H 2 S and the organic sulfur chemical conversion to odourless sulfur and also, the sorbent can experience self-regeneration during the application. Especially, in the open air environment for long-term applications, such as in waste water treatment plant or sludge disposal, where there have been lots of surface sulfur odour sources, the sorbent could be embedded into the construction materials as long its functions would be sustained, which does not need regular changes. This would be a big challenge for the odour <b>removal</b> <b>catalyst</b> development. In this work, we have developed a self-regenerable catalyst types sorbent, which can effectively convert H 2 S and COS into sulfur powder and also convert CO into CO 2, thus removing the odour in an actively chemical ways.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper olivine is {{considered}} as a prospective in-bed tar <b>removal</b> <b>catalyst</b> for fluidized bed biomass gasifiers. The catalytic activity of olivine is investigated via steam reforming reaction of naphthalene as a model biomass tar compound. It is observed that the calcination of olivine improves {{the performance of the}} catalyst. Calcination of olivine is done with air at 900 °C for different treatment times. With increasing calcination time, tar conversion increases; more than 80 % naphthalene conversion is observed with 10 h of calcination time for olivine, which is found to be an optimum as further increase in time up to 20 h does not improve the naphthalene conversion. The primary focus {{of this paper is to}} characterize the olivine catalysts under investigation (specific composition (Mg 1. 78, Fe 0. 13) SiO 4) with different calcination times. Techniques such as BET-surface area analysis, XPS, Mössbauer spectroscopy, TPR, SEM/EDX analysis are used to understand the basic phenomena of calcination of olivine. Olivine is observed to be non porous. SEM/EDX show iron rich areas at the surface of olivine after calcination. Severe segregation of iron is observed at the surface due to calcination, which is found to be non-uniform. Mössbauer spectroscopy reveals the appearance of iron(III) phase in the olivine after calcination. Besides the catalytic activity towards tar reduction, olivine is also observed to be highly attrition resistant to be used as an in-bed additive for fluid bed and moving bed biomass gasifiers...|$|E

Dolomite, olivine and alumina are three well known tar <b>removal</b> <b>catalysts</b> used in biomass gasification processing.

The aim {{of the current study}} was to learn about the influence of these three catalysts in the product distribution and tar production during sewage sludge gasification. To this end, a set of assays was performed in which the temperature (750 – 850 °C), the in-bed catalyst content (0, 10 and 15 wt. %) and the steam–biomass ratio (SB) in the range of 0 – 1 were varied with a constant equivalence ratio (ER) of 0. 3. The results were compared to the results from gasification without a catalyst. We show that dolomite has the highest activity in tar elimination, followed by alumina and olivine.

40|$|With {{respect to}} global issues of {{sustainable}} energy, biomass is getting increased attention as a renewable energy source. Biomass gasification {{is the only}} process that produces a syn-gas mixture which has numerous opportunities for applications such as for gas turbines, engines, fuel cells, hydrocarbon synthesis, hydrogen production etc. One of the major issues in biomass gasification is {{to deal with the}} formation of tar. Tar is a term used to describe a complex mixture of condensable hydrocarbons and is undesirable due to its condensation causing blockage in the process equipments. The successful implementation of biomass gasification depends much on the effective and efficient tar removal from the producer gas. This paper addresses several issues on tar treatment with special emphasis on use of olivine as tar <b>removal</b> <b>catalyst</b> and use of non-thermal plasma for tar removal. In order to facilitate the study tar conversion, naphthalene is chosen as a model biomass tar compound {{which is one of the}} most stable and therefore the most difficult tar to decompose. Olivine, a naturally occurring mineral, is a very attractive inbed catalyst for fluidized bed biomass gasifiers as it shows high attrition resistance. A simple method of pre-treatment of olivine can improve the catalytic activity of olivine significantly. A naphthalene conversion of more than 81 % is observed over olivine catalyst which is pre-treated with air for 10 hours at a temperature of 900 °C. Chemical conversion of tar requires high temperatures to initiate the reactions. Apart from temperature, another approach to generate this reactive environment is by means of gas discharges. Atmospheric pressure gas discharges or non-thermal plasma as is commonly referred to, generates high energy electrons which dissociate molecules and thereby creates the necessary reactive environment. The major advantage of using non-thermal plasma is to do chemical conv~rsion of tars at low temperatures. The experimental results have indicated complete conversion of tar by pulsed corona processing at much lower temperature. The energy density requirement is observed to be 400 - 600 JIL for naphthalene removal from a fuel gas mixture at a temperature of 200 °C. This could be significantly reduced to 200 - 250 JIL by increasing the temperature to 400 °C. The investigations also indicate that the gaseous environment has strong influence on tar cracking reactions. For both the methods presented here, it is observed that presence of H, and CO in the gas mixture, do not improve the tar removal efficiency of the processes for high temperature processes...|$|E

50|$|Nanoscale metal {{catalysts}} {{are important}} ingredients for fixed- and fluidized-bed CVD synthesis of CNTs.
