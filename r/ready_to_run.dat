5|$|Drnovšek's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not run for president again led to expectations that the Social Democrats (SD) would nominate their leader Borut Pahor and indeed Pahor confirmed that he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for the office. The Social Democrats had become the most popular party in opinion polls and were considered the likely winners at the next general election in 2008; opinion polls indicated that Pahor would easily win the presidential election. However, after months of mixed signals, Pahor finally announced that he would instead concentrate on the general election and would not run for the mostly ceremonial office of the president.|$|E

25|$|Although toy trains were {{historically}} produced to this scale, O gauge's popularity {{across the}} whole of Europe reduced after World War II, and the standard is rarer than in the United States. Modelling in O gauge in fact almost died out in Britain but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s as modellers developed a new appreciation for the level of accurate detailing possible in this scale. Some <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> models are produced in this scale but most are available only as kits for assembly by the modeller or a professional model-builder. O gauge is considered an expensive scale to model in although the necessarily smaller scope of a larger-scaled layout mitigates this to some extent. The two dominant British manufacturers, Bassett-Lowke and Hornby, ceased production of O gauge trains in 1965 and 1969, respectively. However, ACE Trains {{and for a while}} a revived Bassett-Lowke are once again producing tinplate O gauge sets, many of them reproductions of classic Hornby and Bassett-Lowke designs, and Heljan also recently joined the market producing O gauge Diesel locomotives.|$|E
500|$|Among his Maryland {{teammates}} and coaches, Turner {{earned a reputation}} as an archetypal [...] "laid-back" [...] Californian and for remaining calm under pressure. After the 2007 win over Rutgers, offensive tackle Scott Burley described his roommate Turner as [...] "real calm ... He would say, 'Guys, are you ready to score again? Are you <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the ball on these guys?' And we're like, 'Yeah, let's do that.'" [...] Turner received the nicknames [...] "Sunshine" [...] and [...] "Napoleon Dynamite", in reference to his similar appearance to the fictional characters in the films Remember the Titans and Napoleon Dynamite, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Under this {{arrangement}} Etty {{did not receive}} formal tuition from Lawrence. Instead, Lawrence set aside a room in his attic for Etty to copy from his pictures, and agreed to answer Etty's questions {{when he was in}} a position to do so. Etty found the experience of trying to copy Lawrence's work extremely frustrating, and in his own words [...] "was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away", but he persisted and eventually taught himself to copy Lawrence's work very closely. Although Etty found his year with Lawrence a frustrating experience, his development of the ability to copy other works served him in good stead in future when he came to copy elements from the Old Masters.|$|E

500|$|Capuano ran for Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth in the 1994 election, {{running against}} former State Representatives Augusto Grace and William F. Galvin for the Democratic nomination. During the race he framed {{himself as an}} {{advocate}} {{for the poor and}} urban communities, and criticized aid formulas which he argued left less-wealthy municipalities with less per-capita revenue. To appear on the Democratic primary required the support of at least 15% of delegates in the state party convention. In what the Boston Globe deemed [...] "an embarrassing defeat," [...] he was disqualified from the race with only 13% of delegate votes. When asked why he staged the difficult race to begin with, he responded, [...] "Because I wasn't <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for Governor." ...|$|E
500|$|As an actress, {{she entered}} Broadway {{as a star}} on sheer talent and little training... she sang abroad for two summers, fully expecting that the next step would be the Metropolitan Opera. In {{politics}} after five months {{of working with the}} [...] Women's Division, it seemed only natural that she head the state's organization and serve as Democratic National Committeewoman. Restless after three years in those positions, she saw the possibility of becoming a member of Congress as a logical next step. Only four years later, she felt <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for the Senate. But her lack of political experience and her inflexible stands on political issues, along with gender questions, eroded the support of the Democratic Party in 1950. What in fact may have hurt her the most is that for which she is most remembered—her idealism.|$|E
500|$|SIMD {{parallel}} computers {{can be traced}} back to the 1970s. The motivation behind early SIMD computers was to amortize the gate delay of the processor's control unit over multiple instructions. In 1964, Slotnick had proposed building a massively parallel computer for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. His design was funded by the US Air Force, which was the earliest SIMD parallel-computing effort, ILLIAC IV. The key to its design was a fairly high parallelism, with up to 256processors, which allowed the machine to work on large datasets in what would later be known as vector processing. However, ILLIAC IV was called [...] "the most infamous of supercomputers", because the project was only one fourth completed, but took 11years and cost almost four times the original estimate. When it was finally <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> its first real application in 1976, it was outperformed by existing commercial supercomputers such as the Cray-1.|$|E

Furtado emerges and starts singing, and she and the dancers leave the restroom and {{walk out of the}} club while Furtado is holding a gnome. During daytime, Furtado's dancers walk down the street to her apartment, walk into her bedroom and wake her up. They get dressed and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> dance, <b>run</b> down the stairs and tow a car into the studio, where Furtado begins performing choreography with her dancers.

25|$|Many trains {{arrived at}} Exeter from the Bristol and Exeter Railway very late. Because the South Devon line was only {{equipped}} with a telegraph that linked the stations, the engines had to start pumping for when the timetable said that the trains were due to enter their section and then keep pumping until the train eventually passed. This meant that the engines pumped for {{twice as long as}} was necessary and meant that much more coke was consumed than would have been the case if pumping had only been undertaken when the train was actually <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>run.</b> The engine houses were connected to the telegraph system on 2 August 1848 but a lack of trained staff meant that it was not fully used.|$|R

2500|$|The Republicans {{who could}} not escape Málaga were either shot or imprisoned. After the fall of Malaga, the Nationalists {{executed}} 4,000 Republicans only in the city itself. Thousands of Republican refugees fled from the city along the coast, many of them died. The Nationalists {{caught up with the}} fleeing Republicans on the road to Almería and shot the men, but let the women continue so as to put the burden of feeding them on the Republican government. Paul Preston said: [...] "The crowds of refugees who blocked the road out of Malaga had been in an inferno. They were shelled from the sea, bombed from the air and then machine-gunned. The scale of the repression inside the fallen city explained why they were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the gauntlet." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{week after}} the engagement, the {{proposed}} Anglo-Russo alliance experienced its first crisis. Queen Victoria asked the Tsar to bring Maria to Scotland, {{so that she could}} meet her future daughter-in-law. Alexander II refused. The Tsarina suggested that they all meet in Cologne, instead. The Queen called it [...] "simply impertinent" [...] that [...] "I ... who have been nearly twenty years longer on the throne than the Emperor of Russia ... and who am a Reigning Sovereign ... should be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> to the slightest call of the mighty Russians ... like any little Princess." [...] Victoria also made herself unpopular by refusing the Tsar’s offer to make the Prince of Wales colonel of a Russian regiment, and by demanding that an Anglican marriage service be held in St Petersburg alongside the Orthodox ceremony. But Maria Alexandrovna looked forward happily to her marriage: [...] "How happy I am to belong to him. I feel that my love for him is growing daily. I have a feeling of peace and inexpressible happiness and a boundless impatience to be altogether his own." ...|$|E

40|$|Different {{companies}} {{sharing the}} same cloud infrastructure often prefer <b>to</b> <b>run</b> their virtual machines (VMs) in isolation, i. e., one VM per physical machine (PM) core, due to security and efficiency concerns. To accommodate load spikes, e. g., those caused by flash-crowds, each service is allocated more machines than necessary for its instantaneous load. However, flash-crowds of different hosted services are not correlated, so at any given time, only {{a subset of the}} machines are used. We present here the concept of preallocation — having a single physical machine <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>run</b> one of a few possible VMs, without ever running more than one at a given time. The preallocated VMs are initialized and then paused by the hypervisor. We suggest a greedy preallocation strategy, and evaluate it by simulation, using workloads based on previous analyses of flash-crowds. We observe a reduction of 35 - 50 % in number of PMs used compared with classical dynamic allocation. This means that a datacenter can provide per-service isolation with 35 %- 50 % fewer PMs. ...|$|R
