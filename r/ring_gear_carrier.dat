30|$|A {{planetary}} gearbox typically consists of some key components: a sun gear, planet gear, <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>carrier,</b> and bearing, and faults may occur in these components owing to fatigue or tough working conditions. According to a condition-monitoring report on wind turbines, a gearbox failure {{is the leading}} contributor to all wind turbine failures [3]. A vibration-based method was proven {{to be one of}} the most popular techniques in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, and it has been determined that certain changes to the vibration signals can be seen when a fault occurs, e.g., crack or spalling [4 – 6]. The commonly used vibration signal processing methods can be divided into three categories: time domain methods, frequency domain methods, and time–frequency domain methods. Time domain methods refer to the analysis of a signal with respect to time, and are relatively easy and direct compared to both frequency and time–frequency domain methods. Statistical indicators, the time synchronous averaging (TSA) method, and an autoregressive (AR) model are typically used in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery [4, 7 – 9]. Frequency domain methods refer to an analysis of the signals with respect to the frequency, and a periodic signal in the time domain can be converted into a frequency component through a Fourier transformation. In this way, researchers can identify the difference between the spectrum of a normal vibration signal and a fault vibration signal with commonly used methods that include a spectrum-based analysis, resonance demodulation technique, and cepstrum analysis [10 – 12]. In contrast, time–frequency domain methods are used to study a signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously, allowing both the constituent frequency components and their time variation features to be revealed and analyzed. Researchers have developed various time–frequency domain methods including a short-time Fourier transformation, Wigner–Ville distribution, continuous wavelet transform, and Hilbert-Huang transformation [13 – 16]. Although vibration-based methods have been successfully used in the fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of rotating machinery, the appearance of faults in the analysis results has to be identified artificially, e.g., the identification of a fault characteristic frequency in the spectrum, the determination of a filter sub-band in a demodulation analysis, or the determination of a wavelet type, all of which require considerable of experience and expertise [17 – 19]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop some intelligent techniques that can automatically determine the health conditions of a {{planetary gearbox}}.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of a single-stage planetary gear set with helical gears of multishaft automotive automatic transmissions has been studied, in which one component of the planetary gear set is imposed by additional external vertical and axial loading from countershaft gear pair {{in addition to the}} moment.

A three-dimensional nonlinear time-variant dynamic model considering not only the transverse, torsional, axial, and rotational motions of the gears but also the elasticity of the mounted shafts has been developed by combining the lumped parameter method with finite element method.

40|$|Abstract. 3 K {{type and}} 2 K- 2 H type {{planetary}} gear trains {{can be designed}} to have high reduction ratios. Due to the reason of power circulation, these two kinds of planetary gear trains with high reduction ratios have low meshing efficiencies. The 2 K type planetary gear reducer only contain two <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> and one <b>carrier,</b> hence it {{will not have the}} problem of power circulation and will have better meshing efficiency than 3 K type and 2 K- 2 H type planetary gear reducers. Also, in general, the gear reducers with high reduction ratio are compound gear system. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose 2 K type planetary simple gear reducers with high reduction ratios. Based on the concept of train value equation, the kinematic design of 2 K type planetary gear trains with high reduction ratio are synthesized. Six 2 K type planetary gear reducers are designed to illustrate the kinematic design process. Three of the examples are 2 K type planetary gear reducers with simple planet gears. For the 2 K type planetary simple gear reducer, there is a problem that is the simple planet gear engages to two <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> with different tooth number. One example is used to illustrate how to design the two <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> with different shift coefficient to engage the same planet gear. Based on the proposed process, all 2 K type planetary simple gear reducers with high reduction ratios can be synthesized...|$|R
50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock the same <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun <b>gear.</b> The planet <b>carrier</b> of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. The rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|R

40|$|The {{strain of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> can reflect the dynamic {{characteristics}} of planetary gearboxes directly, which makes it an ideal signal to monitor the health condition of the gearbox. To overcome the disadvantages of traditional methods, a new approach for the dynamic measurement of <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> strains using fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the installation of FBGs is determined according to the analysis for the strain distribution of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Secondly, {{the parameters of the}} FBG are determined in consideration of the accuracy and sensitivity of the measurement as well as the size of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The strain measured by the FBG is then simulated under non-uniform strain field conditions.

50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R

The assembly conditions of compound planetary gears are more restrictive than simple planetary gears, and they must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> at opposite ends of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. Compound planetary gears can easily achieve larger transmission ratio with equal or smaller volume.
