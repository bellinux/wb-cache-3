5|$|Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> {{has been}} {{threatened}} {{since the late}} 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, even though they continue to support their community. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.|$|E
5|$|Asian rice was domesticated 8,200–13,500 {{years ago}} in China, with a single genetic origin from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon, in the Pearl River valley region of China. <b>Rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> then spread to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{population}} size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million {{people because of}} extensive <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that they could easily provide to the growing market.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days, Chinese Foochow {{settlers}} in Sibu tried {{to convert the}} town into a <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> centre. However, this vision did not materialise because the soil was not suitable for <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation.</b> In August 1909, Charles Brooke agreed to grant land titles to Sibu Chinese farmers and encouraged them to cultivate rubber plantations. The rise of rubber prices from 1909 to 1911 had encouraged another 2,000 Foochow settles to come to Sibu. The demand for rubber rose again during Korean War between 1950 and 1953 and has benefited Sibu rubber plantations. Local farmers later used the profits from rubber plantations into setting up shops at Sungai Merah and Durin bazaars and involve in more profitable timber industry. During the Sarawak Communist Insurgency in the 1970s, rural farmers had to abandon their rubber plantations because of martial law declared by the state government which forbade them for helping the communists operating in the jungles.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} an updated estimation of annual Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission from crop and <b>rice</b> <b>cultivations</b> from year 2008 to 2012 in Sarawak. This includes GHG estimation from <b>rice</b> <b>cultivations,</b> biomass and soils organic. The estimation of GHG emission {{in this study}} is conducted in accordance to 2006 IPCC guidelines for Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, where uncertainty analyses are incorporated. This study also presents findings at urban and non-urban areas of Sarawak and its comparisons. It is found that, the change in biomass for both urban and non-urban areas in Sarawak increases yearly with significant changes in biomass at urban areas at 160. 29 × 103 tons C yr− 1 as compared to non-urban areas at 45. 90 × 103 tons C yr− 1. It is also found that, the annual carbon loss from cultivated organic soil at urban areas is higher at 6. 17 × 106 tons C yr− 1 in Miri. Total CH 4 emission from wet paddy in non-urban areas is found to be higher than urban areas at 19. 01 Gg CH 4 yr− 1. This study would unable relevant authorities to use the values of GHG emission estimated in this study for the purpose of analysis on vulnerability, adaption and mitigation...|$|R

5|$|Two {{archaeological sites}} {{in the city of}} Gifu have shown that the area around modern-day Gifu has had {{residents}} since pre-history because of Gifu's location in the fertile Nōbi Plain. The Ryomonji and Kotozuka sites have produced large burial mounds that are representative of the late-Yayoi period, which is when <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> began in Japan. As civilization in Japan grew, permanent settlements began to appear and, eventually, the village of Inokuchi was established, which would eventually become the modern city of Gifu.|$|E
40|$|Methane (CH 4) and {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) fluxes were {{measured}} from paddy–upland rotation (three years for soybean {{and three years}} for rice) with different soil fertility due to preceding compost application for four years (i. e., 3 kg FW m− 2 year− 1 of immature or mature compost application plots and a control plot without compost). Net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance was evaluated by integrating CH 4 and N 2 O emissions and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions calculated from a decline in soil carbon storage. N 2 O emissions from the soybean upland tended to be higher in the immature compost plot. CH 4 emissions from the rice paddy increased every year and tended to be higher in the mature compost plot. Fifty-two to 68 % of the increased soil carbon by preceding compost application {{was estimated to be}} lost during soybean cultivation. The major component of net GHG emission was CO 2 (82 – 94 %) and CH 4 (72 – 84 %) during the soybean and <b>rice</b> <b>cultivations,</b> respectively. Net GHG emissions during the soybean and <b>rice</b> <b>cultivations</b> were comparable. Consequently, the effects of compost application on the net GHG balance from the paddy–upland rotation should be carefully evaluated with regards to both advantages (initial input to the soil) and disadvantages (following increases in GHG) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The ERMES agromonitoring {{system for}} <b>rice</b> <b>cultivations</b> {{integrates}} EO data at different resolutions, crop models, and user-provided in situ {{data in a}} unified system, which drives two operational downstream services for rice monitoring. The first is aimed at providing information concerning {{the behavior of the}} current season at regional/rice district scale, while the second is dedicated to provide farmers with field-scale data useful to support more efficient and environmentally friendly crop practices. In this contribution, we describe the main characteristics of the system, in terms of overall architecture, technological solutions adopted, characteristics of the developed products, and functionalities provided to end users. Peculiarities of the system reside in its ability to cope with the needs of different stakeholders within a common platform, and in a tight integration between EO data processing and information retrieval, crop modeling, in situ data collection, and information dissemination. The ERMES system has been operationally tested in three European rice-producing countries (Italy, Spain, and Greece) during growing seasons 2015 and 2016, providing a great amount of near-real-time information concerning rice crops. Highlights of significant results are provided, with particular focus on real-world applications of ERMES products and services. Although developed with focus on European <b>rice</b> <b>cultivations,</b> solutions implemented in the ERMES system can be, and are already being, adapted to other crops and/or areas of the world, thus making it a valuable testing bed for the development of advanced, integrated agricultural monitoring systems...|$|R

5|$|The testimonies of explorers {{and colonial}} administrators {{demonstrate}} that Carabane {{has participated in}} <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation,</b> fishery, trade, and palm wine production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role {{in the lives of}} the population. Palm oil and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants have been reluctant to participate. Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} populations of sarus cranes in South-east Asia: the northern population in China and Myanmar, {{and the southern}} population in Cambodia and Vietnam. The sarus used to extend to Thailand and further east into the Philippines, but may now be extinct in both these countries. In 2011, 24 captive bred cranes raised from five original founders were reintroduced into Thailand. In Australia they are found only in the northern parts, and are partly migratory in some areas. The global range has shrunk and the largest occupied area is now in India. With marshlands largely destroyed, these cranes are increasingly dependent on wet paddy fields in India. Although now found mainly at a low elevation on the plains, there are some historical records from highland marshes further north in Harkit Sar and Kahag in Kashmir. The sarus crane breeds in some high elevation regions such as near the Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh, where populations may be growing in response to increasing <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> along the reservoir. In rice-dominated districts of Uttar Pradesh, sarus crane abundance (estimated as occupancy) was highest in the western districts, intermediate in the central districts, and minimal in the eastern districts. Sarus crane abundance was positively associated with percentage of wetlands on the landscape, and negatively with the percentage of area under <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, Ratanakiri Province had a {{population}} of approximately 184,000. Its population nearly doubled between 1998 and 2013, largely due to internal migration. In 2013, Ratanakiri made up 1.3% of Cambodia's total population; its population density of 17.0 residents per square kilometer was just over one fifth the national average. About 70% of the province's population lives in the highlands; of the other 30%, approximately half live in more urbanized towns, and half live along rivers and in the lowlands, where they practice wetland <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> and engage in market activities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to assess the soil quality by aggregate indices using the Relative Soil Quality Index (RSQI) proposed by Ho Ngoc Pham. RSQI is integrated from the individual indices into a simple formula for overall assessment of the soil quality. RSQI is different from other approaches. Particularly, the individual indices and the weighting factors of Pham are calculated from the analytical laboratory data and the environmental standards, respectively, and not self-regulated as in methods of some other authors. In this paper, the authors applied the RSQI to assess the Soil Environmental Quality of <b>rice</b> intensive <b>cultivation</b> areas through a case study in Haiduong province in 2013. The RSQI is calculated for sampling points in 12 districts and simulated the Soil Environmental Quality on GIS map. The results show that the Soil Environmental Quality of <b>rice</b> intensive <b>cultivation</b> areas in Haiduong is predominantly divided into three levels: good, moderate, and poor. According to the report of General Statistics Office for Haiduong province, <b>rice</b> intensive <b>cultivation</b> areas in 2013 achieved a relatively high average rice yield of 5. 90 tonnes per hectare; it means actual soil properties are in line with results of the research...|$|R
5|$|The {{economy of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom was based mainly on agriculture. The main {{agricultural}} product was rice, the cultivation of which was supported by an intricate irrigation network. <b>Rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> began around the Malvatu oya, Deduru oya and Mahaweli river and spread throughout the country. Shifting cultivation was also done during the rainy seasons. Rice was produced in two main seasons named Yala and Maha. Due to the extensive production of rice, the country was mostly self-sufficient. Cotton was grown extensively {{to meet the requirements}} of cloth. Sugarcane and Sesame were also grown and there are frequent references in classical literature to these agricultural products. Finger millet was grown as a substitute for rice, particularly in the dry zone of the country. Surpluses of these products, mainly rice, were exported.|$|E
5|$|Farming villagers in {{the north}} spent their days {{harvesting}} crops like wheat and millet, while farmers south of the Huai River engaged in intensive <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised. The cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the Yangzi River; even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops. Some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo. Besides cutting down trees to sell wood, the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal, and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots, and weaving mats and baskets. In the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common, while in the south the myriad of rivers, canals, and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport. Although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers, there were on average many more owner-cultivators north of the Huai River due to harsher climate, living not far above subsistence level.|$|E
5|$|Recorded dietary {{items include}} sago shoots and insects, {{and it also}} {{swallows}} small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently monogamous, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour. The only known nest was a shallow bowl {{in the top of}} a rotting tree stump that was lined with wood chips and dry leaves. The two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails. The estimated population of 3,500–15,000 birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation,</b> and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of China {{doubled in size}} during the 10th and 11th centuries. This growth {{was made possible by}} expanded <b>rice</b> <b>cultivation</b> in central and southern Song, the use of early-ripening rice from south-east and southern Asia, and the production of widespread food surpluses. The Northern Song census recorded a {{population of}} roughly 50 million, much like the Han and Tang dynasties. This data is found in the Standard Histories. However, it is estimated that the Northern Song had a population of some 100 million people, and 200 million {{by the time of the}} Ming dynasty. This dramatic increase of population fomented an economic revolution in pre-modern China. The expansion of the population, growth of cities, and the emergence of a national economy led to the gradual withdrawal of the central government from direct involvement in economic affairs. The lower gentry assumed a larger role in grassroots administration and local affairs. Appointed officials in county and provincial centers relied upon the scholarly gentry for their services, sponsorship, and local supervision.|$|E
