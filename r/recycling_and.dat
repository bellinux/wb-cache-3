5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on <b>recycling</b> <b>and</b> energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space for open pit garbage disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of garbage bags at traffic intersections and public areas. In some cities, stickers need to be purchased that allow for identification of disposable garbage.|$|E

5|$|As most Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents, {{they seek}} a living through ad-hoc various {{industries such as}} the construction, <b>recycling</b> <b>and</b> prostitution industries or as street pedlars.

5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal <b>recycling</b> <b>and</b> foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E

5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper <b>recycling</b> <b>and</b> emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E
5|$|President Dmitry Medvedev {{announced}} in May 2010 that the Russian government would strongly consider purchasing electricity generated from {{renewable energy sources}} {{in an attempt to}} encourage development of renewable energy. The government has plans for 4.5% of Russia's energy output to come from non-hydroelectric renewable energy sources. Additionally, in November 2010, the government approved a US$300billion program to make factories and buildings more energy efficient; it also announced plans to construct eight energy-efficient lamp production plants, promote <b>recycling</b> <b>and</b> support the construction of a hybrid car plant. Medvedev {{announced in}} late 2009 that he wanted to cut Russian energy consumption by 40% by 2020. At the moment, development is slowed by low investment, economic instability, low public demand and low tariffs on heat and electricity. Subsidies for natural gas are another obstacle to renewable energy development.|$|E

The city treats and distributes water and requires payment of a monthly solid waste fee for trash removal, <b>recycling,</b> <b>and</b> drop off for large items. Residents who recycle receive a credit. Hazardous waste is handled by Hennepin County drop off sites. After each significant snowfall, called a snow emergency, the Minneapolis Public Works Street Division plows over 1,000 miles (1,609km) of streets and 400 miles (643.7km) of alleys—counting both sides, the distance between Minneapolis and Seattle and back. Ordinances govern parking on the plowing routes during these emergencies as well as snow shoveling throughout the city.|$|E

5|$|France voiced {{concerns}} over the artificially low price of gold in 1968 and called for returns to the former gold standard. Meanwhile, excess dollars flowed into international markets as the United States expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the Vietnam War. Its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first current account deficit since the 19th century. In August 1971, President Richard Nixon suspended the exchange of U.S. dollars for gold {{as part of the}} Nixon Shock. The closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment burdens of a devalued dollar to other nations. Speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against the dollar. These influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks, which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies, largely ineffective capital controls, or floating exchange rates. Following these woes surrounding the U.S. dollar, the dollar price of gold was raised to $38 USD per ounce and the Bretton Woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of 2.25% as part of the Smithsonian Agreement signed by the G-10 members in December 1971. The agreement delayed the system's demise for a further two years. The system's erosion was expedited not only by the dollar devaluations that occurred, but also by the oil crises of the 1970s which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in petrodollar <b>recycling</b> <b>and</b> balance of payments financing. Once the world's reserve currency began to float, other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to describe the relationship between specific local government solid waste <b>and</b> <b>recycling</b> program attributes <b>and</b> recyclable material recovery. The characteristics of solid waste <b>and</b> <b>recycling</b> programs vary greatly across North Carolina, achieving variable levels of recyclable material recovery rates. Given that solid waste disposal is increasing at a significant rate in North Carolina and approximately 20 years of landfill space remain in the state’s landfills, solid waste directors <b>and</b> <b>recycling</b> coordinators face an enormous amount of pressure to divert as much materials as possible to recycling programs. Through a survey of North Carolina solid waste <b>and</b> <b>recycling</b> program managers, this study collected vital data regarding characteristics of waste <b>and</b> <b>recycling</b> collection programs including pickup frequencies, weekly waste <b>and</b> <b>recycling</b> collection capacities, <b>recycling</b> separation requirements, <b>and</b> other variables presumed to be related to recyclable material recovery rates. Using correlation analyses and significance tests, the study revealed which solid waste <b>and</b> <b>recycling</b> program characteristics are most closely related to recyclable materials recovery. The study showed the three variables most closely related to recyclable materials recovery are recycling pickup frequency, separation methods <b>and</b> provision of <b>recycling</b> equipment. Solid waste <b>and</b> <b>recycling</b> program managers interested in maximizing recyclable material recovery rates should evaluate these three program attributes first to determine if improvements could be made. Recycling pickup frequency should be maximized, separation methods should be minimized and local governments should increase convenience for residents to obtain recycling bins or carts...|$|R
