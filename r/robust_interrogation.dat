During this period Scholz came to public attention in connection with researches undertaken on the wartime career, as a German communist politician exiled in Sweden, of Herbert Wehner, known to a younger generation of West Germans as a high-profile senior SPD politician from the Willy Brandt era. According to {{the view of the}} matter presented by Der Spiegel, Stolz's researches disclosed that Wehner's break with Soviet sponsored communism had been a far more convoluted process than Wehner himself had publicly disclosed. [...] Despite his Communist past, when Wehner arrived in Sweden he was suspected of being a Gestapo agent, as a result of which he faced arrest and <b>robust</b> <b>interrogation</b> by the Swedes. Scholz nevertheless felt able to exonerate Wehner of the persistent charge that under interrogation he had implicated fellow communists, insisting that he only every told his Swedish interrogators what they already knew.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} compact and <b>robust</b> <b>interrogation</b> device for the read out of fiber Bragg grating sensors. The core system {{consists}} of a dielectric thin film filter with a lateral spectral transmission gradient and a photo diode array. This allows a high resolution detection of the Bragg wavelength shift {{by means of a}} centroid measurement. We first show the functionality of the system with a temperature measurement on a fiber Bragg grating. We achieved a temperature resolution of 0. 2 K and an accuracy of ± 2 K, which correspond to a spectral resolution of 1 pm and an accuracy of ± 11 pm. On the basis of these results, we developed a specially adapted high sensitivity electronics and a robust packaging for the applications on pipeline structures...|$|E

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) allows for in vivo exploration of large-scale brain networks with high spatial resolution. Its application in rodents affords researchers a powerful translational tool to directly assess/explore the effects of various pharmacological, lesion, and/or disease states on known neural circuits within highly controlled settings. Integration of animal and human research at the molecular-, systems-, and behavioral-levels using diverse neuroimaging techniques empowers more <b>robust</b> <b>interrogations</b> of abnormal/ pathological processes, critical for evolving our understanding of neuroscience. We present a comprehensive protocol to evaluate resting-state brain networks using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in rodent model. Specifically, we begin with a brief review of the physiological basis for rs-fMRI technique and overview of rs-fMRI studies in rodents to date, following which we provide a robust step-by-step approach for rs-fMRI investigation including data collection, computational preprocessing, and brain network analysis. Pipelines are interwoven with underlying theory behind each step and summarized methodological considerations, such as alternative methods available and current consensus in the literature for optimal results. The presented protocol is designed in such a way that investigators without previous knowledge in the field can implement the analysis and obtain viable results that reliably detect significant differences in functional connectivity between experimental groups. Our goal is to empower researchers to implement rs-fMRI in their respective fields by incorporating technical considerations to date into a workable methodological framework...|$|R
40|$|Little {{has been}} {{published}} about the ascending trajectory of lesbian characters in prime-time television texts. Rarer still are analyses of lesbian fictions on New Zealand television. This study offers a <b>robust</b> and critical <b>interrogation</b> of Sapphic expression found in the New Zealand television landscape. More specifically, this thesis analyses fictional lesbian representation found in New Zealand's prime-time, free-to-air television environment. It argues that television's script of lesbian desire is more about illusion than inclusion, and that lesbian representation is a misnomer, both qualitatively and quantitively. In order to assess the authenticity of television's lesbian fictions, I sampled the opinions of New Zealand's television audience through focus group and survey methodology, and analysed two primary sources of lesbian representation available between 2004 - 2006. Television and other media provide {{the social and cultural}} background - the milieu - against or within which their fictions, dramas and comedies are set. Even when media texts are clearly non- or anti realistic (fantasy films, for instance), they usually attempt to produce their narratives as consistent, familiar and in keeping with the cultural characteristics, values and proclivities of mainstream contemporary society. This is not realism so much as a set of arbitrary conventions that are read as, or stand for, reality and the real. In short, the media is a teller of stories and fairy tales; and since mainstream Western culture has naturalised homonormativity, television's fairy tales are almost exclusively tales of heterosexuality. Television, from this perspective, reinscribes and reinforces what Pierre Bourdieu refers to as the 'masculine order'. Television uses reality to frame messages of compulsory heterosexuality, and it rarely presents homonormative messages. Lesbian representation is, therefore, difficult for a heteronormative medium to render without effort. Homonormativity is, for lesbian audiences, a central part of the cultural background - the components of realism, if you like, within which representations of lesbians would 'play out' their stories in media texts. Television stories which ignore this imperative deny both the audience's ability to interpret for themselves the integrity of the representation, and their ability to acquire new knowledge of lesbians...|$|R
40|$|The Biologically Engineered Single Sludge Treatment (BESST) {{system is}} a small package {{wastewater}} treatment plant, {{which is designed to}} reduce influent concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen, biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids, to a standard fit for discharge into controlled waterways. This thesis examines the treatment performance of the BESST, while operating under steady state and disruptive conditions, and assesses the contribution of physicochemical and microbiological factors to treatment efficacy. The design of the BESST was based on principles of activated sludge processes, and comprised of an anoxic area, an aerobic area, and an upflow clarifier. In each area of the system, physico-chemical and microbiological profiles were distinct from the other areas. The influent delivered to the system was municipal sewage, delivered {{from the start of the}} wastewater treatment works within which the prototype BESST was located. The influent was generally high in concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand, and was highly variable in nature. At times, this was reflected in effluent quality, particularly when disruptive events were occurring, such as mechanical failure. However, good levels of reduction in concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen, biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids were observed throughout the treatment period, and the system demonstrated a good level of robustness with regard to mechanical failure and experimental changes to sewage control parameters. Transformations of nitrogen and phosphorus were performed by bacteria in the biomass of the system, and were analysed throughout the sampling period by qualitative, culture based and molecular microbiological methods. Culture based techniques were shown to be a valuable monitoring tool, but were not representative of the actual community in the BESST. Molecular methods provided a higher resolution of microbial populations present during treatment, but it was not possible to correlate data obtained from culture based methodology with that obtained using molecular techniques. Enhanced phosphorus removal trials were performed during the study period, in order to facilitate the production of an effluent very low in concentrations of total phosphorus. The trial suggested that enhanced removal of phosphorus was possible in the BESST, and found the most dominant morphotype accumulating polyphosphate, to be that of filamentous bacteria. The study produced a large and complex dataset, which presented difficulties in the analysis of interactions between variables. Suggestions are presented to overcome such difficulties. The BESST is presented in this study as a package wastewater system which is able to successfully perform biological nutrient removal in a <b>robust</b> manner, the <b>interrogation</b> of which has led to a greater contribution to knowledge of small wastewater treatment systems and the reactive nature of the chemical and biological processes occurring within them.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{challenges}} facing the South African National Department of Education in its commitment to provide equal educational opportunities for all. The Story of Nothemba {{is central to the}} theme of this paper. It describes the story of a South African girl born in eQebe, whose physical disability and systematic disregard for her constitutional rights dashed her life time dream and passion to become a lawyer in a democratic South Africa. The paper argues for a critical interrogation of the following dynamics that have the potential to complicate both the implementation and optimization of the Inclusive Education Policy: (i) Understanding the social stereotypes about disability, (ii) Teacher empowerment, (iii) Systemic imbalance between support and expectations, (iv) Adopting relevant curriculum policy and assessment strategies and practices, and (v) Utilizing the research logic to inform policy implementation. The paper further calls for a <b>robust</b> <b>interrogation</b> at conceptual level about ‘disability ’ to inform the current policies on education and training, teacher training and development, curriculum and assessment strategies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{article is}} a {{theoretical}} discussion that links Marcuse’s concept of one-dimensional society and the Great Refusal with critical race theory {{in order to achieve}} a more <b>robust</b> <b>interrogation</b> of whiteness. The author argues that {{in the context of the}} United States, the one-dimensionality that Marcuse condemns in One-Dimensional Man is best illuminated by the concept of whiteness, which posits that whiteness in the context of white supremacy is an ideological manifestation of capitalism in the United States. The author furthers that the values Marcuse wants to break with or refuse in An Essay on Liberation can be more concretely captured if it is made clear that the ideology of whiteness represents a key part of the normative order of advanced industrial society that must be ‘Refused’. The reproduction of whiteness in educational structures serves to oppress raced, gendered, and classed individuals and communities who deviate from the norms established by the ideology of whiteness. Thus, in the context of education, the author proposes that the crucial theoretical tools we have to challenge one-dimensional education and refuse whiteness are critical race theory and critical multicultural education...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} ways to be an {{intellectual}} friend and ally. In this response to Lee Monaghan 2 ̆ 7 s article I argue that while groups of scholars and activists may share broad social and political commitments, {{this does not mean that}} they should never challenge each others points of view. Sometimes friendship is deepened by a <b>robust</b> <b>interrogation</b> of unexplored areas of difference. In this case, our shared domain is the critical scholarship of body weight. However, one theme in my recent work has explored the mosaic of different writers whom I call ‘obesity sceptics’ and the radically different ways they arrive at similar conclusions about the ‘obesity epidemic’. In this article I offer both context for this work and an account of my interest in the idea of intellectual consistency. In particular, although Monaghan accuses me of abandoning any interest in intellectual rigour, he fails to see that intellectual rigour is precisely what I am most interested in. Above all, my point is that political solidarity and intellectual consistency are rarely easy bedfellows and that emphasising one inevitably threatens the other. This does not mean that solidarity is impossible, but rather that part of the scholar 2 ̆ 7 s role is to notice lazy solidarity where it occurs so that politics and scholarship might enrich, rather than simply pander to, each other...|$|E
40|$|Controversy lingers in {{academic}} circles surrounding the merit that diversity brings to an organisation s board directorate construct, particularly the influence {{it has on}} firm performance. Director fiduciary responsibilities prescribe the provision of direction and governance, representative of and accountable to, company shareholders and its stakeholders. The question then avails itself, if the extent of board diversity, in respect to human and social capital, facilitates enriched decision-making through varied experience and backgrounds to proficiently serve their constituency, and if positive, have organisations reaped the improved benefits owing to the positive effect expected of diversity through desegregation? This research report was conducted {{with the intention of}} understanding the effects of board composition diversity on company performance. The research commenced with a <b>robust</b> <b>interrogation</b> of literature exemplifying diversity, in particular, that of board diversity and its impact on company performance. A quantitative methodology was employed in the evaluation of company performance relative to the level of diversity of the board. The ratios, Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Tobin s q, were employed to assess both financial and market performance across 130 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, for the 2014 financial year. The attributes of diversity in this analysis embodied nationality, gender and race. The findings show that board diversity has an impact on company performance and that the full benefits thereof have not yet been realised. Diversity is an enabler of company performance yet the status quo of homogenous board directorates is evident in the minimal female representation on company s boards within South Africa, demonstrating the slow adoption of change. Quotas imposed upon companies impede the benefits of diversity as in certain instances, this is seen as window dressing and is not embraced in the spirit in which it was intended. This paper, however, does not paint a picture of doom and gloom but instead shows diversity as being positive and encourages the early adoption thereof, specifically within a South African context.
