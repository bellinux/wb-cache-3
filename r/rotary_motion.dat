40|$|AbstractThe {{smoothness}} {{tool path}} {{is essential in}} five-axis high speed machining. However, the smoothness of the tool orientation in the part coordinate system cannot assure the smooth <b>motions</b> of the <b>rotary</b> axes of a five-axis machine tool because the conversion of tool posture from the part coordinate system to the machine coordinate system is nonlinear. To generate a tool path with smooth <b>rotary</b> <b>motions</b> of the five-axis machine tool, the tool path in this paper is represented with three spline curves: the cutter location curve and the two trajectory curves of the rotary axes of the machine tool, so that the <b>rotary</b> axes’ <b>motions</b> can be simultaneously smoothed. For a flank milling tool path, the geometric deviations between the envelope surface of the tool movement and the design surface should be respected while smoothing the tool path. The point-to-surface distance is adopted to calculate the geometric deviations, and then a smoothness optimization model is developed to smooth the <b>rotary</b> axes’ <b>motions</b> using the weighted least squares method. A numerical example of five-axis flank milling of a S-shape surface is given to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach...|$|R

The first, referred to as the standardized technique, was developed by Ingle in 1961, and had disadvantages such as the potential for loss of working length and inadvertent ledging, zipping or perforation. Subsequent refinements have been numerous, and are usually described as techniques. These include the step-back, circumferential filing, incremental, anticurvature filing, step-down, double flare, crown-down-pressureless, balanced force, canal master, apical box, progressive enlargement, modified double flare, passive stepback, alternated <b>rotary</b> <b>motions,</b> and apical patency techniques.|$|R

25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} motor or piezo motor {{is a type}} {{of electric}} motor based upon the change in shape of a piezoelectric material when an electric field is applied. Piezoelectric motors make use of the converse piezoelectric effect whereby the material produces acoustic or ultrasonic vibrations in order to produce a linear or <b>rotary</b> <b>motion.</b> In one mechanism, the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series stretches and position holds, similar to the way a caterpillar moves.|$|E
25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative <b>rotary</b> <b>motion</b> between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative <b>rotary</b> <b>motion</b> can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|E

25|$|Two {{different}} classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations {{took place on}} the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that operated a crank and connecting rod to convert <b>rotary</b> <b>motion</b> to reciprocating.|$|E
25|$|The first Watt engines were {{atmospheric}} pressure engines, like the Newcomen engine {{but with the}} condensation taking place separate from the cylinder. Driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a partial vacuum {{raised the possibility of}} reciprocating engine development. An arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser. Consequently, the direction of the power stroke might be reversed, making it easier to obtain <b>rotary</b> <b>motion.</b> Additional benefits of the double acting engine were increased efficiency, higher speed (greater power) and more regular motion.|$|E

Freeing the productive potential of society from the limited capacity of hand, water and animal power, this was arguably the pivotal development of the entire industrial revolution, without which the spectacular increases in economic activity of the subsequent century would have been impossible.|$|E

Reindeer fawn and dog puppy skin parkas, with the fur inside, were made for babies (irniaq) and small children (mikelnguq). Puppies one and two months old were killed for the purpose. Fawn and puppy skins were turned inside out, scraped, hung out to dry, and then put away.

For a sealskin parka, one skin was required for a three-year-old, two for a five- or six-year-old, and three for a child of 10 or 12 years. A small child's sealskin parka was often decorated with tassels of the same material stitched to the upper center of the back. A baby's boots were always made with the fur inside but otherwise were similar in construction to adult boots. In former times, babies wore long boots and no pants. When a child was toilet trained, pants separate from boots were put on a boy, while girls were given trouser-boots like those worn by women.|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} of this movement is quite complicated. If one studies the anatomy and physiology of the subepicardial and subendocardial myofibres during both systole and diastole, it would be expected that images would show opposite rotations in the outer and inner sides of the myocardium. This could not be seen {{in any of the}} slices of any subjects. Instead, it seems like different <b>rotary</b> <b>motions</b> govern at different parts of the myocardium. The results in the midcavity slices form four corners, where opposing corners have movements with the same direction (see Figure 4, lines 1 and 2, column b). This pattern was similar in all normal left ventricles, hence it was assumed as the normal pattern in the horizontal motion. The results obtained show the expected opposite relationship between systole and diastole.|$|R

500|$|The {{design of}} these ships was very {{controversial}} {{while they were}} being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr, while Reed, describing {{a time when the}} ship's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: [...] "The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the Novgorod can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her <b>rotary</b> <b>motion</b> reversed." [...] It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: [...] "On a trial cruise, they (Novgorod and [...] ) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly round and round, every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo." [...] The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: In the final analysis, the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. Their faults – and they certainly had faults — were exaggerated by critics, both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men.|$|E

In 1782 the firm sought to modify Watt's {{invention}} so that the engine had a <b>rotary</b> <b>motion,</b> making it suitable {{for use in}} mills and factories. On a 1781 visit to Wales Boulton had seen a powerful copper-rolling mill driven by water, and when told it was often inoperable in the summer due to drought suggested that a steam engine would remedy that defect. [...] Boulton wrote to Watt urging the modification of the engine, warning that they were reaching {{the limits of the}} pumping engine market: [...] "There is no other Cornwall to be found, and the most likely line for increasing the consumption of our engines is the application of them to mills, which is certainly an extensive field." [...] Watt spent much of 1782 on the modification project, and though he was concerned that few orders would result, completed it {{at the end of the}} year. [...] One order was received in 1782, and several others from mills and breweries soon after. [...] George III toured the Whitbread brewery in London, and was impressed by the engine. [...] As a demonstration, Boulton used two engines to grind wheat at the rate of 150bushels per hour in his new Albion Mill in London. [...] While the mill was not financially successful, according to historian Jenny Uglow it served as a [...] "publicity stunt par excellence" [...] for the firm's latest innovation. [...] Before its 1791 destruction by fire, the mill's fame, according to early historian Samuel Smiles, [...] "spread far and wide", and orders for rotative engines poured in not only from Britain but from the United States and the West Indies.|$|E

Then by combining these two basic types of motions, planar locomotion {{of the system is}} constructed. Two typical planar trajectories of the system, that is, oblique lines and curve lines, are proposed and both approached with folding lines.

30|$|Aluminum {{metallization}} {{using the}} sprayed coating for exhaust mild steel (MS) pipes of tractors {{is a standard}} practice for avoiding rusting. Patches of thin metal coats are prone to rusting and are thus considered as defects in the surface coating. This paper reports a novel configuration of the fiber optic sensor for on-line checking the aluminum metallization uniformity and hence for defect detection. An optimally chosen high bright 440 nm BLUE LED (light-emitting diode) launches light into a transmitting fiber inclined at the angle of 60 ° to the surface under inspection placed adequately. The reflected light is transported by a receiving fiber to a blue enhanced photo detector. The metallization thickness on the coated surface results in visually observable variation in the gray shades.
