40|$|To assess {{modifications}} induced in starch granules {{during high}} temperature drying of corn grain and {{their effect on}} the nutritive value of corn-starch, physicochemical and structural characteristics <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules from corn grains dried at different temperatures have been determined. Additionally, their in vitro digestibility and fermentation patterns were investigated, using a two steps in vitro model of the pig digestive tract. High drying temperatures induced a partial gelatinization <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules and produced a very favorable substrate for porcine pancreatic amylase and led to an altered physical structure which affected the rate and extent <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules digestion by gastric and pancreatic enzymes. Starch micrographs showed that granules extracted from corn dried at 130 °C were less angular, bigger, and had smoother surface than granules extracted from corn dried at lower temperature. High-temperature drying increased the digestibility <b>of</b> wet-milled <b>starch</b> granules, while the <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> from corn dried at lower temperature produced higher volume of gas during their in vitro fermentation, despite their more pronounced crystalline characteristic. The residues from pepsin–pancreatic digestion of overall samples analyzed showed highly degraded and pitted granules or fragmented external shells, starch from corn dried at 130 °C being the most degraded. Aforementioned changes of nutritional attributes <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> granules are discussed according to the restructuration occurring within both their amorphous and crystalline phase, {{as well as to}} the changes of the granules size and purity.

40|$|The {{recently}} discovered potato tuber (Solanum tuberosum) {alpha}-glucan, water dikinase (GWD) (formerly known as R 1) catalyzes the phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> by a dikinase-type reaction mechanism {{in which the}} {beta}-phosphate of ATP is transferred to either the C- 6 or the C- 3 position <b>of</b> the glucosyl <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch.</b> In the present study, {{we found that the}} GWD enzyme is inactive in the oxidized form, which is accompanied by the formation of a specific intramolecular disulfide bond as determined by disulfide-linked peptide mapping. The regulatory properties of this disulfide linkage were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis studies. Both reduced thioredoxin (Trx) f and Trx m from spinach leaves reduced and activated oxidized GWD at very low concentrations, with Trx f being the more efficient, yielding an S 0. 5 value of 0. 4 µM. Interestingly, GWD displays a reversible and selective binding to starch granules depending on the illumination state of the plant. Here we show that starch granule-bound GWD isolated from dark-adapted plants exists in the inactive, oxidized form, which is capable of reactivation upon treatment with reduced Trx. Furthermore, the soluble form of GWD was found in its fully reduced state, providing evidence of a Trx-controlled regulation mechanism linking enzymatic activity and specific binding affinities of a protein to an intracellular surface. The regulatory site sequence, CFATC, of potato GWD is conserved in chloroplast-targeted GWDs from other species, suggesting an overall redox regulation of the GWD enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Potato fruit juice, a <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> industry, {{contains}} up to 2. 5 %[*][w/w] {{of proteins}} that are potentially valuable raw-materials of food, cosmetic, and pharma industries. The recovery of protein from the potato fruit juice {{is limited by}} the lack of industrially feasible concentration and separation technologies. The present research thus aimed at development of such process for the separation of active protease inhibitors from potato fruit juice. Methods. Low temperature mechanical vapor recompression evaporation was applied for concentration of potato fruit juice followed by ethanol precipitation for recovery of active proteins. The effects of precipitation temperature and precipitative agents were investigated employing response surface modeling methodology. Results. Concentration of potato fruit juice by evaporation was successful without loss of trypsin inhibition activity. Precipitation using 6. 5 [*]M ethanol at low temperature (0 –+ 4 °C) was found suitable for the recovery of active protease inhibitors from the concentrate. Piloting at starch industry yielded 50 % of total proteins, with a high quantity of active protease inhibitors and a minor inclusion of other proteins. Conclusion. Concentration by low-temperature evaporation, followed by ethanol precipitation of protease inhibitors at optimized temperature, is an attractive option for valorization of potato fruit juice...|$|R

40|$|The ability <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> {{to impart}} {{functions}} including fluid-loss control, cuttings transport, and rheological characteristics to water-based drilling fluids {{has led to}} its widespread use in the oil industry. The filter cake deposited by these drilling fluids often employs sized solid particles and starch to inhibit fluid loss into the formation. This inherently causes damage to the formation by impairing the permeability and must be removed before production. An alpha-amylase enzyme treatment was found to provide an effective approach to degrading starch in filter cake. In this work, an alpha-amylase enzyme treatment was analyzed by determining the extent <b>of</b> degradation <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> in filter cake using the iodine test, identifying degradants using high performance liquid chromatography, spectrophotometrically monitoring the concentration of enzyme, and measuring the cleanup efficiency of the enzyme treatment using a static filter press apparatus. The alpha-amylase enzyme {{used in this study}} was found to have a molecular weight under 30, 000. The activity of the alpha-amylase enzyme was found to be sensitive to pH and temperature. The alpha-amylase enzyme was found to denature at temperatures above 165 degrees F and reversibly deactivate at pH below 4. Optimal conditions for alpha-amylase activity were found to be 150 degrees F and pH 6. 5. The enzyme treatment works by hydrolyzing the interior glycosidic bonds of amylose and amylopectin <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> creating soluble poly- and oligosaccharides and glucose. The enzyme treatment did not dissolve the calcium carbonate sized solids and a 5 wt. % hydrochloric acid postflush was necessary. The cleanup efficiency of the enzyme at pH 6. 5 and room temperature treatment in conjunction with the postflush in a static test was 73 % at 10 % v/v concentration.

30|$|Starch {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} product of corn, tapioca, wheat and potatoes which are major crops. Other sources include sugar plants such as sugar beet, sugar cane or sugar sorghum. Sugar and starch processing industries also produce large amount <b>of</b> solid <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> containing wastewater. The high fiber content <b>of</b> the solid <b>residue</b> makes them a good source for paper and packaging industries. While the carbohydrates rich wastewater are a suitable substrate for production of microbial products. Biological wastes rich in starchy materials are suitable for biosurfactant production. These substrates have been feedstock for production of industrial enzymes and other related chemicals (Maneerat 2005 a, b). One such substrate is potato {{which is one of}} the important staple food and a lucrative cash crop in many countries. Processing of potatoes, results in starch rich waste water, potatoes peels, un- consumable potatoes, which are rich substrates for the microbes. It is estimated that only 59 % of the potato crop are processed into consumable products and most what remains represent a starchy rich wastes which can be difficult to dispose of. Conventional disposal methods include using as an irrigation source, as animal feed, or as a substrate for alcohol production (Fox and Bala 2000; Natu et al. 1991). (Fox and Bala 2000) attempted to produce biosurfactants utilizing potato associated waste. They evaluated potato substrate as a carbon source for biosurfactant production using B. subtilis ATCC 21332. They compared growth, surface activity and carbohydrate utilization of B. subtilis ATCC 21332 on an established potato medium, simulated liquid and solid potato waste media and a commercially prepared potato starch in a mineral salts medium. The results obtained indicated the utilization of potato substrate and production of surfactant as indicated by high surface tension reduction.|$|R

Small starch granules contain 25 % more ester-bound phosphate per glucose residue than large starch granules. The degree of phosphorylation {{was found to}} be almost constant during tuber development. Isolated tuber discs synthesize starch from externally supplied glucose at a significant rate. Tuber discs supplied with glucose and [32 P]orthophosphate incorporate radiolabeled phosphorus into the <b>starch.</b> The level <b>of</b> 32 P incorporation is proportional to the amount <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> synthesized.

The polysaccharide components <b>of</b> the insoluble <b>residue</b> were characterised by HPLC, GPC, and lambda(max) of the polyiodide complex. It was concluded that short chain-length (CL 16) material was from external chains of AP, intermediate material (modal CL 46) was from retrograded F.

The starch lysophospholipids were completely hydrolysed to free fatty acids which remained complexed with L. AM residues. This was shown by the C- 13 Cp/MAS-NMR spectrum which had a clear resonance at 31 ppm from mid-chain methylene carbons of fatty acids in complexes. The C- 1 signal of the L.

From the analysis of drying system, {{it was found that the}} moisture is removed from 40 to 10 % about 90 - 120 min at 50 - 60 oC using hot air dryer in drying <b>of</b> <b>starch.</b> Also found that the moisture is removed from 30 to 10 % about 60 min at 30 - 35 oC using hot air dryer and about 90 min at 30 - 35 oC using poly sheet dryer in drying of sago...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{study focused}} on the {{distribution}} and pasting properties <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) tuber. A fresh sweet potato tuber was cut into six equivalent parts. The extractable contents and pasting properties <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> {{from different parts of}} fresh sweet potato tuber were determined. The results showed that the extractable content <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> from the Middle section of sweet potato tuber is lower than that from the head and the end section of sweet potato tuber. The extractable content <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> from the inner-end part and the outer-Middle part of sweet potato tuber are 16. 2 % and 10. 3 % respectively. The amylose content <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> is relatively higher in the Middle section and outer layer of sweet potato tuber. The amylose content <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> from the outer-Middle part and the inner-end part of sweet potato tuber are 29. 5 % and 26. 7 % respectively. Pasting properties <b>of</b> <b>starches</b> from different parts of sweet potato tubers are different from each other. Among them, the starches from inner-end part of sweet potato tuber have the highest viscosities and a lower breakdown...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{processing}} and eating qualities of noodles are largely {{related to the}} quality and quantity of wheat protein (gluten), the importance <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> a major ingredient of wheat flour, is often overlooked. Recent developments on the multilevel structural model <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> have brought new insights into the role <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> for better processing and noodle eating qualities. With critical analysis and discussion, this review outlines the comprehensive relationships between the multilevel (molecular, crystalline, and granular) starch structure, noodle eating qualities, and related physicochemical properties. Further, the major and minor structural features <b>of</b> wheat <b>starch</b> and their contributions toward noodle quality are summarized and presented as a schematic diagram, which shows the effects <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> structure on cooked noodles. These features provide new insights for the scientific community, as well as industry, into the role <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> along with gluten, on the quality of noodles...|$|R
