50|$|Basic {{sediment}} {{and water}} (BS&W) is a technical specification of certain impurities in crude oil. When extracted from an oil reservoir, the crude oil will contain some {{amount of water}} and suspended solids from the reservoir formation. The particulate matter is known as sediment or mud. The water content can vary greatly from field to field, and may be present in large quantities for older fields, or if oil extraction is enhanced using water injection technology. The bulk {{of the water and}} sediment is usually separated at the field to minimize the quantity that needs to be transported further. The <b>residual</b> <b>content</b> of these unwanted impurities is measured as BS&W. Oil refineries may either buy crude to a certain BS&W specification or may alternatively have initial crude oil dehydration and desalting process units that reduce the BS&W to acceptable limits, or a combination thereof.|$|E

It can be inferred that low-speed stirring can improve heat transfer condition and liquids removal efficiency, but the changes of scraper rotary speed on TPH {{and moisture}} removal rate are not remarkable.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between process parameters (including cooking temperature, reaction time, H factor, initial alkali charge and sulfidity) and <b>residual</b> alkali <b>content</b> in black liquor during kraft pulping of eucalyptus were systematically studied in this study. Based on these relationships, an empirical model used to quantitatively predict <b>residual</b> alkali <b>content</b> in black liquor was developed. After comparing the model predictions and 26 independent experimental data, a good correlation (R- 2 = 0. 951) was obtained through least square fitting, indicating {{the validity and}} reliability of this empirical model for predicting <b>residual</b> alkali <b>content</b> in black liquor during kraft pulping of eucalyptus.

Detection of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) <b>residual</b> <b>content</b> in Fritillaria thunbergii Bulbus is important to evaluate the degree of sulfur fumigation and its harms. It helps to control the use of sulfur fumigation in Fritillaria thunbergii Bulbus. Near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) was explored as a rapid, non-destructive, and accurate technique to detect SO 2 residual contents in Fritillaria thunbergii Bulbus. An HSI system covering the spectral range of 874 – 1734 nm was used. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was applied to build calibration models for SO 2 <b>residual</b> <b>content</b> detection. Successive projections algorithm (SPA), weighted regression coefficients (Bw), random frog (RF), and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) were used to select optimal wavelengths.

40|$|It is {{well known}} {{residual}} gum exists in degummed or retted hemp fibres. Gum removal results in improvement in fibre fineness and {{the properties of the}} resultant hemp yarns. However, it is not known what correlation if any exists between the <b>residual</b> gum <b>content</b> in retted hemp fibres and the fibre fineness, described in terms of fibre width in this paper. This study examined the mean width and coefficient of variation (CV) of fibre width of seventeen chemically retted hemp samples with reference to <b>residual</b> gum <b>content.</b> The mean and CV of fibre width were obtained from an Optical fibre diameter analyser (OFDA 100). The linear regression analysis results show that the mean fibre width is directly proportional to the <b>residual</b> gum <b>content.</b> A slightly weaker linear correlation also exists between the coefficient of variation of fibre width and the <b>residual</b> gum <b>content.</b> The strong linear co-relation between the mean of fibre width and the <b>residual</b> gum <b>content</b> is a significant outcome, since testing for fibre width using the OFDA is a much simpler and quicker process than testing the <b>residual</b> gum <b>content.</b> Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) reinforces the OFDA findings.
