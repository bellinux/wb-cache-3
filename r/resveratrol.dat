5|$|A {{number of}} {{compounds}} can also bind to cCTnC with low affinity: EMD 57033, <b>resveratrol,</b> bepridil, and EGCG. All of these compounds are renowned for their promiscuity, and the biological {{significance of these}} interactions is unknown. In particular, it is unknown how interaction with cCTnC influences the calcium affinity of cNTnC.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and <b>resveratrol</b> are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of their activity often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as lead compounds in drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{large number}} of oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved {{structural}} motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan. Compounds such as <b>resveratrol</b> increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms.|$|E
25|$|The grapevine fungal {{pathogen}} Botrytis cinerea is able {{to oxidise}} <b>resveratrol</b> into metabolites showing attenuated antifungal activities. Those include the <b>resveratrol</b> dimers restrytisol A, B, and C, <b>resveratrol</b> trans-dehydrodimer, leachinol F, and pallidol. The soil bacterium Bacillus cereus {{can be used to}} transform <b>resveratrol</b> into piceid (<b>resveratrol</b> 3-O-beta-D-glucoside).|$|E
25|$|In rats, {{less than}} 5% {{of the oral}} dose was {{observed}} as free <b>resveratrol</b> in blood plasma. There is a hypothesis that <b>resveratrol</b> from wine could have higher bioavailability than <b>resveratrol</b> from a pill.|$|E
25|$|<b>Resveratrol</b> is {{produced}} in plants {{by the action of}} the enzyme, <b>resveratrol</b> synthase.|$|E
25|$|Wines, {{particularly}} red wines, are {{a source}} of low levels of <b>resveratrol.</b> High doses of <b>resveratrol</b> have been linked to longevity and cancer prevention in other species.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{administering}} <b>resveratrol</b> {{in humans}} may be buccal delivery, that is without swallowing, by direct absorption through tissues {{on the inside}} of the mouth. When one milligram of <b>resveratrol</b> in 50 ml 50% alcohol/ water solution was retained in the mouth for one minute before swallowing, 37nbsp&ng/ml of free <b>resveratrol</b> was measured in plasma two minutes later. This level of unchanged <b>resveratrol</b> in blood can only be achieved with 250nbsp&mg of <b>resveratrol</b> taken in a pill form. However, the viability of a buccal delivery method is called into question due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. For a drug to be absorbed transmucosally it must be in free-form or dissolved. <b>Resveratrol</b> fits the criteria for oral transmucosal dosing, except for this caveat. The low aqueous solubility greatly limits the amount that can be absorbed through the buccal mucosa. <b>Resveratrol</b> that is attempted to be taken buccally was expected to pass through the mucous membrane of the mouth and be absorbed as an oral dose, however, the need to explore buccal delivery in future pharmaceutical formulations was expressed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Resveratrol</b> {{is found}} in highest {{concentration}} in the skins of wine grapes. The accumulation in ripe berries of different concentrations of both bound and free resveratrols depends on the maturity level and is highly variable according to the genotype. Both red and white wine grape varieties contain <b>resveratrol,</b> but more frequent skin contact and maceration leads to red wines normally having ten times more <b>resveratrol</b> than white wines. <b>Resveratrol</b> produced by grape vines provides defense against microbes, and production can be further artificially stimulated by ultraviolet radiation. Grapevines in cool, damp regions with higher risk of grape diseases, such as Bordeaux and Burgundy, tend to produce grapes {{with higher levels of}} <b>resveratrol</b> than warmer, drier wine regions such as California and Australia. Different grape varieties tend to have differing levels, with Muscadines and the Pinot family having high levels while the Cabernet family has lower levels of <b>resveratrol.</b> In the late 20th century interest in the possible health benefits of <b>resveratrol</b> in wine was spurred by discussion of the French paradox involving the health of wine drinkers in France.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of benefit from <b>resveratrol</b> in those who already have heart disease. A 2014 Chinese meta-analysis found weak evidence that high-dose <b>resveratrol</b> supplementation could reduce systolic blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{in vitro}} and animal research, {{there is no}} evidence that <b>resveratrol</b> taken orally or topically has any effect on human skin. Preliminary studies have been conducted on <b>resveratrol</b> to understand its potential as a therapy for melanoma.|$|E
25|$|A preliminary, one-year {{clinical}} trial of subjects with Alzheimer's disease showed that consuming 2 grams of <b>resveratrol</b> daily was well-tolerated and reduced some disease biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, although other biomarkers and progressive dementia were unaffected. Other preliminary human studies indicated that short-term ingestion of <b>resveratrol</b> increased {{cerebral blood flow}} in normal subjects and in people with diabetes. <b>Resveratrol</b> is under study for its potential to limit secondary damage after ischemic stroke or acute brain trauma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Resveratrol</b> {{is found}} in widely varying amounts among grape varieties, {{primarily}} in their skins and seeds, which, in muscadine grapes, have about one hundred times higher concentration than pulp. Fresh grape skin contains about 50 to 100 micrograms of <b>resveratrol</b> per gram.|$|E
25|$|<b>Resveratrol</b> (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a stilbenoid, a {{derivative}} of stilbene.|$|E
25|$|The free-radical {{theory of}} aging {{suggests}} that antioxidant supplements might extend human life. However, evidence suggest that β-carotene supplements and {{high doses of}} vitaminE increase mortality rates. <b>Resveratrol</b> is a sirtuin stimulant that {{has been shown to}} extend life in animal models, but the effect of <b>resveratrol</b> on lifespan in humans is unclear as of 2011.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{conclusive}} {{human evidence}} for {{an effect of}} <b>resveratrol</b> on metabolism.|$|E
25|$|While 70% of orally {{administered}} <b>resveratrol</b> is absorbed, its oral bioavailability {{is approximately}} 0.5% due to extensive hepatic glucuronidation and sulfation. <b>Resveratrol</b> given in a proprietary formulation SRT-501 (3 or 5 g), developed by Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, reached {{five to eight}} times higher blood levels. These levels did approach the concentration necessary to exert the effects shown in animal models and in vitro experiments.|$|E
25|$|Supplements vary in {{purity and}} can contain {{anywhere}} from 50 percent to 99 percent <b>resveratrol.</b>|$|E
25|$|In cells {{treated with}} <b>resveratrol,</b> an {{increase}} is {{observed in the}} action of MnSOD (SOD2) and in GPER activity.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{systematic}} review of existing <b>resveratrol</b> research demonstrated {{there was not}} enough evidence to demonstrate its effect on longevity or human diseases, nor could there be recommendations for intake beyond the amount normally obtained through dietary sources, estimated as being less than 4 mg/day. Much of the research showing positive effects has been done on animals, with insufficient clinical research on humans. <b>Resveratrol</b> research in animals and humans remains active.|$|E
25|$|Although {{research}} {{continues on}} <b>resveratrol,</b> the concentration in wine seems {{too low to}} account for the French paradox.|$|E
25|$|Tests on mice {{demonstrate}} {{conclusive proof}} that <b>resveratrol,</b> a compound found in red wine, improves health and longevity.|$|E
25|$|Mulberries (especially the skin) are {{a source}} of as much as 50 micrograms of <b>resveratrol</b> per gram dry weight.|$|E
25|$|<b>Resveratrol</b> gets {{extensively}} metabolized in the body, {{with the}} liver and lungs as the major sites of its metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Although {{in vitro}} studies {{indicate}} <b>resveratrol</b> activates sirtuin 1 and PGC-1α, and affects functioning of mitochondria, other research disputes this effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{levels of}} <b>resveratrol</b> found in food varies considerably, {{even in the}} same food from season to season and batch to batch.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is used}} as a dietary supplement, {{there is}} no good {{evidence}} that consuming <b>resveratrol</b> affects life expectancy or human health.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen sulfide {{may have}} anti-aging {{properties}} by blocking destructive chemicals within the cell, bearing similar properties to <b>resveratrol,</b> an antioxidant found in red wine.|$|E
25|$|In a human study {{involving}} {{oral administration}} of 500mg over 13 weeks, <b>resveratrol</b> was detected in cerebrospinal fluid, indicating {{that it had}} crossed the blood-brain barrier.|$|E
25|$|<b>Resveratrol</b> is a phytoalexin, a {{class of}} {{compounds}} produced by many plants when they are infected by pathogens or physically harmed by cutting, crushing, or ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline {{suspended}} a small {{clinical trial}} of SRT501, a proprietary form of <b>resveratrol,</b> due to safety concerns, and terminated the study later that year. SRT501 {{was composed of}} microparticles (< 5 µm) intended to enhance absorption and was delivered at a dose 5 grams per day, causing gastrointestinal disorders and diarrhea in many subjects. Although limited human studies have shown <b>resveratrol</b> is well-tolerated, one clinical study of Alzheimer's disease patients showed there were side effects from daily intake of up to 2 grams, including nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{other small}} {{molecules}} {{are known to}} bind in the thyroxine binding sites, including many natural products (such as <b>resveratrol),</b> drugs (Tafamidis, or Vyndaqel, diflunisal, flufenamic acid), and toxicants (PCB).|$|E
25|$|Red wine {{may offer}} health {{benefits}} {{more so than}} white because potentially beneficial compounds are present in grape skin, and only red wine is fermented with skins. The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its <b>resveratrol</b> content. Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8mg/L, depending on the grape variety, because it is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to absorb the <b>resveratrol.</b> By contrast, a white wine contains lower phenolic contents because it is fermented after removal of skins.|$|E
25|$|Plants that {{synthesize}} <b>resveratrol</b> include knotweeds, {{pine trees}} including Scots pine and Eastern white pine, grape vines, peanut plants, cocoa bushes, and Vaccinium shrubs that produce berries, including blueberries, raspberries, mulberries, cranberries, and bilberries.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{produced}} from muscadine grapes may contain more than 40mg/L, an exceptional phenolic content. In muscadine skins, ellagic acid, myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and trans-resveratrol are major phenolics. Contrary to previous results, ellagic acid and not <b>resveratrol</b> {{is the major}} phenolic in muscadine grapes.|$|E
25|$|The website also criticizes some practices, such as caloric {{restriction}} and the Dean Ornish program, {{because they are}} considered to be too difficult for many people to follow, not because they are ineffective; It also argues against <b>resveratrol,</b> which it deems to have inadequate research backing.|$|E
