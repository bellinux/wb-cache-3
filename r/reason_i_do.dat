500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> what I do, I felt I had come to a point where I could stop searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E
2500|$|Although Hitchens {{thought he}} was the only witness called by the Vatican, Aroup Chatterjee (author of Mother Teresa: The Untold Story) was also called to present {{evidence}} opposing Teresa's beatification and canonisation; the Vatican had abolished the traditional [...] "devil's advocate", which served a similar purpose. Hitchens said that [...] "her intention was not to help people", and she lied to donors about how their contributions were used. [...] "It was by talking to her that I discovered, and she assured me, that she wasn't working to alleviate poverty", he said, [...] "She was working to expand the number of Catholics. She said, 'I'm not a social worker. I don't do it for this <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it for Christ. I do it for the church.|$|E

[...] "I am {{leaving for}} that very <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{conceive}} that in fairness to myself I should continue to waste my time in work which can bring forth no fruit. I trust, Miss Merton, that you agree with me." ...|$|E

6000|$|This {{beautiful}} avenue--by far {{the best}} thing which civilization has done for the island--is called by foreigners [...] "the Broom Road," [...] though for what <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know. Originally planned {{for the convenience of}} the missionaries journeying from one station to another, it almost completely encompasses the larger peninsula; skirting for a distance of at least sixty miles along the low, fertile lands bordering the sea. But on the side next Taiarboo, or the lesser peninsula, it sweeps through a narrow, secluded valley, and thus crosses the island in that direction.|$|E

And {{that is the reason}} I never permit strangers to come here, under penalty of death. So long as no one knows the King of Spor is a monster people will not gossip about my looks, and I am very {{sensitive}} regarding my personal appearance. You will perhaps understand that if I could have chosen I should have been born beautiful instead of ugly." ...|$|E
60|$|Westward {{from the}} lake {{stretched}} the grass-lands, and here were multitudes of bison and wild cattle. Also were there many packs of wild dogs, and as there were no trees {{it was not a}} safe place for us. We followed north along the stream for days. Then, and for what <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, we abruptly left the stream and swung to the east, and then to the southeast, through a great forest. I shall not bore you with our journey. I but indicate it to show how we finally arrived at the Fire People's country.|$|E

5000|$|On 17 May 2011, it was {{announced}} by Halifax Town that they had signed McManus from FC United. McManus said: [...] "I'm sorry I had to leave - the only <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so were for {{a greater degree of}} financial security so I can support my daughter, and to help progress my football career at a higher level." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's one <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it," [...] said I. [...] "I didn't want {{to fight}} him as I should have fought a fellow of my own size. I wanted to punish him.

6000|$|... "By no means," [...] said Mr Crimble helplessly. [...] "But there," [...] and {{he brushed}} his knees with his handkerchief, [...] "I fear {{you are too}} much of a reader for me, and--and critic.

60|$|Of {{individual}} objects, perhaps {{nothing is}} more certain to create astonishment than the first sight in his native haunt of a barbarian,--of man in his lowest and most savage state. One's mind hurries back over past centuries, and then asks, Could our progenitors have been men like these?--men, whose very signs and expressions are less intelligible to us {{than those of the}} domesticated animals; men, who do not possess the instinct of those animals, nor yet appear to boast of human reason, or at least of arts consequent on that <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe it is possible to describe or paint the difference between savage and civilised man. It is the difference between a wild and tame animal: and part of the interest in beholding a savage is the same which would lead every one to desire to see the lion in his desert, the tiger tearing his prey in the jungle, or the rhinoceros wandering over the wild plains of Africa.|$|E
6000|$|Having read it I {{examined}} the dress. It {{was of a}} sort that I had never seen before, though experts to whom I have shown it {{say that it is}} certainly South American of a very early date, and like the ornaments, probably pre-Inca Peruvian. It is full of rich colours such as I have seen in old Indian shawls which give a general effect of crimson. This crimson robe clearly was worn over a skirt of linen that had a purple border. In the box that I have spoken of were the ornaments, all of plain dull gold: a waist-band; a circlet of gold for the head from which rose the crescent of the young moon and a necklace of emeralds, uncut stones now much flawed, for what <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, but polished and set rather roughly in red gold. Also there were two rings. Round one of these a bit of paper was wrapped upon which was written, in another hand, probably that of the father of the writer of the memorandum:-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Not for a while. My {{first and}} {{foremost}} love has been this band and always has been. The only <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> those two records is because we weren’t working as a band. But {{being a part of}} this band is a full time job. Some guys can do multiple things and maybe when I was younger <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> that, but not now.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what brings}} you down here?" [...] she asked, with the same searching look. [...] "You don't come down into this hole without some good <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> think at first that you might come down {{in order to see}} me, but you soon showed me that it wasn't that. There was a time when you was fond of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Ralph," [...] persisted his sister, [...] "I don't {{want to ask}} her to {{stop her}} cooking and go out and get wood. It does not look like good management, for one thing, and for other <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to do it. Don't you think you could bring her some wood? Just a little basketful of short sticks will do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Señor," [...] {{he said to}} Peter, [...] "you are a {{very brave}} man, and have done a deed such as none of us have seen before; therefore, I wish to spare you if I may. Also, I have worked you bitter wrong, driven to it by the might of love and jealousy, for which reason also I wish to spare you. To set upon you now would be but murder, and, {{whatever}} else I do, I will not murder. First, let me ease your mind. Your lady and mine is aboard here; but fear not, she has come and will come to no harm from me, or from any man while I live. If for no other <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not desire to affront one who, I hope, will be my wife by her own free will, and whom I have brought to Spain that she might not make this impossible by becoming yours. Señor, believe me, I would no more force a woman's will than I would do murder on her lover." ...|$|E
60|$|You have generously {{tendered}} me the support--the united support--of {{the great}} Empire State. For this, {{in behalf of}} the nation--in behalf of {{the present and future}} of the nation--in behalf of civil and religious liberty for all time to come, most gratefully do I thank you. I do not propose to enter into an explanation of any particular line of policy, as to our present difficulties, to be adopted by the incoming administration. I deem it just to you, to myself, to all, that I should see everything, that I should hear everything, that I should have every light that can be brought within my reach, in order that, when I do so speak, I shall have enjoyed every opportunity to take correct and true ground; and for this <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not propose to speak {{at this time of the}} policy of the Government. But when the time comes, I shall speak, as well as I am able, for the good of the present and future of this country for the good both of the North and of the South--for the good of the one and the other, and of all sections of the country. In the meantime, if we have patience, if we restrain ourselves, if we allow ourselves not to run off in a passion, I still have confidence that the Almighty, the Maker of the universe, will, through the instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, bring us through this as He has through all the other difficulties of our country. Relying on this, I again thank you for this generous reception.|$|E
6000|$|His father, who was {{sometimes}} exacting, complained of concealment. Mr. Gladstone {{replied that he}} regarded the question as one of difficulty, and he therefore took {{as much time as}} he possibly could for reflection upon it, though he never intended to run it as close as it actually came. 'I know,' he says, in a notable sentence, 'it seems strange to you that I should find it necessary to hold my judgment in suspense on a question which seemed to many so plain; but suspense is of constant occurrence in public life upon very many kinds of questions, and without it errors and inconsistencies would be much more frequent than even they are now.' This did not satisfy his father. 'I shall certainly read your speech to find some fair apology for your vote: good and satisfactory <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not expect. I cannot doubt you thought you withheld your opinions from me under the undecided state you were in, without any intention whatever to annoy me. There is, however, a natural closeness in your disposition, with a reserve towards those who may think they may have some claim to your confidence, probably increased by official habits, which it may perhaps in some cases be worth your inquiring into.' The sentence above about suspense is a key to many misunderstandings of Mr. Gladstone's character. His stouthearted friend Thomas Acland had warned him, {{for the sake of his}} personal influence, to be sure to deal with the Jew question on broad grounds, without refining, and without dragging out some recondite view not seen by common men, 'in short, to be as little as possible like Maurice, and more like the Duke of Wellington.' 'My speech,' Mr. Gladstone answered, 'was most unsatisfactory in many ways, but I do not believe that it mystified or puzzled anybody.' ...|$|E

"'I do not think, Mr. Foley, that I {{have any}} longer {{a claim to}} your friendship, since Mr. Barting appears to have {{withdrawn}} his own from me--for what <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> protest <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know.
