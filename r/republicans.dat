5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional <b>Republicans</b> expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} <b>Republicans.</b> This was not enough to give <b>Republicans</b> a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E

5|$|<b>Republicans</b> in Congress {{claimed a}} mandate for abolition, having gained in the {{elections}} for Senate and House. The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative George H.

In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some <b>Republicans</b> explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.|$|E
5|$|The {{organizational}} {{structure of the}} College <b>Republicans</b> has changed significantly {{since its founding in}} 1892.

5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the <b>Republicans</b> {{did in the}} face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{called a}} special session in March 1897 to resume the balloting for senator. He {{appointed}} Andrew T. Wood to fill the vacancy in case the legislators did not elect a senator {{in time for the}} congressional session to begin. The <b>Republicans</b> continued supporting Hunter, Free Silver Democrats still backed Blackburn, and Gold Democrats nominated businessman Henry L. Martin of Woodford County. When continued deadlock between Hunter and Blackburn ensued, Hunter withdrew his name from consideration. <b>Republicans</b> nominated St. John Boyle, but the gridlock continued unabated. After several ballots, Boyle also withdrew, and <b>Republicans</b> put forth lawyer and State senator William Joseph Deboe in his place. Deboe was elected on the 112th ballot, becoming the first Republican senator from the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{was inaugurated}} December 10, 1895. During his term, <b>Republicans</b> {{controlled}} the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate. This led to infighting {{between the two}} houses of the General Assembly and between the General Assembly and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported the Democrats and another who supported the <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the Democrats' {{advantage}} in the Senate, conservative Democrats united with the Republican minority to oppose much of Truman's agenda, most notably, civil rights legislation. In March 1949, Democratic floor leader Scott W. Lucas introduced an amendment to Senate Rule XXII to make cloture easier to achieve; hoping to end a ten-day filibuster against a civil rights bill. Conservative <b>Republicans</b> and Southern Democrats opposed the rule change and tried to obstruct it. Lucas asked for a cloture vote on the rule change, but opponents contended that the motion was out of order. Barkley studied the original debate on Rule XXII, which governed both cloture motions, before ruling in Lucas' favor. Georgia Senator Richard Russell, Jr. appealed Barkley's decision, and the chamber voted 46–41 to overrule. Sixteen <b>Republicans,</b> mostly from Northeast and West Coast states, voted to sustain the ruling; most Southern Democrats voted with the remaining <b>Republicans</b> to overrule it.|$|E

5|$|Douglas {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1858, and Lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful Illinois Democrat. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican Senator, many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party. Some eastern <b>Republicans</b> favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led {{the opposition to the}} Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. But many Illinois <b>Republicans</b> resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois <b>Republicans</b> held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the party's Senate nomination with little opposition.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011-2015 term, the State Senate {{was made}} up of 35 Democrats and 12 <b>Republicans.</b> <b>Republicans</b> gained two seats (District 6 in Baltimore County and District 29 in Calvert and St. Mary's counties) in the {{elections}} held on November 4, 2014. Democrats maintain a super-majority in the chamber despite these changes. Article II, Section 17(a) of the Maryland Constitution specifies it takes a three-fifths vote of both chambers to override a veto, which is 29 votes in the State Senate. The rules of the Senate also permit members to limit debate by a three-fifths majority vote, meaning <b>Republicans</b> would need to gain five additional seats, for a total of 19, in order to sustain a veto or filibuster legislation.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the <b>Republicans</b> {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 <b>Republicans</b> elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the <b>Republicans</b> lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E

5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical <b>Republicans</b> of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative <b>Republicans</b> who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, <b>Republicans</b> in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. <b>Republicans</b> hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
