40|$|Nd-Fe-B {{permanent}} magnets have been coated with 0. 6 wt. % dysprosium and annealed at various temperatures {{to study the}} impact of the temperature-dependent Dy diffusion processes on both the magnetic properties and the microstructure. When optimum annealing conditions are applied the Dy processed magnets with initial coercivity of similar to 1100 kA m(- 1) yield coercivity increases which can exceed 400 kA m(- 1) without a significant reduction of the <b>remanent</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>polarization.</b> The improved stability against opposing magnetic fields can be observed up to a depth of similar to 3 mm along the diffusion direction, restricting the application of the Dy diffusion process to either thin magnets or magnets with tailored coercivity gradients. While in the proximity of the Dy-coated surface, each grain has a Dy-enriched shell with a Dy content of similar to 6 at. %; the Dy concentration decreases exponentially to similar to 1. 8 at. % after a diffusion depth of 400 mu m and to similar to 1 at. % after a diffusion depth of 1500 mu m, as was found with wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. In the vicinity of the Dy-coated surface, the mechanism of the Dy-shell formation is attributed to the melting/solidification of a heavy-rare-earth-rich intermediate phase during high-temperature annealing. This is based on the observation that a constant Dy concentration over the width of the shells was found. Also an epitaxial relation between the Dy-poor core and the Dy-rich shell was observed by electron backscattered diffraction, which is supported by results obtained with Kerr microscopy...|$|E

In this paper, how structure-sensitive {{parameters}} {{derived from}} the hysteresis loop, like coercive field, remanent induction, and hysteresis losses, {{can be used to}} characterise recovery and recrystallization in cold rolled Ti-Nb stabilised interstitial free ultra low carbon steel is shown. The effect on hysteresis measurements of isothermal annealing treatments applied to industrially cold rolled samples at different temperatures is related to the microstructural changes which take place during the annealing {{as a consequence of the}} metallurgical recovery and recrystallization processes. It has been observed that the <b>remanent</b> <b>magnetic</b> field, the coercive field and the hysteresis losses can be used to monitor recovery. Furthermore, recrystallization can be characterised by coercive field and hysteresis loss measurements. Additionally, the effect on magnetic parameters of hardness indentations made after the annealing is studied.

40|$|As {{the solar}} wind is {{incident}} upon the lunar surface, it will occasionally encounter lunar crustal <b>remanent</b> <b>magnetic</b> fields. These magnetic fields are small-scale, highly non-dipolar, have strengths up to hundreds of nanotesla, and typically interact with {{the solar wind}} in a kinetic fashion. Simulations, theoretical analyses, and spacecraft observations have shown that crustal fields can reflect solar wind protons via a combination of magnetic and electrostatic reflection; however, analyses of surface properties have suggested that protons may still access the lunar surface in the cusp regions of crustal magnetic fields. In this first report from a planned series of studies, we use a 1 1 / 2 -dimensional, electrostatic particle-in-cell code to model the self-consistent interaction between the solar wind, the cusp regions of lunar crustal <b>remanent</b> <b>magnetic</b> fields, and the lunar surface.

40|$|A strong {{influence}} of external magnetic fields on the relaxation time constant T 1 of glass cells serving as 3 He neutron spin filters, observed for different glass types in alkali metal coated cells, was initially {{associated with the}} presence {{of a large number of}} ferromagnetic clusters on the glass surface. Later experiments showed the presence of the so called T 1 hysteresis phenomenon with a similar distinctiveness also in uncoated cells made of pure synthetic quartz glass.
