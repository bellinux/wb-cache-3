50|$|Conventional {{rating systems}} are {{primarily}} based on past realized losses {{and the past}} record of other drivers with similar characteristics. More recently, electronic systems have been introduced whereby the actual driving performance of a given driver is monitored and communicated directly to the insurance company. The insurance company then assigns the driver to a <b>risk</b> <b>class</b> based on the monitored driving behavior. An individual, therefore, can be put into different risk classes from month to month depending upon how they drive. For example, a driver who drives long distance at high speed in one month might be placed into a high <b>risk</b> <b>class</b> for that month and pay a large premium. If the same driver drives for short distances at low speed the next month, however, then {{he or she might}} be placed into a lower <b>risk</b> <b>class</b> and charged a lower premium.|$|E

40|$|Practice {{guidelines}} recommend outpatient {{care for}} selected patients with non-massive pulmonary embolism (PE), but fail to specify how these low-risk {{patients should be}} identified. Using data from U. S. patients, we previously derived the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), a prediction rule that risk stratifies patients with PE. We sought to validate the PESI in a European patient cohort. We prospectively validated the PESI in patients with PE diagnosed at six emergency departments in three European countries. We used baseline data for the rule 2 ̆ 7 s 11 prognostic variables to stratify patients into five <b>risk</b> <b>classes</b> (I-V) of increasing probability of mortality. The outcome was overall mortality at 90 days after presentation.

50|$|The {{concept of}} risk-based {{maintenance}} is an advanced form of Reliability centered maintenance. In case of chemical industries, apart from probability of failure, consequences of failure {{is also very}} important.

Risk-based maintenance methodology acts as a tool for maintenance planning and decision making to reduce the probability of failure and its consequences. In risk-based maintenance decision making, the maintenance resources can be utilized optimally based on the <b>risk</b> <b>class</b> (high, medium, or low) of equipment or machines, to achieve tolerable risk criteria.|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} evidence of adverse selection in insurance markets is mixed. The problem {{in assessing the}} extent of adverse selection is that private infor-mation, on which agents act, is generally unobservable to the researcher, which makes it di ¢ cult to distinguish between adverse selection and moral hazard. Unique micro data, from a dental insurance natural experiment, is here used to provide a direct test of selection. All agents in a population were strati 8 ̆ 5 ed into di¤erent <b>risk</b> <b>classes,</b> and were unexpectedly {{given the opportunity to}} insure their dental care costs. The setup of the insurance makes it possible to observe a proxy for private information. Interestingly, results di¤er across <b>risk</b> <b>classes.</b> Within high-risk classes, there is evidence of adverse selection and within low-risk classes, the results, surprisingly, indicate an advantageous selection. This dual selection can explain the limited {{empirical evidence}} for adverse selection in insurance markets in the literature: the two e¤ects may balance out on the aggregate level. The paper also presents a model of insurance choice that can harbor both adverse and advantageous selection. The pattern in the data is ex-plained by di¤erences in the e¤ectiveness of prevention across high and low <b>risk</b> <b>classes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|DecisionDx-UM is a {{prognostic}} {{test that}} accurately determines the metastatic {{risk associated with}} ocular melanoma tumors of the eye. Ocular melanoma is a term commonly used to describe tumors of the uveal tract such as uveal melanoma, choroidal melanoma, ciliary body melanoma, and iris melanoma. The DecisionDx-UM test was clinically validated on these tumors of the uveal tract. DecisionDx-UM assesses the gene expression profile (GEP) of a subset of genes which are differentially expressed in primary tumor cells compared to cells that have undergone transformation to a metastatic phenotype. The test classifies tumors as Class 1A (low metastatic <b>risk),</b> <b>Class</b> 1B (long-term metastatic risk), or Class 2 (immediate, high metastatic risk). [...] Also {{referred to as the}} gene expression profile, the test has been directly compared to all other clinical and pathologic factors, such as chromosome 3 status (monosomy 3), cytopathology and tumor size and the DecisionDx-UM test was shown to be more accurate than these other factors. [...] The DecisionDx-UM test has become standard of care in the majority of ocular oncology centers in the U.S. and is recommended by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The AJCC recommends this testing for all patients with a diagnosis of uveal melanoma as the results are ‘clinically significant’. Accurate results are achieved using both fine needle aspirate biopsies (FNAB) or formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. The prognostic information provided by DecisionDx-UM helps physicians and their patients make individualized decisions about the surveillance and therapeutic options that are most appropriate. The DecisionDx-UM test was exclusively licensed from Washington University in St. Louis and is only available through Castle Biosciences, Incorporated.|$|E

30|$|Several {{limitations}} of this study have to be addressed. No data on the functional status categories assessed by the Lee mortality index was available. Although the incidence of these functional impairments may be expected to be low in this patient population, it is not entirely clear in which degree these parameters would influence the results by inflating the higher <b>risk</b> <b>classes.</b> Including this information would likely increase the difference between the predicted and observed mortality figures (Table  2). Using the preoperative cardiopulmonary risk assessment as a data source might capture minor health impairments that would be missed in a questionnaire study and might dilute the <b>risk</b> <b>classes</b> of the Lee mortality index. Because of the higher contribution of bladder cancer to overall mortality (Figure  1) the comparison of the competing mortality rates with the overall mortality rates predicted by the Lee mortality index (Table  2) should be interpreted with some caution.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{prognostic}} {{value of}} procalcitonin levels to predict mortality and other adverse events in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains undefined. Methods: We assessed {{the performance of}} procalcitonin overall, stratified into four predefined procalcitonin tiers ( 0. 5 μg/L) and stratified by pneumonia-severity-index (PSI) and CURB 65 <b>risk</b> <b>classes</b> to predict all-cause mortality and adverse events within 30 days follow-up in 925 CAP patients. Results: In receiver-operating-curves (ROC), initial procalcitonin levels performed only moderately for mortality prediction (area-under-the-curve (AUC) 0. 60) and did not improve clinical risk scores. Follow-up measurements on days three, five and seven showed better prognostic performance (AUCs 0. 61, 0. 68 and 0. 73). For prediction of adverse events, the AUC was 0. 66 and PCT significantly improved the PSI (from 0. 67 to 0. 71) and the CURB 65 (from 0. 64 to 0. 70).
