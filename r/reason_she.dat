5|$|Hugh married Margaret, one of {{the daughters}} and heiresses of William de Chesney, the founder of Sibton Abbey. Margaret {{was one of three}} daughters, but she {{inherited}} the bulk of her father's estates. Although Margaret was the eldest daughter, the <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> received the bulk of the estates was King Henry's desire to reward Hugh, as the king arranged the marriage as well as ensuring that most of her father's lands went to her. Through Margaret, Hugh gained the barony of Blythburgh in Suffolk, which he had control of by 1174. He also acquired lands at Rottingdean in Sussex from Margaret.|$|E

5|$|Because of the tour's cancellation, various {{media outlets}} {{circulated}} speculation that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned her {{plans for a}} tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Carey did not address those rumours until two years later on October 28, 2010, which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period in late 2008, and suffered a miscarriage. For that <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later. Carey later opted to record a new album, that would be released {{during the summer of}} 2009. During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album.|$|E
5|$|Cid {{informs the}} group, {{when they reach}} Lindblum, that Kuja is Brahne's arms dealer.

There they meet Eiko, discover a village of black mages, and find the Iifa Tree, which produces a fighting-stimulant called Mist. They learn that Kuja uses Mist to create the Black Mages, and Vivi was a prototype. After stopping the Mist creation, the group meets Amarant, hired by Brahne to capture Garnet, who joins them instead. They also learn that Garnet is originally from the same destroyed village as Eiko, and has the power to summon eidolons, which was the <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> was adopted by Brahne. Brahne and Kuja then reach the Iifa Tree, but Brahne attempts to kill him with an eidolon; Kuja instead takes control over it and destroys her and her army instead.|$|E

5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{competed in}} road races and time trials, and {{off-road}} in cross country, in several world championships. She was not {{selected for the}} New Zealand road cycling team for the 1992 Olympics. She believed that omitting her was a mistake and intended to prove it by doing well at that year's Tour de France Féminin. She placed sixth in that race and demonstrated her good form. In 1992, she entered the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in the veteran category and won bronze in both the cross country and the downhill events. When it was announced in 1994 that mountain biking was to become an Olympic discipline, Lynch's focus turned to being picked for the New Zealand team. For that <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> swapped from the veteran class to elite at the world championships. She became New Zealand's first representative in an Olympic mountain biking event at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Aged 39, she was the oldest competitor in the event, but managed to achieve eighth place, leaving two previous world champions behind her. She retired from serious competition after the Olympics, {{with the exception of}} the first UCI World Cup in April 1997 that was held in New Zealand. Until her mid-40s, she competed at the top level in adventure racing. During her domestic career, Lynch won many national titles, and was a serial winner at premium events such as the Karapoti Classic and the Coast to Coast.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October, {{selections}} began {{for women}} to be relocated to Bergen-Belsen. More than 8,000 women, including Anne and Margot Frank, and Auguste van Pels, were transported. Edith Frank was left behind and died from starvation. Tents were erected at Bergen-Belsen to accommodate the influx of prisoners, and as the population rose, the death toll due to disease increased rapidly. Frank was briefly reunited with two friends, Hanneli Goslar and Nanette Blitz, who were confined in another section of the camp. Goslar and Blitz survived the war, and discussed the brief conversations they had conducted with Frank through a fence. Blitz described Anne as bald, emaciated, and shivering. Goslar noted Auguste van Pels was with Anne and Margot Frank, and was caring for Margot, who was severely ill. Neither of them saw Margot, as she {{was too weak to}} leave her bunk. Anne told Blitz and Goslar she believed her parents were dead, and for that <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> did not wish to live any longer. Goslar later estimated their meetings had taken place in late January or early February 1945.|$|E
