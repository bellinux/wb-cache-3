40|$|Abstract Measuring {{equipment}} is often complex and expensive. So training on a simulation in virtual experiments {{is in many}} cases a good idea, especially if it is conducted over the internet. On the other hand, mathematical models, needed for the simulation of a complex measuring device and complex measuring phenomena have limited efficiency. For this reason a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the real <b>equipment,</b> {{in this particular case}} the oscilloscope, is presented in this article. The training efficiency is increased by time sharing the instrument over the internet. Another goal was also to develop a realistic web-based interface that could be used by thin clients, such as an ordinary internet browser without the need for installation of supporting applications.

40|$|Mine wide, {{underground}} {{wireless communications}} are {{possible with the}} use of Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) technology. Due to the propagation through rock of ULF radio signals a relatively small antenna can provide communications coverage over a complete mining operation. Starting as a Personal Emergency Device (PED) for emergency messaging to miners under all circumstances, the ULF communications system has grown to include capabilities <b>of</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> underground <b>equipment</b> such as pumps and fans and centralised blasting initiation. This technology is now in use on 5 continents having lately made it onto the African mining scene. The paper and presentation will provide the audience with the benefit from international mining know-how in this technology as well as local African experiences. A recent commissioning exercise for example, is expected to pay for itself in electricity savings within a few months. These and other results from practical demonstrations and usage will be covered. This novel technology becomes {{an integral part of the}} daily operating infrastructure of a mine with immediate safety and business benefits. It is able to reduce capital expenditure and is designed for ease of routine operational use. The paper will conclude with insights into current R&D for further development of this technology...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{advanced}} and sophisticated building systems combined with emerging IT technolo-gies create {{the opportunities for}} e-based energy management. Driven mostly by the deregulation of energy market, e-based energy management systems {{have the potential to}} help both energy utilities to manage power load and reduce peak loads and end-users to reduce their consumption and possibly increase their comfort. As the real time/time-of-use price of distrib-uted energy fluctuates over a day, significant savings can occur for both utilities and custom-ers; there are some appliances manageable over time, {{in the sense that it}} is possible to shift their energy use in time (away from periods with peak prices) without compromising their func-tion. This holds, for example, for heating and cooling equipment (slow distributed processes, responsible for most of the energy use in build-ings). This paper describes the infrastructure for e-services under test within a European research project and present a set of e-energy services, tested and prototyped in Greece. The provided energy services are linked with the remote monitoring of environmental parameters, the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> and actuation <b>of</b> cooling equip-ment and the on line prediction of energy con-sumption and environmental conditions (using Artificial Neural Networks). The services focus mainly on the cooling season, as this period presents an important po-tential from various points of view; energy dis-tribution companies can importantly improve the energy management by having a prediction of the cooling energy consumption of different areas <b>of</b> buildings while <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> cool-ing <b>equipment</b> during the hours of peak power demand, gives the means to effect orchestrated energy management and load shedding, as well as minimize the contingency of construction and operation of new plants or a feature danger of a black out. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how a scalable, distributed teamwork environment should be designed and realized. Central design criteria includes that the system should be scalable and robust, allow for easy access and be symmetric. The system should allow for project team members to collaborate even though they are not located at the same physical location. The resulting system presented in this thesis, called the mStar environment have been created to address exactly these questions. mStar is scalable and robust through the usage of standard networks and IP-multicast, it allows for easy access as it is desktop based and finally it is symmetric allowing for easy peer-communication. mStar includes support for desktop conferencing, including mAudio for audio, reuse of the MBone Vic tool for video, mWB for whiteboard, mChat for text based chat and mVote for voting. It also supports distributed synchronized presentations using the WWW and the mWeb application. As all traffic is network and IP-multicast based it allows for easy recording and playback of teamwork sessions using the mMOD application. To allow for easy access to users behind non-multicast capable network segments (primarily modem and ISDN), mTunnel was created. It allows for tunneling and transformation of the traffic. Another member of the mStar environment is Director for <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> video <b>equipment.</b> mStar also includes support for easy creation of new teamwork tools and applications using the Tunable Multicast Platform - /TMP and the Generic Agent Architecture. The mStar environment can be used and is being used on a daily basis for electronic meetings, distance education and lectures, and daily teamwork. The usage mStar creates group awareness between project members and helps users from not becoming isolated from their department and project team. mStar allows for usage 24 hours a day and have resulted in, among other things, a new usage patterns, which resembles electronic corridors more than specific meetings, where users can and do meet spontaneously to talk about anything they want, but also overhear other interesting and important conversations just as in a physical office corridor.

40|$|Web-accessible {{laboratory}} experiments are gaining popularity {{due to their}} advantages over traditional {{laboratory experiments}}. With advancement in internet technology, more and more laboratories are becoming web-accessible. The needs for these virtual labs fit perfectly into the modern methods of assembly, delivery and access to educational technology resources adopted by educational institutions around the world. But still there is an absence of proper standards {{as to how to}} properly design and deal with the software infrastructure issues that make it possible for the labs to be accessible through web. It is always necessary to design a software system that is robust, platform independent and easily modifiable to accommodate changing requirements. It is also necessary for the system to be easily replicable for newer labs. The software architecture for the MIT I-Lab Heat Exchanger experiment is designed keeping in mind all these needs and it has been modified at different times to make room for changing requirements both in part of students performing the experiment (through student assessment of the experiment) and the instructors of the courses that the system has been deployed to. The design and implementation of the software architecture for the heat exchanger experiment is discussed in this thesis. The key component of the system is a Laboratory Heat Exchanger, which is employed to study principles of heat transfer. The software system is divided into four functional components: local server <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the laboratory <b>equipment,</b> <b>remote</b> client <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equipment,</b> client collaboration and user registration, authentication and experiment scheduling. The system has been successfully used in three MIT courses and one course at University of Texas at Austin over the span of two semesters and is scheduled to be used in two more courses in addition to these. With evolution of newer and better technology, the system will be able to accommodate itself to suitable changes that conform to the requirements of the system and always thrive to provide a more robust solution to the problems at hand. by Rubaiyat Amin Khan.

40|$|The Waste Emplacement/Retrieval System {{transports}} Waste Packages (WPs) {{from the}} Waste Handling Building (WHB) to the subsurface area of emplacement, and emplaces the WPs once there. The system also, if necessary, removes {{some or all}} of the WPs from the underground and transports them to the surface. Lastly, the system is designed to remediate abnormal events involving the portions of the system supporting emplacement or retrieval. During emplacement operations, the system operates on the surface between the WHB and North Portal, and in the subsurface in the North Ramp, access mains, and emplacement drifts. During retrieval or abnormal conditions, the operations areas may also extend to a surface retrieval storage site and South Portal on the surface, and the South Ramp in the subsurface. A typical transport and emplacement operation involves the following sequence of events. A WP is loaded into a WP transporter at the WHB, and coupled to a pair of transport locomotives. The locomotives transport the WP from the WHB, down the North Ramp, and to the entrance of an emplacement drift. Once docked at the entrance of the emplacment drift, the WP is moved outside of the WP transporter, and engaged by a WP emplacement gantry. The gantry lifts the WP, and transports it to its emplacement location, where the WP is then lowered to its final resting position. The gantry remains in the drift while the WP transporter is returned to the WHB by the locomotives. When the transporter reaches the WHB, the sequence of operations is repeated. Retrieval of all the WPs, or a large group of WPs, under normal conditions is achieved by reversing the emplacement operations. Retrieval of a small set of WPs, under normal or abnormal conditions, is known as recovery. Recovery performed under abnormal conditions will involve a suite <b>of</b> specialized <b>equipment</b> designed to perform a variety of tasks to enable the recovery process. Recovery after abnormal events may require clearing <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> rock, and ground support to facilitate recovery operations. Stabilization of existing ground support and installation of new ground support may also be needed. Recovery of WPs after an event that has contaminated drifts and/or WPs will require limiting the spread <b>of</b> contamination. Specialized <b>equipment</b> will also be necessary for system restoration. The system interfaces with the Subsurface Facility System and Ground Control System for the size and layout of the underground openings. The system interfaces with the Subsurface Ventilation System for the emplacement drift operating environment and the size of the drift isolation doors. The system interfaces with all WP types for the size, weight, and other important parameters affecting emplacement, recovery, and retrieval. The system interfaces with the Subsurface Emplacement Transportation System for the rail system upon which it operates and the distribution of power throuch the rail system. The system interfaces with the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) Operations Monitoring and Control System for the transmission of data to and from the system <b>equipment,</b> and for <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> system <b>equipment.</b> The system interfaces with the Ground Control System for any repairs that are made. The system interfaces with the Emplacement Drift System for the WP emplacement mode and hardware. The system interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System and the Waste Handling Building System for the receipt (during emplacement) and delivery (during retrieval/recovery) of WPs...|$|R
40|$|A data-communication {{protocol}} {{has been}} devised to enable secure, reliable <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> processes and <b>equipment</b> via a collision-based network, while using minimal bandwidth and computation. The network {{could be the}} Internet or an intranet. Control is made secure by use of both a password and a dynamic key, which is sent transparently to a remote user by the controlled computer (that is, the computer, located at the site <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> or process to be controlled, that exerts direct control over the process). The protocol functions {{in the presence of}} network latency, overcomes errors caused by missed dynamic keys, and defeats attempts by unauthorized remote users to gain control. The protocol is not suitable for real-time control, but is well suited for applications in which control latencies up to about 0. 5 second are acceptable. The encryption scheme involves the use of both a dynamic and a private key, without any additional overhead that would degrade performance. The dynamic key is embedded in the equipment- or process-monitor data packets sent out by the controlled computer: in other words, the dynamic key is a subset of the data in each such data packet. The controlled computer maintains a history of the last 3 to 5 data packets for use in decrypting incoming control commands. In addition, the controlled computer records a private key (password) that is given to the remote computer. The encrypted incoming command is permuted by both the dynamic and private key. A person who records the command data in a given packet for hostile purposes cannot use that packet after the public key expires (typically within 3 seconds). Even a person in possession of an unauthorized copy of the command/remote-display software cannot use that software {{in the absence of the}} password. The use of a dynamic key embedded in the outgoing data makes the central-processing unit overhead very small. The use of a National Instruments DataSocket(TradeMark) (or equivalent) protocol or the User Datagram Protocol makes it possible to obtain reasonably short response times: Typical response times in event-driven control, using packets sized. 300 bytes, are < 0. 2 second for commands issued from locations anywhere on Earth. The protocol requires that control commands represent absolute values <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> parameters (e. g., a specified temperature), as distinguished from changes in values <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> parameters (e. g., a specified increment of temperature). Each command is issued three or more times to ensure delivery in crowded networks. The use of absolute-value commands prevents additional (redundant) commands from causing trouble. Because a <b>remote</b> <b>controlling</b> computer receives "talkback" in the form of data packets from the controlled computer, typically within a time interval < or = 1 s, the controlling computer can re-issue a command if network failure has occurred. The controlled computer, the process or equipment that it controls, and any human operator(s) at the site <b>of</b> the <b>controlled</b> <b>equipment</b> or process should be equipped with safety measures to prevent damage to equipment or injury to humans. These features could be a combination of software, external hardware, and intervention by the human operator(s). The protocol is not fail-safe, but by adopting these safety measures as part of the protocol, one makes the protocol a robust means <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>remote</b> processes and <b>equipment</b> by use <b>of</b> typical office computers via intranets and/or the Internet...|$|R
