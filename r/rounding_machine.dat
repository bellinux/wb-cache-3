30|$|Thirty-eight {{pitch pine}} (Pinus rigida Mill.) trees were {{randomly}} selected from plantation forest and 103 logs were obtained. The logs were sorted by end-diameter in order to produce maximum yield when it is manufactured. The logs were debarked and then processed into five different sizes of round timber, 100  mm (R 100), 120  mm (R 120), 140  mm (R 140), 160  mm (R 160), and 180  mm (R 180) in diameter by a <b>rounding</b> <b>machine.</b> The round timbers were stacked at room temperature for 6  months to be air-dried. After a flexural test, the moisture content (MC) was measured by the oven-dry method. The final moisture content was consistently around 18.9  %.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Heavy Current)) [...] Cape Technikon, 1991 Linear {{induction}} motors {{are built}} for numerous applications. Their robustness, gearfree-link to the load {{and the fact}} that speed is not a function of the number of poles (as in <b>round</b> <b>machines)</b> are only a few advantages. As every single phase motor needs some starting aid, so does a linear induction drive. For <b>round</b> <b>machines,</b> capacitors or shaded poles are usually used. A capacitor can be damaged electrically, which is a rare occurrence for shading rings. A useful combination of these advantages is a linear induction motor which is gearless and uses the shaded pole principle as a starting aid. In order to simplify the designing process, a computer program (Fortran) was written. The main objective on the electrical side was to obtain low input power, high power factor and high efficiency. In order to find the performance curves, torque measurements were made. Although the principles of torque measurements are well known the device to measure torque for this machine was not available and had to be constructed...|$|R
50|$|Once the Op Fire is resolved, {{the firing}} unit is {{fatigued}} (can take no other actions {{during the current}} <b>round).</b> <b>Machine</b> gun crews have a special ability, called Rapid Op Fire, which permits them to Op Fire repeatedly (at different moving units) without becoming fatigued. So one machine gun crew, during the same turn, could conceivably Op Fire at numerous enemy units as they move within the machine gun crew's range and line of sight.|$|R

50|$|The Leopard 2 is {{equipped}} with two machine guns, one mounted co-axially, the other on an anti-aircraft mount. German models use the MG 3 7.62 mm machine gun; Dutch and Singapore models use FN MAG 7.62 mm machine guns; Swiss models use Swiss MG 87 7.5 mm <b>machine</b> guns. 4750 <b>rounds</b> of <b>machine</b> gun ammunition are carried on board the Leopard 2.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle carried 80 37 mm rounds (16 in {{the turret}} and 64 in an {{ammunition}} {{rack in the}} right sponson) when fitted with a single radio. Vehicles with a second radio installed only carried 16 main gun rounds. Some units solved this problem by cutting up the removed main ammunition rack and stowing 18 rounds in each sponson, under the radios. This raised the number of main gun rounds able to be carried to 52. Another modification (the most common one) involved fabricating (again from the discarded main ammunition rack) a 43-round bin to be placed behind the driver's seat, and a 20-round bin attached to the framing of the turret basket. This raised the ammunition capacity up to 79 <b>rounds.</b> <b>Machine</b> gun ammunition consisted of 1,500 [...]30 caliber rounds and 400 [...]50 caliber rounds. In addition, the vehicle carried a mix of 16 smoke and hand grenades, four smoke pots, six M1 anti-tank mines and four M1 carbines for the crew.|$|R
