40|$|OALD 5 lists {{a lot of}} collocates in examples, {{which often}} {{take the form of}} slashed Phrase-type examples. The {{advantage}} of phrase examples is that they take up a lot less space than full sentence examples, and several collocations can be shown at once. Compared with the other three dictionaries, OALD 5 seems to have more phrase examples. Consider the collocational information given by dictionaries in the following entries: responsibility OALD 5 : take/assume/accept/bear full <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the consequences. CIDE: The minister took/accepted full <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> (=admitted that he was to blame for) the disaster and resigned. COBUILD 2 : (sense 2) If you accept <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> something that has happened, you agree that you were to blame for it or caused it.

5|$|In October 1950, No.482 Squadron {{personnel}} undertook airframe and Avon engine {{courses in}} preparation for the introduction of the recently ordered English Electric Canberra jet bomber, forty-eight of which began re-equipping No.82 Wing's flying squadrons in December 1953. During the 1950s and 60s, No.482 Squadron provided ground support for exercises involving the Canberras in Darwin and New Guinea, and for ceremonial occasions including several royal visits. In April 1968, No.1 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), responsible for converting aircrew to the Canberra, was made independent of No.82 Wing to concentrate on providing crews for No.2 Squadron, which was on active duty in the Vietnam War. Maintenance <b>responsibilities</b> <b>for</b> the Canberras then transferred from No.482 Squadron to No.1 OCU, along with relevant staff and equipment.|$|E
5|$|The 189th Infantry Brigade was {{activated}} {{once again}} on 1 December 2006 at Fort Bragg. This was done by reflagging the 4th Brigade, 78th Division back to the 189th Infantry Brigade.

The process was also designed to make identification of the brigades easier. It was assigned to Division East of the First Army.

5|$|The Scottish Football Union (SFU), the {{governing}} body for rugby union in Scotland, {{did not give}} the New Zealanders an official welcome, and sent only one official to greet them on their arrival in Edinburgh. In addition, the SFU refused a financial guarantee for the match, promising the gate receipts to the New Zealanders instead; {{this meant that the}} NZRFU had to take on all monetary <b>responsibilities</b> <b>for</b> the match. One reason for the cold reception from the SFU may have been because of negative reports from David Bedell-Sivright, who was Scotland's captain and had also captained the British Isles team on their 1904 tour of New Zealand. Bedell-Sivright had reported unfavourably on his experiences in New Zealand the previous year, especially regarding the wing-forward play of Gallaher.|$|E
