25|$|To {{consider}} another example, where a <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> is {{very natural}} to us, namely {{the surface of}} the rotating Earth, centrifugal force reduces the apparent force of gravity by about one part in a thousand, depending on latitude.

25|$|Fictitious {{forces can}} be {{considered}} to do work, provided that they move an object on a trajectory that changes its energy from potential to kinetic. For example, consider {{a person in a}} rotating chair holding a weight in their outstretched hand. If they pull their hand inward toward their body, {{from the perspective of the}} <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> they have done work against the centrifugal force. When the weight is let go, it spontaneously flies outward relative to the <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> because the centrifugal force does work on the object, converting its potential energy into kinetic. From an inertial viewpoint, of course, the object flies away from them because it is suddenly allowed to move in a straight line. This illustrates that the work done, like the total potential and kinetic energy of an object, can be different in a non-inertial frame than an inertial one.|$|E

25|$|Physics in non-inertial {{reference}} frames was historically {{treated by}} a coordinate transformation, first, to an inertial reference frame, performing the necessary calculations therein, and using another {{to return to}} the non-inertial reference frame. In most such situations, the same laws of physics can be used if certain predictable fictitious forces are added into consideration; an example is a uniformly <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> which can be treated as an inertial reference frame if one adds a fictitious centrifugal force and Coriolis force into consideration.|$|E
25|$|A {{practical}} {{application of the}} Coriolis effect is the mass flow meter, an instrument that measures the mass flow rate and density of a fluid flowing through a tube. The operating principle involves inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes. The vibration, though not completely circular, provides the <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> that {{gives rise to the}} Coriolis effect. While specific methods vary according to the design of the flow meter, sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes. The changes observed represent the mass flow rate and density of the fluid.|$|E

As seen in a <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> that matches the angular velocity of the two co-orbiting bodies, the gravitational fields of two massive bodies combined with the minor body's centrifugal force are in balance at the Lagrangian points, allowing the smaller third body to be relatively stationary {{with respect to the}} first two.|$|E

A conception {{of the system of}} coordinates associated with a <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> is introduced. It is shown that one of these coordinates can be regarded as temporal coordinate, and the others as spatial ones. It is demonstrated that in relativistic case nondiagonal spatial-temporal components of the metric tensor are always equal to zero.

3000|$|In the {{proposed}} approach, the {{voltage and current}} controller are designed in the <b>rotating</b> dq <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> The estimation of ac voltage parameters, such as voltage amplitude and phase angle, will act as {{a crucial role in}} the overall performance of the synchronization algorithm. With a low pass filter used to eliminate the harmonics, a synchronous <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> phase locked loop (SRF-PLL) [21, 22, 23] as shown in Fig.  5 is used in {{the proposed}} control strategy. In spite of the good behavior of the SRF-PLL under sinusoidal conditions, its performance is deteriorated when the three phase input signal becomes distorted. When the three-phase instantaneous voltage waveforms are transformed from the abc <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> into the <b>rotating</b> dq <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> by means of the Park transformation [24, 25], the fundamental and (6 n± 1)th harmonics in the abc <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> are represented by DC component and 6 n th harmonics in the <b>rotating</b> dq <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> In the <b>rotating</b> dq <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> two low pass filters (LPFs) with high cutoff frequency, e.g. 150 Hz, implemented in the control scheme can easily eliminate the 6 th and higher order harmonics to obtain the DC components of v [...] d [...] and v [...] q. [...] The LPFs have few affects to the DC components of the v [...] d [...] and v [...] q [...]. Therefore, the SRF-PLL with LPFs in the <b>rotating</b> dq <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> can provide a good performance of the phase angle and magnitude estimation under distorted condition. In the <b>rotating</b> dq <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> the DC component of the v [...] d [...] represents the amplitude of the fundamental component of Bus 2 voltage, which is subsequently set as the voltage reference in the next subsection. A feedback control loop is used to control the angular position by forcing the v [...] q [...] component to be zero. As depicted in Fig.  5, the estimated grid frequency is ω. As a feed forward signal, the nominal angular frequency is conventionally adopted to improve the dynamics of the phase estimation θ derived by integrating ω.|$|R

25|$|In physics, the Coriolis {{force is}} an {{inertial}} force that acts on {{objects that are}} in motion relative to a <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts {{to the left of}} the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, in connection with the theory of water wheels. Early in the 20th century, the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with meteorology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of distant objects and a <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame,</b> what {{must be taken into}} account is the {{resultant}} force of centrifugal and Coriolis force. Consider a distant star observed from a rotating spacecraft. In the reference frame co-rotating with the spacecraft, the distant star appears to move along a circular trajectory around the spacecraft. The apparent motion of the star is an apparent centripetal acceleration. Just like in the example above of the car in circular motion, the centrifugal force has the same magnitude as the fictitious centripetal force, but is directed in the opposite, centrifugal direction. In this case the Coriolis force is twice the magnitude of the centrifugal force, and it points in centripetal direction. The vector sum of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force is the total fictitious force, which in this case points in centripetal direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} the Earth is a <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> To solve {{classical}} mechanics problems exactly in an Earth-bound reference frame, three fictitious forces must be introduced: the Coriolis force, the centrifugal force (described below) and the Euler force. The Euler force is typically ignored because the variations in the angular velocity of the rotating Earth surface are usually insignificant. Both of the other fictitious forces are weak compared to most typical forces in everyday life, {{but they can be}} detected under careful conditions. For example, Léon Foucault was able to show that the Coriolis force results from the Earth's rotation using the Foucault pendulum. If the Earth were to maintain its current shape but rotate twenty times faster (making each day only ~72 minutes long), people could easily get the impression that such fictitious forces were pulling on them, as on a spinning carousel--those in temperate and tropical latitudes would, in fact, need to hold on in order to avoid being launched into orbit by the centrifugal force.|$|E

2500|$|The Coriolis force {{exists only}} when one uses a <b>{{rotating}}</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame.</b> In the rotating frame it behaves {{exactly like a}} real force (that is to say, it causes acceleration and has real effects). However, the Coriolis force {{is a consequence of}} inertia, and is not attributable to an identifiable originating body, as is the case for electromagnetic or nuclear forces, for example. From an analytical viewpoint, to use Newton's second law in a rotating system, the Coriolis force is mathematically necessary, but it disappears in a non-accelerating, inertial frame of reference. For example, consider two children on opposite sides of a spinning roundabout (Merry-go-round [...] ), who are throwing a ball to each other. From the children's point of view, this ball's path is curved sideways by the Coriolis force. Suppose the roundabout spins anticlockwise when viewed from above. From the thrower's perspective, the deflection is to the right. From the non-thrower's perspective, deflection is to the left. For a mathematical formulation see Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces. In meteorology, a rotating frame (the Earth) with its Coriolis force provides a more natural framework for explanation of air movements than a non-rotating, inertial frame without Coriolis forces. In long-range gunnery, sight corrections for the Earth's rotation are based upon the Coriolis force. These examples are described in more detail below.|$|E

2500|$|In popular (non-technical) {{usage of}} the term [...] "Coriolis effect", the <b>rotating</b> <b>reference</b> <b>frame</b> implied is almost always the Earth. Because the Earth spins, Earth-bound {{observers}} need {{to account for the}} Coriolis force to correctly analyze the motion of objects. [...] The Earth completes one rotation per day, so for motions of everyday objects the Coriolis force is usually quite small compared to other forces; its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean. Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. This force causes moving objects {{on the surface of the}} Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the poles, since the effective rotation rate about a local vertical axis is largest there, and decreases to zero at the equator. Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would in a non-rotating system, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator and to the left of this direction south of it. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones (see Coriolis effects in meteorology).|$|E
