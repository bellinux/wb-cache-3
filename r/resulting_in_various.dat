5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>various</b> cellular responses.|$|E
25|$|During {{the peak}} of the age of sail, {{beginning}} in the early 17th century, it was customary (and later a legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality; these flags eventually evolved into the national flags and maritime flags of today. Flags also became the preferred means of communications at sea, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>various</b> systems of flag signals; see, International maritime signal flags.|$|E
25|$|Predation is a {{biological}} interaction where a predator (a heterotroph that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators {{may or may}} not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation almost always results in the death of the prey. The other main category of consumption is detritivory, the consumption of dead organic matter. It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse. Selective pressures imposed on one another has led to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>various</b> antipredator adaptations.|$|E

500|$|Production lasted six months. The {{production}} crew {{considered the most}} challenging part of creating the OVA to be making [...] "Nomura's drawings move on screen." [...] Because Last Order was hand-drawn, the crew faced difficulties creating uniform lines. Another issue was the overall feel of each scene; original drawings were done by several artists, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>various</b> scenes having different styles. Producer Akio Ofuji explained that they [...] "wanted {{to make sure the}} final product was of very high quality, so [...] worked with the production company day and night, straight through to the deadline." [...] Nomura and Ofuji agreed that many scenes showing important events and feelings in Final Fantasy VII had been fragmented and disjointed, and so they had decided that those scenes would be the subject of Last Order, giving the audience of Advent Children (the film Last Order was released with) a [...] "more enjoyable understanding." [...] They used the film as an opportunity to portray Zack [...] "properly" [...] as a [...] "handsome, light-hearted man [...] was in everyone's memory". Last Order also details Tseng's growth and his feelings towards his both job and events depicted, wherein he attempts to [...] "get his own ideas of justice heard" [...] but later abandons his moral values [...] "in order to carry out a cruel mission." [...] Ofuji commented that [...] "those are the kind of scenes we wanted people to be more aware of." ...|$|E

2500|$|Originally massive glaciers {{that formed}} in Canada moved southward over {{the central and}} low-elevation plains located in the United States. [...] These glaciers and their {{deposits}} had great effects {{on the surface of}} the land they covered, with biggest changes occurring between the Missouri and Ohio Rivers. One key abiotic factor that affects Great Plains is weather in relation to the low- relief topography as result of glacial smoothing. Low relief topography is used to describe areas that have little difference in altitude throughout the region. Low relief landscapes, such as the various types of grasslands found throughout the Great Plains, have an effect on rainfall distribution. Rainfall in this ecoregion increases from west to east <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>various</b> types of prairie grasslands.|$|E

Dealing with nomadic tribes complicated the reservation strategy and decentralized tribal power made treaty making difficult among the Plains Indians. Conflicts erupted in the 1850s, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>various</b> Indian wars. In these times of conflict, Indians become more stringent about white men entering their territory. Such {{as in the case}} of Oliver Loving, they would sometimes attack cowboys and their cattle if ever caught crossing in the borders of their land. They would also prey upon livestock if food was scarce during hard times. However, relationship between cowboys and Native Americans were more mutual than they are portrayed, and the former would occasionally pay a fine of 10 cents per cow for the latter to allow them to travel through their land. Indians also preyed upon stagecoaches travelling in the frontier for its horses and valuables.|$|E
