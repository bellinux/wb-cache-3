30|$|Clearly, the {{capacity}} of rail infrastructure is a complex issue depending upon several factors; the benefits of creating a transnational method for its assessment are highlighted also in the UIC Code 406 (2004) [9]. Indeed {{in the last years}} the scientific literature has devoted great efforts in addressing this issue; many contributions provide an accurate distinction (synthetic, analytical, simulation models) and description of different methodologies (see [10 – 13] or [14]). Several approaches address the assessment of line capacity (as described in [15]); Landex et al. in [16], for example, focus on the application of the UIC code 406 while [17] and [18] describe the Capacity Utilization Index (CUI) procedure applied in UK. Other authors analyse the issue at station level: Malavasi et al. [19] provide a review of capacity methods for complex <b>railway</b> <b>nodes</b> and a detailed description of some synthetic approaches; Lindner in [20] tries to extend the applicability of the UIC Code 406 even to the stations. Also the UIC, in recent studies, present a net distinction between line [21] and node [22] capacity, offering a comparative analysis of different synthetic or analytical methodologies for their evaluation. Finally Watanabe et al. in [23] propose a different methodology for identifying ‘bottleneck’ stations based on passenger flows, volumes of transfer passengers through the stations and on multi-objective optimization with a generic algorithm.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{results of}} an integrated land use and transport modelling, carried out for {{the territory of the}} French region of North-Pas-de-Calais using the software Tranus. The interest of this research was to simulate, test and evaluate impacts of a Transit Oriented Development regional plan, using the LUTI modelling tool. Therefore were analyzed evolution of transport demand modal share and dynamics of real estate market and of localization choices of population and activities. TOD is a model of urban development that promotes high quality, mixed and multi-functional densification, located in proximity of transit nodes and corridors, with priority to non-motorized mobility and with the aim to reduce land consumption and car dependency. Multiple TOD examples can be found at urban and metropolitan scale, with different characteristics depending on the socio-economic and territorial contexts, while rarer are interventions at a regional scale. Therefore this research aim to analyze the application of a TOD regional plan, applied to a specific group of regional <b>railway</b> <b>nodes</b> and corridors, selected for their TOD potential. Results showed that some rail corridors initially selected, clearly confirmed their TOD potential and that TOD effects are more evident in areas with good basic levels of attractiveness and of economic dynamism. Furthermore, if policy of densification clearly contributes to concentrate residential demand in urban zones and to limit urban sprawl, further incentives has to be organized in favor of transit use. More interesting effects are in fact found by simulating transit integrated tariff policies between regional train and bus services, as well as interventions discouraging car use, in addiction to TOD urban configurations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Teaching {{computer}} {{science in the}} domain of safety critical systems needs to address multiple topics: embedded and distributed systems, real-time behavior and model-based system design. We present a model railway demonstrator that employs these paradigms in one application. The distributed <b>railway</b> controller <b>nodes</b> are connected using industry standard networks (CAN, Ethernet or TTP). The corresponding application software can be implemented manually in C/C++ or by using model-based development tools. This flexibility enables users to compare ad-vantages and drawbacks of various design patterns. Following an overview of the railway and its control system, experiences from educational courses as part of the DECOS training activities are discussed. In these courses university students were to implement controlling applications and simulations for the demonstrator using Matlab Simulink, Stateflow, and hardware specific add-ons. I...|$|R

50|$|Plans {{formulated}} by the Deutsche Reichsbahn for military reasons in 1937 to expand to twin tracks the section between Herrlingen and Immendingen, {{which had been}} entirely single-tracked, had strong proponents {{during the course of}} World War II, but were not further pursued {{after the end of the}} war.

40|$|International {{transport}} corridors {{are becoming}} increasingly important in enhancing the sustainable mobility of goods and people around the world. In Europe, such a mobility issue has a much deeper meaning. Namely, European transport corridors have a long tradition in constituting the backbone of territorial cohesion among the member-states of the European Union. Thus, European integration strongly depends not only on multilateral coordination of trade and transport flows, {{but also on the}} cooperation-building projects aimed at achieving integrated spatial and transport development, most easily perceivable at the local level, i. e. in the hot-spots – places with major spatial implications of transport infrastructure development. However, such an integrated approach is difficult to achieve. On the one hand, the impact of globalisation on urban development poses a threat to infrastructure investments in adjacent urban regions. On the other hand, the differences in dealing with large infrastructural and spatial development projects among various states, legal and administrative families, and finally, planning cultures also affect the transparency and inclusion of all the relevant aspects. For example, the ongoing transformation of former transport areas (<b>railway</b> <b>nodes,</b> harbours and airports) situated along the waterfronts into new urban centres {{is only one of many}} spatial conflicts between transport and urban functions. Therefore, multi-level strategic planning strategies to minimise the risks of spatial conflicts are needed. By reflecting on the findings of two bottom-up initiatives aimed at improving the cooperation among stakeholders along two European transport corridors – Rhine- Alpine and Orient/east-Med(iterranean), the paper emphasises the importance of the transportation nodes as strategic sites for inward development. Therefore, two hot-spots are presented – inland port in Basel and railway station in Belgrade. As the cases describe quite different approaches in dealing with integrated spatial and transport development, the paper concludes that the better stakeholder cooperation help to overcome the administrative obstacles and enhance integrated development at the local level. This is surely then to be tranferred to the regional and transnational levels, too...|$|R
40|$|Properly {{planning}} the modern railway logistics {{center is a}} necessary step for the railway logistics operation, which can effectively improve the railway freight service for a seamless connection between {{the internal and external}} logistic nodes.
