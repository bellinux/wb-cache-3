2500|$|Bell {{commenced}} {{development of}} the UH-1C in 1960 in order to correct aerodynamic deficiencies of the armed UH-1B. Bell fitted the UH-1C with a 1,100shp (820kW) T53-L-11 engine to provide the power needed to lift all weapons systems in use or under development. The Army would eventually refit all UH-1B aircraft with the same engine. A new rotor system was developed for the UH-1C to allow higher air speeds and {{reduce the incidence of}} <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> stall during diving engagements. [...] The improved rotor resulted in better maneuverability and a slight speed increase. [...] The increased power and a larger diameter rotor required Bell's engineers to design a new tail boom for the UH-1C. The longer tail boom incorporated a wider chord vertical fin on the tail rotor pylon and larger synchronized elevators.|$|E
50|$|Fully {{articulated}} rotor systems use {{a combination}} of flapping and a horizontal motion that moves the <b>retreating</b> <b>blades</b> forward slightly and moves them back again on the advancing side, thus creating more relative airflow and lift on the retreating side {{at the expense of the}} advancing side.|$|R
50|$|Before {{this could}} be satisfactorily achieved, De la Cierva {{experienced}} several failures primarily associated with the unbalanced rolling movement generated when attempting take-off, due to dissymmetry of lift between the advancing and <b>retreating</b> <b>blades.</b> This major difficulty was resolved {{by the introduction of}} the flapping hinge.

5000|$|<b>Retreating</b> <b>blade</b> stall. As {{forward speed}} of the {{helicopter}} increases, the airflow over the <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> becomes relatively slower, while the airflow over the advancing blade is relatively faster, creating more lift. If not counteracted by flapping, this would cause dissymmetry of lift and eventually <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> stall, and blade stability suffers as the blade reaches its limits for flapping.|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{advancing}} blade has higher airspeed than the <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> and generates a dissymmetry of lift, rotor blades {{are designed to}} [...] "flap" [...] - lift and twist {{in such a way}} that {{the advancing}} blade flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack. Conversely, the <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> flaps down, develops a higher angle of attack, and generates more lift. At high speeds, the force on the rotors is such that they [...] "flap" [...] excessively, and the <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> can reach too high an angle and stall. For this reason, the maximum safe forward airspeed of a helicopter is given a design rating called VNE, velocity, never exceed. In addition, it is possible for the helicopter to fly at an airspeed where an excessive amount of the <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> stalls, which results in high vibration, pitch-up, and roll into the <b>retreating</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Most {{helicopter}} designs {{compensate for}} this by incorporating {{a certain degree}} of horizontal [...] "flap" [...] movement of the rotor blades.

40|$|Vertical axis wind {{turbines}} (VAWTs) have typically lower efficiency {{compared to their}} horizontal counterparts (HAWTs), but are attractive for places where taller structures are prohibited, {{as well as for}} regions where available wind speeds are lower. For HAWTs, the blades are always perpendicular to the incoming wind, providing a continuous thrust throughout the rotation. Contrary to HAWTs, VAWTs have advancing <b>blades</b> and <b>retreating</b> <b>blades,</b> where blades backtrack against the wind, causing lower efficiency. Hence, any modifications that can be made to improve the efficiency of VAWTs can be beneficial to the wind industry.

A comparison of calculated and experimental results showed that most of the rotor characteristics could be calculated with reasonable accuracy, and that the type of induced flow assumed has a secondary effect upon the net rotor forces, although the flapping motion is influenced appreciably.

50|$|When {{dissymmetry}} {{causes the}} <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> to experience less airflow than {{required to maintain}} lift, a condition called <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> stall can occur. This causes the helicopter to roll to the retreating side and pitch up (due to gyroscopic precession). This situation, when not immediately recognized can cause a severe loss of aircraft controllability.|$|E
50|$|As the {{aircraft}} approaches <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> stall conditions, it will shudder and the nose {{will begin to}} pitch up. The resultant upward pitching of the nose will naturally begin to correct the situation as it results in slowing {{the aircraft}}. If forced to continue the acceleration via flight controls (forward cyclic + collective), it may roll {{to the side of}} the <b>retreating</b> <b>blade.</b> Recovery involves lowering the collective pitch, relieving forward pressure on the cyclic or more commonly, both. Either of these control movements should restore the proper attached airflow over the <b>retreating</b> <b>blade</b> thus generating lift again. This is normally an automatically corrected condition if one just 'lets go' of the controls.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic problem}} {{inherent}} in rotor design {{is the difference}} in airspeed for the advancing and <b>retreating</b> <b>blades.</b> Among the many effects this causes is one of interest; the blades rotate forward and backward around the hub as drag increases and decreases. Consider a blade as it reaches {{the rear of the}} aircraft and starts to rotate forward; during this time the relative airspeed starts increasing rapidly, and the blade is pushed further and further back by the increasing drag. This force is absorbed in a drag bearing. During the brief period while it rotates around this bearing, the overall speed of the blade is decreased, slightly offsetting the speed due to forward motion.|$|R

In 1923, de la Cierva's first successful autogyro was flown in Spain by Lt. Gomez Spencer. In 1925 he brought his C.6 to Britain and demonstrated it to the Air Ministry at Farnborough, Hampshire. This machine had a four blade rotor with flapping hinges but relied upon conventional airplane controls for pitch, roll and yaw. It was based upon an Avro 504K fuselage, initial rotation of the rotor was achieved by the rapid uncoiling of a rope passed around stops on the undersides of the blades.|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} advance ratios the <b>retreating</b> <b>blades</b> {{of modern}} helicopters encounter flow environments with severe separation and vortex shedding which {{are known as}} deep dynamic stall conditions. Recently considerable improvements have been achieved for both numerical methods and nonintrusive experimental flow diagnostic techniques {{to be applied to}} these complex highly unsteady flows. For the numerical treatment of the problem a time-accurate code based on the 2 D-Navier-Stokes equations has been applied. The experimental investigation of the instantaneous flowfield was carried out by means of a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), in two different wind tunnel facilities: The low-speed wind tunnel of the German-French Institute, St. Louis (ISL) and the High Speed Wind tunnel (HKG) of the DLr in Goettingen.

40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of the flow field around a helicopter, helicopter aerodynamics deal with quite a number of challenging aerodynamic problems like: flow separation on the <b>retreating</b> <b>blades,</b> compressible flow with shocks embedded on the advancing blades, a complex wake structure containing strong blade tip vortices, unsteady loads due to fluid structure interaction and many more. The extreme operation conditions on rotor blades limit the helicopter in many respects, like maximum speed, efficiency, noise emissions, loading capabilities and others. Due to the complex and frequently highly unsteady flow conditions at the rotor airfoils, experimental investigations are required to complete numerical simulations even if over the past decades, considerable {{progress has been made in}} the development of the performance prediction capabilities for isolated helicopter components. With modern CFD methods it is possible to compute the unsteady, three-dimensional flow field around a helicopter under moderate operation conditions (e. g. Antoniadisa et al. 2011). The computation time needed for such a computation with high spatial and temporal resolution is excessive and for now it remains unprofitable to incorporate CFD in the design iterations of future helicopters. Furthermore, CFD results still need validation and detailed experiments are needed to increase the physical understanding of helicopter flow phenomena and improve the modelling and prediction capabilities...|$|R

40|$|For {{the present}} {{investigations}} of dynamic stall a supercritical airfoil was chosen. This new airfoil designed by DLR {{will be used}} in dynamic stall control research activities (project ADASYS) planned for the near future: the leading edge portion of the airfoil will be drooped down dynamically to improve dynamic stall characteristics on the <b>retreating</b> side during <b>blade</b> motion. The optimised transonic properties of the airfoil, i. e., reduction of shock strength over a Mach number range will improve in addition the performance of the advancing rotor blade. Dynamic stall experiments on the rigid supercritical airfoil have first been carried out in the DNW-TWG transonic wind tunnel with a 1 m × 1 m cross section of the test section and adaptive top and bottom – walls.
