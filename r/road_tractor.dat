50|$|The {{means of}} {{transport}} in the village are bicycles and motorcycle, Rickshaws are used to go in village from Lahore multan <b>road.</b> <b>Tractors</b> and carts are used to transport goods.|$|R
5000|$|The rail service {{provided}} for trucks which are carried on trains {{for part of}} their journey {{is referred to as}} a rolling road, or rolling highway. A related transportation method is the rail transport of semi-trailers, without <b>road</b> <b>tractors,</b> sometimes referred to as [...] "trailer on flatcar" [...] (TOFC).|$|R
50|$|Euclid also {{pioneered the}} high speed tractor belly dumper. This {{combined}} an off <b>road</b> <b>tractor</b> (with a fifth wheel) {{and a very}} large, up to 100-ton capacity, belly dump trailer. This machine, descended from bottom dump wagons drawn by crawler tractors, discharged its load through longitudinal gates {{in the bottom of}} the trailer. The first such trucks carried 13 cubic yards, but by the early 1960s capacities reached 110 tons.|$|E
50|$|Reginald Oliver Denny (born January 22, 1956), was a 36 {{year old}} {{construction}} dump truck driver. On {{the first day}} of the rioting, Denny was attacked by several men, pulled from his International <b>Road</b> <b>Tractor</b> and brutally beaten, sustaining serious head trauma and other injuries. Denny's ability to speak and drive were affected by the attack, and he had to undergo years of rehabilitative therapy. During his recovery, he received over 27,000 get-well cards from supportive members of the community.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, India, Spain, Argentina, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, and Germany, {{the word}} [...] "tractor" [...] usually means [...] "farm tractor", {{and the use}} of the word [...] "tractor" [...] to mean other types of {{vehicles}} is familiar to the vehicle trade, but unfamiliar to much of the general public. In Canada and the US, the word may also refer to the <b>road</b> <b>tractor</b> portion of a tractor trailer truck, but also usually refers to the piece of farm equipment.|$|E
50|$|Modalohrs are {{specialized}} wagons {{for carrying}} road trailers and <b>road</b> <b>tractors</b> on the AFF route from France to Italy and Luxembourg to Spain and vice versa; {{there are plans}} to expand this service. A deck between the bogies (trucks) pivots (swings) 30°, allowing the trailers to be loaded from the sides. The cars are built by Lohr Industrie.|$|R
50|$|It {{manufactures}} heavy-duty trucks, buses, trolleybuses, <b>road</b> <b>tractors</b> and semi-trailers for semi-trailer trucks, and cranes. MAZ was, {{and possibly}} is, the world's largest manufacturer of TELs (Transporter-Erector-Launchers) {{for many of}} the world's mobile ballistic missiles, from the widely proliferated MAZ-543 used to carry and launch the Scud B through to the recent Topol M's impressive 8-axle TEL.|$|R
50|$|AEBI is a Switzerland-based {{manufacturer}} of municipal and agriculture machinery. The company's products include transporters, Implement carriers, <b>road</b> sweepers, <b>tractors,</b> and mowers.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, a fully {{functioning}} OO-scale model RoadRailer was {{manufactured by}} British toymaker Lines Brothers {{as part of}} their 'Minic Motorways' range. This allowed the trailer to be remotely coupled and uncoupled from a railway bogey and/or a <b>road</b> <b>tractor</b> unit. Today, Bowser makes an HO model of the current RoadRailer in kit form and the couplermate to connect the locomotive to the trailers. Weaver Models made the trailers and couplermate in O scale. DeLuxe Innovations makes an N scale ready to run model of the RoadRailer trailer and CouplerMate as well.|$|E
5000|$|A {{semi-trailer}} is {{a trailer}} without a front axle. A {{large proportion of}} its weight is supported either by a <b>road</b> <b>tractor</b> or by a detachable front axle assembly known as a dolly. A semi-trailer is normally equipped with legs, called [...] "landing gear", which can be lowered to support it when it is uncoupled. In the United States, a single trailer cannot exceed a length of 57 ft on interstate highways (unless a special permit is granted), although {{it is possible to}} link two smaller trailers together to a maximum length of 63 ft.|$|E
50|$|To {{the west}} of the station and level {{crossing}} there was a short branch (1.5 miles long) which ran to a brick and tile works in what is now known as the Dales area of Ipswich. There was a second brick works just north of Grove Farm. In World War I the line was requisitioned by the government to serve a munitions depot in the Upper Dales. In 1921 the line was worked by a Garrett steam <b>road</b> <b>tractor</b> as the track was in poor condition and it was removed in about 1927.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Canadian and USA markets, Pacific was selling too in Australia, New Zealand, and South East Asia. However its most impressive order was for four ultra-heavy <b>road</b> <b>tractors</b> to pull massive loads up to 370 tons for the South African Railways. These units were delivered in 1972, featured 600 hp Cummins engines, and were known as the [...] "largest on-highway trucks in the world". Sometimes they all worked coupled forming an extra-long road train, including an extra-capacity lowloader trailer to total 860 tons gross combination mass.|$|R
50|$|The village {{often gets}} snowed {{in during the}} winter, as the Borders Council gritters cannot get access so villagers {{have to rely on}} the local farmers to help clear <b>roads</b> with <b>tractors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thomas Green also {{produced}} {{a range of}} steam road vehicles including fairground centre-engines, <b>road</b> <b>tractors</b> and agricultural tractors. Perhaps their most well known product in this range was the steamroller, which commenced in 1872 with a vertical boilered model for the Royal Gardens, Windsor. Shortly afterward, in 1880, a convertible model (i.e. traction engine or road roller) was introduced. A conventional horizontal boilered model followed this in 1881. The range was developed to encompass {{the whole range of}} weights (3 ton to 12 ton) and styles (tandem roller, triple roller) which enabled them {{to become one of the}} market leaders, with around 300 machines supplied.|$|R
50|$|The firm of Garrett {{also sought}} a {{reliable}} stayless firebox for their smaller boilers at {{around the same}} time in the 1920s. Their solution was more conventional: a conventional outer firebox enclosed an inner firebox, where the inner crown sheet was formed into a curved valley. For a small firebox, this acted as a girder stay between the end sheets of the firebox and was sufficient to be self-supporting. The portable engines used this pattern alone. For the slightly more powerful <b>road</b> <b>tractor</b> boilers, the inner firebox was still self-supporting but the outer wrapper now required crosswise sling stays to support it, where previously it would have been supported by the stays to the inner firebox.|$|E
5000|$|A large {{proportion}} of a semitrailer's weight {{is supported by a}} tractor unit, or a detachable front-axle assembly known as a dolly, or the tail of another trailer. A semitrailer is normally equipped with landing gear (legs which can be lowered) to support it when it is uncoupled. Many semitrailers have wheels that are capable of being totally dismounted and are also relocatable (repositionable) to better distribute load to bearing wheel weight factors. Semitrailers are more popular for transport than full trailers, which have both front and rear axles. Ease of backing is cited as one of the semi's chief advantages. A <b>road</b> <b>tractor</b> coupled to a semi-trailer is often called a semitrailer truck or [...] "semi" [...] in North America & Australia, and an articulated lorry or [...] "artic" [...] in the UK.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the gaseous exhaust emissions along with {{an analysis of the}} size and mass distribution of particulate matter from a Euro V compliant <b>road</b> <b>tractor.</b> The vehicle was fitted with an engine of the displacement of 15, 6 dm 3, maximum power output 412 kW generating a maximum torque of 2700 Nm (1991 lb/ft). For the tests the authors used portable exhaust emission analyzers (PEMS: SEMTECH DS and AVL Micro Soot Sensor. The measurements were conducted under actual operating conditions in traffic typical of long distance European haulage. The analysis of the obtained results was divided into two parts. The first part was related to the assessment of the influence of the traffic conditions on the exhaust emissions and gas mileage. The second part was related to the assessment of the influence of the engine operating conditions on the said exhaust emissions. The obtained exhaust emission results were compared to the emission limits specified in the Euro 5 standard...|$|E

50|$|The 2 ft 6in line, {{known as}} the 'shell tramway', was a double line system with steel rails; the line {{initially}} linked the shell-filling rooms and associated buildings to the shell stores and it ran {{along the length of}} the shell pier. In 1904 it had 30 trucks plus a travelling crane (all with brass wheels to reduce sparks). These were also manually driven until 1929, when for the first time mechanical propulsion was provided within the yard by a battery-driven locomotive (the first of an eventual total of eight to be provided by Greenwood & Batley Ltd). The tramway ceased operation in 1960 following the acquisition of a number of electric <b>road</b> <b>tractors</b> and trailers; much of the rail network was then lifted an the routes concreted over to form roadways.|$|R

40|$|A {{forest road}} network in northeastern Italy was {{explored}} by field investigations {{to evaluate the}} cost of covering annual demand of woodchips according to three scenarios. The first scenario (A) considered the current extent of the forest <b>road</b> network (mainly <b>tractor</b> <b>road)</b> and the associated qualitative characteristics; the second scenario (B) evaluated the possibility of increasing {{the availability of the}} technical amount of forest biomass by extending the forest road network by three <b>tractor</b> <b>roads</b> (3. 9 km); the third scenario (C) considered the impact on woodchip supply of converting 9. 3 km of <b>tractor</b> forest <b>road</b> into truck forest road. At a woodchip price of 60 € t− 1, the cost–supply curve of scenario C indicated a woodchip amount of 2886 t year− 1, which was 561 t year− 1 greater than scenario A and 161 t year− 1 greater than scenario B...|$|R
5000|$|A car {{should be}} allowed to come to a {{complete}} stop before setting the transmission into park to prevent damage. Usually, Park (P) is one of only two selections in which the car's engine can be started, the other being Neutral (N). This is typically achieved via a normally open inhibitor switch (sometimes called a [...] "neutral safety switch") wired in series with the starter motor engagement circuit, which is closed when P or N is selected, completing the circuit (when the key is turned to the start position). In many modern cars and trucks, the driver must have the foot brake applied before the transmission can be taken out of park. The Park position is omitted on buses/coaches (and some <b>road</b> <b>tractors)</b> with automatic transmission (on which a parking pawl is not practical), which must instead be placed in neutral with the air-operated parking brakes set.|$|R
50|$|Passenger and {{commercial}} vehicles must be registered {{as a condition}} of use on a public road. Vehicles not used on public <b>roads,</b> such as <b>tractors</b> or vehicles whose use is limited to private property, are not always required to be registered.|$|R
50|$|Mainly {{because the}} country already has a wide network of double carriageways, the {{standards}} for motorways in comparison are very high. Each direction has at least 3 lanes, aside from the İzmit Bypass and a small stretch of the Otoyol 3 between Silivri and Esenyurt which only have 2. The lanes are each 3.75 meters wide. Most exits have a connection road, which helps avoiding wrong-way driving and illegal access to the <b>road</b> (bikes, <b>tractors</b> and horses are not allowed on otoyols).|$|R
50|$|Sark {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} places in the world where cars are banned from <b>roads</b> and only <b>tractors</b> and horse-drawn vehicles are allowed. In 2011, Sark was designated as a Dark Sky Community and the first Dark Sky Island in the world.|$|R
