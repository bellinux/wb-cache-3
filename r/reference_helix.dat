40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy {{is a powerful}} technique that reports structural and dynamic information {{over a wide range}} of biologically relevant timescales at atomic resolution. In this dissertation, a combination of NMR techniques, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, mutagenesis, and biological assays is implemented to characterize the structural and dynamic properties of the 12 nucleotide single stranded RNA (ssRNA) tail located in the Bacillus subtilis prequeuosine riboswitch aptamer. 13 C (R 1, R 2) spin relaxation and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are used in combination with MD studies to gain insights into fast (picosecond to nanosecond) and slow (up to millisecond) timescale motions. We find that the ssRNA, although highly flexible, adopts a structured, A-form-like conformation within the polyadenine tract. Additionally, the MD simulation shows a similar level of order within the polyadenine tract, {{with a high level of}} dynamics at the terminal ends. A domain elongation strategy is applied to decouple internal and overall motions in order to more quantitatively assess dynamics within the ssRNA. We find that the domain elongated ssRNA has similar structural and dynamic properties to the 12 nt ssRNA, and is on average coaxially stacked with respect to the <b>reference</b> <b>helix.</b> We previously identified an A to C mutation in the middle of the polyadenine tract, which was found to destabilize the structural stability of the ssRNA. We hypothesized that ordering of the ssRNA was important for efficient riboswitch function, and that by destabilizing the ssRNA the ability of the prequeuosine riboswitch to terminate transcription efficiently may be reduced. An in vitro transcription assay is developed to address the role of the mutation in proper riboswitch functioning, and finds that the mutation impacts the time-sensitive functioning of the riboswitch. Overall, this dissertation establishes that ssRNA is capable of forming structured and helical regions, and that ssRNA structure plays an important role in the kinetics of riboswitch function. Further, this dissertation lays out a general approach for assessing the structural and dynamic characteristics of other biologically relevant ssRNA systems...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new experimental approach where the active site of oligosaccharyl transferase {{is used as a}} point of reference against which the position of a transmembrane segment in the membrane can be measured. This so-called glycosylation mapping technique allows any transmembrane segment to be positioned relative to a known <b>reference</b> transmembrane <b>helix</b> with known position in the membrane. We have studied the position of transmembrane polypeptides in the ER membrane and determined the effects of single proline and charged residues on the position of a transmembrane helix in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane using the glycosylation mapping technique. We have found that proline residues can break a transmembrane helix when inserted {{near the end of the}} helix, but not when placed more centrally and only when the helix is sufficiently long. Compared to the helix-disrupting effects seen with proline residues, the charged amino acid residues cause less drastic changes. We suggest that charged residues do not break the helical conformation but just affect the position of the helix in the membrane. The difference between the effects of positively and negatively charged residues can be explained by the so-called snorkel effect, i. e. that the very long side-chains of Arg and Lys can reach up along the transmembrane helix to allow the terminal charged moiety to reside in the lipid head group region. Our results from a turn propensity investigation suggest that in a very long transmembrane helix, twice as long as a normal helix, a single proline residue introduced near the center of the helix can induce the formation of two transmembrane segments separated by a tight turn. The glycosylation mapping technique may be generally useful for determining the position of transmembrane helices in the membrane and the ends of different transmembrane segments...|$|R
40|$|RNAs fold into three- {{dimensional}} (3 D) {{structures that}} subsequently undergo large, functionally important, conformational transitions {{in response to}} a variety of cellular signals(1 - 3). RNA structures are believed to encode spatially tuned flexibility that can direct transitions along specific conformational pathways(4, 5). However, this hypothesis has proved difficult to examine directly because atomic movements in complex biomolecules cannot be visualized in 3 D by using current experimental methods. Here we report the successful implementation of a strategy using NMR that has allowed us to visualize, with complete 3 D rotational sensitivity, the dynamics between two RNA helices that are linked by a functionally important trinucleotide bulge over timescales extending up to milliseconds. The key to our approach is to anchor NMR frames of <b>reference</b> onto each <b>helix</b> and thereby directly measure their dynamics, one relative to the other, using 'relativistic' sets of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) (6, 7). Using this approach, we uncovered super- large amplitude helix motions that trace out a surprisingly structured and spatially correlated 3 D dynamic trajectory. The two helices twist around their individual axes by approximately 536 and 1106 in a highly correlated manner (R = 0. 97) while simultaneously (R = 0. 81 - 0. 92) bending by about 94 degrees. Remarkably, the 3 D dynamic trajectory is dotted at various positions by seven distinct ligand- bound conformations of the RNA. Thus even partly unstructured RNAs can undergo structured dynamics that directs ligand- induced transitions along specific predefined conformational pathways...|$|R
40|$|Statement of {{the problem}} We {{want to be able}} to move a helix and its {{covariance}} matrix from one reference point to another in a solenoidal magnetic field. Since this problem comes up frequently during Kalman tracking fitting, I thought it would be useful to provide a reference with the necessary formulas. Some of the discussion here was first presented in CBX 92 – 45, but there are enough new formulas to warrant a new note. II Representation of helix A helix is described by 5 parameters: (c, φ 0, d 0,cot θ, z 0), described as follows: 1. c is called the curvature of the track, defined as 1 / 2 R, where R is the radius of curvature 2. φ 0 is the phi angle of momentum relative to the x axis at the PCA to the reference point 3. d 0 is the signed DCA to the reference point (measured in the bend (xy) plane) 4. cotθ is the cotangent of the “dip angle ” θ 5. z 0 is the z position at the distance of closest approach to the <b>reference</b> point. The <b>helix</b> is defined relative to a “reference point ” (xr, yr, zr). In CLEO, this point has typically been taken to be at the origin, but it is very useful to make it arbitrary, particularly when doing Kalman track fitting. The equations of motion are best parameterized as a function of the arc length s ⊥ measured from the PCA to the reference point in the bend plane: sinφ 0 cosφ 0 x = xr + x 0 + sin ρ⊥s⊥ − 11 −cos ρ⊥s⊥ 6 ρ⊥ ρ⊥ cosφ 0 sinφ 0 y = yr + y 0 + sin ρ⊥s⊥+ 11 −cos ρ⊥s⊥ 6 ρ⊥ ρ⊥ z = zr + z 0 + s⊥cotθ (1) px = px 0 cos ρ⊥s⊥− py 0 sinρ⊥s⊥ py = px 0 sin ρ⊥s⊥+ py 0 cos ρ⊥s⊥ p = p z z 0 where ρ ⊥ = 2 c = a / p⊥, a=− 0. 299792458 Bq, B is the magnetic field strength in Tesla, and q is the charge.
