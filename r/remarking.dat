5|$|Cooper's {{early years}} in the {{entertainment}} industry were marred with difficulties. When his role in the second season of Alias was demoted to a minuscule part, he considered quitting show business. His substance addiction, and doubts about his career, triggered thoughts of suicide. Cooper has abstained from alcohol since 2004, <b>remarking</b> that it would have destroyed his life.|$|E
5|$|Hardy cites Ramanujan as <b>remarking</b> {{that all}} {{religions}} seemed equally true to him. Hardy further argued that Ramanujan's religious belief had been romanticised by Westerners and overstated—in {{reference to his}} belief, not practice—by Indian biographers. At the same time, he remarked on Ramanujan's strict vegetarianism.|$|E
5|$|Tregelles {{explained}} {{the origin of}} the Arabic inscription, on which Cyril's statement appears to rest, by <b>remarking</b> that the text of the New Testament in the manuscript begins with Matthew 25:6, this lesson (Matthew 25:1-13) being that appointed by the Greek Church for the festival of St. Thecla.|$|E
30|$|By using <b>Remark</b> 2.12 and <b>Remark</b> 2.13, we can verify <b>Remark</b> 3.3 and <b>Remark</b> 3.4, respectively, by {{the same}} {{procedure}} as we used for verification of <b>Remark</b> 3.2.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} <b>remarks</b> {{related to}} the symptom attribute (40 <b>remarks)</b> in the questionnaire were categorized: no evaluation criteria are given (5 <b>remarks),</b> need for benchmark (6 <b>remarks),</b> difficulty choosing only one response (4 <b>remarks),</b> distinction between response options is ambiguous (7 <b>remarks),</b> response options are inadequate (6 <b>remarks),</b> questions and response options need to be reformed (7 <b>remarks),</b> and inconsistency between questions and response options (4 <b>remarks),</b> and other (1 <b>remarks).</b> The following <b>remarks</b> related to ease of memory retrieval and judgment (26 <b>remarks)</b> were categorized: some symptoms are hard to notice (6 <b>remarks),</b> need for exemplars of symptoms (10 <b>remarks),</b> significance of the question should be clarified (3 <b>remarks),</b> problems interpreting “interference with daily activities” (4 <b>remarks),</b> and problems apprehending the severity of symptoms at their worst (3 <b>remarks).</b> Other <b>remarks</b> on the questionnaire include the phrase “in the last 7  days,” which complicated questions (5 <b>remarks).</b> Participants with constant subjective symptoms in particular seemed to find it challenging to confine the interpretation of their symptom experience to only the severity or interference experienced “in the last 7  days.” Regarding the two alternative wordings of “its worst,” the responses were varied among responders and symptoms. Following agreement on changes among the project team, ultimately we kept the initial wording, which is the objective term discussed above, in the final version.|$|R
30|$|Analyzing the 94 {{narrative}} comments {{provided on}} the items across the debriefing interviews, 11 <b>remarks</b> concerned comprehension difficulties, 13 <b>remarks</b> concerned clarity, 25 <b>remarks</b> concerned knowledge and recall (ease of memory retrieval), and 45 <b>remarks</b> concerned ease of judgment or spontaneous comments. These <b>remarks</b> thus applied to 52 {{out of the}} 123 items, with 71 items not <b>remarked</b> on. Patients {{found it difficult to}} interpret some symptoms, such as “body odor” (5 <b>remarks)</b> or “problems with memory” (2 <b>remarks),</b> because their effects are relatively subjective. Determining the severity of persistent symptoms such as “anxiety” (4 <b>remarks)</b> or “leg/arm swelling” (1 <b>remark)</b> was also problematic for small numbers of participants. Problems determining whether something like “aching joints” included symptoms such as stiff shoulders or aching muscles were reported by five patients.|$|R
5|$|Allingham {{was awarded}} the freedom of his home town of Eastbourne by the mayor on 21 April 2006. He lived on his own until May 2006 when, one month before his 110th {{birthday}} and with failing eyesight, he moved to St Dunstan's, a charity for blind ex-service personnel, at Ovingdean, near Brighton. Aside from his poor eyesight, he was reportedly in good health, with visitors <b>remarking</b> on his memory and voice.|$|E
5|$|As {{they read}} the end, Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake, still waiting for God to save her (the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom). Shocked, Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death. Marge then interrupts, {{claiming}} that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot, and they get married and live in a spaceship. She then rips out the last page and eats it, <b>remarking</b> that {{it is easier to}} chew than the video of Bambi.|$|E
5|$|Critics such as James Berardinelli praised Connery's performance, the femme fatale {{character}} of Fiona Volpe, and the underwater action sequences, <b>remarking</b> {{that they were}} well choreographed and clearly shot. He criticised {{the length of the}} scenes, however, stating they were in need of editing, particularly during the film's climax. At Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an 86% rating. In 2014 Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors, and stunt actors to list their top action films; Thunderball was listed at number 73.|$|E
30|$|We {{conducted}} a qualitative-descriptive analysis using semi-structured cognitive interviews. The interviews were transcribed word-for-word, examined repeatedly, and categorized. <b>Remarks</b> were {{split into two}} categories: 1) <b>remarks</b> on the items and 2) <b>remarks</b> on the questionnaire in general. The <b>remarks</b> on the items were further categorized into those concerning 1) comprehension difficulties, 2) clarity, 3) knowledge and recall (ease of memory retrieval), and 4) ease of judgment and other spontaneous comments. The <b>remarks</b> on the questionnaire were also further categorized into those concerning 1) attributes, 2) ease of memory retrieval and judgment, 3) other <b>remarks</b> on the questionnaire, and 4) other <b>remarks</b> in general. As a single patient could make several <b>remarks,</b> {{the total number of}} <b>remarks</b> does not reflect the number of patients. We performed descriptive statistics to summarize the variables for the cognitive interviews.|$|R

5|$|In 1960, having {{reached the}} University of Toronto's {{compulsory}} retirement age, Farquharson left {{the university and}} the hospital. In recognition of his work for Toronto General Hospital, the twelve-bed Clinical Investigation Unit was named after him in 1961, and the Farquharson Foundation was established to support research conducted by the university's teaching hospitals. Also in 1961, Farquharson visited India, later <b>remarking</b> on the societal respect for doctors there. He also continued to advocate for support for universities.|$|E
5|$|John {{initially}} attended local schools. When he was aged 10, {{his family}} scraped together {{the money to}} send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, <b>remarking</b> to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{addresses}} {{magic in}} Book XXX. He {{is critical of}} the Magi, attacking astrology, and suggesting that magic originated in medicine, creeping in by pretending to offer health. He names Zoroaster of Ancient Persia {{as the source of}} magical ideas. He states that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, <b>remarking</b> that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously {{at the time of the}} Peloponnesian War.|$|E
50|$|The <b>remarks</b> {{were later}} {{included}} in full in {{an anthology of}} Wittgenstein's miscellaneous work called Philosophical Occasions 1912-1951. The editors claim that Rush Rhees omitted a number of <b>remarks</b> from the bilingual book edition of the <b>Remarks,</b> and include in their anthology some <b>remarks</b> they believe Rhees may have erroneously excluded.|$|R

5|$|Sarah, however, did {{not like}} being away from England, and often complained that they were {{received}} with full honours in Europe, but were in disgrace at home. Sarah found life travelling the royal courts difficult, <b>remarking</b> that they were full of dull company. She took the waters at Aachen in Germany on account of her ill health, corresponded with those in England who could supply her with political gossip, and indulged in her fascination with Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn {{version of}} Silver Star Story was well {{received}} in Japan, with Weekly Sega Saturn Magazine recognizing {{it as one}} of the most memorable gaming experiences of 1997. The PlayStation version received a 7 out of 10 score from Hyper PlayStation magazine, <b>remarking</b> that although it contained lower quality visual effects and movie playback than the previous Saturn releases, it still remained a solid role-playing game. It sold enough to qualify for Sony's PlayStation the Best distinction, and was subsequently re-released in Japan in April 1999 at a budget price.|$|E
5|$|The film {{compares the}} rise of the {{neoconservative}} movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and <b>remarking</b> on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E

5|$|The {{second edition}} {{contains}} many {{changes to the}} text. A whole chapter on a dispute between doctors was completely removed, along with various sections of dialogue and praise of the Glastonbury Waters. The edition also contains many new passages, such as an addition of {{a scene in which}} a doctor repairs Amelia's nose and Booth <b>remarking</b> on the surgery (in Book II, Chapter 1, where Booth is talking to Miss Matthews).|$|E
5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco <b>remarking</b> that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
5|$|C.mutica {{populations in}} Europe were first {{found in the}} Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several {{specimens}} of an unknown caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures {{in and around the}} Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier in Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C.mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a new species. <b>Remarking</b> upon the resemblance of the caprellids to C.acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later discovered to be introduced populations of C.mutica rather than a new species.|$|E

5|$|In {{animated}} {{versions of}} Naruto, Sakura was voiced by Chie Nakamura. Early {{in the first}} series, the actors were told by Kishimoto that Sakura would end marrying Sasuke. However, most of them ended up having doubts as during the first anime Sasuke abandoned his teammates. As a result, by the second series, Nakamura was often asked by other people if her character would instead end with Naruto. When Sakura married Sasuke in the end, Nakamura was happy because Sakura stayed true to her feelings. In an interview, Kate Higgins, who does the voice acting for Sakura in the English dub, notes the development of Sakura in the series, <b>remarking</b> that she becomes a more complex character as she becomes more sensitive and caring.|$|E
5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, <b>remarking</b> on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} first year, {{with an initial}} target of 300,000visitors surpassed after six months, with over 100,000visitors {{in the first six}} weeks; by the museum's first anniversary on 5 July 2003 some 470,000visitors had been received. The museum won the Building Award in the 2003 British Construction Industry Awards, and was shortlisted for the 2004 Stirling Prize. The museum received a largely positive critical reception, with reviewers <b>remarking</b> on the metaphorical power of the building, the complementary effects of the museum's main exhibition with its internal architecture, and the economy with which the museum was built. In August 2005 Imperial War Museum North received its millionth visitor. The museum was, however, criticised in 2008 by The Guardian for poor energy efficiency, as part of a report into the carbon dioxide emissions of UK public buildings.|$|E

5000|$|With 20% {{women the}} gender ratio is 1:4. So there are 4 {{times as many}} men to make sexist <b>remarks,</b> so 4 times as many sexist <b>remarks</b> are made to women as to men. But there are 4 times fewer women to receive sexist <b>remarks,</b> so each {{individual}} woman is four {{times as likely to}} receive a given <b>remark</b> than an individual man is. These effects multiply, so in this example the mean number of sexist <b>remarks</b> per woman is 16 times the number per man.
