He found employment with the Standard Printing Company, and was a <b>regular</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> their Saturday newspaper, the Weekly Standard.

He recorded a small number of songs using a phonograph but the vast majority were recorded by hand. He was a <b>regular</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the Folk Song Society's Journal, a member of the society's committee from 1904 to 1946, and when in that year the society amalgamated with the English Folk Dance Society he became president of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, a position he held until his death.|$|E
