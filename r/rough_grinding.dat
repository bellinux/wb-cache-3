50|$|The {{process is}} {{intended}} to replace or limit traditional grinding operations. Hard turning, when applied for purely stock removal purposes, competes favorably with <b>rough</b> <b>grinding.</b> However, when it is applied for finishing where form and dimension are critical, grinding is superior. Grinding produces higher dimensional accuracy of roundness and cylindricity. In addition, polished surface finishes of Rz=0.3-0.8z cannot be achieved with hard turning alone. Hard turning is appropriate for parts requiring roundness accuracy of 0.5-12 micrometres, and/or surface roughness of Rz 0.8-7.0 micrometres. It is used for gears, injection pump components, hydraulic components, among other applications.|$|E
50|$|Abrasive {{machining}} {{works by}} forcing the abrasive particles, or grains, into {{the surface of}} the workpiece so that each particle cuts away a small bit of material. Abrasive machining is similar to conventional machining, such as milling or turning, because each of the abrasive particles acts like a miniature cutting tool. However, unlike conventional machining the grains are much smaller than a cutting tool, and the geometry and orientation of individual grains are not well defined. As a result, abrasive machining is less power efficient and generates more heat.The grain size may be different based on the machining. For <b>rough</b> <b>grinding,</b> coarse abrasives are used. For fine grinding, fine grains (abrasives) are used.|$|E

50|$|Quenching: A paste {{is applied}} to the blade using water, charcoal, clay, ground natural {{sharpening}} stone, and other ingredients in a proprietary way and composition. This thicker paste goes on the blade spine on both sides and traditionally mimics the wavy hamon of nihonto. A thinner slip goes on the hard edge to help heat transfer there. It then must dry in air or over heat. The quench water or oil is prepared and brought to the right temperature. The forge is heated. Lights are turned off and the room shut from the outside. Once ready, the blade is buried and shuffled around in the charcoal and when it reaches the correct temperature it is thrust into water and moved forward and back (so as to prevent lateral distortion) and then after a couple seconds side to side. The knife could also be brought up slightly above temperature and then held in the room to the correct temperature before quench. The quench could be interrupted toward the end for more <b>rough</b> <b>grinding</b> or to correct distortion. The blade is tempered either immediately over fire, or in oil, or in an oven.

Conventional cutting fluid application fails to penetrate the chip-tool interface and thus cannot remove heat effectively.

40|$|An {{advanced}} {{system was}} developed for the intelligent, self-optimising computer numerically controlled grinding of compliant, thin walled cylinders. A study was made of previous developments in the adaptive control of grinding processes. Requirements imposed {{on the design of}} computer control systems by the implementation of adaptive control techniques were considered. A manually controlled centreless grinding machine was automated and the mechanical capabilities of the machine were extended so that productivity was limited by process rather than machine constraints. In-process measurement was implemented to allow a control system to account for variations in process conditions. Experimental work performed with highly compliant workpieces exposed problems of process control that were accounted for by machine cycle design and process optimisation. It was considered that the improvements in productivity achieved by maximising material removal rates were limited for highly compliant workpieces. Therefore, a requirement for improving productivity through the design of appropriate machine cycles was identified. The design of a novel machine cycle eliminated the need for separate <b>rough</b> and finish <b>grinding</b> operations whilst allowing the control system to compensate for the high level of system compliance that was experienced. The benefits and disadvantages of the new machine cycle design were revealed by comparing the performance of the automated machine with that of manually operated machine tools.

40|$|Diamond {{coatings}} {{on cutting}} tools provide {{the advantages of}} the properties of diamond in terms of high hardness, excellent wear resistance, and general chemical inertness. The main limitations of diamond coating are coating adhesion problems, high surface roughness and low production rate due to the use of coating equipment with small chamber. There is also a need to have a better understanding on the growth mechanism of diamond coatings on tungsten carbide with cobalt binder (WC-Co). Thus the motivation for this work is to obtain low surface roughness of diamond coatings while achieving good adhesion to substrates through the use of large chamber hot filament chemical vapour deposition (HFCVD) method. In this research, nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) coatings were deposited on WC-Co substrates using the HFCVD method. WC-Co was selected because it is used widely in the current tooling market. The cutting method was varied between precision cutting and electrical discharge machining EDM (Wire-Cut). It was found that precision cutting produce generally planar substrates and was the preferred method of cutting. To achieve good adhesion between the diamond coating and WC-Co substrates, the WC-Co substrates were pretreated before being deposited with diamond and some of these pretreatments parameters were varied. It was found that 20 minutes of Murakami agent treatment, 4560 seconds of acid etching and < 0. 25 ^m natural diamond seeding in ultrasonic bath were the best pretreatment method. The substrates were then deposited with diamond in the HFCVD chamber. Four batches of deposition were ran namely batch A, B, C and D. The overall results show that the deposited diamonds were nanocrystalline in size with cauliflower or ballas NCD morphology with various crystallite arrangements. Batch A produced generally four different types of morphologies. Type 1 was planar diamond coating morphology attributed to precision cutting effects. Type 2 was planar diamond coating morphology with micro features attributed to <b>rough</b> bench <b>grinding.</b> Type 4 was the extension of type 3 where EDM cut produced about a third tier morphology separating islands of diamond ballas aggregates. Three-tier ballas morphology improves the adhesion property where boundaries hinder failure path of the diamond coating. Batch B produced an obvious microcrystalline diamond layer under the NCD layer. Batch C produced a single layer of very thin NCD layer of only 1. 7 microns. Batch D produced a layer NCD coating of about 4 microns thick by changing oxygen pulsing rate and time. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing XRD showed that the diamond layer was in compression. Raman Spectrometer identified the presence of NCD. Atomic force microscope (AFM) showed the ultra-low roughness of the diamond coatings with < 200 nm. Nanoindentation revealed that the NCD coating has high hardness of 10 - 60 GPa and reduced modulus of 40 - 300 GPa. The adhesion strength is good as indicated from the indentation test. Electron microscopy results showed the ballas consist of elongated radial grains in accordance to the thickness of the NCD coating. Further magnifications revealed diamond twins that contributed to the properties and nano size of diamond crystallites. Transmission electron microscopy analyses also indicate that the NCD nucleated and grew on the tungsten carbide (100) planes in the (1 1 1) direction, forming (111) planes...|$|R

Lubbock's well-known terms, a paleolithic and neolithic period; and no one will pretend that the art of <b>grinding</b> <b>rough</b> flint tools was a borrowed one. In all parts of Europe, as far east as Greece, in Palestine, India, Japan, New Zealand, and Africa, including Egypt, flint tools have been discovered in abundance; and of their use the existing inhabitants retain no tradition. There is also indirect evidence of their former use by the Chinese and ancient Jews. Hence there can hardly be a doubt that the inhabitants of these countries, which include nearly the whole civilised world, were once in a barbarous condition. To believe that man was aboriginally civilised and then suffered utter degradation in so many regions, is to take a pitiably low view of human nature. It is apparently a truer and more cheerful view that progress has been much more general than retrogression; that man has risen, though by slow and interrupted steps, from a lowly condition to the highest standard as yet attained by him in knowledge, morals and religion.|$|R
