It appeared along with the slogan [...] "support our troops", {{in the form of}} yellow ribbons tied to trees, and countless other contexts. It often had the implied meaning of [...] "bring our troops home" [...] from the Desert Shield and Desert Storm troop deployments. It appeared again during the 2003 invasion of Iraq with similar meanings, most prominently {{in the form of a}} yellow ribbon printed on magnetized material and displayed on the outside of automobiles.|$|E

5000|$|Helictites are, perhaps, {{the most}} {{delicate}} of cave formations. They are usually made of needle-form calcite and aragonite. Helictite forms have been described in several types: <b>ribbon</b> helictites, <b>saws,</b> rods, butterflies, [...] "hands", curly-fries, and [...] "clumps of worms". They typically have radial symmetry. They can be easily crushed or broken by the slightest touch. Because of this, helictites are rarely seen within arm's reach in tourist caves.|$|R

50|$|The {{existing}} {{village of}} Kelvedon {{has been a}} settlement since the Early Middle Ages, though it stands near (and partly on) {{the site of a}} Roman settlement, probably Canonium. Kelvedon expanded significantly in the Victorian era. The reason was the Norwich to London railway making it a place to live yet get to work as rail was the only fast method of transport. Victorian Kelvedon was set along one street, High Street. In the 1930s, {{with the advent of the}} automobile, High Street became the A12, the main road through Essex. <b>Ribbon</b> development <b>saw</b> houses sprawl along the road for miles. The village suffered major congestion until a bypass was built in the 1960s. Suburbanization started to take place in the 1980s - a large development called Riverside Park was constructed containing hundreds of homes.|$|R
5000|$|Dupin says he {{had visited}} the {{minister}} at his hotel. Complaining of weak eyes he wore a pair of green spectacles, the true purpose of which was to disguise {{his eyes as he}} searched for the letter. In a cheap card rack hanging from a dirty <b>ribbon,</b> he <b>saw</b> a half-torn letter and recognized it as the letter of the story's title. Striking up a conversation with D— about a subject in which the minister is interested, Dupin examined the letter more closely. It did not resemble the letter the Prefect described so minutely; the writing was different and it was sealed not with the [...] "ducal arms" [...] of the S— family, but with D—'s monogram. Dupin noticed that the paper was chafed as if the stiff paper was first rolled one way and then another. Dupin concluded that D— wrote a new address on the reverse of the stolen one, re-folded it the opposite way and sealed it with his own seal.|$|R
