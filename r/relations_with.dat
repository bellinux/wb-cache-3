40|$|The {{relationship}} between emotional cognitive adjustment and {{perceived social support}} and determining the share of {{each one of these}} variable in quality of life for disabled athletes is an important factor to know. We selected 100 people among disabled athletes through convenience sampling and were asked to fill emotional cognitive adjustment strategies scale questionnaire, perceived social support questionnaire and quality of life scale. Results revealed that social support parameters have significant <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> parameters required for quality of life. Similarly, all the parameters regarding emotional cognitive adjustments (except perspective taking) revealed positive and significant <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> all parameters of quality of life (including physical, psychological, interpersonal relation and environment). However, the perspective taking parameter has only positive and significant <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> psychological dimension of quality of life, and it has no significant <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> other dimensions. Meanwhile, negative parameters of emotional cognitive adjustment, self-blaming and catastrophic thinking has no significant <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> any parameters of quality of life. Rumination has only negative significant <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> interpersonal <b>relation</b> dimension of quality of life and blaming others parameter had negative and significant <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> the environment.
