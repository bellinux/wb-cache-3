Until now, the reproducibility of these parameters has not been investigated. Methods Twenty healthy volunteers underwent HRM on two separate days. Standard HRM parameters were measured. In addition, in conventional (virtual) line tracings, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) resting pressure, <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure,</b> and relative <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> were measured. Firstly, for each variable, the mean percentage of covariation (100 x SD/mean: %COV) was derived as a measure of inter-and intra-individual variation.

40|$|SUMMARY Pressure {{activity}} in the rectum and anal canal was measured with a multilumen probe in 29 patients with ulcerative colitis (12 active, 11 quiescent, six studied during both phases) and 18 normal controls under resting conditions and during rectal infusion of saline. Resting motor activity was significantly decreased in patients with active colitis compared with quiescent colitis (p< 0005) and normal controls (p< 0 - 001). Forty per cent of active colitics showed a featureless record compared with only one patient with quiescent colitis and one normal subject. The volume of saline infused before leakage occurred, and the total volume retained were significantly lower (p< 0 O 001) in patients with active and quiescent colitis compared with normal controls. Rectal infusion of saline provoked regular rectal contractions, of significantly higher (p< 005) amplitude in patients with active colitis, than in quiescent colitis or controls. These rectal contractions were associated with simultaneous anal relaxations. During saline infusion, peak anal pressures were lower in patients with ulcerative colitis than in normal subjects, {{but there were no}} significant differences in <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressures.</b> In normal subjects, the rectal pressures remained below the anal pressures throughout the saline infusion.

40|$|To {{compare the}} effects of the tongue-hold {{swallowing}} maneuver on pharyngeal pressure generation in healthy young and elderly research volunteers. Sixty-eight healthy research volunteers (young, n = 34, mean age = 26. 8 years, SD = 5. 5; elderly, n = 34, mean age = 72. 6 years, SD = 4. 8; sex equally represented) performed 5 noneffortful saliva swallows and 5 tongue-hold swallows each. Amplitude and duration of pharyngeal pressure were investigated during both swallowing conditions with solid-state pharyngeal manometry {{at the level of the}} oropharynx, hypopharynx, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES). At both pharyngeal levels, tongue-hold swallows produced lower peak pressure compared with saliva swallows. During tongue-hold swallows, UES <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> was increased in the elders, whereas the younger group displayed a trend toward reduced <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure.</b> Elderly individuals produced pressure longer during control swallows in the oropharynx and hypopharynx than young individuals. The tongue-hold maneuver affects oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal pressure in the young and elders in similar ways, whereas effects on UES peak <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> differ between age groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Esophageal {{peristalsis}} and basal gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) pressure correlate poorly with dysphagia. AIM: To determine intraluminal {{pressures that}} reflect GEJ function {{and to determine}} manometric correlates for dysphagia before and after fundoplication. METHODS: The relationships between maximal intrabolus pressure, residual GEJ <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> and peak peristaltic pressure for water swallows were determined in normal volunteers and patients with reflux disease before and after fundoplication. GEJ anatomy was assessed by radiological, endoscopic and surgical criteria, whilst dysphagia was measured with a validated composite dysphagia score. RESULTS: Dysphagia {{was significantly associated with}} lower peak peristaltic pressure in the distal esophagus and the presence of a hiatus hernia preoperatively, as well as higher residual pressure on GEJ relaxation postoperatively. Peak distal peristaltic pressure and residual GEJ <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> were predictors of intrabolus pressure after total fundoplication (p< 0. 002). Residual GEJ <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> was four times higher after 360 ° fundoplication (N= 19) compared to 90 ° fundoplication (N= 14, p< 0. 0001). Similarly, intrabolus pressure was elevated 2. 5 times after 360 ° fundoplication and nearly doubled after 90 ° fundoplication and both were significantly different from controls (N= 22) and reflux disease patients (N= 53, p< 0. 0001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: After Nissen fundoplication, {{troublesome}} dysphagia {{develops in}} 5 - 10 per cent of patients. The mechanism of dysphagia {{has not been}} fully resolved, {{in spite of a}} number of studies focusing on oesophageal motility and lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) dynamics. Tightness and length of the wrap have had considerable attention, without giving a fully satisfactory explanation of the pathophysiological mechanism. METHODS: Eighteen patients with persistent dysphagia after Nissen fundoplication needing reoperation were studied. Eighteen patients, matched for age and sex, without dysphagia after Nissen fundoplication were used as controls. Reoperation consisted of conversion of a 360 degrees into a 270 degrees wrap. Barium swallow, endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and 24 -h pH monitoring were performed before and after (re) operation. RESULTS: Peristaltic amplitude, velocity and duration of contraction were not significantly influenced by operation. In 16 of 18 patients with dysphagia, LOS relaxation was incomplete and the residual <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> was significantly higher than that in the group without dysphagia (P < 0. 01). No correlation was found between LOS pressure and peristaltic amplitude, nor between LOS pressure and ramp pressure in the distal oesophagus. After reoperation, basal LOS pressure decreased significantly (P < 0. 01) and LOS relaxation was complete in all but three patients; residual <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> decreased (P < 0. 01) and was significantly lower than that after uncomplicated Nissen fundoplication. In the latter group, LOS pressure, residual <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> and ramp pressure increased significantly after operation (P < 0. 01).

40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{functional}} knee brace on local intra-muscular pressures and on calculated blood perfusion pressure in the tibialis anterior muscle of the legs of six volunteers were determined. Torque generation during dorsiflexion of the ankle joint was measured with a Ki-netic Computerized ergometer, and the time to elicit muscle fatigue during exercise was recorded. For each experimental subject studies compared right with left unbraced legs, then right braced with left unbraced legs, and finally right unbraced with left braced legs. In the braced leg, intramuscular pressure at rest and muscle <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> during exercise were significantly higher, and the time to elicit muscle fatigue was 35 % shorter. The calculated local blood perfusion pressure was lower because of the increased muscle <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure.</b> We conclude that the increased muscle re-laxation pressure during exercise caused by a knee brace is a {{possible explanation for the}} premature development of muscle fatigue in the braced leg. All knee braces when applied must compress the soft tis-sues of the thigh and leg; however, {{little is known about the}} {{effects of a}} knee brace on the soft tissues and the neuro-muscular function in the leg.

This manometric study investigated the immediate effects of the tongue-hold maneuver on pharyngeal peak pressure generation, duration of pressure generation, and pressure slope measurements in healthy volunteers. METHOD: Pharyngeal pressures from 40 young, healthy individuals (mean age = 25. 8 years, gender equally distributed) were recorded at 3 locations: oropharynx, hypopharynx, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES), during normal control and tongue-hold swallows. Measures of peak amplitude, duration, and slope of pressure generation were subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Tongue-hold swallows produced lower pharyngeal peak pressure and shorter pharyngeal pressure durations compared to control swallows. Further, tongue-hold swallows produced lower UES <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressures.</b> Between sensors, peak pressure was lower and pressure slopes were steeper in the hypopharynx compared to the oropharynx. Several gender-specific differences were found for pharyngeal peak pressure, pressure duration, and pressure slopes.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{measurement}} of the physical extent of opening of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) during bolus swallowing has to date relied on videofluoroscopy. Theoretically luminal impedance measured during bolus flow should be influenced by luminal diameter. In this study we measured the UES nadir impedance (lowest value of impedance) during bolus swallowing and assessed it as a potential correlate of UES diameter that can be determined non-radiologically. METHODS: In 40 dysphagia patients, bolus swallowing of liquids, semisolids and solids was recorded with manometry, impedance and videofluoroscopy. During swallows, the UES opening diameter (in the lateral fluoroscopic view) was measured and compared to automated impedance manometry (AIM) derived swallow function variables and UES nadir impedance as well as high resolution manometry (HRM) derived UES <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> variables. RESULTS: Of all measured variables, UES nadir impedance was the most strongly correlated with UES opening diameter. Narrower diameter correlated with higher impedance (r = - 0. 478, p< 0. 001). Patients with < 10 mm, 10 - 14 mm (normal) and ≥ 15 mm UES diameter had average UES nadir impedances of 498 ± 39 ohms, 369 ± 31 ohms and 293 ± 17 ohms respectively (ANOVA p= 0. 005). A higher swallow risk index (SRI), indicative of poor pharyngeal swallow function, was associated with narrower UES diameter and higher UES nadir impedance during swallowing. In contrast, UES <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> variables were not significantly altered in relation to UES diameter. CONCLUSIONS: The UES nadir impedance correlates with opening diameter of the UES during bolus flow. This variable, when combined with other pharyngeal AIM analysis variables, may allow characterisation pathophysiology of swallowing dysfunction. status: publishe...|$|E

Nonparametric testing {{was used to assess}} differences among groups of treated patients (10 had type 1 achalasia and 15 had type 2 achalasia), and the Pearson correlation was used to assess their relationship. There {{were no significant differences in}} TBE measurements between patient groups. Of the 25 patients who received treatment, 10 had a manometric pattern consistent with persistent achalasia after treatment (6 patients with type 1 and 4 patients with type 2 achalasia), whereas 15 appeared to have resolved the achalasia pattern (peristalsis was absent in 8 patients and weak in 7 patients). The height of the barium column at 5 minutes and Eckardt Scores were reduced significantly in patients who had resolved their achalasia pattern, based on HRM. The integrated <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> and the TBE column height correlated at 5 minutes (r = 0. 422; P <. 05). Patients who resolved their achalasia pattern, based on HRM, showed improved emptying based on TBE measurements and improved symptom scores. There was no significant difference between patients with type 1 or type 2 achalasia in TBEs. These findings indicate that normalization of the integrated <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> on HRM is a clinically relevant objective of treatment for achalasi...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of swallowing-triggered neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the submental musculature on pharyngeal pressure generation in healthy research participants during stimulation and up to 60 min thereafter. Methods: Twenty healthy research participants [mean age = 23. 7 years (SD = 3. 8), 10 females] performed 60 noneffortful saliva swallows at a rate of approximately one every 30 s. Each swallow triggered a 4 -s block of submental NMES, which consisted of 200 -ls 2 stimuli applied at a rate of 80 Hz and an intensity of 75 % of the individual’s pain threshold utilising a treatment protocol identified to increase motor evoked potentials to the submental muscle group (Doeltgen et al., in review). Pharyngeal pressures during both non-effortful and effortful saliva swallows were measured at baseline, during stimulation and at 5, 30, and 60 min post-stimulation in the oropharynx, hypopharynx and, upper esophageal sphincter (UES). Results: Effortful swallows produced greater pharyngeal pressure (p = 0. 001), and lower UES <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> (p = 0. 021), than noneffortful swallows. Pharyngeal and UES pressures during stimulated and nonstimulated noneffortful swallows did not differ (p[0. 05). At 30 and 60 min post stimulation, noneffortful swallows were completed with lower pressures at all sensors (p = 0. 025), whereas effortful swallows were not affected by stimulation (p[0. 05). Conclusion: Swallowing-triggered submental NMES has no immediate effects on pharyngeal pressure generation, whereas at 30 and 60 min post stimulation, decreased pressure in the oro- and hypopharynx poses a potential risk for compromising airway protection and bolus flow. Decreased UES <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> may facilitate bolus transit at this level of the pharynx. Doeltgen, Sebastian, Heck, F. and Huckabee, M. L...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pneumatic {{dilation}} of {{the lower}} esophageal sphincter (LES) in achalasia has an unappreciated effect on upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function. We studied UES pressure patterns at baseline and alterations in UES parameters resulting from therapy. Methods: High-resolution manometry (HRM) tracings from 50 achalasia patients, seen at a tertiary center between January 2009 and July 2011, were reviewed. Manometric parameters studied were (i) LES: resting pressure (restP), 4 -second integrated <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> (IRP 4); (ii) UES: resting pressure (restP), minimal <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressure</b> (MRP), peak pressure (PP), relaxation interval (RI), intrabolus pressure (IBP), and deglutitive sphincter resistance (DSR). Mixed models analyses with LES and UES parameters as dependent variables and treatment stage as within-subject independent variable of interest were used. Correlations between treatment-induced changes in LES, UES, and esophageal body (EB) parameters were performed. Key Results: Pre- and posttreatment HRM tracings were available from 50 patients (mean age 52. 7 ± 18. 6 years, 29 men). Upper esophageal sphincter parameters MRP (17. 9 ± 1. 2 vs 15. 2 ± 0. 9 mmHg; p = 0. 02) and IBP (31. 5 ± 1. 5 vs 27. 4 ± 1. 2 mmHg; p = 0. 009) were significantly reduced after initial balloon dilation and this effect was significant in type II achalasia (p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 0006). Peak pressure, RI, and DSR were not. The therapeutic effect on LES IRP 4 correlated significantly with the change in UES MRP, statistically mediated by the change in EB deglutitive pressure (p = 0. 004 and p = 0. 0002). Conclusions & Inferences: We present the first HRM study demonstrating that pneumatic dilation of the LES affects intraesophageal and UES pressures in patients with achalasia. L. Wauters, L.

40|$|Background—Despite {{improving}} arterial {{oxygen saturation}} and pH, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions plus rescue breathing (CCRB) has not improved survival from ventricular fibrillation (VF) compared with chest compressions alone (CC) in numerous animal models and 2 clinical investigations. Methods and Results—After 3 minutes of untreated VF, 14 swine (321 kg) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive CCRB or CC for 12 minutes, followed by advanced cardiac life support. All 14 animals survived 24 hours, 13 with good neurological outcome. For the CCRB group, the aortic <b>relaxation</b> <b>pressures</b> routinely decreased during the 2 rescue breaths. Therefore, the mean coronary perfusion pressure of the first 2 compressions in each compression cycle was lower than those of the final 2 compressions (141 versus 212 mm Hg, P 0. 001). During each minute of CPR, the number of chest compressions was also lower in the CCRB group (621 versus 921 compressions, P 0. 001). Consequently, the integrated coronary perfusion pressure was lower with CCRB during each minute of CPR (P 0. 05 for the first 8 minutes). Moreover, at 2 to 5 minutes of CPR, the median left ventricular blood flow by fluorescent microsphere technique was 60 mL · 100 g 1 · min 1 with CCRB versus 96 mL · 100 g 1 · min 1 with CC, P 0. 05. Because the {{arterial oxygen saturation}} was higher with CCRB, the left ventricular myocardial oxygen delivery did not differ. Conclusions—Interrupting chest compressions for rescue breathing can adversely affect hemodynamics during CPR fo...|$|R
