To investigate the possibility of applying <b>rice</b> SSR <b>markers</b> in bamboo, we selected 120 <b>rice</b> SSR <b>markers</b> that are evenly distributed on rice chromosomes and assessed these for their transferability to 21 different bamboo species. A total of 4847 bands of 2196 alleles were obtained from 82 SSR markers that were able to amplify products in the bamboo genome; the transferability was 68. 3 %.

The key factors for enhancing successful regeneration are genotypes, tissue source of explants, combination and concentration of growth regulators, and culture conditions. In the present study different methods of regeneration were tested {{in a set of}} 12 rice accession representing indica, japonica, aromatic and wild groups. The highest frequency of shoot regeneration was achieved using mesocotyls derived from in vitro grown seeds cultured on Murashige and Skoogs, basal medium without growth regulators, when cultured on medium supplemented with Benzyl Adenine (BA) 0. 5 mg/l under subdued light at 25 °C ± 2 °C. Under these conditions mesocotyls (Plurality of meristems) produced 3 to 4 tiller shoots in primary culture. One seed/One single mesocotyls segment produced over 5 to 9 shoots, arising primarily through direct organogenesis after 3 weeks of culture. Through callusing phase different rice cultivars produced different percentage of callusing however Basmati 370 gave high percentage in response to callussing, organogenesis and root formation. In between these two methods, the direct shoot regeneration gave 80 % - 100 % result besides the wild species in respect with their genotype whereas the indirect organogenesis gave only 10 % - 30 % of plantlets. So the direct multiplication from mesocotyls is an efficient method for plantlet regen eration of rice cultivars through in vitro culture.

In this study, we performed a genome-wide search of ILPs between two subspecies (indica and japonica) in rice using the draft genomic sequences of cultivars 93 - 11 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica) and 32 127 full-length cDNA sequences of Nipponbare obtained from public databases. We identified 13 308 putative ILPs. Based on these putative ILPs, we developed 5811 candidate ILP markers via electronic-PCR with primers designed in flanking exons. We further conducted experiment to verify the candidate ILP markers. Out of 215 candidate ILP markers tested on 93 - 11, Nipponbare and their hybrid, we successfully exploited 173 codominant ILP markers. Further analyses on 10 rice accessions showed that these ILP markers were widely applicable and most (71. 1 %) exhibited subspecies specificity. This feature suggests that ILPs would be useful for the studies of genome evolution and inter-subspecies heterosis and for cross-subspecies marker-assisted selection in rice.
