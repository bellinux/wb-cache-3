40|$|PURPOSE: The {{brachial plexus}} block through the humeral canal as {{described}} by Dupré is indicated in hand and forearm surgery. This block requires a multi-stimulation technique that emphasizes {{the necessity of a}} rigorous and safe technique. Nerve injury associated with regional anesthesia can entail significant morbidity for patients. Thus, we investigated the brachial block sequence in terms of unintended nerve stimulation as a surrogate of potential nerve injury. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly allocated in two groups of 30. In Group I the radial nerve was blocked before the ulnar nerve. In Group II the ulnar nerve was blocked before the radial nerve. During the radial nerve approach we recorded, if present, an ulnar nerve response. During the ulnar nerve approach we recorded, if present, a radial nerve response. RESULTS: In Group I while looking for the radial nerve, in 50 % of the cases, an ulnar motor response was recorded. In Group II while looking for the ulnar nerve, a <b>radial</b> <b>motor</b> response was recorded in 10 % of the cases. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the radial nerve should be blocked before the ulnar nerve when performing a brachial plexus block at the humeral canal.

40|$|In {{the period}} {{before the start}} of the space program, the {{division}} to which I was assigned was called the Flight Research Division. As described in reference 1. 1, most of the research work was conducted on full-scale airplanes. Some simulation studies were made, however, using special simulators designed to study specific problems. These simulators included a device called the yaw chair, that enabled a study of the ability of a human pilot to control lateral oscillations over a wide range of oscillation periods with both stable and unstable damping. In addition, a device called the NAP (Normal Oscillation and Pitch) chair was built that simulated the vertical and pitching motion of an airplane over a range of vertical motion of about 6 feet. These simulators allowed covering a range of conditions systematically, rather than obtaining different conditions by considering results on a number of different airplanes. At the time the space program started, a three-axis rotational simulator was under construction in which a cockpit was mounted to provide angular motion in pitch, roll, and yaw. This simulator was intended to study combined rolling and yawing oscillations of an airplane, but it found use for other purposes during the space program. In contrast with modern simulators that use electronic displays and general-purpose motion bases, these simulators used mechanical systems to simulate accurately the motion of the vehicle. The output of the mechanical system was amplified by a hydraulic servomechanism based on a variable displacement hydraulic pump. Servomechanisms of this type were available in Naval gun turrets. I have since learned that the development of these servomechanisms was largely attributed to Charles Manley, the same man who earlier perfected the excellent <b>radial</b> <b>motor</b> used in Samuel Langley’s aerodromes.

40|$|Three (3) designs {{have been}} made for two sizes, 6. 91 cm (2. 72 inch) and 4. 29 cm (1. 69 inch) outer diameters, of a {{patented}} inverted configured Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSM) electric motor specifically for drilling at ultra-high rotational speeds (10, 000 rpm) and that can utilize advanced drilling methods. Benefits of these motors are stackable power sections, full control (speed and direction) of downhole motors, flow hydraulics independent of motor operation, application of advanced drilling methods (water jetting and abrasive slurry jetting), {{and the ability of}} signal/power electric wires through motor(s). Key features of the final designed motors are: fixed non-rotating shaft with stator coils attached; rotating housing with permanent magnet (PM) rotor attached; bit attached to rotating housing; internal channel(s) in a nonrotating shaft; electric components that are hydrostatically isolated from high internal pressure circulating fluids ('muds') by static metal to metal seals; liquid filled motor with smoothed features for minimized turbulence in the motor during operation; and new inverted coated metal-metal hydrodynamic bearings and seals. PMSM, Induction and Switched Reluctance Machines (SRM), all pulse modulated, were considered, but PMSM were determined to provide the highest power density for the shortest <b>motors.</b> Both <b>radial</b> and axial electric PMSM driven motors were designed with axial designs deemed more rugged for ultra-high speed, drilling applications. The 6. 91 cm (2. 72 inch) OD axial inverted motor can generate 4. 18 KW (5. 61 Hp) power at 10, 000 rpm with a 4 Nm (2. 95 ft-lbs) of torque for every 30. 48 cm (12 inches) of power section. The 6. 91 cm (2. 72 inch) OD <b>radial</b> inverted <b>motor</b> can generate 5. 03 KW (6. 74 Hp) with 4. 8 Nm (3. 54 ft-lb) torque at 10, 000 rpm for every 30. 48 cm (12 inches) of power section. The 4. 29 cm (1. 69 inch) OD <b>radial</b> inverted <b>motor</b> can generate 2. 56 KW (3. 43 Hp) power with 2. 44 Nm (1. 8 ft-lb) torque at full speed 10, 000 rpm for every 30. 48 cm (12 inches) of power section. Operating conditions are 300 voltage AC at the motor leads. Power voltage losses in the cables/wirelines to the motor(s) are expected to be about 10 % for 5000 feet carrying 2 amperes. Higher voltages and better insulators can lower these losses and carry more amperes.

40|$|In this dissertation, the {{influence}} of using induction motor in machinery train on rotordynamics is discussed. Two areas are considered ? the use of variable frequency drives (VFDs), which control and drive the induction motor; and the unstable forces due motor eccentricity, which is resulted from motor rotor lateral motion. VFDs ? The dissertation documents fatigue related mechanical failures in VFD motor machinery due to mechanical vibrations excited by drive torque harmonics which are created by PWM switching. Present effort models the coupled system with full electrical system including DC bus, inverter, motor, and an industrial mechanical system including flexible couplings, gearboxes and multiple inertias. The approach extends failure prediction beyond simple occurrence of resonance, to fatigue life evaluation based on Rain-flow algorithm, which is suitable for both steady state and transient startup mechanical response. The use of multilevel inverters is demonstrated having the possibility actually exacerbate resonance and fatigue failure. The model is also compared to an industrial test case, which provides good agreement. Motor eccentricity ? In this dissertation, a MEC modeling method is proposed to calculate both the <b>radial</b> and tangential <b>motor</b> eccentric force. The proposed model is also coupled with the motor electric circuit model to provide capability of transient simulation. FEM (Ansys Maxwell) is used to verify the proposed model. Parametric study is performed on the <b>motor</b> <b>radial</b> and tangential eccentric forces. Also a Jeffcott rotor model is used to study {{the influence}} of the motor eccentric force on mechanical stability. A stability criteria of the bearing damping is calculated. The <b>motor</b> <b>radial</b> and tangential eccentric forces are all curved fitted to catch their nonlinearity, which are used in time domain simulation. Nonlinear motions are observed, including limit cycle and jumping phenomena. The results of this dissertation show that both the use of VFDs and the motor lateral motion (motor eccentricity) can cause severe mechanical vibration problem in a rotating machinery train. Both of these two problems need to be carefully concerned in design stage...|$|R

We find that, during the planning stages of the movement, the percentage of directionally tuned neurons displaying gamma oscillations increases when compared to the percentage of directionally tuned neurons displaying beta oscillations. A similar trend is not seen in non-directionally tuned neurons. This suggests that the GPi neurons involved in the planning of movement communicate information using an emergence of oscillations in the gamma-band. I...|$|R

However, up to now, recovery of expansion work in small system has not been considered as a viable solution, because of the limited amount of recoverable energy and of difficulties in designing and operating a two-phase flow expander. The idea here presented is to investigate the application of a radial piston machine, adapted from oleodynamic motor designs, as an expander that will be coupled with the compressor motor shaft; the consequent power reduction goes directly to COP improvement.

Unlike the traditional PM synchronous motors, the SDPMIWM operates on the harmonics. The field is full of harmonic components and the flux waveforms in the motor can be complex. All these makes calculating the motor loss difficult. Thus, this paper study the field distribution of the motor, including harmonic analysis, magnetization in key positions of stator and rotor, and end effect in the motor including its influence in motor's performances.

The axial injector is interesting because of its relatively easy design, the higher regression rates, and the noticeably stable motor operation. To exploit its qualities, not only the assessment of the regression rate but rather the entire behavior of the motor is required. For the investigated set of operating conditions, the instantaneous regression rates exhibit a time dependence caused by the impinging jet zone dynamics, while the average regression rates are higher and less mass flux dependent than those achieved with the <b>radial</b> injection <b>motor</b> and expected from the classical turbulent-boundary-layer diffusion- limited theory. A comparison to the data from the radial injector was further drawn in terms of combustion efficiency and fuel regression uniformity. Concerning combustion stability, some observations are made.
