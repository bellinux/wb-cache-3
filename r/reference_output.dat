It offers an especially large gamut designed for use with photographic output in mind. The ProPhoto RGB color space encompasses over 90% of possible surface colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of likely occurring real-world surface colors documented by Pointer in 1980, making ProPhoto even larger than the Wide-gamut RGB color space. The ProPhoto RGB primaries were also chosen {{in order to minimize}} hue rotations associated with non-linear tone scale operations.

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} an {{indirect}} similar model reference adaptive control scheme (SMRAC) {{in which the}} reference model is no longer constrained to be fixed but may be time varying in order to assure a bounded control effort, measured as the shift from the plant poles to the reference model poles. The reference model may be time varying, but its dimensionless description is kept constant; hence, the <b>reference</b> <b>output,</b> in a dimensional analysis sense, is similar. The similarity property guarantees that the dimensionless output properties of the reference model, such as the % overshoot, are kept unmodified during operation. The ideas presented in the paper allow the user to set a control effort level and the SMARC scheme maintains the control effort bounded while keeping the dimensionless properties of the <b>reference</b> <b>output</b> unaltered. This property is interesting because due to error parameter estimation and/or time-varying system parameters, {{the use of a}} fixed reference model can lead to either problems on actuator saturation or loss in achievable performance.

40|$|Near-infrared array detectors, {{like the}} NIRSpec's Teledyne's H 2 RGs, often provide {{reference}} pixels and a <b>reference</b> <b>output.</b> These {{are used to}} remove correlated noise. Improved Reference Sampling and Subtraction (, pronounced "IRS-square") is a statistical technique for using this reference information optimally in a least squares sense. Compared to "traditional" H 2 RG readout, uses a different clocking pattern to interleave many more reference pixels into the data than is otherwise possible. Compared to standard reference correction techniques, subtracts the reference pixels and <b>reference</b> <b>output</b> using a statistically optimized set of frequency dependent weights. The benefits include somewhat lower noise variance and much less obvious correlated noise. NIRSpec's images are cosmetically clean, with less 1 /f banding than in traditional data from the same system.
