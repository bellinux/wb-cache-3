2500|$|Smith {{joined the}} Los Angeles Times in June 1953. [...] At the Times, besides his duties as a <b>rewrite</b> <b>man,</b> {{in which he}} would quickly {{assemble}} stories based largely on information from reporters who phoned in from the field, Smith began writing humor pieces for the op-ed page. He was awarded his own column in 1958.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was as a}} <b>rewrite</b> <b>man</b> for the Daily News in 1947 that Smith {{had what}} he later called [...] "perhaps my finest hour as a newspaperman": his stories on the infamous Elizabeth Short murder case. The police beat {{reporter}} phoned in the bulletin to Smith, who recounted the moment this way in his book Jack Smith's L.A.: [...] "Within the minute I had written {{what may have been}} the first sentence ever written on the Black Dahlia case. I can't remember it word for word, but my lead went pretty much like this: 'The nude body of a young woman, neatly cut in two at the waist, was found early today on a vacant lot near Crenshaw and Exposition Boulevards.'" [...] His editor added one adjective, making Short [...] "a beautiful young woman ... Our city editor, of course, no more knew what the unfortunate young woman had looked like than I did ... But the lesson was clear. On the Daily News, at least, all young women whose nude bodies were found in two pieces on vacant lots were beautiful. I never forgot it." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Rewrite</b> <b>men</b> {{are common}} at large {{national}} magazines, where reporters handle the reporting of the story while a writer takes the material and writes the actual article. In this case, the reporter will put all the information and quotes gathered into a multipage file which is then given to the writer. In cases of a story in several areas, several reporters will give their files to the writer. The article which is written has {{all of the information}} and observations by the reporter(s). People Magazine stories are written in this format with field reporters doing the reporting and New York based writers writing the pieces. Time magazine also used to engage <b>rewrite</b> <b>men</b> almost exclusively, although it has all but abandoned the practice as of its 2008 redesign.|$|R
60|$|Ames was the king-pin, the snowy-petalled Marguerite, the star-bright looloo of the <b>rewrite</b> <b>men.</b> He saw {{attempted}} {{murder in the}} pains of green-apple colic, cyclones in the summer zephyr, lost children in every top-spinning urchin, an uprising of the down-trodden masses in every hurling of a derelict potato at a passing automobile. When not rewriting, Ames {{sat on the porch}} of his Brooklyn villa playing checkers with his ten-year-old son.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>rewrite</b> <b>man</b> (rewrite person) is a {{newspaper}} reporter {{who works in the}} office, not on the street, taking information reported by others and crafting it into stories. It is rarely used as an actual title. The term <b>rewrite</b> <b>man</b> is something of a misnomer. Rewrite men or women do not just [...] "rewrite"; they take notes gathered by on-the-scene-reporters, information gathered by telephone, or from wire services or clippings from other newspapers, and write articles.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982, Stout {{changed to}} the New York Times, where he {{continued}} to work both as reporter and editor. In 1997 he moved to their Washington office and became a night <b>rewrite</b> <b>man,</b> i.e. working mainly {{in the office and}} turning information and texts received from others into articles. After 2000, Stout worked mainly for the papers website, again including work as <b>rewrite</b> <b>man.</b> Throughout his career, Stouts responsibilities had also covered sports and domestic news. After 27.5 years with the New York Times, editor Stout took advantage of a buy-out offer in 2009 and left the newspaper. He stated he was [...] "leaving with very warm feelings for the York Times."

5000|$|The {{tradition}} was {{exemplified by the}} longtime night city editor of the American, Harry Romanoff, [...] "Romy," [...] who could create news stories almost at will with only a telephone. He ran the city room at night {{with the help of}} two <b>rewrite</b> <b>men</b> (including Mike McGovern, noted below), one night photo editor, a sports desk editor (Brent Musburger's first job out of journalism school) and one night copy boy who [...] "cut and pasted AP and UPI wires for Harry's review). Since the afternoon paper was put together the previous evening, the night city editor was the key news editor. Moreover, [...] "Romy" [...] a stout, cigar-chomping, suspendered, order-barking commander of the city desk, enjoyed the fearful but absolute regard of pressmen, the composing room and the entire night staff of the Tribune Tower, which owned and housed the Chicago's American operations in its final decades.|$|R
60|$|Vesey was the {{youngest}} reporter. He had a thirty-two-inch chest and wore a number fourteen collar; but his bright Scotch plaid suit gave him presence and conferred no obscurity upon his whereabouts. He wore his hat in such a position that people followed him about to see him take it off, convinced {{that it must be}} hung upon a peg driven into the back of his head. He was never without an immense, knotted, hard-wood cane with a German-silver tip on its crooked handle. Vesey was the best photograph hustler in the office. Scott said it was because no living human being could resist the personal triumph it was to hand his picture over to Vesey. Vesey always wrote his own news stories, except the big ones, which were sent to the <b>rewrite</b> <b>men.</b> Add to this fact that among all the inhabitants, temples, and groves of the earth nothing existed that could abash Vesey, and his dim sketch is concluded.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, Harry Preston {{moved to}} California, where he joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios {{as an analyst}} and <b>rewrite</b> <b>man.</b> The writers’ strike in 1962 forced him to move east to join the famous Jam Handy Studios in Detroit, where one of his {{commercials}} (for “Religion in American Life”) was nominated for an industry award.|$|E

40|$|Deploying {{wireless}} sensor networks {{can present}} many technical challenges. The ABSYNTH Project attempts to address these challenges by presenting the user with an end-to-end system to assist the user. GAIL (Guarded Action Intermediate Language) is an intermediate language for expressing node-level code. GAIL programs consist {{of a series of}} guarded action statements. These statements have a boolean expression, the guard, which triggers its actions when it is true. Programs in GAIL contain descriptions of both the hardware and software. GAIL is designed to be constrained in several ways. First, each guarded action has a constraint to determine when the guards should be evaluated. Second, all variables are statically allocated. Finally, evaluation of the guarded actions is designed to limit where expressions with side effects are allowed to occur. These constraints cause the language to not be Turingcomplete. Instead, GAIL programs can be modeled as finite state machines. This property of the language facilitates program analysis at compile time. GAIL programs are optimized using rewrite rules by <b>rewriting</b> programs into <b>man...</b>|$|R
40|$|Jane Austen {{sprinkles}} deaths {{throughout her}} novels as plot devices and character indicators, {{but she does}} not tackle death directly. Yet death pervades her novels, in a subtle yet brutal way, in the lives of her female characters. Austen reveals that death was the definition and the destiny of women; it was {{the driving force behind the}} social and economic constructs that ruled the eighteenth-century woman's life, manifested in language, literature, religion, art, and even in a woman's doubts about herself. In Northanger Abbey Catherine Morland discovers that women, like female characters in gothic texts, are written and <b>rewritten</b> by the <b>men</b> whose language dominates them. Catherine herself becomes an example of real gothic when she is silenced and her spirit murdered by Henry Tilney. Marianne Dashwood barely escapes the powerful male constructs of language and literature in Sense and Sensibility. Marianne finds that the literal, maternal, wordless language of women counts for nothing in the social world, where patriarchal,figurative language rules, and in her attempt to channel her literal language into the social language of sensibility, she is placed in a position of more deadly nothingness, cast by society as a scorned woman and expected to die. Fanny Price in Mansfield Park is sacrificed as Eve, but in her death-like existence and in her rise to success she echoes Christ, who is ultimately a maternal figure that encapsulates the knowledge of the goddess, the knowledge that from death will come life. Emma Woodhouse in Emma discovers that her perfection, sanctioned by artistic standards, is really a means by which society eases its fears about death by projecting death onto women as a beautiful ideal. In Persuasion, Anne Elliotfindsthat women endure death while men struggle against it, and this endurance requires more courage than most men possess or understand. Austen's novels expose the undercurrent of death in women's lives, yet hidden in her heroines is the maternal power of women—the power to bear children, to bear language and culture, to bear both life and death...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{feminist and}} postmodern thought has critiqued {{traditional}} conceptions of masculinity, describing {{the effect that}} the distinctive masculinity of the "man of reason" has had on the history of philosophy, on consciousness, and on the academy. A common characteristic of the recent literature on masculinity is that it reflects the historical and cultural context in which it is written [...] a context of binary, hierarchical dualisms which involve certain symbolic associations. These dualisms, such as Man-Woman, masculine-feminine, and reason-emotion, arguably find their roots in Pythagorean philosophy and can be traced through the Renaissance to our current historical context. One example is our conception of reason: the association of maleness with a clear, determinate mode of thought, i. e. reason, was incorporated into the form-matter distinction that was central to Greek thought. This paper will show that in cases where women attempt to redefine the dichotomy by revaluing the traditionally feminine (like feelings and emotions) over the traditionally masculine (like reason) their work is often mistakenly criticized for being purely political; conversely, when men attempt to redefine the same dichotomy in an attempt to allow men to "get back in touch with their feelings," to be nurturers, their work is described in terms of providing a better epistemology. The current literature on masculinity explores alternatives to rewriting or redefining Woman that try to avoid the problem of status remaining with redefinition. This alternative is <b>rewriting</b> or redefining <b>Man.</b> Through redefining Man, one may be able to reconceptualize the privileged side of the hierarchical dualism {{in such a way that}} it is no longer privileged. Deprivileging, as well as redefining Man, is argued by theorists of masculinity to be possible because while the devalued status of the inferior side of a hierarchical dualism tends to keep the same status when redefined, it may be possible to redefine the privileged side of the dualism in such a way that it loses its privileged status. Unfortunately, many of these attempts to rewrite or redefine masculinity have detrimental faults of their own. Finally, this paper will discuss more promising possibilities for new definitions of Man, as well as a vision for better interaction between the work of women and men in general...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of feminist and postmodern thought, {{traditional}} conceptions of masculinity {{and what it means}} to be a “Real Man” have been critiqued. In Genevieve Lloyd's The Man of Reason, this critique takes the form of exposing the effect that the distinctive masculinity of the “man of reason” has had on the history of philosophy. One major feature of the masculine-feminine dichotomy will emerge as a key notion for understanding the rest of the paper: the dichotomy of reason-feeling, a parallel and a foundational aspect to the dichotomy of masculinity and femininity. In exploring the history of symbolic conceptions of masculinity in ancient Greece, the Renaissance, and the present, one finds that the oppression of women is integrally linked to the traditional tie between masculinity and reason. There have been many efforts in recent feminist philosophy to rewrite or redefine “Woman” in such a way as to alleviate the oppression of women. I argue that the effectiveness of rewriting Woman for this purpose is problematic, primarily because any rewriting of this type must occur in the current historical context of hierarchical dualisms, like Man-Woman, masculine-feminine, male-female. These binary oppositions arguably find their roots in Pythagorean philosophy and can be traced through the Renaissance to our current historical context. It is these dualisms that have traditionally valued the masculine side of the Man-Woman dichotomy more than the feminine. Further, it will be argued that the hierarchical dualism of Man and Woman is so pervasive that if we rewrite or redefine the inferior, deprivileged side of that dualism, we cannot correct its devalued status. Instead, we redefine that which is undervalued but retain its devalued status. This particular aspect of attempts to critique hierarchical dualisms like reason and feeling has been reflected in the writings of many feminists, male and female. This paper will show that in cases where women attempt to redefine the dichotomy by revaluing the traditionally feminine (like feelings and emotions) over the traditionally masculine (like reason) their work is often mistakenly criticized for being purely political; conversely, when men attempt to redefine the same dichotomy in an attempt to allow men to “get back in touch with their feelings,” to be nurturers, their work is described in terms of providing a better epistemology. The current literature on masculinity explores alternatives to rewriting or redefining Woman that try to avoid the problem of status remaining with redefinition. This alternative is <b>rewriting</b> or redefining <b>Man.</b> Through redefining Man, one may be able to reconceptualize the privileged side of the hierarchical dualism in such a way that it is no longer privileged.

5000|$|Sometimes {{an entire}} front page, with bylines from several {{different}} reporters, will {{have actually been}} written by a single <b>rewrite</b> <b>man</b> working with an editor.
