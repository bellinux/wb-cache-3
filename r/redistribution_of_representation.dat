40|$|Sleep {{benefits}} {{the consolidation of}} psychological memory, and there are hints that sleep likewise supports immunological memory formation. Comparing psychological and immunological domains, we {{make the case for}} active system consolidation that is similarly established in both domains and partly conveyed by the same sleep-associated processes. In the psychological domain, neuronal reactivation of declarative memory during slow-wave sleep (SWS) promotes the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>representations</b> initially stored in hippocampal circuitry to extra-hippocampal circuitry for long-term storage. In the immunological domain, SWS seems to favor the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> antigenic memories initially held by antigen-presenting cells, to persisting T cells serving as a long-term store. Because storage capacities are limited in both systems, system consolidation presumably reduces information by abstracting 'gist' for long-term storage...|$|R

40|$|This thesis used a rodent {{model of}} skilled forelimb {{training}} and intracortical microstimulation {{to examine the}} relationship between learning and cortical reorganization. This thesis examines how reorganization is related to the specific changes in forelimb movements during learning. It also examines the role that task repetition plays in driving motor cortex reorganization and showed that once the skilled motor task had been acquired it was necessary to repeat the task sufficiently to produce motor cortex reorganization. This thesis also examines reorganization following skilled reach training was related to the consolidation of motor skill, finding that animals that learned the skilled reaching task after five days of training also showed cortical reorganization, which persisted for one month. These experiments show that the distribution and subsequent <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> movement <b>representations</b> within motor cortex is related to changes in motor performance that occur during motor training. ii...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Data <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> {{parallel}} data <b>representations</b> has be-come {{an important}} factor of grid frameworks for scientific computing. Providing the developers with generalized interfaces for flexible paral-lel data redistribution is a major goal of this research. In this article we present the architecture and the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>redistribution</b> module <b>of</b> TGrid. TGrid is a grid-enabled runtime system for applications consisting of cooperating multiprocessor tasks (M-tasks). The data redis-tribution module enables TGrid components to transfer data structures to other components which may be located on the same local subnet or may be executed remotely. We show how the parallel data redistri-bution {{is designed to be}} flexible, extendible, scalable, and particularly easy-to-use. The article includes a detailed experimental analysis <b>of</b> the <b>redistribution</b> module by providing a comparison of throughputs which were measured for a large range of processors and for different intercon-nection networks. ...|$|R

Because such an age effect was not observed when animals performed a nonspatial task, the present study tested the hypothesis that the different patterns of spatial selectivity observed in memory and nonmemory tests reflected a <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>representations</b> that occurred in response to changing task demands. In the present experiment, after animals became familiar with the test environment and motor demands of performance on a radial maze, CA 1 and hilar place cells were recorded as they learned a spatial memory task. CA 1 place cells recorded from unimpaired old, but not impaired old or young, animals became more spatially selective as animals learned the task. Hilar spatial selectivity for both age groups was not significantly related to choice accuracy. These data support the hypothesis that at least a subpopulation of aged rats may benefit from reorganization <b>of</b> spatial <b>representations</b> {{in such a way that}} the normal age-related spatial learning deficit is attenuated. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|Over {{more than}} a century of {{research}} has established the fact that sleep benefits the retention of memory. In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of "sleep and memory" research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept <b>of</b> an active <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> memory <b>representations</b> from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i. e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems...|$|R

A 4 Rs framework <b>of</b> <b>redistribution,</b> recognition, <b>representation</b> and reconciliation was employed to analyse data gathered from: interviews with teacher educators, policy makers and development partners, and focus group discussions with and questionnaires completed by pre- and in-service teachers. The study concluded that teacher recruitment was driven by concerns of quality with weakly implemented largely quantitative measures of inclusion. Socio-politically grounded measures would be required for a diverse teaching force. Alongside, policies and procedures for the transfer of teachers would need to be streamlined so that teachers deployed to schools in marginalised areas serve there for a specified period of time. </p...|$|R
