5|$|Risk parity is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration). The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including <b>real</b> <b>assets,</b> commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are uncorrelated assets, low equity risk, and passive management.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary draft We study economies where {{buyers and}} sellers meet bilaterally and at random and where 8 ̆ 5 at money competes with a one-period lived <b>real</b> <b>asset</b> as means of payment. The <b>real</b> <b>asset</b> can be in two states {{depending}} on its future dividend. We emphasize private information about asset fundamentals to explain the usefulness of 8 ̆ 5 at money. We show that a monetary equilibrium exists irrespective of the quantity of the <b>real</b> <b>asset</b> in the economy. Moreover, the rate of return of the <b>real</b> <b>asset</b> {{is greater than the}} rate of return of 8 ̆ 5 at money. Asset liquidityas measured by transaction velocityis endogenous and depends on fundamentals and policy. Buyers holding high-dividend assets refrain from using them as means of payment in order to signal their quality to the sellers. Asset liquidity declines as the asset becomes riskier or as ination decreases. Provided that the stock of the <b>real</b> <b>asset</b> is not too large and ination is not too small, the price of the <b>real</b> <b>asset</b> exhibits a liquidity premium that is a¤ected by monetary policy. Liquidity premia increase with ination. The optimal monetary policy is such that the liquidity premium and the velocity of the high-dividend asset are zero...|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{economic}} slowdown, in the 2014 Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, Australia {{continued to have}} the second highest average wealth per adult (US$430,800) and the highest median wealth (US$225,400), with a total wealth of $7.2 trillion. The average level of <b>real</b> <b>assets</b> (US$319,700) was the second {{highest in the world}} after Norway and 60% of gross household assets. The report explained that this partly reflects a large endowment of land and natural resources relative to population, and also high urban real estate prices. Only 6% of Australians had net worth below US$10,000, compared to 29% in the USA and 70% for the world as a whole. The average debt was 20% of gross assets. The proportion of people with wealth above US$100,000 was {{the highest in the world}} (eight times the world average). Australia had 3.8% (1,783,000 people) of the top 1% of global wealth holders while having 0.4% of the world’s adult population. The wealth share by Australia's top decile was 51.1% in 2000, 50.7% in 2007, and 51.1% in 2014. In 2016, Australia continued to be the second wealthiest nation in terms of wealth per adult.|$|E

2500|$|Sukuk were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to conventional bonds which are not considered permissible by many Muslims as they pay interest and may finance businesses involved in non-Sharia-compliant activities (gambling, alcohol, pork, etc.). [...] Sukuk securities are structured to comply with Sharia by paying profit, not interest—generally by involving a tangible asset in the investment. For example, Sukuk securities may have partial ownership of a property built by the investment company (and held in a Special Purpose Vehicle), so that sukuk holders can collect the property's profit as rent, (which is allowed under Islamic law). Because they represent ownership of <b>real</b> <b>assets</b> and (at least in theory) do not guarantee repayment of initial investment, sukuk resemble equity instruments, but like a bond (and unlike equity) regular payments cease upon their expiration. However, most sukuk are [...] "asset-based" [...] rather than [...] "asset-backed"—their assets are not truly owned by their Special Purpose Vehicle, and their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments.|$|E
60|$|Before {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century no nation owed {{payments}} to a foreign nation on any considerable scale, except such tributes as were exacted under the compulsion of actual occupation in force and, at one time, by absentee princes under the sanctions of feudalism. It is true that the need for European capitalism to find an outlet in the New World has led during the past fifty years, though even now on a relatively modest scale, to such countries as Argentine owing an annual sum to such countries as England. But the system is fragile; and it has only survived because its burden on the paying countries has not so far been oppressive, because this burden is represented by <b>real</b> <b>assets</b> and is bound up with the property system generally, and because the sums already lent are not unduly large in relation to those which it is still hoped to borrow. Bankers are used to this system, and believe it to be a necessary part of the permanent order of society. They are disposed to believe, therefore, by analogy with it, that a comparable system between Governments, on a far vaster and definitely oppressive scale, represented by no <b>real</b> <b>assets,</b> and less closely associated with the property system, is natural and reasonable and in conformity with human nature.|$|E

First, general differential equation for the put option value is derived, and appropriate boundary conditions are spelled out.

Then, as an analog for the hurdle rate rule in case of investing in the <b>real</b> <b>asset,</b> the “grace rate ” rule is introduced as a proxy for the optimal selling (scrapping) decision. The finding is that, similarly to the hurdle rate rule, the “grace rate ” rule is robust enough, and may lead to a near optimal decision {{for a wide range of}} the project’s parameters.
