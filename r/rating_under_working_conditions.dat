The {{root mean square}} value of reel axial torque was calculated by weighted processing and was taken for the basis of the calculation on structure critical load. Based on the block of load spectrum, the virtual fatigue calculation showed the relation about the static strength and critical load block of load spectrum. Keeping the ratio of the static strength and critical load, the force analysis of wring reel aimed to the structure weight reduction by finite element analysis (FEA). The established wholly parametric and weight reduction model of wring structural part had been computed and meets the strength and stiffness requirement. The weight of this reel is reduced by 15. 5 kg and lightweight effect is 8 %. This method of weight reduction can be used to the reference on the design of hydraulic deck machinery of ship and hydraulic actuation construction machinery...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulative {{analysis of a}} modification to the TCP congestion control mechanism called ESSE (early slow start exit), designed to improve the TCP startup phase by setting the slow start threshold according to a pipesize estimation based on the observation of few ACK arrival times. We evaluate the performance of ESSE by using various methods to estimate the pipesize as the ratio between the round trip time and the spacing between ACK. This algorithm is easy to implement and preserves the compatibility with the standard protocol since it requires changes to the sender side only. Simulative experiments show that ESSE allows us to speed-up TCP connections and drastically reduce the packet drop <b>rate</b> <b>under</b> several <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> and load levels. Better performance of TCP can be observed {{for any of the}} considered estimators, which indicates that the algorithm is robust against estimation errors. Further, the characteristics of fairness and friendliness (towards Newreno) of the algorithm are investigated. According to our simulations, ESSE-modified protocols guarantee fair utilization of bandwidth among homogeneous and heterogeneous (Newreno) connections sharing a common link...|$|R

40|$|Methane {{conversion}} to syngas is very attractive for hydrogen or clean fuel production and provides {{an alternative to}} oil products. An efficient architecture for the membrane reactor is constituted of a porous support, a thin dense membrane and a catalyst layer. This work {{is focused on the}} elaboration process of such asymmetric membranes by co-sintering of at least the porous support and the dense membrane and specially the choice of well adapted materials. La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 Fe 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 O 3 -δ perovskite material has been chosen as the dense membrane because it exhibits a good compromise between oxygen flux and stability. The choice of the material for the porous support is mainly oriented by the sintering behaviour of the membrane, the thermal expansion behaviour of both layers to avoid cracks formation <b>under</b> <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> and the chemical inertness of both materials. Several formulations fulfilling these three requirements were synthesized by liquid phase reaction and tape-cast.
