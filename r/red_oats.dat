25|$|Grant’s gazelles are {{generally}} mixed feeders that both browse and graze. Their average diet consists of 65.8% browse and 34.3% graze. Rainfall in their habitats {{seems to be}} the determinant of their diets. The Grant's gazelle's diet may also be responsible for the slow growth rates in the browsed plots. They get most of their moisture from the plants they eat, so they do not often have to drink water. Thus they can stay on the plains long after the rains end. From July to September, gazelles move deep into dense brush and wait for the next rains. They will eat <b>red</b> <b>oats</b> and small, tough plants, which are avoided by the other ungulates. This allows the gazelles to survive in the brush during the dry season. Grant’s gazelles eat mainly dicotyledons during the dry season and grass in the wet season.|$|E
40|$|Tillage and {{subsequent}} bare soil {{have been linked}} to erosion, nutrient leaching, reduced biological diversity, loss of organic matter, and release of CO 2 into the atmosphere (Brady and Weil, 2004). The usefulness of an organic no-till system for transplanted vegetables was explored over two growing seasons. In 2007 - 2008, in a randomized complete block design, treatments of tilled and no-till (T and NT, respectively) were seeded to a dense grain and legume winter cover crop. Tilled plots were mown and disk-ploughed two times; NT plots retained a mow-killed mulch on the soil surface. There were less weeds in NT plots. A corollary experiment was conducted in 2007 - 2008 to help determine the best cover crops for a no-till system. There was no difference in the amount of biomass produced by the different cover crops, although anthesis for ‘Juan’ triticale (Triticum X Secale) was 12 days later than for ‘Montezuma’ <b>red</b> <b>oats</b> (Avena sativa). In 2008 - 2009, a completely randomized experimental design was used to test the effect of tillage on bell pepper yield, weed suppression, plant height, and total soil carbon. The treatments were tilled and no-till (T and NT, respectively). A winter cover crop was seeded. Tilled plots were mown, hand-forked and roto-tilled; NT plots retained a killed mulch on the soil surface. Although T plots yielded more bell peppers, NT plots had more weed suppression. There was no difference between the treatments in the change of total soil carbon over the 1 year period, although both treatments experienced overall gains. The present study will add to the growing body of research on the possibility of organic no-till vegetable farming for small- to mid-sized growers located on the central coast of California...|$|E

40|$|Trees are {{becoming}} {{an increasingly important}} component of the Iowa landscape. For tree plantings to be more common in Iowa two major problems related to establishment must be overcome: (1) intense weed competition and (2) a lack of market or non-market values for several years for newly planted trees. To develop information that addresses these problems, a research project was initiated during the spring of 1998 at the ISU Rhodes Research Farm. The objectives of the project are: (i) to evaluate the influence of seven weed control treatments [four small grain/forage crop combinations (<b>oats</b> and <b>red</b> fescue; <b>oats,</b> <b>red</b> fescue, and <b>red</b> clover; and <b>oats,</b> orchardgrass, and <b>red</b> clover; red clover and hairy vetch), one herbicide treatment (conventional mix of preemergents with additional control from RoundUp), mowing, and no treatment] on the survival and growth of two groups of tree species (fast-growing hardwoods [two poplar clones and silver maple] and highvalue hardwoods [red oak and black walnut as seedlings and from seed]); (ii) to evaluate the influence of seedlings of the tree species on the productivity of small grain/forage crop combinations, and (iii) to determine the cost effectiveness of planting trees with different weed control techniques...|$|R

There was wild {{excitement}} {{because they had to}} cross a little bridge to get into the front garden. But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley, yellow <b>oats,</b> <b>red</b> wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching level to the sky.|$|R
40|$|When it is {{understood}} that the profits on forage fed spring pigs can be increased more than five fold over those fed in dry lot, the great value of green pastures in pork production becomes clear. In 1911, pigs grazed upon alfalfa at the Iowa Agricultural Experiment station returned a profit of more than $ 3. 00 each, as compared to 61 cents in dry lot. The yearly net profits with spring pigs on an acre of forage at Ames, counting corn at 50 cents a bushel and hogs at $ 5. 00, has ranged with the best forages from $ 30. 00 to $ 80. 00. In 1909, an acre of red clover netted on this basis, $ 32. 34; <b>oats,</b> <b>red</b> clover and rape, $ 32. 30; in 1910, sweet clover, $ 42. 07; rape, $ 37. 57; and red clover, $ 34. 62; in 1911, rape, $ 80. 37; alfalfa, $ 65. 99; and oats, field peas and rape, $ 64. 63. Such profits encourage the growing of hog forages. The average daily profit on young pigs grazing in forage is invariably higher than on those confined to pens...|$|R
40|$|Whole-grain {{brown rice}} {{contains}} 15 vitamins and minerals, including B vitamins, potassium, magnesium, and iron—all nutrients the body needs {{to grow and}} develop normally. In addition to these essential nutrients, there are bioactive phytochemicals in rice, {{as well as in}} other whole grains, vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, and seeds. Although the role of these plant chemicals in terms of human health has not been proven, a body of evidence suggests that some phytochemicals could be nutritionally beneficial. Now, studies headed by chemist Ming-Hsuan Chen, who is with the Agricultural Research Service’s Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart, Arkansas, have provided knowledge about the chemical composition and potential bioavailability of compounds in a representative group of rice varieties. Rice is a cereal grain, along with corn, <b>oats,</b> <b>red</b> and white wheat, and barley. The USDA-ARS National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) in Aberdeen, Idaho, for example, contains more than 18, 000 rice samples of various colors, called “accessions,” from around the world. These accessions provide a valuable resource to breeders for developing new rice varieties with desirable agronomic and nutritional features. Rice is categorized into seven color classes based on bran color: white, light brown, speckled brown, brown, red, variable purple, and purple...|$|R
