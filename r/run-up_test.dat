40|$|PUR-revetment is a newly {{developed}} method for hydraulic application. Its structure {{is similar to}} that of open stone asphalt revetment, but the crushed stones are glued by polyurethane (PUR) instead of bitumen. To study the feasibility of applying PUR-revetment, a research based on the comparisons between PUR-revetment and open stone asphalt revetment was carried out, for which, a standard four-point bending frequency sweep test, a standard monotonic three-point bending strength test, a porosity test, a stability on slope test, a wave <b>run-up</b> <b>test,</b> an interface permeability test, a relative resistance to abrasive action test and some calculations in GOLFKLAP were done. It suggests PUR-revetment is applicable in practice. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|We used {{real-time}} {{monitors and}} low-volume air samplers {{to measure the}} potential human exposure to airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations during various flight-related and ground-support activities of C- 130 H aircraft at an Air National Guard base. We used three types of photoelectric aerosol sensors (PASs) to measure real-time concentrations of particle-bound PAHs in a break room, downwind from a C- 130 H aircraft during a four-engine <b>run-up</b> <b>test,</b> in a maintenance hangar, in a C- 130 H aircraft cargo bay during cargo-drop training, downwind from aerospace ground equipment (AGE), and in a C- 130 H aircraft cargo bay during engine running on/off (ERO) loading and backup exercises. Two low-volume air samplers were collocated with the real-time monitors for all monitoring events except those in the break room and during in-flight activities. Total PAH concentrations in the integrated-air samples followed a general trend: downwind from two AGE units > ERO-loading exercise > four-engine <b>run-up</b> <b>test</b> > maintenance hangar during taxi and takeoff > background measurements in maintenance hangar. Each PAH profile was dominated by naphthalene, the alkyl-substituted naphthalenes, and other PAHs {{expected to be in}} the vapor phase. We also found particle-bound PAHs, such as fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene in some of the sample extracts. During flight-related exercises, total PAH concentrations in the integrated-air samples were 10 - 25 times higher than those commonly found in ambient air. Real-time monitor mean responses generally followed the integrated-air sample trends. These monitors provided a semiquantitative temporal profile of ambient PAH concentrations and showed that PAH concentrations can fluctuate rapidly from a baseline level 4, 000 ng/m(3) during flight-related activities. Small handheld models of the PAS monitors exhibited potential for assessing incidental personal exposure to particle-bound PAHs in engine exhaust and for serving as a real-time dosimeter to indicate when respiratory protection is advisable...|$|E

Through 2011 and into 2012, NIF ran the [...] "national ignition campaign" [...] to reach {{the point at which the}} fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining, a key goal that is a basic requirement of any practical IFE system. NIF failed in this goal, with fusion performance that was well below ignition levels and differing considerably from predictions. With the problem of ignition unsolved, the LIFE project was canceled in 2013.|$|R
40|$|It is {{desirable}} to achieve low frequency sound absorption in the tests {{section of the}} NASA Ames 80 X 120 -ft wind tunnel. However, {{it is difficult to}} obtain information regarding sound absorption characteristics of potential treatments because of the restrictions placed on the dimensions of the test chambers. In the present case measurements were made in a large enclosure for aircraft ground <b>run-up</b> <b>tests.</b> The normal impedance of the acoustic treatment was measured using two microphones located close {{to the surface of the}} treatment. The data showed reasonably good agreement with analytical methods which were then used to design treatments for the wind tunnel test section.

40|$|Full-scale wave run-up {{measurements}} {{have been}} carried out on the Zeebrugge rubble mound breakwater in the frame of the EU-funded OPTICREST project. Wave run-up has been measured by a run-up gauge and by a so-called spi-derweb system. The dimensionless wave run-up value Ru 2 % / H m 0 measured in Zeebrugge equals 1. 77 for Iribarren number om = 3. 63. An (apparent) influence of the water level on wave run-up has been observed. The porosity of the armor layer has a significant influence on wave run-up and may explain the dependency of wave run-up on the water level observed in Zeebrugge. Full-scale measurement results have been compared to literature data. The full-scale wave run-up data are in good agreement with the existing results of wave <b>run-up</b> <b>tests</b> with rip-rap slopes but are clearly higher than other wave run-up data resulting from tests with rubble mound breakwaters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{design and}} control of active mufflers used in engine exhaust systems. Boundary element method is employed to investigate noise attenuation performances of various active muffler structures. Based on these performance evaluations, an active muffler having only one loudspeaker inclined at 45 degree with the muffler centerline is constructed and tested for active noise control (ANC). The feedback ANC with two controller tuning algorithms, the filtered-x least m an square (FXLMS) algorithm and Godart modified algorithm, is applied independently for ngine exhaust noise attenuation. Experimental investigation reveals that feedback ANC with FXLMS algorithm can attain an averaged 23. 6 dB noise attenuation for pure tone excitation and over 6 dB noise reduction for motorcycle and automobile exhaust noises. It is also shown that feedback ANC with Godart modified algorithm has faster transient response compared to FXLMS algorithm for a pure tone noise, but has inferior noise attenuation capabilitythan the FXLMS algorithm for the engine exhaust noise at fixed speeds (about 5 dB noise reduction) as well as during <b>run-up</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Guided splined disks” {{are defined}} as flat thin disks in which the inner radius of the disk is splined and matches a splined arbor that {{provides}} the driving torque for rotating the disk. Lateral constraint for the disk is provided by space fixed guide pads. Experimental lateral displacement of <b>run-up</b> <b>tests</b> of such a system is presented, and the flutter instability zones are identified. The results indicate that flutter instability occurs at speeds when a backward travelling wave of a mode meets a reflected wave of a different mode. Sometimes, the system cannot pass a flutter zone, and transverse vibrations of the disk lock into that flutter instability zone. The governing linear equations of transverse motion of such a spinning disk, with assumed free inner and outer boundary conditions, are derived. A lateral constraint is introduced and modeled as a linear spring. Rigid body translational and tilting degrees of freedom {{are included in the}} analysis of the total motion of the spinning disk. The eigenvalues of the system are computed numerically, and the flutter instability zones are defined. The results show that the mathematical model can predict accurately the flutter instability zones measured in the experimental tests...|$|R
40|$|Since July 2008, the Numerical Offshore Tank (TPN) of the University of São Paulo and Petrobras {{have been}} working on a {{research}} project intended to improve knowledge and modeling of advanced hydrodynamics topics, such as the wave run-up phenomenon.

40|$|High-frequency beach {{water table}} {{fluctuations}} due to wave run-up and run-down {{have been observed}} in the field [Waddell, 1976]. Such fluctuations affect the infiltration/exfiltration process across the beach face and the interstitial oxygenation process in the beach ecosystem. Accurate representation of high-frequency watertable fluctuations is of importance in the modeling of (1) the interaction between seawater and groundwater, more important, the effects on swash sediment transport and (2) the biological activities in the beach ecosystem. Capillarity effects provide a mechanism for high- frequency water table fluctuations. Previous modeling approaches adopted the assumption of saturated flow only and failed to predict the propagation of high-frequency fluctuations in the aquifer. In this paper we develop a modified kinematic boundary condition (kbc) for the water table which incorporates capillarity effects. The application of this kbc in a boundary element model enables the simulation of high-frequency water table fluctuations due to wave <b>run-up.</b> Numerical <b>tests</b> were carried out for a rectangular domain with small-amplitude oscillations; the behavior of water table responses {{was found to be}} similar to that predicted by an analytical solution based on the one-dimensional Boussinesq equation. The model was also applied to simulate the water table response to wave run- up on a sloping beach. The results showed similar features of water table fluctuations observed in the field. In particular, these fluctuations are standing wave-like with the amplitude becoming increasingly damped inland. We conclude that the modified kbc presented here is a reasonable approximation of capillarity effects on beach water table fluctuations. However, further model validation is necessary before the model can confidently be used to simulate high-frequency water table fluctuations due to wave run-up...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The two key {{questions}} which motivate our work are: do bubbles exist (in {{the sense that}} stock market prices do not always correspond to {{the present value of}} expected future profitability) and, if bubbles exist, do they have an effect on business fixed investment? The case of Japan is particularly interesting because of the dramatic movements in the Japanese stock market and the wide perception that these were associated with a bubble. We use a variety of techniques to analyze these questions. Fist, we examine financing and investment patterns to gauge firms' reactions to the 1980 s stock market <b>run-up.</b> Second, we <b>test</b> subsets of the orthogonality conditions associated with the empirical first-order conditions for fixed investment. Third, we use a linear projection to decompose stock market prices into fundamental and bubble components, allowing us to carry out parametric estimates of the effect of the bubble component on fixed investment. The data strongly suggest that there was a bubble that had an economically important statistically significant effect on business fixed investment in Japan. ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments are {{presented}} {{that focus on}} the interaction of single sinusoidal long waves with beachfront development on the shore. A pump-driven methodology is applied to generate the tested waves in the wave flume. The approaching waves firstly propagate over a horizontal bottom, then climbing up a 1 in 40 beach slope. The experiments reported here are confined to the surf similarity parameter of the waves ranging from ξ = 7. 69 – 10. 49. The maximum <b>run-up</b> of the <b>tested</b> waves under undisturbed conditions agrees well with analytical results of of Madsen and Schäffer (2010). Beachfront development is modelled with cubic concrete blocks (macro-roughness (MR) elements). The obstruction ratio, the number of element rows parallel to the shoreline as well as the way of arranging the MR elements influences the overall reduction of maximum run-up compared to the undisturbed run-up conditions. Staggered and aligned as well as rotated and non-rotated arrangements are tested. As a result, nomograms are finally compiled to depict the maximum run-up reduction over the surf similarity parameter. In addition, some guidance on practical application of the results to an example location is given...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{identify}} information sources which facilitate a functional coupling of perception and action in representative practice contexts is an important challenge for sport scientists and coaches. The current study investigated the role of visual information in regulating athlete gait behaviours during a locomotor pointing task in cricket. Integration of experiential knowledge of elite coaches and theoretical understanding from previous empirical research led us to investigate whether {{the presence of an}} umpire would act as a vertical informational constraint that could constrain the emergent coordination tendencies of cricket bowlers' <b>run-up</b> patterns. To <b>test</b> this idea, umpire presence was manipulated during run-ups of 10 elite medium-fast bowlers. As hypothesised, removal of the umpire from the performance environment did not result in an inability to regulate gait to intercept a target, however, the absence of this informational constraint resulted in the emergence of different movement patterns in participant run-ups. Significantly lower standard deviation values of heel-to-crease distances were observed in the umpire condition at multiple steps, compared to performance in the no-umpire condition. Manipulation of this informational constraint altered gait regulation of participants, offering a mechanism to understand how perception-action couplings can be varied during performance in locomotor pointing tasks in sport...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{characteristics}} of a high-speed spindle and Dual-Spindle High-Speed Drilling Machine Head were studied {{to determine if the}} modal, free-run, and cutting characteristics allow for a stable machining system at the required operating speed of 167 Hz (10 000 RPM). A finite element analysis of the high-speed spindle model was conducted to determine the validity of the finite element method in modeling the bearing support structure of the spindle-bearing assembly. The finite element analysis under simply applied boundary conditions does not provide valid results in terms of the displacement shape and the natural frequency of the spindle-bearing support structure. A detailed understanding of the structure 2 ̆ 7 s boundary interactions is required to correctly model such an assembly. Because of its scope, this problem was separated for future work. Modal analysis indicates that the lowest natural frequency of the spindle assemblies occurs at 712 Hz (43 200 RPM). This value is beyond the required operating speed of 167 Hz (10 000 RPM), and with only two cutting edges on the drill bit, vibration problems during cutting were not expected. Free-run characteristics indicate a fairly stable system with low vibration, and bearing thermal levels. <b>Run-up</b> and run-down <b>tests</b> were carried out at speeds up to 267 Hz (16 000 RPM). Vibration levels during metal cutting with two different diameter drills were only slightly higher than those at the free run tests. There was no indication of any tendency to produce chatter or any other form of excessive vibration. The vibration analysis of the dual-spindle high-speed drilling machine head demonstrates that the system is capable of operating under the required working parameters.
