50|$|It is a <b>recoil</b> <b>escapement</b> as {{mentioned}} above; {{the momentum of}} the pendulum pushes the escape wheel backward during part of the cycle. This causes extra wear to the movement, and applies varying force to the pendulum, causing inaccuracy.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} without recoil {{called the}} deadbeat escapement {{was invented by}} Richard Towneley around 1675 and introduced by British clockmaker George Graham around 1715. This gradually superseded the <b>recoil</b> <b>escapement</b> and is used in virtually all modern pendulum clocks with anchor escapements.|$|E
50|$|The {{clock was}} re-discovered {{in the tower}} in 1928 by T.R. Robinson, an horological enthusiast who went up the clock tower {{to see the new}} clock (installed in 1884). The {{presence}} of the old clock was known to many, but nobody attributed much importance to the old clock. It was only T.R. Robinson who believed that it was the clock mentioned in 1386. From photos taken in 1928, it looked to be fairly complete. Eventually its historic importance was realised. It was first put on display in the Cathedral's North transept. Then, in 1956, the clock was restored to its original condition and started working again. The pendulum and <b>recoil</b> <b>escapement</b> were replaced by a new verge and foliot escapement, thus restoring the clock to something like its original design.|$|E
5000|$|The deadbeat {{escapement}} has {{two faces}} to the pallets, a 'locking' or 'dead' face, with a curved surface concentric with the axis {{on which the}} anchor rotates, and a sloping 'impulse' face. [...] When an escape wheel tooth is resting {{against one of the}} dead faces, its force is directed through the anchor's pivot axis, so it gives no impulse to the pendulum, allowing it to swing freely. When the pallet on the other side releases the escape wheel, a tooth lands on this [...] "dead" [...] face first, and remains resting against it for most of the pendulum's outward swing and return. For this period the escape wheel is [...] "locked" [...] and unable to turn. Near the bottom of the pendulum's swing the tooth slides off the dead face onto the slanted 'impulse' face of the pallet, allowing the escape wheel to turn and give the pendulum a push, before dropping off the pallet. It is still a frictional rest escapement because the sliding of the escape tooth on the dead face adds friction to the pendulum's swing, but it has less friction than the <b>recoil</b> <b>escapement</b> because there is no recoil force.|$|E
