5|$|The Scottie and the German Shepherd are {{the only}} breeds of dog that {{have lived in the}} White House more than three times. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was renowned for owning a Scottie named Fala, a gift from his distant cousin, Margaret Suckley. The President loved Fala so much that he rarely went {{anywhere}} without him. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> several Scotties before Fala, including one named Duffy and another named Mr. Duffy. Eleanor <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> a Scottish Terrier named Meggie when the family entered the White House in 1933. More recently, President George W. Bush has owned two black Scottish Terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley. Barney starred in nine films produced by the White House.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Taft {{wanted to}} be chief justice, and kept {{a close eye on}} the health of the aging incumbent, Melville Fuller, who turned 75 in 1908. Taft {{believed}} Fuller likely to live many years. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> indicated he was likely to appoint Taft if the opportunity came to fill the court's center seat, but some considered Attorney General Philander Knox a better candidate. In any event, Fuller remained chief justice throughout Roosevelt's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Burton himself {{alleged that}} <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> orchestrated his {{prosecution}} in March 23, 1907 speech in Abilene, Kansas {{after his release}} from prison. Burton pointed out that his was the first prosecution under § 1782 and that numerous other public officials before him had potentially violated it, under the interpretation that prevailed in the Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|<b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> been {{stricken}} with polio, {{and was one}} of the moving forces of the March of Dimes. The ten-cent coin could be changed by the Mint without the need for congressional action, and officials moved quickly to replace the Mercury dime. Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock prepared models, but faced repeated criticism from the Commission of Fine Arts. He modified his design in response, and the coin went into circulation in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt's {{death was}} met with shock and grief across the U.S. and around the world. His declining health had not been known to the general public. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> been {{president}} for more than 12 years, longer than any other person, and had led the country through some of its greatest crises to the impending defeat of Nazi Germany and {{within sight of the}} defeat of Japan as well.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Republican convention, Taft and <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> {{discussed}} which cabinet officers would stay on. Taft kept only Agriculture Secretary James Wilson and Postmaster General George von Lengerke Meyer (who was {{shifted to the}} Navy Department). Others appointed to the Taft cabinet included Philander Knox, who had served under McKinley and Roosevelt as Attorney General, as the new Secretary of State, and Franklin MacVeagh as Treasury Secretary.|$|E

5|$|Taft did {{not enjoy}} the easy {{relationship}} with the press that <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had,</b> choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as his predecessor had.

5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|Bryan urged {{a system}} of bank guarantees, so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, {{offering}} a postal savings system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September, Carrie Nation called on Taft and demanded to know his views. Taft and <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> agreed the party platform would take no position on the matter, and Nation left indignant, to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.|$|E

5|$|Burton and <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> a {{complicated}} history. Burton, {{as a leader}} at the 1900 Republican National Convention, was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination. Roosevelt's last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (whose jurisdiction, at the time, included appeals from Kansas) had been William Cather Hook, a choice favored by Burton's political opponents: Senator Chester I. Long (R-KS) and Governor Willis J. Bailey (R-KS). When the next vacancy opened on the Eighth Circuit, Burton and his allies favored the appointment of Charles Blood Smith. D.W. Mulvane was unsuccessful in pressing Smith's candidacy in a June 1903 meeting with Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|Howe's health {{declined}} in 1934, {{and he was}} hospitalized for heart problems and breathing difficulties. He {{spent the last two}} years of his life in and out of Bethesda Naval Hospital. Though he experienced increasing periods of confusion, he continued to give orders to his staff by telephone; <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> instructed them to treat Howe's calls with courtesy, but to double-check his instructions with himself and other staff. Howe died on April 18, 1936. Roosevelt gave him a state funeral three days later in the White House East Room.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, President Franklin Delano <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> {{the tree}} {{moved from the}} Ellipse to the White House grounds, where it {{remained}} until 1954 when it was returned to the Ellipse. In 1946, the lighting ceremony became a televised event, though not with widespread telecast. From 1948 to 1951, President Harry S. Truman signalled the lighting of the tree by remote control from his Independence, Missouri home, but in 1952, he stayed at the White House for the lighting ceremony. In 1953, the ceremony was widely telecast and President Dwight David Eisenhower's address was radio broadcast through the Voice of America in thirty-four languages.|$|E

5|$|President Hoover was {{defeated}} in the 1932 election by Franklin D. Roosevelt. MacArthur and <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> worked together before World War I and, despite political differences, remained friends. MacArthur supported the New Deal through the Army's operation of the Civilian Conservation Corps. He ensured that detailed plans were drawn up for its employment and decentralized its administration to the corps areas, which became {{an important factor in}} the program's success. MacArthur's support for a strong military, and his public criticism of pacifism and isolationism, made him unpopular with the Roosevelt administration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> served {{almost three}} and a half years of McKinley's term. On the night of his own {{election}} in 1904, Roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for re-election in 1908, a pledge he quickly regretted. But he felt bound by his word. Roosevelt believed Taft was his logical successor, although the War Secretary was initially reluctant to run. Roosevelt used his control of the party machinery to aid his heir apparent. On pain of loss of their jobs, political appointees were required to support Taft or remain silent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> {{withdrawn}} {{much land}} from the public domain, including some in Alaska thought rich in coal. In 1902, Clarence Cunningham, an Idaho entrepreneur, had found coal deposits in Alaska, and made mining claims, and the government investigated their legality. This dragged on {{for the remainder of}} the Roosevelt administration, including during the year (1907–1908) when Ballinger served as head of the General Land Office. A special agent for the Land Office, Louis Glavis, investigated the Cunningham claims, and when Secretary Ballinger in 1909 approved them, Glavis broke governmental protocol by going outside the Interior Department to seek help from Pinchot.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roosevelt</b> <b>has</b> a {{significant}} dropout rate; for the 2010-2011 school year, more than 50 {{percent of students}} dropped out compared to the Missouri state dropout rate of 3.4 percent. <b>Roosevelt</b> also <b>has</b> {{a significant}} discipline incident rate of 13.5 percent, more than seven times the average Missouri rate. Since the passage of No Child Left Behind in 2001, <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>has</b> not met the requirements for adequate yearly progress in either communication arts or mathematics. In addition, Roosevelt graduates average lower first and second semester grades during their first year in college than the average Missouri graduate, and as of 2010, more than 80 percent of Roosevelt graduates enrolled in a public university in Missouri required remedial coursework in either English or mathematics.|$|R

5|$|When the Republican {{convention}} {{began in}} Philadelphia that June, no {{vice presidential candidate}} had overwhelming support, but <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> the broadest range of support from around the country. McKinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention, not to him. On June 21, McKinley was unanimously renominated and, with Hanna's reluctant acquiescence, Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot. The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan, setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest.|$|E
5|$|With the 1950 mid-term {{elections}} drawing near, and Truman abstaining from overt campaigning {{while the}} troops were fighting in Korea, members of Truman's staff, most notably George Elsey, came up with another way to garner votes for the Democratic Party. In July 1944, President Franklin <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> traveled to Hawaii to meet with MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz. At this meeting, Roosevelt {{made the decision to}} attack the Philippines in the final year of the Pacific war. It was a political triumph in an election year, refuting Republican claims that Roosevelt fixated on Europe {{at the expense of the}} Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, {{but because of the}} potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>had</b> sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E
