50|$|Marital rape {{is not a}} {{criminal}} offence in Niue. A man cannot be convicted of the rape or attempted rape of his wife unless a decree nisi of divorce, decree of nullity, judicial separation, or separation order was {{in place at the}} time of the act. Sexual violence against girls is addressed in the Niue Act 1966, which provides that those who have or attempt sexual intercourse with a girl under 15 are liable to terms of imprisonment. Despite this, sexual assault on minors has been reported as occurring “regularly”. Cultural and societal beliefs have the effect of inhibiting the reporting of these offences. Where complaints are lodged, they are frequently subsequently withdrawn or dropped. The introduction of a mandatory <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> on figures of authority, and a “no-drop” policy ensuring cases are not closed prematurely have been touted as possible solutions.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines an attorney’s <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> {{in terms}} of section 29 of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act 38 of 2001 (FICA) to report suspicious and unusual transactions, which {{are not subject to}} legal professional privilege. In order to contextualise this <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> and to understand its application, terminology such as the proceeds of crime and money laundering is explained. Global best practice anti-money laundering guidelines, as manifested in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, are evaluated as well as typologies related to attorneys as targets for money laundering purposes. The establishment and development of the domestic regulatory and legislative frameworks to address the challenges around the proceeds of crime and money laundering are discussed, with specific reference to the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 121 of 1998, which inter alia criminalised money laundering, and the FICA. Special focus is placed on section 29 of FICA and terminology such as “transaction” and “suspicion” is evaluated as well as section 37 of the FICA, which acknowledges the legal professional privilege. The research explains the principles around the legal professional privilege and the requirements for the privilege to sustain and also indicates that there are clear limitations to the application of the legal professional privilege, as mere confidential information is not privileged and the right to confidentiality can be limited by legislation. The research also evaluates contradictory views around the section 29 FICA <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> by attorneys and addresses possible reasons for low reporting. As attorneys have a definite <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> {{in terms of}} section 29 of FICA, ramifications of non-reporting may include an attorney being the subject of a criminal investigation for possible association with predicate offences, offences under POCA as well as FICA non-reporting offences. Relevant role players will therefore need to partner towards assisting the profession in understanding and discharging this <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation.</b> Recommendations addressing the role of the provincial law societies as well as the Financial Intelligence Centre in assisting towards maturing the regulatory regime are also discussed. The research concludes with an ethical and positivistic approach towards discharging the <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> and suggestions regarding the way forward {{in order to protect the}} reputation of an elite profession.

Whether, and how soon, those lawyers {{are required to}} report this information to grievance authorities {{is a question that}} has received little attention from courts and scholars, despite the fact that most states have mandatory reporting rules. The dilemma for lawyers serving as testifying experts is particularly troublesome because nonreporting may result not only in discipline, but testimonial impeachment. The better view is that an expert in a pending case ordinarily has no mandatory obligation to report misconduct. This conclusion is supported by an analysis of the narrowness of the <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation,</b> the exceptions to the rule, public policy considerations related to malpractice litigation and grievance procedures, and customary professional practices. However, after litigation ends, an expert (and other lawyers) may have a duty to call evidence of serious misconduct to the attention of disciplinary authorities...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an {{international}} standard-setter and an inter-governmental body established in 1989 and has set various measures consisting of legal, regulatory and operational ones in governing money laundering and terrorism financing. Given the threats of such crimes and the vulnerabilities of some professions and businesses to such crimes, in 2003 the FATF included them under the AML/CFT regime. Since then, those professions and businesses became the gate-keepers and known as the designated non-financial business and professions (DNFBPs). As a consequence of such inclusion, several mandatory obligations were imposed on these gate-keepers, involving customer due diligence, record-keeping, <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation,</b> the compliance function and training programme for employees. It is within this context that {{the objective of this}} paper is to examine the extent to which the FATF is moulding the AML/CFT regime in Malaysia, which in turn, is shaping the compliance of legal profession, who now have to “police” their clients for evidence of money laundering and terrorist financing.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the extent to which}} lawyers advising on the disclosure documents of their clients issued to the securities markets should be responsible for their clients’ disclosure failures. It identifies the following problems with the current framework. First, {{there is a lack of}} objective due diligence standards which lawyers are expected to meet when they are advising on public disclosure documents. Second, except for takeovers, lawyers are not subject to public enforcement actions even if they have not acted with due care and diligence in ensuring that their clients comply with their disclosure obligations. Third, private enforcement actions against lawyers are weak or non-existent. Fourth, the lack of clarity on the <b>reporting</b> <b>obligation</b> of lawyers, who suspect securities fraud committed by, or on behalf of, their corporate clients, to report up the ladder and the lack of obligation to report externally to a regulator, do not encourage lawyers to make the relevant inquiries. This article argues that the solution has to lie in imposing public oversight over the lawyers advising their clients on public disclosure documents. This is already the position taken for takeovers and there is no reason why such oversight should not be extended to all disclosure documents...|$|E
