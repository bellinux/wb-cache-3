40|$|ABSTRACT: The author {{attempted}} at revealing anatomical features <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves</b> in nine  {{species of}} the genus Strobilanthes Blume (Acanthaceae). Leaves are bifacial. The features such as resolution of vascular tissue in midrib region, occurrence of sclerenchyma, collenchyma, layers of palisade, cystoliths, sphaeraphides, etc. differ taxon to taxon and found systematically significant. They are employed devising an artificially dichotomous key as an aid in their identification...|$|R
5000|$|The small, creamy white, {{flowers are}} {{arranged}} in inflorescences borne in the axils <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves.</b> The inflorescences {{have been described as}} cymes, with up to three orders of branching, each branch being terminated by a flower. [...] Each flower is subtended by bracts. The bracts transition into a perianth of undifferentiated tepals. The tepals typically {{are arranged in}} a spiral, but sometimes are whorled at the periphery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{successful}} {{spread of}} dame's rocket in North America {{is attributed to}} its prolific seed production and because the seeds are often included in prepackaged [...] "wildflower seed" [...] mixes sold for [...] "naturalizing". The plants typically produce a low-lying <b>rosette</b> <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> the first year; in subsequent years, blooming and seed production occurs in tandem throughout the blooming season. This species is commonly found in roadside ditches, dumps and in open woodland settings, where it is noticed when in bloom. It makes an attractive, hardy garden plant and probably does not pose a threat in urban settings.|$|R
40|$|Kernels of the maize {{cultivar}} Gaspé Flint {{are known}} to mature earlier than ordinary corn belt corn if both are grown under identical field conditions (Henry, 1956). In fact it is the earliest maturing corn known in Canada, and probably the earliest in the world. The present research reports the number <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves</b> produced from planting to tessel initiation, {{and the length of}} time required for this development. From this, a general schedule of post-embryonic development from the mature kernel stage up to the time of tessel initiation was arrived at. [ [...] . ...|$|R
5000|$|The age of {{individual}} plants {{is difficult to}} assess, but many plants may be over 1000 years old. Some individuals {{may be more than}} 2000 years old. Because Welwitschia only produces a single pair <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves,</b> the plant was thought by some to be neotenic, consisting essentially of a [...] "giant seedling." [...] However, research showed that its anatomy is not consistent with the giant seedling idea. Instead, the plant is more accurately thought of as achieving its unusual morphology as a result of having [...] "lost its head" [...] (apical meristem) at an early stage.|$|R
40|$|The {{duration}} of cambial activity, {{and change in}} wood structure from early to latewood, are considered {{in relation to the}} initiation <b>of</b> scale and <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves,</b> and shoot extension, in Picea abies, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior, and Fagus sylvatica. The initiation of cambial activity appears {{to be associated with the}} production of the first scales at the shoot apex, but the cessation of cambial activity does not appear to coincide with the end of primordial initiation at the apex. In P. abies and P. menziesii leaf initiation continues at a rapid rate for several weeks after cambial activity has ceased. In Q. robur, F. excelsior, and F. sylvatica cambial activity continues longer than leaf initiation. The decline in vessel or tracheid diameter is not consistently related to the change from initiation of scales to initiation <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves.</b> In the ring porous hardwoods the rapid decline in vessel diameter at the end of the earlywood coincides with the cessation of shoot elongation, but in the other species vessel or tracheid diameter declines steadily from the beginning of the earlywood...|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} the underground organs in Ophiopogon japonicus（sensu lato）growing at the Kakuma hills, east of Kanazawa city. This species is a rhizomatous plant growing widely in Japan. Two types of rhizome were iden-tified : a vertical rhizome and an underground stolon. They are sometimes very similar in appearance and diffi-cult to identify. We {{found that the}} vertical rhizome had only <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves</b> and the underground stolon scale leaves. Thus the vertical rhizome and the underground stolon can be identified whether they have the remains <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves</b> or not. The vertical rhizome and the underground stolon also differed in the growth pattern. These results lead {{to the conclusion that}} two types of plant grew side by side with each other at the Kakuma hills; one has only the vertical rhizome and the other develops the underground stolon as well as the vertical rhizome...|$|R
50|$|After germination, the {{seedling}} produces two cotyledons which grow to 25-35 mm in length, {{and have}} reticulate venation. Subsequently, two <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves</b> are produced {{at the edge}} of a woody bilobed crown. The permanent leaves are opposite (at right angles to the cotyledons), amphistomatic (producing stomata on both sides of the leaf), parallel-veined and ribbon-shaped. Shortly after the appearance <b>of</b> the <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves,</b> the apical meristem dies and meristematic activity is transferred to the periphery of the crown.|$|R

40|$|Bulbs of Lycoris radiata and L. squamigera did {{not form}} flower buds {{when they were}} moved from {{outdoors}} to the glasshouse kept above 20 ℃ on or before December 20 and on or before February 20, respectively. Among bulbs grown at 15 ℃ day/ 12 ℃ night, 20 ℃/ 17 ℃ and 25 ℃/ 25 ℃ {{since the middle of}} September, those of L. radiata at 25 ℃/ 25 ℃ and of L. squamigera at 20 ℃/ 17 ℃ and 25 ℃/ 25 ℃ did not initiate flower buds. These results indicate that L. squamigera requires longer and lower temperature than L. radiata for floral induction. After the cold requirement had been satisfied, an earlier heating caused earlier flower bud development. High temperature above a critical range also caused reduction in bulb size and provoked an untimely emergence <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{investigating the}} proportion of several types <b>of</b> tree <b>foliages</b> <b>leaves</b> as animal feed in different locations and altitudes in Malang Raya. The case {{study was conducted in}} five districts of Malang Raya where were assumed as the centre of goat farms. The results showed that there were 30 types of forage used as goat feeds, both <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> tree <b>foliages</b> and shrubs, or grasses, crop residues and others. Most forages (73 %) were <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> tree <b>foliages</b> and shrubs, both legumes, and non-legumes. Tree <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves</b> were more used as goat feeds in the study area with higher altitude, whereas in the area with lower altitude, farmers also utilized grasses and crop residues. The <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> tree <b>foliages</b> were Paraserianthes falcataria, Gliricidia sepium, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Leucaena leucocephala and Calliandra calothyrsus. Paraserianthes falcataria was most widely used in Klampok-Singosari (88. 3 %). The proportion of Calliandra calothyrsus ranged from 32 to 98 %, while Gliricidia sepium was 58 - 98 %, both were most widely used in Argoyuwono-Ampelgading. Artocarpus heterophyllus was most widely used in Wajak (90. 3 %), whereas Leucaena leucocephala leaf was used by all respondents (100 %) in Sumberdem-Wonosari.

40|$|I {{take this}} {{opportunity}} of placing on record the occurrence of Brachycome melanocarpa. Sonder et F. von Mueller as a native of Tasmania. It has as yet only been gathered on the eastern slope of Mount Wellington, in a damp locality at about 3, 000 feet altitude, but probably occurs elsewhere, only its general resemblance to B. scapiformis, D. C., has caused it to be overlooked. It has hitherto been recorded from South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. A tufted perennial, sending up annual flowering scapes of usually four to ten inches in height, as in B. scapiformis, it differs in being more extensively hirsute; the leaf has a long attenuated base or petiole, an obcuneate apex with usually seven bold dentures;the scape is coarser, with more leafy bracts, or commonly bears a gradually reduced series <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves,</b> but these characters are not quite constant for either species...|$|R

40|$|General Description. —White alling, {{also known}} as wild olive, mangle bobo, aceituna Americana, olivier bard, and oliba, is a shrub or small tree usually 3 or 4 m in height, {{occasionally}} reaching 9 m and 15 cm in stem diameter. Although seedlings have a tap and lateral root system, older plants rely on shallow lateral roots that are stiff and brittle with a brown, corky bark. Trunks of white alling are usually covered with a thick, light brown, furrowed bark. The heartwood is light gray-brown, hard, heavy, and somewhat brittle; the sapwood is tan in color. Multiple stems commonly diverge {{from the base of}} the principal stem. The crowns are vertical and narrow with a thin complement <b>of</b> <b>foliage.</b> <b>Leaves</b> are oblong to linear-lanceolate, 3 to 11 cm long by 1 to 2 cm broad, and pointed at both ends. The usually solitary, axillary tubular flowers are yellow blotched with purple and 2 cm long. Drupes are ovoid, tapering to a point with a permanently attached style. Their corky-textured flesh is yellowish-green to yellow at maturity, has a slightly bitter taste, and contains a single hardshelle...|$|R
50|$|Verticordia sieberi is a shrub with {{a single}} main branch and which usually grows to a height of less than 1.5 m. It is {{sometimes}} a compact, small shrub but may also be openly branched with the flowers held high above most <b>of</b> the <b>foliage.</b> The <b>leaves</b> are linear to elliptic, 2-8 mm long and semi-circular in cross-section.|$|R
50|$|The crown is {{a rather}} dense head <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> with <b>leaves</b> that are stiff, palmate up to 10 m in {{diameter}} and petioles of two to four metres in length. The leaf is plicate at the base, cut one third or more into segments 4-10 cm broad with bifid end which are often drooping. A triangular cleft develops at the petiole base. The palm leaves form a huge funnel that intercepts particulate material, especially pollen, which is flushed {{to the base of}} the trunk when it rains. In this way, Lodoicea improves its nutrient supply and that of its dispersal-limited offspring.|$|R
50|$|The caudex is cylindrical, {{surrounded}} by the persistent petiole bases. Most species form distinct branched or unbranched trunks but in some species the main trunk can be subterranean with the leaf crown appearing to arise directly from the ground. There are two types <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> - <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves</b> and scaly <b>leaves.</b> The <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves</b> are pinnate (or more rarely bipinnate) and arranged spirally, with thick and hard keratinose. They are not permanent and fall off leaving back leaf-bases. The leaflets are articulated, have midrib but lack secondary veins. The scaly leaves are persistent, brown in colour and protective in function. Megasporophylls are not gathered in cones. Pollination takes place by air.|$|R
50|$|Morphologically, Johnson's {{seagrass}} {{is recognized}} {{by the presence of}} pairs <b>of</b> linearly shaped <b>foliage</b> <b>leaves,</b> each with a petiole formed on the node of a horizontally creeping rhizome. The rhizome is located at or just below the sediment surface and is anchored to unconsolidated substrate by unbranched roots. The leaves are generally 2-5 cm long (including the petioles), and the rhizome internodes rarely exceed 3-5 cm in length, making this species appear diminutive relative to the larger seagrasses.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{pathogenicity}} and overwintering {{survival of the}} foliar nematode, Aphelenchoides fragariae, infecting Hosta spp. Nematodes applied to either lower or upper sides of noninjured and injured hosta leaves were able to infect and produce typical symptoms on nine cultivars. Leaves of only four cultivars (Borschi, Fragrant Blue, Patomic Pride, and Olive Bailey Langdon) showed no symptoms of nematode infection. The nematodes overwintered as juveniles and adults in soil, dry leaves, and dormant buds, but not in roots. Nematode winter survival was higher in dormant buds and soil from the polyhouse than in an open home garden. Of the nematodes found in the dormant buds, 35 % to 79 % were located between the first two outside layers of the buds. The nematodes tolerated 8 hr exposure to 40 °C and − 80 °C in leaf tissues. Relative humidity influenced nematode migration from soil to leaves. The presence of nematodes only on the outer surface <b>of</b> <b>foliage</b> (<b>leaves</b> and petioles) confirmed the migration of A. fragariae {{on the surface of}} the plants. Of the total number of nematodes found on the foliage, 25 % to 46 % and 66 % to 77 % were alive at 90 % and 100 % relative humidity, respectively, suggesting that high moisture is required for the survival and upward movement of nematodes. We conclude that A. fragariae can overwinter in soil, infected dry leaves, and dormant buds and migrate in films of water on the outer surface of the plant during spring to leaves to initiate infection...|$|R
