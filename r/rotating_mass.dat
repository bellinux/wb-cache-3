5|$|Our {{solar system}} orbits within the Milky Way, a {{barred spiral galaxy}} that is a {{prominent}} member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a <b>rotating</b> <b>mass</b> of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.|$|E
25|$|The GP-B gyro {{consists}} of a nearly-perfect spherical <b>rotating</b> <b>mass</b> made of fused quartz, which provides a dielectric support for {{a thin layer of}} niobium superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.|$|E
25|$|Tests of the Lense–Thirring precession, {{consisting}} of small secular precessions of {{the orbit of}} a test particle in motion around a central <b>rotating</b> <b>mass,</b> for example, a planet or a star, have been performed with the LAGEOS satellites, but many aspects of them remain controversial. The same effect may have been detected in the data of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, a former probe in orbit around Mars; also such a test raised a debate. First attempts to detect the Sun's Lense–Thirring effect on the perihelia of the inner planets have been recently reported as well. Frame dragging would cause the orbital plane of stars orbiting near a supermassive black hole to precess about the black hole spin axis. This effect should be detectable {{within the next few}} years via astrometric monitoring of stars at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. By comparing the rate of orbital precession of two stars on different orbits, it is possible in principle to test the no-hair theorems of general relativity.|$|E

500|$|Near a <b>rotating</b> <b>mass,</b> {{there are}} gravitomagnetic or frame-dragging effects. A distant {{observer}} will determine that objects {{close to the}} mass get [...] "dragged around". This is most extreme for rotating black holes where, for any object entering a zone known as the ergosphere, rotation is inevitable. Such effects can again be tested through their influence on the orientation of gyroscopes in free fall. Somewhat controversial tests have been performed using the LAGEOS satellites, confirming the relativistic prediction. Also the Mars Global Surveyor probe around Mars has been used.|$|E
500|$|A {{black hole}} is an object with a {{gravitational}} field that is sufficiently powerful {{that it can}} prevent light from escaping. When they are formed from {{the collapse of a}} <b>rotating</b> <b>mass,</b> they retain all of the angular momentum that is not shed in the form of ejected gas. This rotation causes the space within an oblate spheroid-shaped volume, called the [...] "ergosphere", to be dragged around with the black hole. Mass falling into this volume gains energy by this process and some portion of the mass can then be ejected without falling into the black hole. When the mass is ejected, the black hole loses angular momentum (the [...] "Penrose process"). The rotation rate of a black hole has been measured as high as 98.7% of the speed of light.|$|E
500|$|In spiral galaxies, {{the spiral}} arms {{do have the}} shape of {{approximate}} logarithmic spirals, a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in a uniformly <b>rotating</b> <b>mass</b> of stars. Like the stars, the spiral arms rotate around the center, but they do so with constant angular velocity. The spiral arms {{are thought to be}} areas of high-density matter, or [...] "density waves". As stars move through an arm, the space velocity of each stellar system is modified by the gravitational force of the higher density. (The velocity returns to normal after the stars depart {{on the other side of}} the arm.) This effect is akin to a [...] "wave" [...] of slowdowns moving along a highway full of moving cars. The arms are visible because the high density facilitates star formation, and therefore they harbor many bright and young stars.|$|E

500|$|The Scharnhorst-class {{ships were}} built with nine 28.3cm (11.1 inch) SK C/34 54.5caliber quick-firing guns in three triple turrets, two forward and one aft. These guns were an {{improvement}} over the earlier 28.3cm SK C/28 guns mounted on the Deutschland-class cruisers. While the 28.3cm guns were of a smaller caliber than main guns of other navies, they were still preferred {{by a number of}} gunnery officers in the Kriegsmarine due to their higher rate of fire. The guns were equipped with three different types of shells, an armour-piercing (AP) L/4,4 shell that weighed 330kg (727.5lb) and two high explosive (HE) shells that both weighed 315kg (694.4lb)— an L/4,4 type with a base fuse and an L/4,5 version with a nose fuse. All three types of shells used the same propellant charges: an RPC/38 42.5kg (93.7lb) fore charge and an RPC/38 76.5kg (168.6lb) main charge. They fired these shells at a rate of fire of 3.5rounds per minute. Muzzle velocity for the AP shells was 890meters per second (2,920feet per second); the guns were expected to fire 300 rounds before enough wear had been incurred to warrant replacement. Scharnhorsts and Gneisenaus guns were mounted in three Drh LC/34 turrets. The turrets were named, in alphabetical order from the bow of the ship: [...] "Anton", [...] "Bruno" [...] and [...] "Cäsar". Similarly to most other German installations, those turrets had an electric system of rotation, but all other operations were hydraulic systems. Although <b>rotating</b> <b>mass</b> of the turret was 750 tonnes (internal barbette diameter 10.2 m), traversing speed was quite good– 7.2 deg/sec. The turrets allowed depression of the guns to −8° and elevation to 40° for [...] "A" [...] and [...] "C" [...] turrets, while [...] "B" [...] turret was capable of depressing to −9°. At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to 40,930m (44,760yards).|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{preceding}} Pup and Triplane, the Camel {{was considered to}} be difficult to fly. The type owed both its extreme manoeuvrability and its difficult handling to the close placement of the engine, pilot, guns and fuel tank (some 90% of the aircraft's weight) within the front seven feet of the aircraft, and to the strong gyroscopic effect of the <b>rotating</b> <b>mass</b> of the cylinders common to rotary engines. Aviation author Robert Jackson notes that: [...] "in the hands of a novice it displayed vicious characteristics that could make it a killer; but under the firm touch of a skilled pilot, who knew how to turn its vices to his own advantage, {{it was one of the}} most superb fighting machines ever built".|$|E
2500|$|The turbine {{generator}} {{consists of a}} series of steam turbines interconnected to each other and a generator on a common shaft. There is usually a high-pressure turbine at one end, followed by an intermediate-pressure turbine, and finally one, two, or three low-pressure turbines, and the generator. As steam moves through the system and loses pressure and thermal energy, it expands in volume, requiring increasing diameter and longer blades at each succeeding stage to extract the remaining energy. The entire <b>rotating</b> <b>mass</b> may be over 200 metric tons and [...] long. It is so heavy that it must be kept turning slowly even when shut down (at 3 rpm) so that the shaft will not bow even slightly and become unbalanced.

40|$|In {{this paper}} some {{analytical}} developments concerning {{the possibility of}} generating a rectilinear motion of vessels subject to vibration, {{without the use of}} propellers are presented. The motion is obtained by a device equipped with counter <b>rotating</b> <b>masses</b> installed in the boat which vibrates along the longitudinal direction. The hull has a suitably shaped stern. The study considers an analysis for evaluating the energy that the propulsion system consumes in relation to its performances. A further aim was to increase the speed of the system. This result is obtained by using elliptical gears to transmit the motion from the driving motor to a two or more pairs of counter <b>rotating</b> <b>masses.</b> This solution allows one to reach the variability of the angular velocity of the counter <b>rotating</b> <b>masses</b> during each revolution in accordance with certain laws that maximize the thrust applied to the vessel preferentially along a direction with respect to the opposite one, all things being equal. A formulation to compute the propulsive efficiency of the device study is developed. Some remarks in relation to practical applications and critical issues of the proposed approach are shortly discussed. In {{the second part of the}} paper the results relative to a vessel 13 m long are illustrated...|$|R
60|$|Take {{first the}} {{relation}} between the planes of the planetary orbits and the plane of the Sun's equator. If, when the nebulous spheroid extended beyond the orbit of Neptune, all parts of it had been revolving exactly in the same plane, or rather in parallel planes--if all its parts had had one axis; then the planes of the successive rings would have been coincident {{with each other and with}} that of the Sun's rotation. But it needs only to go back to the earlier stages of concentration, to see that there could exist no such complete uniformity of motion. The flocculi, already described as precipitated from an irregular and widely-diffused nebula, and as starting from all points to their common centre of gravity, must move not in one plane but in innumerable planes, cutting each other at all angles. The gradual establishment of a vortical motion such as we at present see indicated in the spiral nebulæ, is the gradual approach towards motion in one plane. But this plane can but slowly become decided. Flocculi not moving in this plane, but entering into the aggregation at various inclinations, will tend to perform their revolutions round its centre in their own planes; and only in course of time will their motions be partly destroyed by conflicting ones, and partly resolved into the general motion. Especially will the outermost portions of the <b>rotating</b> <b>mass</b> retain for a long time their more or less independent directions. Hence the probabilities are, that the planes of the rings first detached will differ considerably from the average plane of the mass; while the planes of those detached latest will differ from it less.|$|E

When system load increases, grid inertia is initially used to supply the load. This, however, leads to a decrease in the stored kinetic energy of the turbine generators. Since the mechanical power of these turbines correlates with the delivered electrical power, the turbine generators have a decrease in angular velocity, which is directly proportional to a decrease in frequency in synchronous generators. The purpose of the turbine-governor control is to maintain the desired system frequency by adjusting the mechanical power output of the turbine.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{investigates the}} {{unidirectional}} motion {{of an object}} forced to move on the ground due to an attached inertial drive which comprises counter-rotating eccentric masses on the horizontal plane. The study deals with the {{case in which the}} motion is generated by motors rotating at high speed, preferably constant. This inertial propulsion eventually enables the body to travel a limited maximum distance, which was found to be proportional to the square of the motor speed and inversely proportional to the coefficient of sliding (kinetic) friction. Other significant parameters such as the ratio of <b>rotating</b> <b>masses</b> over the object mass, as well as the initial position of these masses when the object is released to move and the magnitude of eccentricity, are discussed. The simulation is based on the combination of analytical formulas with the numerical solution of Single-DOF nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the unidirectional motion of the object to which the <b>rotating</b> <b>masses</b> are attached...|$|R
50|$|Inertial Response is a {{property}} of large synchronous generators, which contain large synchronous <b>rotating</b> <b>masses,</b> and which acts {{to overcome the}} immediate imbalance between power supply and demand for electric power systems, typically the electrical grid. Due to the ever existing power imbalance between mechanical power supply and electric power demand the rotational frequency of the <b>rotating</b> <b>masses</b> in all sychronous generators in the grid either speed up (excess power supply) or slow down (excess power demand). This enables the grid operator to rebalance the system {{in order to stop}} the speed change, resulting in a relatively small variation in AC frequency ideally within the allowable frequency range of that system. i.e. A 50 Hz system may allow a ±0.5 Hz deviation in the frequency of the AC voltageThe grid frequency is the combined result of the detailed motions of all individual synchronous rotors in the grid, which are modeled by a general equation of motion called the Swing Equation.|$|R
