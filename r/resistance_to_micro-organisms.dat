40|$|The growing {{emergency}} due to {{the phenomenon}} of drug <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> has pushed forward the search for new potential drug alternatives to those already in use. Plants represent a suitable source of new antifungal molecules, as they produce a series of defensive proteins. Among them are the PRPs (pathogenesisrelated proteins), shown {{to be effective in}} vitro against human pathogens. An optimized and established cell-suspension culture of maize (Zea mays) was shown to constitutively secrete in the medium a series of PRPs comprising the antifungal protein zeamatin (P 33679) with a final yield of approx. 3 mg/litre. The invitro- produced zeamatin possessed antifungal activity towards a clinical strain of the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, an activity comparable with the one reported for the same protein extracted from maize seeds. Along with zeamatin, other PRPs were expressed: a 9 kDa lipid-transfer protein, a 26 kDa xylanase inhibitor and a new antifungal protein, PR- 5. A fast, two-step chromatographic procedure was set up allowing the complete purification of the proteins considered, making this cell line a valuable system for the production of potential antifungal agents in a reliable and easy wa...|$|E
40|$|The high {{temperature}} treatment of wood {{is one of}} the alternatives to chemical treatment. During this process, the wood is heated to higher temperatures than those of conventional drying. The wood structure changes due to decomposition of hemicelluloses, ramification of lignin, and crystallization of cellulose. The wood becomes less hygroscopic. These changes improve the dimensional stability of wood, increase its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>micro-organisms,</b> darken its color, and modify its hardness. However, wood also might loose some of its elasticity. Consequently, the heat treatment conditions have to be optimized. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the transformation of the chemical structure of wood caused by the treatment. In this study, the modification of the surface composition of the wood was followed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and inverse gas chromatography (IGC) under different experimental conditions. The effect of maximum treatment temperatures on the chemical composition of Canadian birch and aspen as well as the correlations between their chemical transformation and different mechanical properties are presented. FTIR analysis results showed that the heat treatment affected the chemical composition of birch more compared to that of aspen. The results of IGC tests illustrated that the surfaces of the aspen and birch became more basic with heat treatment. The mechanical properties were affected by degradation of hemicellulose, ramification of lignin and cellulose crystallization...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAmong the {{difficulties}} of preparation of ligno-cellulosic biomass-filled concrete are its hygroscopicity, its sensitivity to degradation in strong alkaline media and its probable low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>micro-organisms.</b> Among the many methods have been explored and tested to solve these difficulties. We are reporting here the use of high temperature thermal treatment. We applied heat on miscanthus with the hope to reduce hygroscopicity, enhance alkali resistance and dimensional stability, without using any chemical treatment. The effects of heat treatment atmosphere on chemical modifications and behaviours of treated miscanthus were investigated. The parameters which were varied were atmospheres (vacuum and nitrogen), time and treatment temperature. Mass loss, with {{closely related to the}} degree of miscanthus modifications is the parameter used to control the treatment conditions. At the same treatment intensity, miscanthus treated under nitrogen has lower mass loss than those treated under vacuum. Under vacuum, volatile degraded products are continuously removed, which can help to stop their recondensation or cross linking reactions occurring on the surface of miscanthus stems. Reductions in water absorption and in mass loss in alkali medium with thermally treated Miscanthus are observed. The hydrophilicity of treated miscanthus is expected to decrease. The resulting products likely have an improvement in decay resistance due to the removal of hemicelluloses which are low stability and are mostly degraded during treatment. At elevated temperature, cellulose and lignin are also modified. After thermal treatment, miscanthus chips were used to prepare lightweight concrete blocks with a common Portland cement as a binder. The amount of sugars released during concrete preparation process, which can contribute to the inhibition of cement hydration or delay in cement setting time, was determined. The interactions between miscanthus chips and cement were characterised. We will evaluate the potential of this method for improving concrete preparation...|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of gramicidin, penicillin, streptomycin, and the numerous other antibiotics known today has contributed materially {{to the list}} of therapeutic agents available against micro-organisms. However, the immediate enthusiasm which greeted their introduction has had to be checked by the realization that many of the important organisms affected readily develop <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the antibiotic agents, just as they have to the sulfonamides. Further knowledge of the mechanisms by which organisms acquire such resistances may be fundamental {{to our understanding of the}} mechanism of action of the antibiotic. On the practical side, too, there is the possibility, remote as it may be, that insight into the problem might enable effective countermeasures to be instituted. Our kn,owledge of the rOle of individual enzymes in metabolism is due in part to the experimental use of inhibiting substances which block these catalysts more or less specifically.

To partially overcome biofilms <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> biocides alternative strategies are being developped. So a wealth of biological antibiofilm agents are under development in the research laboratories but there are only few products on the market and none of them proved to be universal antibiofilm molecules. However, most of these antibiofilm agents may benefit from the "swimmers" approach that would act synergistically by allowing a better infiltration and/or an in situ delivery in the targets biofilms. The goal of the project, Greenswimmers 1, is to identify the "best" bacteria for this purpose of infiltration and biocide delivery. In this technical report we explain how we evaluated the efficiency of swimmers with respect to infiltration of Stapyloccocus Aureus biofilms. This evaluation relies on the kinematics properties of swimmers and on the kinematics of the porous network created by the swimmers, in interaction with the biofilm. Practically, we addressed the tracking of the swimmers with the successful multiple particle tracking algorithm, U-Track, we improved in order to exploit the information from two channels of the biofilm video under the microscope. We also combined swimmers detection and poresegmentation for a more robust estimation of pores. A first step in pore segmentation consists in partitioning the images from the movies with superpixel decomposition. Eventually, more than three hundreds movies were analyzed for eight species and several strains of each of them. Parameters such as speed, persistence, pore area, e-DNA proportion were estimated from the data...|$|R

In our study we evaluated the antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci isolated from eight types of vegetables {{randomly selected from}} grocery stores in Naples. Methods: From July to November 2008, we analyzed 150 samples: the bacteria were isolated with standardized methods and antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the disc diffusion method. The <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> vancomycin versus other antibiotics was assessed by the Kappa test. Results: 70 % of the samples, mainly parsley (96. 2 %), showed enterococci. Of these, 59. 1 % belonged to the species Enterococcus faecium. Strains resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin were isolated respectively in 47. 6 % and 49. 5 % of the samples: the first one mainly in curly endive (72. 7 %) and the second one in parsley (76. 9 %).

A pressure of 300 MPa at 10 °C for 20 min was required to completely reduce the population of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a pressure of 350 MPa was needed to reduce most of the Gram-negative bacteria and moulds. The Gram-positive bacteria were more resistant, and pressures of 400 MPa were unable to completely reduce their populations.

In the tomatoes, the skin loosened and peeled away, though the flesh remained firm, and colour and flavour were unchanged. The lettuce remained firm but underwent browning; flavour was unaffected.
