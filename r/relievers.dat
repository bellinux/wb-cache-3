5|$|Affeldt {{finished}} the 2008 {{season with a}} 3.33 ERA in seventyfour games. He {{was also one of}} only five NL <b>relievers</b> to pitch seventy-five innings and average one strikeout per inning, along with Joel Hanrahan, Aaron Heilman, Hong-Chih Kuo, and Carlos Mármol.

5|$|In the American League {{and others}} with the DH rule, there will usually be nine {{offensive}} regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight <b>relievers,</b> a backup catcher {{and two or three}} other reserves; the need for late-inning pinch-hitters is reduced by the DH.|$|E

5|$|In {{his last}} two seasons with Chicago, Pierce posted records of just 14–7 and 10–9, but a shaky bullpen contributed to his {{middling}} record; although he left {{the game with a}} lead in the sixth inning or later 15 times in those seasons, White Sox <b>relievers</b> failed to protect that lead seven times. Indeed, Pierce was seen to be the team's only consistently effective starter in 1960, picking up eight complete-game victories by mid-August. On June 20, 1961, Pierce broke Ed Walsh's White Sox record of 1,732 career strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|The Reliever of the Year Awards {{are based}} on the vote of a nine-member panel that {{consists}} of the top five <b>relievers</b> in career saves (among non-active pitchers)—Rivera, Hoffman, Lee Smith, John Franco, and Billy Wagner—and the four living relief pitchers who are in the Hall of Fame: Dennis Eckersley, Rollie Fingers, Goose Gossage, and Bruce Sutter. Each voter selects three pitchers for each league based solely on their performance in the regular season; a 5-3-1 weighted point system is used to determine the winner.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned. However, Bayer Aspirin made up {{only a small fraction of}} the British aspirin market because of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain <b>relievers</b> to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Divergent {{strategies}} have emerged {{for the management}} of severe asthma. One strategy utilises high and fixed doses of maintenance treatment, usually inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β 2 -agonist (ICS/LABA), supplemented by a short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA) as needed. Alternatively, budesonide/formoterol is used as both maintenance and <b>reliever</b> therapy. The latter is superior to fixed-dose treatment in reducing severe exacerbations while achieving similar or better asthma control in other regards. Exacerbations may be reduced by the use of budesonide/formoterol as <b>reliever</b> medication during periods of unstable asthma. We examined the risk of a severe exacerbation in the period after a single day with high <b>reliever</b> use. Methods Episodes of high <b>reliever</b> use were quantified and exacerbations occurring post-index day with these episodes were examined post hoc in two double-blind studies comparing the efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol maintenance and <b>reliever</b> therapy (Symbicort SMART™, Turbuhaler®) 160 / 4. 5 [*]μg twice daily plus as needed with similar or higher maintenance doses of ICS/LABA plus SABA or formoterol. Results Budesonide/formoterol maintenance and <b>reliever</b> therapy significantly reduced the risk of episodes of high <b>reliever</b> use (> 6 inhalations/day) vs. all alternative ICS/LABA regimens. With conventional fixed-dose treatment the need for exacerbation treatment within 21 [*]days ranged from 6. 0 – 10. 1 % of days post-index for all regimens compared with 2. 5 – 3. 4 % of days with budesonide/formoterol maintenance and <b>reliever</b> therapy. Conclusions Budesonide/formoterol maintenance and <b>reliever</b> therapy reduces the incidence of high <b>reliever</b> episodes and the exacerbation burden immediately following these episodes vs. alternative ICS/LABA plus SABA regimens at up to double the maintenance dose of ICS.

5|$|Before {{he could}} appear in any games with Colorado Springs, López was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 14. Due to major league rules, Arizona {{was unable to}} call him up until April 24. He had another poor season, having a record of 1–1 and an 11.02 ERA, {{the highest in the}} majors among <b>relievers</b> who made at least 30 appearances. On July 5, López was {{designated}} for assignment to make room on the roster for Armando Almanza. He cleared waivers and was sent down to the Tucson Sidewinders of the Pacific Coast League {{for the rest of the}} season. He went 0–1 with a 2.22 ERA. On October 15, he was granted free agency.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 {{he led the}} Major Leagues {{in games}} pitched, with 81, while also leading the Majors in holds, with 33. The 1994 MLB season was Shortened to 115 games for the Giants; however, over 36 games pitched, Jackson led National League <b>relievers</b> in ERA (1.49), opponents average (.164), and hits per 9.0 innings pitched (4.9) while {{finishing}} second in strikeouts per 9.0 innings pitched (10.84). The already shortened season was again shortened for Jackson due to tendinitis in his right elbow. This led to two stints on the disabled list: one from June 17 until July 2, and another from July 6 {{until the end of}} the season. On October 17, 1994, Jackson was granted free agency.|$|E
5|$|The Major League Baseball Delivery Man Award is {{presented}} by Major League Baseball {{to the best}} relief pitcher in the league. The award was developed in 2005, {{as part of a}} sponsorship agreement between Major League Baseball and package delivery company DHL Express. A monthly version of the award is also handed out to <b>relievers</b> during the season. The annual award ("DHL presents the Delivery Man of the Year") is voted upon by fans, while the monthly edition ("DHL presents the Major League Baseball Delivery Man of the Month") is decided by a four-man panel of baseball experts and commentators. The 2017 recipients of the annual award were Craig Kimbrel of the Boston Red Sox and Kenley Jansen of the Los Angeles Dodgers.|$|E
5000|$|Looking {{to improve}} the bullpen after the struggles of the 2008 season, the Mets signed closer Francisco Rodríguez to a three-year, $37 million {{contract}} on December 10, 2008. [...] Immediately after, the team acquired <b>reliever</b> J. J. Putz from the Seattle Mariners in a three team trade involving the Mariners and the Cleveland Indians, giving the Mets a setup man for Rodriguez. New York shipped <b>reliever</b> Aaron Heilman, outfielder Endy Chávez, pitcher Jason Vargas and three minor leaguers to Seattle for Putz, center fielder Jeremy Reed and <b>reliever</b> Sean Green, while Mets <b>reliever</b> Joe Smith was acquired by Cleveland.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain <b>relievers),</b> and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|Rivera is {{regarded}} within baseball {{as one of}} the most dominant <b>relievers</b> in major league history. Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, he saved at least 25games in 15consecutive seasons and posted an ERA under 2.00 in 11seasons, both of which are records. His career 2.21ERA and 1.00WHIP are the lowest in the live-ball era among qualified pitchers. Fellow players credit him with popularizing the cut fastball across the major leagues. Along with his signature pitch, Rivera was known for his precise control, smooth pitching motion, and for his composure and reserved demeanor on the field. In 2013, the Yankees retired his uniform number 42; he was the last major league player to wear the number full-time, following its league-wide retirement in honor of Jackie Robinson. Rivera has been involved in philanthropic causes and the Christian community through the Mariano Rivera Foundation. He is considered to be a strong candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame once he is eligible.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{ended the}} month with a five-game series, {{continuing}} into June, against the New York Mets. Although Buchanan's second major-league {{start in the}} series opener was a quality start, the Phillies offense managed one run for a 4–1 loss. The last two games of May went 14 innings apiece, with the Phillies winning the first and losing the second. In the first game A. J. Burnett threw seven innings and allowed five runs, after which six <b>relievers</b> threw a combined seven scoreless innings. Ruiz had four hits and Brown had four RBIs; Reid Brignac hit a walk-off RBI single to left field in the 14th inning, scoring Byrd for a 6–5 win. The next night, after the Phillies fell behind 4–0, Howard hit a seventh-inning three-run home run; {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, Brown hit an RBI single to tie the game and send it into extra innings. In the 14th inning David Wright hit an RBI single to take the lead, which the Mets' bullpen held to win 5–4.|$|E

50|$|New Mets manager George Bamberger used Zachry as both {{a starter}} and <b>reliever</b> in 1982. He went 2-3 with a 2.11 ERA as a <b>reliever,</b> and earned his first career save on August 15 against the Cubs.|$|R
50|$|On July 30, 2011, the Rangers traded Hunter {{and first}} baseman Chris Davis to the Baltimore Orioles for <b>reliever</b> Koji Uehara. In the 2012 season, Hunter posted a 7-8 record. He was a starter for a while, but was optioned to Triple A Norfolk. He {{was placed in}} the bullpen as a <b>reliever.</b> As a <b>reliever</b> Hunter's fastball {{averaged}} 96 MPH over the month of September, and topped out at 100 MPH, after averaging 91-92 MPH for his career.|$|R
5|$|After {{spending}} {{two weeks}} {{on the disabled list}} with a groin strain during the opening month of the 1998 season, Rivera continued to establish himself as one of the major leagues' best closers. Moreover, he became the central figure of a Yankees bullpen that, supported by middle <b>relievers</b> Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton, contributed to the team's late-1990s dynasty. That year, Rivera made the cutter one of his primary pitches, and it quickly became his signature, earning a reputation for breaking hitters' bats with its sharp lateral movement. He saved 36games in 41opportunities and had a 1.91ERA in the regular season. In the 1998 postseason, he pitched scoreless innings and saved six games, three of which came in the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. Rivera's save in Game 4 of the series clinched the Yankees' championship, capping off a season in which they won an MLB-record 125games combined in the regular season and the postseason. By season's end, Rivera had allowed only two earned runs in 35 career postseason innings pitched—a 0.51ERA—and by passing 30innings pitched, he qualified for the major league record for lowest postseason career ERA; it is a record he still holds after 141innings pitched.|$|E

25|$|Despite the team's winning ways in April, {{the bullpen}} {{was a source}} of {{problems}} all month, with its combined 5.70 ERA ranking as the highest in the National League during April. Nationals <b>relievers</b> pitched in all 25 games in April and gave up runs in 19 of them. Although Nationals <b>relievers</b> issued a National League-lowest 2.93 walks per nine innings and threw a higher percentage of their pitches in the strike zone than any other MLB bullpen by a full two percentage points, they also threw the fourth-lowest number of first-pitch strikes among MLB bullpens, suggesting problems with command in the strike zone. Much of the bullpen's struggles came from <b>relievers</b> giving up 1.86 home runs per nine innings, a rate one full home run higher than the previous season's.|$|E
