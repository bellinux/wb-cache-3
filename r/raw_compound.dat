50|$|In the {{extrusion}} of plastics, the <b>raw</b> <b>compound</b> {{material is}} commonly {{in the form}} of nurdles (small beads, often called resin) that are gravity fed from a top mounted hopper into the barrel of the extruder. Additives such as colorants and UV inhibitors (in either liquid or pellet form) are often used and can be mixed into the resin prior to arriving at the hopper. The process has much in common with plastic injection molding from the point of the extruder technology though it differs in that it is usually a continuous process. While pultrusion can offer many similar profiles in continuous lengths, usually with added reinforcing, this is achieved by pulling the finished product out of a die instead of extruding the polymer melt through a die.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In {{this study}} I am {{examining}} {{the efficiency and}} performance of high dividend, zero dividend and repurchase yield investing strategies in developed European markets from 1988 to 2008. Between these three portfolios I am to discover the relationship between different payout strategies to portfolio returns. I am also studying the performance of these three strategies in bull and bear market. DATA I studied 1, 880 companies from 16 European countries between 1988 and 2008. I constructed a Euro 750 index, which comprised of 750 largest companies in each year measured by their market capitalization. From the Euro 750 I formed Top 25, Zero and Repo portfolios. RESULTS The main {{findings in this study}} are that the high dividend yield portfolio earns higher <b>raw</b> <b>compound</b> returns and risk-adjusted returns than market portfolio in the full time period but this is mainly due to the excellent performance in the first decade. The positive return margin is later diminished but the defensive characteristics have improved. Furthermore, prolonging the investing period improves the performance. High dividend yield strategy is superior in the bear market especially in the 1998 to 2008 time period and it has the lowest beta. Zero dividend strategy is inferior to the market portfolio and it is not able to outperform the market portfolio in the bull market periods in spite of the higher beta. Repurchase strategy is as a stand-alone risky but when combined with high dividend yield strategy it improves the excess return to the market portfolio at the cost of higher volatility and risk...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} reports {{the development of}} phospholipid vesicles for the coincorporation of quercetin and resveratrol, proposed as a new strategy to treat skin lesions by exploiting the combinatorial effect of the two polyphenols. Quercetin and resveratrol have gained great interest in the pharmaceutical research area due to their wide spectrum of therapeutic activities (i. e., antioxidant, antiradical, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic), coupled with their safety profile (they have GRAS status) and natural origin (they are commonly found in fruits and vegetables). Liposomes were prepared by direct sonication of phosphatidylcholine (Lipoid S 75) in buffer, {{in the presence of}} quercetin and resveratrol, in combination or as single agents. The physico-chemical properties of the vesicles were assessed by light scattering, ζ-potential, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. The antioxidant power of the two polyphenols, both as <b>raw</b> <b>compounds</b> and formulated in liposomes, was determined by the DPPH assay. The in vitro cytotoxicity and uptake of the polyphenols were tested in human fibroblasts, as well as their activity against ROS, and the in vivo antiinflammatory efficacy was assessed on TPA-treated mouse skin by the determination of oedema formation and myeloperoxidase activity. Light scattering results showed that vesicles were small in size, around 80 nm, with good homogeneity (polydispersity index ≤ 0. 25) and highly negative zeta potential values (- 36 mV), due to the charge carried by S 75. The liposomes were spherical, uni- and bilamellar structures, with good stability in terms of particle migration and aggregation, as disclosed by the Turbiscan™ technology. Further, both quercetin and resveratrol displayed a potent antioxidant activity, as DPPH radical was almost completely inhibited, even when incorporated in liposomes. The cellular uptake of quercetin and resveratrol was higher when they were formulated in liposomes rather than in solution, and when co-loaded rather than as single agents, which resulted in a superior ability to scavenge ROS. The administration of the polyphenols coloaded in liposomes on TPA-inflamed skin led to a remarkable amelioration of the tissue damage, with a significant reduction of oedema and leukocyte infiltration. Therefore, the proposed approach based on polyphenol vesicular formulations may be of value in the treatment of pre-cancerous/cancerous skin conditions associated with inflammation and oxidative stres...|$|R

This compared with 50 outbreaks during the previous 5 years (1973 - 77) when over 1500 persons and 7 deaths were recorded. Although the incidence of outbreaks has decreased {{the average number of}} persons affected in outbreaks has increased. A marked reduction was seen in the incidence of outbreaks due to Clostridium perfringens, in contrast to foodborne salmonellosis which remains a problem. Thirty-four hospitals, of which 10 reported two or more outbreaks, were involved. The type of hospitals most frequently affected were general (14), psychiatric (13), geriatric (9) and hospitals for the mentally subnormal (7). Meat, including poultry meat, was incriminated in over 90 % of outbreaks where a food vehicle was identified. In modern or re-equipped kitchens cooking in advance with subsequent reheating is being progressively discontinued as more food is being cooked on the day of consumption, a practice which may readily explain the decreasing incidence of outbreaks due to Cl. perfringens.

40|$|The use of {{agricultural}} wastes (byproducts) in various segments of brick and tile industry is increasing continuously. These additives, which are previously mixed into the <b>raw</b> or <b>compound</b> clay, start to ignite during the firing process, providing extra thermal energy inside {{the product and}} decreasing the required external energy need. Besides this effect, the combustion of additives increases the porosity of the final product resulting in enhanced thermal insulation properties. In this paper the effect of some common agricultural wastes (sawdust, rice-peel and seed-shell) on the thermal properties of brick clay products was investigated. The brick samples were prepared from the mixture of the yellow and gray clay in the ratio of 4 : 1, water content was between 15. 57 - 16. 67 wt. % and the pore-forming additives in concentrations 0, 4 and 7 wt. %. To measure the steady state thermal conductivity of the clay mixtures, samples with dimensions of 300 × 300 × 50 mm were prepared.

Micronized drug powders containing leucine as dispersibility enhancer were prepared by co-spray drying the active compound and the excipient from water or hydro-alcoholic feeds. Microparticles were fully characterized in terms of process yield, particle size distribution, morphology and drug content. The ability of the drug to reach the deepest airways after aerosolization of spray-dried formulations was evaluated by Andersen cascade impactor, using the monodose DPI as device. In order to investigate the behaviour of the drug once in contact with lung fluid, an artificial CF mucus was prepared.

We propose a method for {{simulation of}} the gasifier based on the analysis of experimental data and of the total uncertainty associated with them. The overall aim is to use data from the large amount of pilot and demonstration gasifiers in the analysis and optimization of gasification-based processes. In the method proposed a set of fuel conversion variables and their associated uncertainties are calculated using a stochastic approach that takes into account the effect of unclosed mass balance, incomplete characterization of the <b>raw</b> gas <b>compounds</b> and measurement errors. Subsequently, these fuel conversion variables are used to simulate the gasifier in a flowsheet model developed in Aspen Plus. The results include the evaluation of critical parameters, such as, gasifier efficiency, char gasification, and tar yield and their uncertainties, which depend highly on the measurement system. The method is applied to data sets derived from several measurement setups, and the results are validated with total carbon measurements. The results show that detection of ≥ 95 % of the carbon in the raw gas is necessary to maintain the uncertainty level at < 3 % and to estimate the char conversion and oxygen transport. The flowsheet model of the gasifier is applied to a database of six operational points; the results show that interpolation and extrapolation of the fuel conversion variables are possible and the gasifier is evaluated in operational conditions different from the experiments. In summary, this method is flexible with respect to different measurement setups and represents a valuable tool for process simulation using flowsheet software...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} is presented for computing meaningful pathways {{in the network}} of small molecule metabolism comprising the chemical reactions characterized in all organisms. The metabolic network {{is described as a}} weighted graph in which all the compounds are included, but each compound is assigned a weight equal to the number of reactions in which it participates. Path finding is performed in this graph by searching for one or more paths with lowest weight. Performance is evaluated systematically by computing paths between the first and last reactions in annotated metabolic pathways, and comparing the intermediate reactions in the computed pathways to those in the annotated ones. For the sake of comparison, paths are computed also in the un-weighted <b>raw</b> (all <b>compounds</b> and reactions) and filtered (highly connected pool metabolites removed) metabolic graphs, respectively. The correspondence between the computed and annotated pathways is very poor (< 30 %) in the raw graph; increasing to approximately 65 % in the filtered graph; reaching approximately 85 % in the weighted graph. Considering the best-matching path among the five lightest paths increases the correspondence to 92 %, on average. We then show that the average distance between pairs of metabolites is significantly larger in the weighted graph than in the raw unfiltered graph, suggesting that the small-world properties previously reported for metabolic networks probably result from irrelevant shortcuts through pool metabolites. In addition, we provide evidence that the length of the shortest path in the weighted graph represents a valid measure of the "metabolic distance" between enzymes. We suggest that the success of our simplistic {{approach is}} rooted in the high degree of specificity of the reactions in metabolic pathways, presumably reflecting thermodynamic constraints operating in these pathways.

In recent decades, attention of scientists has deserved lupane type pentacyclic triterpenes. Betulin is main representative of triterpenes in BOB. Birch bark comprises about 12. 50 wt. % of the tree mass from which up to 3. 40 % is outer bark which contains 25 % of betulin. Such a high content of individual compound in natural resources is very uncommon; therefore it makes the isolation of betulin from birch outer bark economically favourable on an industrial scale.

However, {{there is a}} lack of information on the thermal formation of persistent organic pollutants such as dioxins in the torrefied solid product. In this paper, we investigated the applicability of pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) for simultaneous extraction of a number of polychlorinated planar aromatic compounds from torrefied wood. The targeted compounds included polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), naphthalenes (PCNs), benzenes (PCBz), phenols (PCPhs) and PAHs. PLE tests were conducted on torrefied and non-torrefied (i. e. raw) eucalyptus wood chips using 5 single solvents (n-hexane, toluene, dichloromethane, acetone and methanol) and a mixture of n-hexane/toluene (1 : 1, v/v). The performance of each solvent was evaluated in terms of recoveries of spiked internal standards and the amount of co-extracted sample matrix. High polarity solvents such as methanol and acetone resulted in poor recoveries from torrefied wood for most of the target compounds, probably due to the high co-extraction of thermally degraded lignocellulosic <b>compounds.</b> <b>Raw</b> wood was less solvent-dependent and comparable results were obtained for polar and non-polar solvents. Toluene showed the best performance of the investigated solvents, with average recoveries of 79 +/- 14 % and 66 +/- 9 % for raw and torrefied wood, respectively. The method was validated using pentachlorophenol-tainted spruce wood chips. The proposed PLE method was compared to the traditional Soxhlet method. Results show that PLE gave equivalent or better extraction for all target compounds...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{insulation}} {{properties of}} phenolic foams that demonstrate low thermal conductivity and relatively low costs of initial components make them an efficient mineral material. An effective method aimed at reduction of toxicity of phenolic foams consists {{in the introduction}} of a composite mixture of chelate <b>compounds.</b> <b>Raw</b> materials applied in the production of phenolic foams include polymers FRB- 1 A and VAG- 3. The aforementioned materials are used to produce foams FRP- 1. Introduction of 1 % aluminum fluoride leads to the 40 % reduction of the free phenol content in the foam. Introduction of crystalline zinc chloride accelerates the foaming and curing of phenolic foams. The technology that contemplates the introduction of zeolites into the mixture includes pre-mixing with FRB - 1 A and subsequent mixing with VAG- 3; thereafter, the composition is poured into the form, in which the process of foaming is initiated. The content of free phenol was identified using the method of UV spectroscopy. The objective of the research was to develop methods of reduction of the free phenol content in the phenolic foam. Уменьшение концентрации свободного фенола и формальдегида при отверждении фенолоформальдегидных смол и производстве теплоизоляционных изделий на их основе может быть достигнуто: применением добавок, вступающих в химическое взаимодействие с фенолом и формальдегидом; подбором более мягких режимов отверждения фенольных олигомеров; созданием новых методов синтеза фенолоформальдегидных смол, обеспечивающих получение олигомеров с высокой стабильностью при хранении и пониженным содержанием свободного фенола и формальдегида.

40|$|Natural Rubber (NR) latex is a {{colloidal}} {{dispersion of}} NR polymer which is predominantly cis 1, 4 -Polyisoprene {{in an aqueous}} medium. Various chemicals are added to NR latex mainly as dispersions, at compounding stage to enhance processing characteristics and to obtain desired properties of the final product. The properties of chemicals in dry form or as dispersions are critical for latex compounding for maintaining the overall colloidal stability of the latex mix. Addition of chemical dispersions into latex for compounding are basically governed by particle or droplet size, physical nature, viscosity, pH and stability of the dispersion. Hence, properties of <b>raw</b> materials (<b>compounding</b> chemicals) are very important for making good dispersions for latex compounding and producing desired latex products. In this study, {{an attempt was made}} to use activated carbon as a compounding ingredient to enhance the sorption properties of NR latex foam product. From this study it was found that activated carbon powder which had particle size below I 0 μ and pH (in 1 % solution) having a basic pH or a pH towards neutrality can be made to a stable dispersion of 36 % Total Solids Content by ball milling for 18 hours {{in the presence of a}} dispersing agent. This dispersion had proper dispersion characteristics such as low particle size (3 u), a pH greater than 7 and low viscosity value. From mechanical and chemical stability studies on latex compound, it was found that up to 2. 0 % (on dry weight of latex) of activated carbon, the latex compound had good mechanical and chemical stability. At 2. 0 % activated carbon, the cellular structure of the foam was satisfactory. From physical property testing of foam with activated carbon on compression set and tensile strength, it was found that good foam properties were obtained with the chemical formula for optimum vulcanizing condition consisting of phr 2. 55 Sulphur, 1. 10 ZDC and 0. 85 ZMBT. The results of sorption property investigations of this study reveal that NR latex foam with 2. 0 % activated carbon has a significantly higher sorption property compared to standard NR latex foam. Therefore, activated carbon can be incorporated to a NR latex compound in dispersion form at 2. 0 % dosage to produce a latex foam pillow having higher sorption property...|$|R
30|$|Main {{water-soluble}} components, such as caffeine, polysaccharides, and catechins (Zhu et al. 2015; Nie et al. 2011), {{are generally}} {{responsible for the}} taste of tea fusion, whereas volatile components contribute to tea aroma. In tea, volatile components are only present in about 0.01  % of the total dry weight, but they result in a high odor experience because of their low threshold value (Rawat et al. 2007). Whereas water-soluble content is naturally influenced by geographical characteristics, climate, tea cultivar, and processing technology applied on <b>raw</b> leaves, volatile <b>compound</b> content can be influenced and transformed by the processing technology used on the leaves (Fernández-Cáceres et al. 2001; Narukawa et al. 2011). Volatile compounds are transformed from water-soluble components during processing steps, such as fermentation, post-fermentation, and baking (Hara et al. 1995). For example, Yunnan and Fujian oolong teas are both partially fermented by the same processing technology {{with a series of}} steps, and they show sweet, fruity, and flower-like odors. Green tea, which is not fermented, has a fresh, grassy flavor. Black tea, which is fully fermented, has a honey, flower-like flavor. Pu-erh tea, which is post-microbially fermented, has a woody and stale flavor (Lv et al. 2015). Whether teas produced from the same types of tea leaves coming from different tea trees show similar or different aroma characteristics has not been extensively studied. For finding the similarity and differences of volatile and water-soluble compounds between Yunnan and Fujian oolong tea, we compared them with those of other kinds of tea to decrease the noises from the data of oolong teas.|$|R
