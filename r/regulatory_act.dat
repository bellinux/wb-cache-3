5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 2000s (decade), the {{increased}} Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $23billion industry. He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Act</b> that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos, as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCain {{became a}} member of the Armed Services Committee, with which he had {{formerly}} done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee. He continued to support the Native American agenda. As first a House member and then a senator– and as a lifelong gambler with close ties to the gambling industry– McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Act,</b> which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises. McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.|$|E

25|$|Several laws {{influenced}} {{the creation of}} the Indian Gaming <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Act</b> (IGRA). Many of these influential laws came from U.S. Supreme Court rulings regarding tribal sovereignty. While a number of court rulings {{played a significant role in}} the development of legislation regarding reservation gambling rights, two landmark cases, Bryan v. Itasca County and California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, provided major legal breakthroughs.|$|E

ICNIRP Guidelines are implemented in many countries worldwide. Croatia has also implemented them indirectly through the European Recommendation 1999 / 519 /EC. The Croatian <b>regulatory</b> <b>acts</b> include the Non-Ionising Radiation Protection Act, Ordinance on Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) Protection, and the Ordinance on Basic Requirements for Devices which produce Optical Radiation and Measures for Optical Radiation Protection.

In spite of a high number of indoor and outdoor sources and the “worst-case exposure assessment”, the results are within the limits defined by the Croatian EMF Ordinance.

[...] The state statute in question had been lobbied for by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) in 1987. [...] At the request of Governor William O'Neill, acting state attorney general Clarine Riddle prepared a memorandum highlighting the differences between high school students playing casino games for monopoly money and a full-scale, for-profit casino.

500|$|When the {{decision}} was announced, it was reported as a substantial victory for Indians by both the local and national press. Bryan is a landmark case on the taxation of Indians and tribal sovereignty, having been cited over 380 times as of July 2010. The case has {{had a significant impact}} on Indian gaming with its broad holding that Public Law 280 did not confer [...] "general state civil regulatory control over Indian reservations." [...] This ruling in a challenge to a tax bill of under $200 had the effect of enabling Indian tribes nationwide to earn over $200 billion in gaming revenue as of 2007. The first cases influenced by Bryan involved bingo, which many states allowed, but regulated. The cases which were decided all cited Bryan in holding that the various states had no legal grounds to regulate games on tribal land. Many analysts point to the Bryan case as being the grounds upon which California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians [...] was decided. The Supreme Court noted that California was not able to impose civil regulations against an Indian tribe on tribal land. In that case, the court noted that California not only allowed gaming, but promoted its own state lottery. Therefore, the prohibition against gaming was regulatory in nature, not criminal, notwithstanding the fact that the games were open to non-Indians as well as Indians. After {{the decision}}, Congress passed the Indian Gaming <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Act</b> to provide for a system of regulation of the Indian gaming industry.|$|E

2500|$|The Indian Gaming <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Act</b> ( [...] , [...] et seq.) is a 1988 United States {{federal law}} that {{establishes}} the jurisdictional framework that governs Indian gaming. [...] There was no federal gaming structure before this act. The stated purposes of the act include providing a legislative basis for the operation/regulation of Indian gaming, protecting gaming {{as a means of}} generating revenue for the tribes, encouraging economic development of these tribes, and protecting the enterprises from negative influences (such as organized crime). The law established the National Indian Gaming Commission and gave it a regulatory mandate. The law also delegated new authority to the U.S. Department of the Interior and created new federal offenses, giving the U.S. Department of Justice authority to prosecute them.|$|E
