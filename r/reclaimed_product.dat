40|$|AbstractThe {{growth in}} population, technology, and economy are {{resulting}} in the rapid increase of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), which has a significant direct impact to the environment. MSW is generally disposed by landfill, which {{requires a lot of}} land space. Moreover, it is considered as a non-sustainable solution, by which only decomposable material is decayed where plastic and paper still remain inside. In order to provide the land space for recently large amount of waste, the old MSW need to be reclaimed and used as alternative fuel for sustainable disposal and converted into green and clean energy through gasification process. However, using an as-receive <b>reclaimed</b> <b>product</b> faces the challenges of combustion behaviour because it is non-homogeneous and loosens. This study discusses the improvement of the characteristics of the as-received <b>reclaimed</b> <b>product</b> by converting it into high density Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF). The surrogate reclaimed landfill RDF used has been made of waste plastic (polyethylene) and paper with a ratio of 75 : 25 %-wt. After densification by extrusion, RDF- 5 has a density higher than 600 kg/m 3. The experiment was conducted in a laboratory scale downdraft gasifier by feeding surrogate RDF 10 kg/hr with the air flow rate 12, 15 and 18 Nm 3 /hr, respectively. Charcoal was added as an additive at the same weight of RDF in order to increase the fraction of fixed carbon and improve concentration of producer gas. The influences of the additive on the producer gas concentration and combustion characteristics were investigated. Results showed highest CO% and LHV were affected by air flow rate of 12 Nm 3 /hr at 22. 02 %-vol and 4. 39 MJ/Nm 3, respectively, whereas highest H 2 % was obtained with air flow rate of 15 Nm 3 /hr. It was found that the densification of the reclaimed landfill and the mixing of the additive optimized the combustion behavior in terms of temperature distribution along the gasifier height and improved the producer gas quality...|$|E

Heating of the plastic packaging due to the frequent high acceleration strokes that initiate adhesion wear probably causes the additional damages.   Further testing is needed for the method to be fully optimized. Analyzing the motion of the bags within the cardboard box when vibrated by making tests with an open lid and then analyzing the motion with a high-speed camera have distinguished the motions causing transport damages. To normalize between different vibration tests a formula using impulse to describe accumulative fatigue wear has been derived.

Much of this has been dedicated to the promotion of pre-demolition and prerefurbishment audits to facilitate targets being set and markets for reusable resources sourced prior to work commencing. Against this backdrop the surveys undertaken to measure levels of reclamation in the UK over a 15 year period showed a significant decline. The cause of this decline was investigated and revealed a number of challenges which were affecting both the supply and demand for <b>reclaimed</b> <b>products</b> and materials.

40|$|When {{analyzing}} “socially responsible” {{along the}} supply-chain of apparel production, {{there has not}} been an emphasis on the purchase of findings used in production of clothing and how surplus items are used or discarded. Hawley (2006) describes the mechanical sorting of findings to assist in the post-consumer recycling of apparel to aid in <b>reclaiming</b> fiber from <b>products.</b> Her research raised the following questions: 1) What happens to these findings after they are removed from the garment? 2) Is it possible to use these items in wearable or fiber art projects? 3) Where are additional sources for obtaining or reclaiming surplus or discarded findings? The author once worked for a jean manufacturer. As with many apparel companies an abundance of findings, purchased or provided by vendors, are not used in production. Often these items are given or sold to employees at a discount price instead of discarding them.

40|$|Abstract: Poly(ethy 1 ene terephthalate) (PET) {{has become}} one of major post {{consumer}} plastics wastes, in addition to polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and poly(viny 1 chloride) (PVC). The challenge to large-volume plastics companies is to learn how to collect, separate, reprocess and market their low-cost products and make a profit, too. The effort of PET recycling, however, is the most successful story in the plastic recycling technology, including both reclaim and upgrade of PET waste. Beverage bottles made of PET are recycled more than 20 % of the total production. The technology of today can reclaim the post-consumer PET bottles to produce high-quality granulated PET with better than 99 % purity. A practical reclaim process for recycling PET bottles (including bottle, HDPE base cup, aluminum cap, liner, label and adhesive) is available by the Center for Plastics Recycling Research in USA. PET recycling process, like for other plastics, can be divided into three categories: incineration, physical recycling, and chemical recycling. To make the plastic recycling business pay requires more than simple recovery and marketing. Greatest profit potential is in upgraded and value-added <b>reclaim</b> <b>products.</b> Upgrading involves compounding with additives to make material more processable, adding reinforcement, or producing extrusions or finished parts from reclaim resins. For instance, a modified injection-moldable resin made from PET bottle scrap is claimed to provide high impact and processability at less cost than competitive materials. It is foreseen that chemical recycling of waste PET bottle becomes feasible if the price of raw material goes up. Three economical processes are involved in this technology: pyrolysis, hydrocracking, and hydrolysis. The hydrolysis process is presently employed to recover the raw material for unsaturated polyester resin manufacture or polyols for the production of polyurethane resin. It is reported in this presentation that polymer concrete could be a huge potential market for chemical reclaim of PET materials, especially for green or mixed-color PET, which are priced lower than colorless PET reclaim materials...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a {{methodology}} for incorporating disassemblability into life-cycle design for Material Recovery Opportunities (MRO) is presented. Disassemblability {{is defined as}} the ability to optimize the design and disassembly process for removal of specific parts or materials in a manner which will simultaneously minimize costs and maximize the material value to be reclaimed. MRO are defined as an opportunity to <b>reclaim</b> post-consumer <b>products</b> for recycling, remanufacturing and re-use. This methodology has been developed to identify and assess cost-effective characteristics of disassembly for the recovery of products. Four levels of analysis are introduced: (1) economic analysis, (2) optimal disassembly sequence generation, (3) disassembly optimization, and (4) design for disassembly. Three economic indices are presented to evaluate the trade-off between reclamation and disposal of individual components using a disassembly tree. A systematic procedure for generating an optimal disassembly sequence based on maximizing the economics of material recovery is presented. Five criteria are established to reduce the search space and facilitate material recovery opportunities: (1) material compatibility, (2) clustering for disposal, (3) concurrent disassembly operations, (4) maximizing yield, and (5) clustering for maximum reclamation value. Employing disassemblability into life-cycle design will reduce environmental impacts over the life-cycle and facilitate economic material recovery.

The analysis considers all the key stages in the life cycle, which include extraction of raw materials, construction, maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, replacement, and disposal. The proposed life cycle design approach is illustrated on the cases of two concrete highway bridge decks that are built in corrosive environments using high performance concrete containing industrial by-products and normal concrete. It is found that that use of high performance concrete leads to highway bridge decks with: (i) longer service lives (3 to 10 times longer than decks built with normal concrete; (ii) 65 % reductions in CO 2 emissions associated with construction and rehabilitation compared to normal concrete decks; and (iii) 40 % to 45 % reductions in life cycle cost compared to normal concrete decks.

40|$|In the past, many {{companies}} were concerned primarily with managing activities along the traditional supply chain {{in order to}} optimise operational processes and thereby economic benefits, without considering new economic and environmental opportunities {{in relation to the}} reverse supply chain and the use of used or <b>reclaimed</b> <b>products.</b> In contrast, there is now increasing interest among companies in reverse logistics and closed loop supply chain (CLSC) and their economic benefits and environmental impacts. In particular, the concept of CLSC views the reverse flow (i. e. the reverse supply chain) of reclaimed goods as integral to the forward flow (i. e. the traditional supply chain) to the consumer. At the end of the useful life of products, a reverse supply process is activated in which unwanted materials and products are recovered from end users to recapture some of their value. Therefore, planning for the forward flow of goods must take into account the recovered products. Three main processes that need to be considered are: (1) collection and distribution planning; (2) inventory control; and (3) production planning. In this thesis, our focus is the study of remanufacturing activity, {{which is one of the}} main recovery methods applied to closed loop supply chains. Specifically, we investigate and evaluate strategies for effective management concerning inventory control and production planning of a remanufacturing system. In order to pursue such a research objective, we model a production and inventory system for remanufacturing using the System Dynamics (SD) simulation modelling approach. Our primary interest is in the remanufacturing and returns processes of such a system. 3 As part of the development of the SD models, we identify the main factors, their influence relationships and the business/operational policies that affect the dynamic behaviour of the system. The returns process is modelled using significant factors which define: (1) the average period of time for which a product stays with its customer before it is returned (residence time); (2) the incentives offered by companies for the recovery of the used products (service agreement with customer); and (3) the behaviour of customers in returning used products (customer behaviour). Interestingly, combining these factors in a process model addresses the issue regarding the uncertainty in quantity and timing of returns in the reverse supply chain. To our knowledge, a returns process modelled with such factors and their influence relationships is not readily available in the literature. For the same system, the remanufacturing process is modelled using such key factors as: (1) integrated remanufacturing/production capacity, (2) lead times, (3) backorder and (4) inventory coverage. Several policies that affect the dynamic behaviour of the system are defined in the modelling process using such factors. These modelled policies are included in order to improve the efficiency of managing production/remanufacturing and inventory activities in the process. This thesis also contributes to the field through the analysis of several scenarios combining the aforementioned factors and utilising simulation in order to evaluate strategies aimed at the optimum performance of the system. The evaluation results reveal that efficiency in managing inventory can be improved by increasing the returns rate (quantity of returns), which in turn can be achieved by reducing the residence time and increasing company incentives for the recovery of used products. At the same time, the uncertainty around the returns rate is significantly diminished by increasing those incentives that encourage customers to return used products. Other findings indicate improved efficiency in the remanufacturing process with higher remanufacturing capacity if the quantity of remanufacturable returns and the remanufacturing lead time are increased and decreased, respectively. Moreover, increasing the production lead time affects system performance more than does an equivalent increase in the remanufacturing lead time. 4 Case studies are used in this thesis in order to support some of the research findings and to further validate the developed models of the production and inventory system for remanufacturing. The selection of companies employed as case studies was based on their engagement in remanufacturing and returns processes, which made them useful for our research. Specifically, data and information were collected through interviews with company management representatives of the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association, Fuji Xerox Australia and CEVA Logistics. These three companies are significantly involved in operational and management activities linked to reverse logistics and remanufacturing processes. The knowledge gained about these companies’ activities, coupled with the data collected from the ‘real world’, were useful for the development of the models of returns and remanufacturing processes as well as for the assessment of the research findings...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the current}} {{problems}} faced by mankind {{is the problem of}} safe disposal of waste rubber. Statistics show that the number of waste tires is continuously increasing at a very rapid rate. Since rubber materials do not decompose easily (due to their crosslinked structure), they end up being a serious ‘environmental problem’. An intuitive solution to prevent the accumulation of the scrap tires is to continuously reuse them. A new patented reclamation method was discovered in our laboratory, which makes use of a twin screw extruder (TSE) in order to produce reclaimed rubber (referred as devulcanized rubber (DR) from here on) of very high quality. Also, this method has proven to be more economical than other commercial <b>reclaiming</b> methods. <b>Products</b> made solely from a reclaimed material face challenges from those made by virgin materials because of relatively poor properties. However, the striking advantage of using reclaimed rubbers is the cost reduction. Hence, it is important to work on establishing methods by which these reclaimed rubbers could be efficiently used and incorporated into present day products. The deterioration of properties could be minimized by blending them with varying amounts of other materials. A possibility in this direction is manufacturing of thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) using reclaimed rubber and general purpose thermoplastics. In accordance with this idea, the focus of this research is to prepare DR and polypropylene (PP) based TPVs. DR is unique as the rubber itself consists of two phases- one phase consisting of uncrosslinked (including devulcanized rubber molecules), and the other phase consisting of crosslinked (un-devulcanized) rubber. These un-devulcanized crumbs act as stress concentrators because they do not break-up easily, and lead to poor physical properties. Hence, this project tries to find out ways to increase the interfacial adhesion between the rubber and PP by using reactive and non-reactive techniques. Preliminary experiments were carried out in a batch mixer to compare DR and rubber crumb (CR). DR based TPVs showed better properties than CR based TPVs, however, the properties were not useful for commercial applications. Sulphur based dynamic vulcanization was studied in a batch mixer and found to be not effective in improving the properties of DR based blends. On the other hand, DCP/ sulphur based curing system was found to show significant improvement in properties. Therefore, DCP/sulphur based curing package was studied in detail on the blends consisting of DR and PP. The optimum ratio of DCP/sulphur was found to vary depending on the ratio of DR/PP. A hypothesis regarding the mechanism of DCP/sulphur curing has been proposed, which seem to correlate well with the experimental results observed. Additionally, it was determined that DR prepared from tire rubber (DRT) performed better than DR prepared from waste EPDM (DRE) for the curing system used. Accordingly, experiments on a TSE were carried out using DRT and a combination of compatibilizing resins and curatives. This combination showed a drastic improvement in blends properties and once again the optimum ratio of compatibilizing resins seemed to depend on the ratio of DRT/PP. As a result of the work, successful strategies based on reactive compatibilization techniques were developed in order to prepare useful TPVs having up to 70 % DR. A series of compatibilization techniques has been evaluated using design of experiments and various characterization techniques such as mechanical tests, scanning electron microscopy, thermal analysis and crosslink density measurements. This {{led to the development of}} a formulation, which could improve the blend properties significantly. A tensile strength of around 10 MPa and an elongation-at-break of 150 - 180 % could be achieved for devulcanized rubber (70 %) based TPVs, which has broadened the scope for its commercial applications. In addition to that, the process was established on a TSE that has enabled a continuous and steady production of these TPVs with reasonable throughputs. 1 yea...|$|R
