40|$|Production. California {{produces}} 90 % of {{the grapes}} {{grown in the}} United States and 8 % of the world's production (5, 60), and is ranked the number one in production of wine, table, and <b>raisin</b> <b>grapes</b> in the United States. California supplies 99 % of the nation's raisin production (54). Average raisin production for the years 1996 - 1997 was 373, 000 tons, with average annual value of $ 450, 000, 000 (5, 55). ● Acreage. Bearing grape acreage in California in 1998 was 691, 664 acres, of which 269, 843 acres (39 %) were planted to <b>raisin</b> <b>grape</b> varieties (4). Thompson seedless grapes, which are the primary variety for <b>raisin</b> <b>grapes,</b> totaled 262, 956 acres (38 % of state grape acreage). About 150, 000 acres of Thompson Seedless are devoted to making raisins each year, the remainder going to table and wine grape production. Organic growing acreage accounts for about 1. 5 % of the total grape growing acreage (California Certified Organic Farmers, personal communication). ● Ranking.

In 1999, the state had 424, 000 wine grape acres producing a crop of 2. 7 million tons valued at $ 1. 56 billion, 87, 000 table grape acres producing a crop of 0. 8 million tons worth $ 417 million, and 279, 000 <b>raisin</b> <b>grape</b> acres producing a crop of 2. 1 million tons valued at $ 764 million.

Pierce’s Disease Xylella fastidiosa is a plant pathogenic bacterium that causes disease in a variety of plants [2]. There are strains that cause leaf scorch in almonds, oleander scorch in oleander, variegated chlorosis in citrus, and Pierce’s disease (PD) in grapevines. The bacterium is vectored by sharpshooters, piercing-sucking insects that feed on the xylem, the water conducting tissue of the plant. Once introduced into a host plant, the bacterium lives and reproduces in the xylem, eventually clogging the tissue. In grapes, the bacteria multiply rapidly, spread systemically and can reach concentrations of billions of live bacterial cells per gram of plant tissue [23].
