40|$|Introduction: One of {{the major}} {{complications}} of hemodialysis patients is restless legs syndrome (RLS). Therefore, interventions are essential to its improvement. This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of massage with glycerin oil on RLS in hemodyalysis patients. Methods: The present study is a randomized clinical trial in chronic renal failure patients undergoing hemodyalysis in Kamkar hospital, Ghom, Iran, 2014. Seventeen patients with RLS were selected after obtaining the informed consent by continuous method and randomly assigned into 2 groups. The intervention group received effleurage massage with glycerin oil, and the control group received the routine care of hemodyalysis ward. Data were collected by RLS questionnaire and analyzed by descriptive and analytical (Exact Fisher, dependent and independent t-test) statistic in Spss v 16. Results: No significant difference found in <b>RLS</b> <b>score</b> between intervention (24. 09 ± 5. 34) and control (22. 9 ± 4. 38) groups in beginning of study. While mean of score RLS had significant decrease in massage with glycerin oil group (9. 54 ± 4. 64) in comparison with the control group (23. 23 ± 4. 52) (p= 0 / 0001). Conclusion: it is recommended to use effleurage massage with glycerin oil as a complementary therapy to decrease the RLS in hemodyalysis patients. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background: Sleep {{disorders}} {{are one of}} the most common problems in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of Pramipexole on sleep quality in patient with restless leg syndrome(RLS) and chronic renal failure. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was performed on 20 hemodialysis patients selected from the dialysis centers of Ilam. Eligible patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups, the drug(Pramipexole) and pelaseo groups. The experimental group took Pramipexole during the study, while the control group received pelasebo. The Persian version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and RLS scale rate and quetionary for diagnosis of RLS was done for patients at the baseline and the end of study. Results: Results showed no significant difference in the mean sleep quality score between the experimental and control groups at baseline, but a significant difference was seen in mean sleep quality score between the drug and plasebo groups after the end of the study in <b>RLS</b> <b>score</b> index(P< 0. 002) but they have no change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores. Conclusion: Pramipexole has stabilizing effect on sleep quality in hemodialysis patients with restless leg syndrome and may be used as a noninvasive method for sleep disorders in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Restless leg {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a common}} problem in patients with chronic renal failure. It can reduce {{the quality of life}} and sleep disturbances. This disorder is usually treated pharmacologically. Recently, complementary medicine methods have been suggested because of chemical drugs adverse effects. There is not enough evidence about the effect of aromatherapy on RLS. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of massage with lavender oil on RLS symptoms in hemodialysis patients. Patients and Methods: This randomized clinical trial study included 70 hemodialysis patients with RLS that were randomly assigned into two groups in 2014. The experimental group received effleurage massage using lavender oil and control group received routine care for three weeks. Data was collected with RLS questionnaire and analyzed using independent and paired t-test and Chi-square test. Results: The mean RLS scores were not significantly different in the two groups at the start of study (22. 41 ± 7. 67 vs. 22. 90 ± 4. 38, P = 0. 76). At the end of study, the mean <b>RLS</b> <b>score</b> significantly decreased in the intervention group, while this score remained relatively un-changed in the control group (12. 41 ± 5. 49 vs. 23. 23 ± 4. 52, P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Lavender oil massage was effective to improve RLS in hemodialysis patients. It has no adverse effects, is practical and cost-effective. It is suggested to be used along with routine treatment of RLS in hemodialysis patients...|$|E

2500|$|Ainscough's first {{experience}} of competitive rugby league football came through Wigan St Judes ARLFC. He {{remained at the}} amateur club until 2006, when he gained a scholarship to join the academy of his hometown professional club, Wigan. His first game for the academy came in a Junior Academy Championship fixture at Hilton Park against Leigh, playing at wing. Ainscough marked this appearance by also scoring his first try in a Wigan jersey. He was rotated into different positions throughout his academy career, playing at centre for a repeat match against Leigh seven weeks later, as well as fullback against [...] the game after that. On both occasions, Ainscough scored tries, earning one and two tries in each game respectively. However, his first competitive hat-trick came playing on the left wing in a play-off game against Widnes. During his time with the academy in 2007, Ainscough also played two matches at senior level, once against Hull, and once against Harlequins <b>RL,</b> <b>scoring</b> a try in the latter fixture.|$|R
5000|$|Despite this, Thomas Leuluai {{replaced}} Tomkins for the team's next {{match against}} Warrington, meaning Tomkins {{would have to}} wait for his Super League debut. He played {{out the rest of the}} 2008 season in the reserves, some of his highlights including a hat-trick against Castleford and another five-try performance against Harlequins <b>RL.</b> After <b>scoring</b> four tries against Hull's reserves, Tomkins was tipped to make at least ten Super League appearances in 2009 season by Shaun Wane, Wigan's reserve coach. He also received an endorsement from Ian Lenagan, the club's chairman, when he said, [...] "I think Sam is going to be a world-class half-back and we want to give him his chance." [...] Tomkins was named Reserve Team Player of the Year at the Wigan inaugural awards evening.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{clinical}} studies showed increased postoperative pain intensity and cumulative morphine consumption following intraoperative high dose remifentanil. In {{this study we}} investigated in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery i) whether postoperative pain and analgesic consumption is increased following intraoperative high versus low dose remifentanil, and ii) whether this is prevented by preoperative administration of the NMDA antagonist amantadine. 48 adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery {{were randomly assigned to}} three anaesthetic regims: group RL recieved a continuous remifentanil infusion 0, 1 µg/kg/min and sevoflurane titrated to autonomic responses; group RH recieved a continuous inspiratory concentration of sevoflurane (0, 5 MAC) and a remifentanil infusion titrated to autonomic responses; group RHA recieved the same anaesthetic plan as RH and preoperatively 200 mg amantadine iv. Patients who were blinded to group assignment controlled their own morphine administration via PCIA. Pain scores and morphine consumption were recorded to the sixth hour on PCIA by a also blinded study observer. Results: The mean remifentanil infusion rate was RH 0, 20 ± 0, 01 and RHA 0, 22 ± 0, 01 µg/kg/min, which were significantly greater than in group <b>RL.</b> Postoperative pain <b>scores</b> were not significantly different between the groups. All patients required morphine in the same amount: 30, 7 ± 4, 1 (RL), 28, 9 ± 5, 2 (RH) and 30, 6 ± 2, 0 mg (RHA). Relative large-dose intraoperative remifentanil did not increase postoperative pain and morphine consumption. Also, preoperative amandatin administration did not attenuate the postoperative response. These data suggests that remifentanil does not cause a clinical relevant hyperalgesia mediated by NMDA-receptors...|$|R
