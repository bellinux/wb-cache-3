500|$|In 1910, the Maryland General Assembly {{authorized}} {{funding for}} the construction of a boulevard between Annapolis and Baltimore. This boulevard, which would have a minimum <b>road</b> <b>width</b> of , would begin in Annapolis, cross the Severn River, head northwest to Glen Burnie, and continue through Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties to the tracks of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in South Baltimore. The newly formed Maryland State Roads Commission was placed in charge of constructing the new BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard. The boulevard was constructed as a [...] wide macadam road from the Severn River north to Arnold and from Severna Park to Pasadena in 1910 and 1911. The sections between Arnold and Severna Park and from Pasadena to Glen Burnie were completed in 1912. The boulevard followed much of what is today MD 648, with the major difference being in Pasadena, where instead of following Waterford Road north to MD 177, the boulevard headed northwest along what are discontinuous segments of MD 915 to Lipins Corner.|$|E

2500|$|Road {{construction}} in Yellowknife {{is often a}} challenge due {{to the presence of}} permafrost which requires that roads generally be regraded and resurfaced every 10 to 20 years.

Speed limits are [...] on most roads, [...] in school zones, and [...] on highways. School zones and playground zones are in effect 24 hours per day 7 days per week. The highway system in the NWT is maintained by the Government of the Northwest Territories. Highway 4 (Ingraham Trail) and Highway 3 (Yellowknife Highway) both run through Yellowknife and are all-weather roads. One well-known, almost infamous, road in Yellowknife is Ragged Ass Road, after which Tom Cochrane named an album.|$|E

50|$|Marked {{pedestrian}} crossings {{are often}} found at intersections, {{but may also}} be at other points on busy roads {{that would otherwise be}} too unsafe to cross without assistance due to vehicle numbers, speed or <b>road</b> <b>widths.</b> They are also commonly installed where large numbers of pedestrians are attempting to cross (such as in shopping areas) or where vulnerable road users (such as school children) regularly cross. Rules govern usage of the pedestrian crossings to ensure safety; for example, in some areas, the pedestrian must be more than halfway across the crosswalk before the driver proceeds.|$|R
50|$|The Callender-Hamilton bridge {{system is}} a {{prefabricated}} Panel/Floor Beam/Deck system designed to span bridging lengths ranging from 30 to 150 metres with <b>road</b> <b>widths</b> of one to three or more lanes. The design uses Warren trusses and is centred {{on a series of}} gusset plates that allow the direct attachment of the longitudinal, diagonal, vertical, and cross framing members. Centralised connection points increase the speed of construction and allow identical panels to be fabricated from identical members and then installed on site. An important feature is that all connections are bolted, so removing the need for onsite welding.|$|R

As a result, some of the ZÃ¼m stations including Bovaird, Creditview, and James Potter are still unopened and is not expected to open until the widening project is complete because the <b>road's</b> <b>width</b> did not reach the ZÃ¼m stations. Instead, temporary bus stops are places nearby disabled ZÃ¼m stations along the route. Also, heavy traffic and construction activities can result in bus delays along the route.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} {{optimisation}} of transversal disposition {{of steel and}} concrete composite road bridges {{in terms of the}} number of steel beams. For this purpose, a parametric study was performed, in which a total of 32 superstructures of steel and concrete composite road bridges, with different number of steel beams, different <b>road</b> <b>widths</b> and theoretical spans, were modelled and assessed. The reliability verification of the superstructure has been done according to Eurocodes. A result of parametric study is a comparison of advantages of the double-beam and the four-beam variants in terms of material consumption when considering different transverse dimensions and spans of the bridge. The individual variants are compared on the basis of the consumption of structural steel, concrete and reinforcing steel bars...|$|R
