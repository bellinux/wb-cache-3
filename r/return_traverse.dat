5000|$|The {{spinning}} mule or {{mule jenny}} {{was created in}} 1779 by Samuel Crompton. It {{was a combination of}} Arkwright's water frame and Hargreaves' spinning jenny. It was so named because it was a hybrid of these two machines. The mule consisted of a fixed frame containing a creel of bobbins holding the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage containing the spindles. It used an intermittent process: On the outward traverse, the rovings were paid out, and twisted, and the <b>return</b> <b>traverse,</b> the roving was clamped and the spindles reversed taking up the newly spun thread. The rival machine, the throstle frame or ring frame was a continuous process, where the roving was drawn twisted and wrapped in one action. The spinning mule became self-acting (automatic) in 1830s. The mule was the most common spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900, but was still used for fine yarns until the 1960s. A cotton mill in 1890 would contain over 60 mules, each with 1320 spindles.|$|E

The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz, but they managed to get a rope long enough to reach Kurz by tying two ropes together. While abseiling, however, Kurz could not get the knot that joined the two ropes to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers, who were just a few metres below him, desperately trying to move himself past the knot, but in vain. He then began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with the head of his ice-axe but could not reach higher.

40|$|Summary: Counting all the k-mers (substrings {{of length}} k) in DNA/RNA {{sequencing}} reads is the preliminary step of many bioinformatics ap-plications. However, {{state of the}} art k-mer counting methods require that a large data structure resides in memory. Such structure typically grows with the number of distinct k-mers to count. We present a new streaming algorithm for k-mer counting, called DSK (disk streaming of k-mers), which only requires a fixed user-defined amount of memory and disk space. This approach realizes a memory, time and disk trade-off. The multi-set of all k-mers present in the reads is partitioned, and partitions are saved to disk. Then, each partition is separately loaded in memory in a temporary hash table. The k-mer counts are <b>returned</b> by <b>traversing</b> each hash table. Low-abundance k-mers are optionally filtered. DSK is the first approach that is able to count all the 27 -mers of a human genome dataset using only 4. 0 GB of memory and moderate disk space (160 GB), in 17. 9 h. DSK can replace a popular k-mer counting software (Jellyfish) on small-memory servers...|$|R

60|$|A splendor so exceptional, even in {{the most}} splendid age of the most splendid city, as that which marked the nuptial feasts of the unhappy Jacopo Foscari, could not be left unnoticed in this place. He espoused Lucrezia, {{daughter}} of Lionardo Contarini, a noble as rich and magnificent as Jacopo's own father, the Doge; and, on the 29th of January 1441, the noble Eustachio Balbi being chosen lord of the feasts, the bridegroom, the bride's brother and eighteen other patrician youths, assembled in the Palazzo Balbi, whence they went on horseback to conduct Lucrezia to the Ducal Palace. They were all sumptuously dressed in crimson velvet and silver brocade of Alexandria, and rode chargers superbly caparisoned. Other noble friends attended them; musicians went before; a troop of soldiers brought up the rear. They thus proceeded to the court-yard of the Ducal Palace, and then, <b>returning,</b> <b>traversed</b> the Piazza, and threading the devious little streets to the Campo San Samuele, there crossed the Grand Canal upon a bridge of boats, to San Barnaba opposite, where the Contarini lived. On their arrival at this place the bride, supported by two Procuratori di San Marco, and attended by sixty ladies, descended to the church and heard mass, after which an oration was delivered in Campo San Barnaba before the Doge, the ambassadors, and a multitude of nobles and people, in praise of the spouses and their families. The bride then returned to her father's house, and jousts took place in the campos of Santa Maria Formosa and San Polo (the largest in the city), and in the Piazza San Marco. The Doge gave a great banquet, and at its close one hundred and fifty ladies proceeded to the bride's palace in the Bucintoro, where one hundred other ladies joined them, together with Lucrezia, who, seated between Francesco Sforza (then General-in-chief of the Republic's armies) and the Florentine ambassador, was conducted, amid the shouts of the people and the sound of trumpets, to the Ducal Palace. The Doge received her at the riva of the Piazzetta, and, with Sforza and Balbi led her {{to the foot of the}} palace stairs, where the Dogaressa, with sixty ladies, welcomed her. A state supper ended this day's rejoicings, and on the following day a tournament took place in the Piazza, for a prize of cloth of gold, which was offered by Sforza. Forty knights contested the prize and supped afterward with the Doge. On the next day there were processions of boats with music on the Grand Canal; on the fourth and last day there were other jousts for prizes offered by the jewelers and Florentine merchants; and every night there were dancing and feasting in the Ducal Palace. The Doge was himself the giver of the last tournament, and with this the festivities came to an end.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited Prepared for The U. S. Antarctic Program {{is conducting a}} proof-of-concept traverse to haul heavy cargo 1600 km from McMurdo Station to South Pole Station. During the 2003 – 04 season (year two), the tractor-trains experienced poor mobility over undisturbed snow on the Ross Ice Shelf. despite relatively low sled ski pressures and encouraging results of pre-departure tests conducted on the McMurdo Ice Shelf. To understand why, we conducted expedient mobility tests, snow-strength measurements, and snow-pit studies along 250 -km of route as the <b>traverse</b> <b>returned</b> to McMurdo. The key phenomenon causing train immobility appears to be traction–slip–resistance feedback resulting from the sled skis riding in the ruts made by the towing tractors. We measured much lower towing resistance when the same sleds were towed over undisturbed snow outside of the tractor ruts. Large pitch and roll motions, and consequently large resistance peaks, also occurred when several sleds were towed in series. The role of snow strength was more difficult to assess. Hard sastrugi caused severe motions and sled breakdowns. Decreasing average strength towards {{the center of the}} Ross Ice Shelf agreed with qualitatively worsening mobility but quantitative results were inconclusive.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an ultrasonic depth gauge for liquids under high pressure and is particularly {{useful in the}} space industry where {{it is necessary to}} use a pressurized gas to transfer a liquid from one location to another. Conventional liquid depth gauges do not have the capability to operate under extreme high pressure (i. e., exceeding 300 psi). An ultrasonic depth gauge capable of withstanding high pressure according to the present invention is comprised of a transducer assembly and a supporting electronics unit. The former is mounted in to the bottom wall of a storage vessel with its resonating surface directly exposed to the highly pressurized liquid in the vessel. In operation, the ultrasonic pulse propagates upward through the liquid to the liquid-gas interface in the storage vessel. When the ultrasonic echo returns from the liquid-gas interface, it re-excites the composite resonator into vibration. The supporting electronics unit measures the round-trip transmit time for the ultrasonic pulse and its <b>return</b> echo to <b>traverse</b> the depth of the highly pressurized liquid. The novelty of the invention resides in the use of a conventional transducer rigidly bonded to the inside wall of a bored out conventional high-pressure plug to form a composite resonator capable of withstanding extremely high pressure...|$|R

40|$|During the 2013 {{convective}} storm season, a high resolution 3 -D Lightning Mapping Array was deployed to north central Kansas (Cummins et al, this conference.) In conjunction with fixed and mobile camera systems and electric field mills, this allowed for detailed investigations of lightning induced upward lighting (LTUL) discharges from tall {{objects in the}} region, including wind turbines. Also, concurrent observations using a network of low-light cameras deployed over the central U. S. {{as part of the}} PhOCAL program detected transient luminous events (TLEs) above the Kansas LMA (KSLMA). During the night of 29 - 30 May 2013, waves of precipitation associated with several large MCSs traversing Kansas moved through the KSLMA domain. We focus on two LTUL events that exemplify two modes of upward lightning production from tall structures. At 0859 Z, 30 May 2013, a nearby + 92 kA CG, with extensive in-cloud branching passing overhead a wind farm, was followed by complex LTUL discharges from four turbines. In addition, a sprite was confirmed by the Bennett, CO SpriteNet camera. The parent flash covered a very large area. It initiated near the MCS convective leading line ~ 150 km to the south, and traveled into a stratiform precipitation maximum over the KSLMA. Typically when a +CG precedes an LTUL, the triggering component is either 1) the <b>return</b> stroke that <b>traverses</b> the leader network which initially forms near the towers or 2) new negative leader activity that develops once the return stroke reaches the end of the initial leader network that may not have initially been near the tower. In the latter case, the new leader development passes near the towers and triggers upward positive leaders similar to those associated with only an intracloud flash. The +CG return stroke may hit > 10 km from the towers and the new leader development may travel extensive distances before getting close enough to the towers to trigger upward lightning. In this case, there was the typical long delay between the +CG return stroke and LTUL initiation (10 s to 100 s of ms). The parent lightning discharges for both sprites and LTULs have many common aspects and tend to occur in similar meteorological regimes, with the two phenomena often occurring together. An earlier LUTL, at 2320 Z, 29 May 2013 was captured at 9900 fps by a Phantom camera in the PhOCAL mobile Lightning Investigation Vehicle (LIV). This discharge, exhibiting numerous recoil leaders, also occurred in a stratiform region some ~ 50 - 100 km north of an MCS convective core. While there was no preceding +CG, there was an extensive network of IC channels, one of which passed overhead close to the turbine. These observations are consistent with the ongoing UPLIGHTS studies of LTULs from tall towers in Rapid City. While a +CG is usually involved (~ 85 % of the time), the LTUL occurs because of the associated extensive in cloud components passing over towers. The earlier case without a +CG typifies this second mode where the triggering component is a negative leader associated with the IC activity passing near the towers initiates the upward positive leaders. We will discuss the parent discharges, shown in their meteorological (radar and satellite) context, and attempt to better understand the charge structures present in both the convective and stratiform regions of the MCS. The sprite and its relationship to the parent discharge will similarly be discusse...|$|R
