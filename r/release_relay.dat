40|$|The author proposes an anthropological {{reading of}} the (post) colonial fact as it is {{distilled}} in the Kourouma's novels Les soleils des indépendances (1968 and 1970), En attendant le vote des bêtes sauvages (1998) and Allah n'est pas obligé (2000); which <b>releases</b> the <b>relay</b> of a complex semantic and metaphorical network of the changing status of the colonies / African countries {{at the time of}} decolonization, that is to say what Ahmadou Kourouma means by "suns" of independence. The anthropological question, especially about its initiatory ritual component, will prove not accessory or decorative, even exotic, {{in the work of the}} Ivorian writer, but a real thematic element in a more complex discursive coherence...|$|R
2500|$|In a large {{installation}} of electromechanical relays, {{it would be}} difficult to determine which device originated the signal that tripped the circuit. This information is useful to operating personnel to determine the likely cause of the fault and to prevent its re-occurrence. Relays may be fitted with a [...] "target" [...] or [...] "flag" [...] unit, which is <b>released</b> when the <b>relay</b> operates, to display a distinctive colored signal when the relay has tripped.|$|R
50|$|Alpha-synuclein is {{a protein}} that is {{abundant}} in the human brain. Smaller amounts {{are found in the}} heart, muscles, and other tissues. In the brain, alpha-synuclein is found mainly at the tips of nerve cells (neurons) in specialized structures called presynaptic terminals. Within these structures, alpha-synuclein interacts with phospholipids and proteins. Presynaptic terminals release chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, from compartments known as synaptic vesicles. The <b>release</b> of neurotransmitters <b>relays</b> signals between neurons and is critical for normal brain function.|$|R
25|$|Cortisone is one {{of several}} end-products of a process called steroidogenesis. This process starts with the {{synthesis}} of cholesterol, which then proceeds through a series of modifications in the adrenal gland (suprarenal) to become any one of many steroid hormones. One end-product of this pathway is cortisol. For cortisol to be released from the adrenal gland, a cascade of signaling occurs. Corticotropin-releasing hormone released from the hypothalamus stimulates corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary to <b>release</b> ACTH, which <b>relays</b> the signal to the adrenal cortex. Here, the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis, in response to ACTH, secrete glucocorticoids, in particular cortisol. In the peripheral tissues, cortisol is converted to cortisone by the enzyme 11-beta-steroid dehydrogenase.|$|R
50|$|Delay boxes began {{appearing}} in drag race {{cars in the}} 1980s. The early units were timers in a sheet metal box with an analog potentiometer and lock nut to establish a setpoint with no readout or feedback to the driver. These early units used a resistor / capacitor charging scheme to trigger a unijunction transistor to <b>release</b> an electromechanical <b>relay.</b> Such drag racing delay timers are very crude by today's standards. Nolen (IKE) Hamma is credited with introducing such early devices to drag racing. (currently DBA as Digital Delay, INC.) Ike Hamma is deceased. His family is assigned a patent for a type of delay timer, his son Charlie Hamma is the current president of Digital Delay Inc., a manufacturer of drag racing timers. Other entities contributed to delay box technology and also have Intellectual Property. Some of these other entities have delay box patents (Reid and Furrow), some entities did not pursue patents for their inventions even though their inventions may have predated those of known patent holders.|$|R
40|$|Cortisol is <b>released</b> to <b>relay</b> {{information}} to cells to regulate metabolism and reaction to stress and inflammation. In particular, cortisol is {{released in the}} form of pulsatile signals. This low-energy method of signaling seems to be more efficient than continuous signaling. We hypothesize that there is a controller in the anterior pituitary that leads to pulsatile release of cortisol, and propose a mathematical formulation for such controller, which leads to impulse control as opposed to continuous control. We postulate that this controller is minimizing the number of secretory events that result in cortisol secretion, which is a way of minimizing the energy required for cortisol secretion; this controller maintains the blood cortisol levels within a specific circadian range while complying with the first order dynamics underlying cortisol secretion. We use an l 0 -norm cost function for this controller, and solve a reweighed l 1 -norm minimization algorithm for obtaining the solution to this optimization problem. We use 4 examples to illustrate the performance of this approach: (i) a toy problem that achieves impulse control, (ii) two examples that achieve physiologically plausible pulsatile cortisol release, (iii) an example where the number of pulses is not within the physiologically plausible range for healthy subjects while the cortisol levels are within the desired range. This novel approach results in impulse control where the impulses and the obtained blood cortisol levels have a circadian rhythm and an ultradian rhythm that are in agreement with the known physiology of cortisol secretion. The proposed formulation is a first step in developing intermittent controllers for curing cortisol deficiency. This type of bio-inspired pulse controllers can be employed for designing non-continuous controllers in brain-machine interface design for neuroscience applications...|$|R
500|$|When {{the trades}} {{indicated}} production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg {{and asked him}} bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where {{he had heard the}} rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was [...] "out to get him" [...] and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. In truth, Katzenberg was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt, which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated <b>release.</b> Lasseter grimly <b>relayed</b> the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.|$|R
5000|$|Schrödinger wrote: One {{can even}} set up quite ridiculous cases. A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, {{along with the}} {{following}} device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter, there is {{a tiny bit of}} radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps {{in the course of the}} hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a <b>relay</b> <b>releases</b> a hammer that shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The psi-function of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts.It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid a [...] "blurred model" [...] for representing reality. In itself, it would not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds and fog banks.|$|R
