40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the effect of trust and {{commitment}} in customer value creation. Thus, firstly, the different value creating functions in business relationships are examined. Next, the conceptual model that connects trust and commitment with the value creating functions is proposed. At this point the causal connections of the specified structural model are studied. The empirical results reveal that distributor's commitment is a direct and positive antecedent of value creation in a relationship, understood from a functionalist perspective. With reference to the other <b>relational</b> <b>variable,</b> distributor's trust, it has an indirect effect in value creation through distributor's commitment...|$|E

This study conceptualizes influence reputation as a <b>relational</b> <b>variable</b> that varies locally throughout a network. Drawing upon interviews with 168 interest group representatives in the United States health policy domain, this research examines the effects of multiplex networks of communication, coalitions, and issues on influence reputation. Using an exponential random graph model (ERGM), the analysis demonstrates that multiple roles of confidant, collaborator, and issue advocate affect how group representatives understand the influence of those with whom they are tied, after accounting for homophily among interest groups...|$|E

40|$|Social {{power is}} a {{fundamental}} concept in social relationships. Social power {{is defined as a}} potential capacity to change other's state by providing or withholding resources or administering punishments. It exists in many kinds of everyday relationships (e. g., teacher-student and peers). Power affects not only targets but also the agents who use it. Having power or lacking power affects people's emotions, cognitions and behaviors. The Approach/Inhibition theory of power states that elevated {{power is a}}ssociated with increased rewards and freedom and thereby activates approach-related tendencies. On the other hands, reduced power is associated with increased threat, punishment, and social constraints and thereby activates inhibition-related tendencies. In this theory, approach system links attention to rewards, positive emotions, automatic cognitions and disinhibited behaviors. Inhibition system, on the contrary, links attention to threats, negative emotions, controlled cognitions and inhibited behaviors. Another point of interest is whether or not power has the same effect across cultures. Power is originally a <b>relational</b> <b>variable,</b> and interpersona...|$|E

40|$|The present paper aims at {{confirming}} {{the influence of}} CSR policies on building up customer relationship through improving trust and commitment, {{and at the same}} time to study the influence of these values on satisfaction and loyalty. To achieve this purpose, a causal model that establishes the relationship between those variables has been developed and empirically tested. In order to verify the proposed hypothesis a structured survey was developed. The survey was given to a sample of 501 customers (valid responses) of modern distribution retail stores (supermarkets and hypermarkets) in Spain. All hypotheses are supported, thus confirming that the consumer perception on CSR policies carried out by the retailer influence on trust and consumer commitment to the company. As these variables affect satisfaction and loyalty, these results also confirm the indirect influence of CSR on customer satisfaction, through these <b>relational</b> <b>variables.</b> Therefore CSR is an essential tool for developing a long-standing relationship between the customer and the company. The originality is that there are very few works that address the study of the relationship between CSR and <b>relational</b> <b>variables</b> commitment and trust. The sample, consumers of retail establishments, is another originality. And the value is that CSR improves the competitiveness of retailing companies through the <b>relational</b> <b>variables...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to investigate, within the {{bargaining}} context, the effect of trust and suspiciousness on four categories of information: providing fictitious information, providing nontruthful information, providing personal disclosures, and seeking clarification. Participants role-played the buying and selling of a used car. Trust was viewed as a <b>relational</b> <b>variable,</b> that is, as being embedded in the relational milieu and history of the bargainers. Suspiciousness was treated as an individual difference variable, a personality trait concerned with the degree to which bargainers generally are predisposed to believe another bargainer. ^ Following an experiment in which dyads role-played the buying and selling of a car, suspiciousness was found to be correlated with providing nontruthful information, with high suspicious bargainers providing more nontruthful information than low suspicious bargainers. Likewise, bargainers who did not trust each other provided more fictitious and nontruthful information than bargainers who trusted each other. Role differences were found. Buyers provided more nontruthful information and personal disclosures than sellers, and sellers sought more clarification than buyers. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent work {{suggests}} that migrants {{have been a}} major driving force in the dramatic growth of international telephony over recent decades, accounting for large rises in telephone calls between countries with strong immigrant/emigrant connections. Yet, the existing literature has done a poor job of evaluating the substantive importance of migrants in explaining large disparities in levels of bilateral voice traffic observed between different countries. It has also failed to go very far in examining how domestic and relational factors moderate (namely amplify or attenuate) the influence of migrant stocks on international calling. Our contribution addresses these gaps in the literature. For a sample, which includes a far larger number of countries than previous studies, we show that, together with shorter-term visitors, bilateral migrant stocks emerge as the <b>relational</b> <b>variable</b> with one of the substantively largest influences over cross-national patterns of telephone calls. We also find that the effect of bilateral migrant stocks on inter-country telephone traffic is greater where the country pairs are richer and more spatially distant from one another...|$|E

Then, using survey data from the Pudong New Area of Shanghai in 2001, we present a statistical account and analysis of the increasingly varied and layered residential spaces of Shanghai into which people are ‘sorted’ by both internal local and extralocal factors. The analysis shows that, net of a number of demographic and socioeconomic variables, personal global connections have an effect on people living in different neighborhood areas, especially in more expensive and exclusive housing estates. Finally, we discuss the implications of the findings for how the individual-level impact of global connectivity could reinforce local spatiosocial stratification in rapidly globalizing cities like Shanghai. ...|$|E
40|$|Rationalism, pessimism and {{indeterminacy}} {{are three}} central characteristics of Waltz’s structural realism. Not surprisingly, {{they are also}} the aspects that most often come under attack by scholars aiming to either criticize or improve on Waltz’s ideas. Standing out in the former group, constructivists, inspired by Alexander Wendt, advocate a minimal reading of anarchy, where the latter can engender conflict and cooperation alike, depending of what states ‘make of it. ’ Attempts to improve on Waltz’s theory, on the other hand, usually concentrate on solving the indeterminacy problem by formulating theories that should explain political outcomes more accurately while retaining most of structural realism’s parsimony. The ‘offensive ’ and ‘defensive ’ realism schools are probably the most significant among these developments. Combining acknowledgement of the limits of neorealism with the recognition of the value and richness of this paradigm, this paper aims to reconcile the above theoretical positions (structural realism, constructivism, offensive and defensive realism) building on the work of Waltz himself. To do so we isolate Waltz’s idea of ‘socialization’—one of the ‘transmission belts ’ between structure and political outcomes—and turn this concept from a constant factor into an intervening and <b>relational</b> <b>variable</b> which moves along a quantitative (high/low) as well as a qualitative (conflictual/cooperative) dimension.

The cases, namely hospitality and call centre, are similar in terms of person specification {{and low levels of}} core job characteristics which makes for a viable comparison. The call centre context is a distinctive case due to electronic performance monitoring which is suggested as a factor contributing to different relationships between variables in this context. The growing prevalence of call centres and shift work both nationally and internationally creates the need for scrupulous examination of the impacts of this type of work on employees. The outcomes examined in these contexts include loneliness, fatigue as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. Resilience is examined as a <b>relational</b> <b>variable</b> as it {{has been found to be}} an enduring personality variable that serves as a counterweight to negative environmental forces acting upon well-being.

40|$|The role {{of social}} capital in {{processes}} of socioeconomic development has been studied extensively {{for more than a}} decade. Influential authors (Dasgupta and Sergaldin 2000; Narayan and Cassidy 2001; Woolcock 1998) in the field of development studies proposed a broad theoretical framework linking social capital and socioeconomic development. At the same time, major international organisations tried to turn this concept into a tool to work out development policies. Particularly, a group ofWorld Bank’s researcher (Bebbington et al. 2006) has produced a body of empirical studies that tackled the questions of how to measure social capital in developing contexts and how to evaluate development policies relying on this concept. The paper discusses the methodological difficulties of the measurement {{of social capital}} in adherence with the World Bank’s model (Fine 2001; Harper 2002) and affirms that social capital needs to be more narrowly defined and its explicative power in socioeconomic processes has to be reduced. To this purpose the studies on social capital carried out in the field of social network analysis represent the most promising starting point (Borgatti et al. 1998; Lin 2001; Lin et al. 2001). Therefore, firstly the paper defines social capital as a <b>relational</b> <b>variable</b> measurable in informational social networks. Secondly the concept of social capital key player is introduced and operationalised applying Borgatti’s KPP-POS measures (Borgatti 2006). Social capital key players are sets of actors that can maximally contribute to the diffusion of information and innovation in their social network, therefore potentially contributing more to endogenous processes of development (Chiesi 2007; Trigilia 2001). For this reason their individuation can substantially help the correct framing of local development policies that rely on the active participation of the affected comunities...|$|E
40|$|The {{strategic}} {{employment of}} ambiguity within communication {{was brought to}} prominence by Eric Eisenberg in his 1984 essay aimed at countering the prevailing ideology of clarity and openness as competence in organizational communication theory and research. Strategic ambiguity {{is defined as the}} deliberate, intentional use of ambiguity in communication {{in order to create a}} 'space' in which multiple interpretations by recipients are enabled and to which multiple responses are possible. The observation that strategic ambiguity results in the co-creation of meaning arises because the ambiguity is not an attribute of the communication per se, 'it is a <b>relational</b> <b>variable</b> which arises through a combination of source, message, and receiver factors'. Thus strategic ambiguity is an intertextual phenomenon and situated so the production and reception contexts of the communication are inseparable from the message itself. In this paper we wish to explore in more depth, the intentional aspects of strategic ambiguity to enrol the recipient actively in choosing how to interpret the message. In particular, we are interested in strategic ambiguity as a social strategy in that its use is 'determined by its effects on listeners and readers and the consequences of these effects in shaping the speaker or writer'. To begin our elucidation, we will review the use of ambiguity in organizational communication and related discursive concepts in the linguistic, political and legal communication and, more recently, organizational literatures. With a few exceptions, the potential of intentional use of ambiguity in a creative sense in organizational discourse has not been widely canvassed in the literature and its existence may still be viewed as a problem. What is evident, with its increasing dissemination in the organizational literature, however, is that there appears to be some equivocality over the implications of the intentional implementation of ambiguity in discourse. We will explore the sources of the uncertainty surrounding what is, and what is not, strategic ambiguity. The confusion over the concept of strategic ambiguity and its implementation has arisen, we believe, because of two characteristics that are not necessarily taken into account. First, for its use to be strategic there has to be intent rather than coincidence in the formation of the ambiguous message, so we will summarise the literature on the notion of strategic intent, as inducement to participate, in communication. Second, the producer of the message must assume that the recipient of the ambiguous communication will perceive it as equivocal and respond creatively but possibly unpredictably to the multiple choices offered by the ambiguity. Thus we will review the literature on interpretation of communications as part of the notion that the intentional use of ambiguous communication is a social discourse strategy. Following this review of the nuances in the use of ambiguity in communication, we will describe a framework encompassing types of discursive ambiguity in communication with the delineators being the notion of intent and the perception of choice by the recipient. We will discuss some of the issues that are evident in trying to research different components of the framework, such as recognising intent prior to the communication relationship as opposed to labelling it as intent in retrospect. Irrespective of these potential issues, we believe this framework will help both to clarify the notion of strategic ambiguity and differentiate it from related concepts, as well as to further the understanding of, and potential uses of, this discursive strategy in organizational sense-making...|$|E

30|$|Social {{farming is}} gaining {{increasing}} attention from multiple stakeholders in Europe {{because it can}} generate several socioeconomic benefits, for farming households too. The research—which {{is part of a}} project carried out by a healthcare authority in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in order to investigate social farming in the local area—is a first attempt to analyse social farm results and to what extent they are affected by farm assets, {{as well as by the}} environment in which farms are embedded. The proposed model is based on the investigation of the causal relationships between “structural”, “relational” and “social farm result” constructs (latent variables), and on the identification of their measurement scales (observed variables). The causal relationships between these three constructs have been tested via a structural equation model calculated with the linear structural relationship method. The findings show that social farm results are mainly influenced by the <b>relational</b> <b>variables</b> (e.g., social and economic relations). On the contrary, the structural variables (e.g., size) do not directly affect the results, but they do have a negative indirect effect on them which is mediated by the <b>relational</b> <b>variables.</b> The findings suggests that alongside structural investment support, it is also important to strengthen relations and networks at local level in order to reinforce social farm results. Overall the findings contribute to the further understanding of the driving forces affecting social farm performance and provide policy makers and practitioners with information for scaling-up social farming.|$|R
