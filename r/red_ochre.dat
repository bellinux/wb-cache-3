5|$|In the Period II, the finds {{excavated}} {{revealed that}} people had moved out from pit dwelling to structures built at the ground level. However, the pits and its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the pits and covering it with mud plaster, and occasionally painted in <b>red</b> <b>ochre.</b> Post-holes around the pits revealed that the superstructures were made of wood built over compacted Karewa soil floors.|$|E
5|$|Three stone hearths and {{traces of}} <b>red</b> <b>ochre</b> found on Jura and dated to 6000BC are the {{earliest}} stone-built structures found {{so far in}} Scotland. However, in general the Neolithic sites in the Inner Hebrides lack the scale and drama of those found in Orkney and the Western Isles.

5|$|Today {{there is}} {{widespread}} agreement among archaeologists that the world's first art and symbolic culture dates to the southern African Middle Stone Age.

Pierced and ochred Nassarius shell beads were also recovered from Blombos, with even earlier examples (Middle Stone Age, Aterian) from the Taforalt Caves. Arrows and hide working tools have been found at Sibudu Cave as evidence of making weapons with compound heat treated gluing technology.|$|E

5|$|The {{west coast}} of Canada by 7,000–5000BCE (9,000–7,000years ago) saw various {{cultures}} who organized themselves around salmon fishing. The Nuu-chah-nulth of Vancouver Island began whaling with advanced long spears at about this time. The Maritime Archaic is one group of North America's Archaic culture of sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic. They prospered from approximately 7,000BCE–1,500BCE (9,000–3,500 years ago) along the Atlantic Coast of North America. Their settlements included longhouses and boat-topped temporary or seasonal houses. They engaged in long-distance trade, using as currency white chert, a rock quarried from northern Labrador to Maine. The Pre-Columbian culture, whose members were called Red Paint People, is indigenous to the New England and Atlantic Canada regions of North America. The culture flourished between 3,000BCE–1,000BCE (5,000–3,000years ago) and was named after their burial ceremonies, which used large quantities of <b>red</b> <b>ochre</b> to cover bodies and grave goods.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the chisel, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the reed pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of carbon black and <b>red</b> <b>ochre,</b> the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds. It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus papyrus. It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.|$|E
5|$|The testing {{showed that}} the base layer onto which the codex was painted is {{composed}} of gypsum, a material used as a base layer for paintings since antiquity. The black paint was analysed with RBS and {{found to be a}} carbon-based pigment consistent with other pre-Columbian Mexican codices. The red colour used in the codex is <b>red</b> <b>ochre,</b> an iron-based pigment. There is very little blue colouration in the Grolier Codex and the presence of the distinctive Maya Blue pigment could not be confirmed. Analysis by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) revealed the blue pigment used on the codex does not contain cobalt and does contain clay. Its elemental composition matches that of palygorskite, the main inorganic component of Maya Blue. However, some other materials such as lapis lazuli could not be ruled out since PIXE only identifies elements, not compounds. The investigators concluded that the codex does contain some original pre-Columbian materials but could not confirm that the document is authentic.|$|E

5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning.

Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|R
5|$|Traces of red pigment {{still remain}} on the figure's body that was {{originally}} painted red overall. The feathers of her wings and the owls' feathers were also colored red, alternating with black and white. By Raman spectroscopy the red pigment is identified as <b>red</b> <b>ochre,</b> the black pigment, amorphous carbon ("lamp black") and the white pigment gypsum. Black pigment is also found on {{the background of the}} plaque, the hair and eyebrows, and on the lions' manes. The pubic triangle and the areola appear accentuated with red pigment but were not separately painted black. The lions' bodies were painted white. The British Museum curators assume that the horns of the headdress and part of the necklace were originally colored yellow, just as they are on a very similar clay figure from Ur. They surmise that the bracelets and rod-and-ring symbols might also have been painted yellow. However, no traces of yellow pigment now {{remain on the}} relief.|$|E

For the Clearwell Caves ochres, which range in colour from yellow-orange to red-brown, it is shown that the colour {{is related to the}} nature of the chromophore present and not to any differences in particle size. The darker <b>red</b> <b>ochres</b> contain predominantly haematite while the yellow ochre contains only goethite. The ochres from Qatalhoyuk contain only about one-twentieth of the levels of iron found in the Clearwell Caves ochres. The iron oxide pigment (haematite in all cases studied here) has been mixed with a soft lime plaster which also contains calcite and silicate (clay) minerals. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.
