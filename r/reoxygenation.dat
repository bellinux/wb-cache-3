50|$|Cardioprotection {{encompasses}} several regimens {{that have}} shown to preserve function and viability of cardiac muscle cell tissue subjected to ischemic insult or <b>reoxygenation.</b> Cardioprotection includes {{strategies that are}} implemented before an ischemic event (preconditioning, PC), during an ischemic event (perconditioning, PerC) and after the event and during reperfusion (postconditioning, PostC). These strategies can be further stratified by performing the intervention locally or remotely, creating classes of conditioning known as remote ischemic PC (RIPC), remote ischemic PostC and remost ischemic PerC. Classical (local) preconditioning has an early phase with an immediate onset lasting 2-3 hours that protects against myocardial infarction. The early phase involves post-translational modification of preexisting proteins, {{brought about by the}} activation of G protein-coupled receptors as well as downstream MAPK’s and PI3/Akt. These signaling events act on the ROS-generating mitochondria, activate PKCε and the Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) pathway, preventing mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP) opening.

40|$|CONTEXT: Exposure of hepatocytes to {{pathological}} {{conditions in}} a microenvironment of hypoxia and <b>reoxygenation</b> is very frequent in hepatic diseases. Several substances present perspectives for cytoprotective action on hepatocyte submitted to <b>reoxygenation</b> after hypoxia and simple hypoxia. OBJECTIVE: We research therapeutic options for hepatocytes submitted to hypoxia and hypoxia + <b>reoxygenation</b> injury. METHODS: Primary culture of rat hepatocytes was submitted to hypoxia (2 hours) plus <b>reoxygenation</b> (2 hours) and simple hypoxia (4 hours) {{in the presence}} or the absence of cytoprotectors. The hepatocyte lesion was evaluated by functional criteria through percentage of lactate dehydrogenase released and cell viability. The effects of the cytoprotectors prostaglandin E 1 3 &# 951;g/mL, superoxide dismutase 80 &# 956;g/mL, allopurinol 20 &# 956;M and verapamil 10 - 4 M were studied in this model of injury. RESULTS: <b>Reoxygenation</b> after hypoxia induced more significant lesion in cultured hepatocytes compared to simple hypoxia, detected by analysis of functional criteria. There was a significant reduction of percentage of lactate dehydrogenase released and a significant increase of percentage of cell viability in the hypoxia + <b>reoxygenation</b> + cytoprotectors groups compared to hypoxia + <b>reoxygenation</b> groups. Prostaglandin E 1, superoxide dismutase and verapamil also protected the group submitted to simple hypoxia, when evaluated by functional criteria.

40|$|AbstractReperfusion injury {{represents}} an important cause of primary graft non-function during liver transplantation. However, the mechanism responsible for cellular damage during <b>reoxygenation</b> {{has not yet}} been completely understood. We have investigated whether changes in intracellular Na+ distribution might contribute to cause hepatocyte damage during <b>reoxygenation</b> buffer after 24 h of cold storage. Hepatocyte <b>reoxygenation</b> resulted in a rapid increase in cellular Na+ content that was associated with cytotoxicity. Na+ accumulation and hepatocyte death were prevented by the omission of Na+ from the incubation medium, but not by the addition of antioxidants. Blocking Na+/H+ exchanger and Na+/HCO 3 − co-transporter by, respectively, 5 -(N,N-dimethyl) -amiloride or omitting HCO 3 − from the <b>reoxygenation</b> medium significantly decreased Na+ overload and cytotoxicity. Stimulation of ATP re-synthesis by the addition of fructose also lowered Na+ accumulation and cell death during <b>reoxygenation.</b> A significant protection against Na+-mediated <b>reoxygenation</b> injury was evident in hepatocytes maintained in an acidic buffer (pH 6. 5) or in the presence of glycine. The cytoprotective action of glycine or of the acidic buffer was reverted by promoting Na+ influx with the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin.

40|$|Due to the {{abnormal}} vasculature {{of solid}} tumors, tumor cell oxygenation can change rapidly {{with the opening}} and closing of blood vessels, leading to the activation of both hypoxic response pathways and oxidative stress pathways upon <b>reoxygenation.</b> Here, we report that ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent phosphorylation and activation of Chk 2 occur {{in the absence of}} DNA damage during hypoxia and are maintained during <b>reoxygenation</b> in response to DNA damage. Our studies involving oxidative damage show that Chk 2 is required for G 2 arrest. Following exposure to both hypoxia and <b>reoxygenation,</b> Chk 2 −/− cells exhibit an attenuated G 2 arrest, increased apoptosis, reduced clonogenic survival, and deficient phosphorylation of downstream targets. These studies indicate that the combination of hypoxia and <b>reoxygenation</b> results in a G 2 checkpoint response that is dependent on the tumor suppressor Chk 2 and that this checkpoint response is essential for tumor cell adaptation to changes that result from the cycling nature of hypoxia and <b>reoxygenation</b> found in solid tumors...|$|E
40|$|Perfluorochemicals (PFCs) {{are known}} to provide a unique tool for {{controlled}} uptake and delivery of oxygen. We have charac-terized the effects of incremental oxygen delivery on cell via-bility of human ischemic cardiomyocytes using chemically inert PFCs as oxygen carrier. We have found that cell viability after prolonged ischemia depends on the dose of oxygen supple-mentation by oxygenated (ox) PFCs during <b>reoxygenation.</b> Al-though <b>reoxygenation</b> with the transient addition of oxPFCs in high concentrations (2250 M O 2 in 0. 4 M PFCs) results in decreased cell viability compared with normoxic reoxygen-ation, cell survival increases by 30 4 % after <b>reoxygenation</b> with moderate oxPFC concentrations (750 M O 2 in 0. 1 M PFCs). Immunoblot analysis revealed that oxPFC-supplemented <b>reoxygenation</b> causes marked (16 -fold) deactivation of death-as...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>reoxygenation</b> studies on free overall weirs has been reviewed {{with the main}} objective of investigating model scale effects. A nomogram has been presented for constant values of (r - 1) {{as a function of}} the nappe Froude and Reynolds numbers. Analysis of the nomogram indicates that small-scale Froude model studies tend to underestimate prototype <b>reoxygenation,</b> whereas laboratory experiments at prototype heights of fall tend to overestimate the <b>reoxygenation</b> if no consideration of flow rate is made. Correction factors for temperature and water quality effects have been examined. It is hoped that this nomogram will serve as a guide to the complicated interrelationships involved in the <b>reoxygenation</b> process and as a method for uniform presentation for comparison of data acquired in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiarrhythmic}} {{effect of}} verapamil was tested on spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias during <b>reoxygenation</b> after 15 min of glucose-free hypoxia and on programmed electrical stimulation-(8 stimuli + 1 or 2 extrastimuli) induced ventricular fibrillation in isolated Langendorff perfused guinea pig hearts. Verapamil (1 mg/l) added during hypoxia and <b>reoxygenation</b> significantly reduced, during <b>reoxygenation,</b> {{the incidence of}} arrhythmias (46 %, N = 13 vs. controls 87 %, N = 30; P less than 0. 01), of ventricular fibrillation (0 %, N = 13 vs. controls 70 %, N = 30; P less than 0. 001) and of programmed stimulation-induced ventricular fibrillation (0 %, N = 10 vs. controls 100 %, N = 16). No effect was observed on programmed stimulation-induced ventricular fibrillation during hypoxia (90 %, N = 10 vs. controls 100 %, N = 10). Verapamil added during <b>reoxygenation</b> reduced the incidence of <b>reoxygenation</b> arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation (47 % and 29 %, N = 17, P less than 0. 01 and P less than 0. 05 vs. controls, respectively) but it {{had no effect on}} programmed stimulation-induced ventricular fibrillation (100 %, N = 10). It is likely that verapamil exerts its antiarrhythmic effect by preventing cellular calcium overload during hypoxia and <b>reoxygenation...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} whether different durations of severe hypoxia (0. 5 mgO 2 L− 1) followed by <b>reoxygenation</b> cause damage to the locomotor muscle of the crab Neohelice granulata. We evaluated reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (LPO), mitochondrial membrane potential, and aerobic fiber area of the locomotor muscle after different periods of hypoxia (1, 4, or 10 h) followed by 30 or 120 min of <b>reoxygenation.</b> Additionally, changes in cell volume, mitochondrial dysfunction, and infiltration of hemocytes were evaluated after hypoxia and a subsequent 2, 24, or 48 h of <b>reoxygenation.</b> After hypoxia, neither ROS nor LPO increased. However, mitochondrial membrane potential and aerobic fiber area decreased in a time-dependent manner. After <b>reoxygenation,</b> the ROS and LPO levels increased and mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, but these quickly recovered in crabs exposed to 4 h of hypoxia. On the other hand, alterations of mitochondria resulted in morphological changes in aerobic fibers, which required more time to recover during <b>reoxygenation</b> after 10 h of hypoxia. The locomotor muscles of the crab N. granulata suffer damage after hypoxia and <b>reoxygenation.</b> The intensity of this damage is dependent on the duration of hypoxia. In all experimental situations analyzed, the locomotor muscle of this crab was capable of recovery...|$|E
