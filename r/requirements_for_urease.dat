40|$|Syntheses of metal-containing enzymes {{often require}} the {{participation}} of accessory proteins. The roles played by many of these accessory proteins are poorly characterized. Klebsiella aerogenes urease, a nickel-containing enzyme, provides an ideal system to study metallocenter assembly. Here, we describe a method for isolating a complex containing urease apoprotein and the UreD, UreF, and UreG accessory proteins. We demonstrate that urease apoprotein in this complex is activated to near wild-type enzyme levels when incubated with nickel ions and high (≈ 100 mM) concentrations of bicarbonate. Significantly, we also observed nickel-dependent activation at physiologically relevant (≈ 100 μM) bicarbonate levels, {{but only in the}} presence of GTP. Based on studies involving a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, we conclude that nucleotide hydrolysis, not just binding, is required for this process. The critical nucleotide-binding site was localized to UreG on the basis of experiments using a variant complex. These studies highlight the relevance of the UreD-UreF-UreG-urease apoprotein complex to nickel metallocenter assembly and explain the previously identified in vivo energy <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>urease</b> activation...|$|R
40|$|The uptake (transport and metabolism) of urea was {{studied in}} {{a strain of}} the marine {{bacterium}} DeZeya uenusta, measuring the uptake of [14 C]urea in viuu and the urease reaction in uitru. Urea uptake in uiuo was sodium-dependent and exhibited a K, value of 1 - 4 p ~ for urea, a broad pH optimum between pH 6. 0 and 8 - 5, a distinct temperature optimum at 35 "C and a <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> energy. <b>Urease</b> activity in uitru exhibited a K, value of 0. 86 mM for urea and showed maximum activities at pH 8. 5 and 60 OC; the enzyme was neither dependent {{on the presence of}} sodium, nor inhibited by metabolic inhibitors. Synthesis of the urea uptake system was subject to nitrogen control; ammonium resulted in a repression of the system, whereas high uptake rates were observed after growth with nitrate or incubation of the cells {{in the absence of a}} nitrogen source. The uptake reaction in uiuu, but not the urease activity in uitru, was decreased greatly in the presence of ammonium. This inhibition was relieved by methionine sulphoximine (MSX), a potent inhibitor of glutamine synthetase; in mutant strains impaired in this enzyme no inhibition of urea uptake by ammonium was observed. These results suggest that glutamine formed from ammonium rather than ammonium itself regulates urea uptake activity in D. uenusta...|$|R

40|$|The nickel-containing enzymes of Helicobacter pylori, urease and hydrogenase, are {{essential}} for efficient colonization in the human stomach. The insertion of nickel into urease and hydrogenase is mediated by the accessory protein HypA. HypA contains an N-terminal nickel-binding site and a dynamic structural zinc-binding site.

Thus, the zinc and metal coordination sites of HypA play similar roles in urease and hydrogenase maturation. In other pathogenic bacteria, deletion of hydrogenase leads to a loss in acid resistance.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori is {{dependent}} upon {{the production of the}} highly abundant and active metalloenzyme <b>urease</b> <b>for</b> colonization of the human stomach. Thus, H. pylori has an absolute <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> the transition metal nickel, a required cofactor <b>for</b> <b>urease.</b> To investigate the contribution of genes that are factors in this process, microarray analysis comparing the transcriptome of wild-type H. pylori 26695 cultured in brucella broth containing fetal calf serum (BBF) alone or supplemented with 100 μM NiCl 2 suggested that HP 1512 is repressed in the presence of 100 μM supplemental nickel. When measured by comparative real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), HP 1512 transcription was reduced 43 -fold relative to the value for the wild type when cultured in BBF supplemented with 10 μM NiCl 2. When grown in unsupplemented BBF, urease activity of an HP 1512 ::cat mutant was significantly reduced compared to the wild type, 4. 9 ± 0. 5 μmol/min/mg of protein (n = 7) and 17. 1 ± 4. 9 μmol/min/mg of protein (n = 13), respectively (P < 0. 0001). In silico analysis of the HP 1511 -HP 1512 (HP 1511 - 1512) intergenic region identified a putative NikR operator upstream of HP 1512. Gel shift analysis with purified recombinant NikR verified nickel-dependent binding of H. pylori NikR to the HP 1511 - 1512 intergenic region. Furthermore, comparative real-time qPCR of four nickel-related genes suggests that mutation of HP 1512 results in reduced intracellular nickel concentration relative to wild-type H. pylori 26695.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{produces}} a potent urease that {{is believed to}} play a role in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal diseases. Four genes (ureA, ureB, ureC, and ureD) were previously shown to be able to achieve a urease-positive phenotype when introduced into Campylobacter jejuni, whereas Escherichia coli cells harboring these genes did not express urease activity (A. Labigne, V. Cussac, and P. Courcoux, J. Bacteriol. 173 : 1920 - 1931, 1991). Results that demonstrate that H. pylori urease genes could be expressed in E. coli are presented in this article. This expression was found to be dependent on the presence of accessory urease genes hitherto undescribed. Subcloning of the recombinant cosmid pILL 585, followed by restriction analyses, resulted in the cloning of an 11. 2 -kb fragment (pILL 753) which allowed the detection of urease activity (0. 83 +/- 0. 39 mumol of urea hydrolyzed per min/mg of protein) in E. coli cells grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions. Transposon mutagenesis of pILL 753 with mini-Tn 3 -Km permitted the identification of a 3. 3 -kb DNA region that, in addition to the 4. 2 -kb region previously identified, was essential <b>for</b> <b>urease</b> activity in E. coli. Sequencing of the 3. 3 -kb DNA fragment revealed the presence of five open reading frames encoding polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 20, 701 (UreE), 28, 530 (UreF), 21, 744 (UreG), 29, 650 (UreH), and 19, 819 (UreI). Of the nine urease genes identified, ureA, ureB, ureF, ureG, and ureH were shown to be required <b>for</b> <b>urease</b> expression in E. coli, as mutations in each of these genes led to negative phenotypes.

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess whether bacteria, including Helicobacter, could be involved in the aetiology of gastric glandular lesions seen in horses. Results Stomach lesions, as well as normal appearing mucosa were obtained from horses slaughtered for human consumption. All samples were tested <b>for</b> <b>urease</b> activity using the Pyloritek ® assay, while mucosal bacterial content was evaluated using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation. In selected sub samples, bacteria characterisation was pursued further by cloning and sequencing. Mucosal lesions were found in 36 / 63 stomachs and included hyperplastic rugae, polypoid structures and focal erosions. None of the samples were tested positive <b>for</b> <b>urease</b> activity or <b>for</b> FISH using the Helicobacter genus specific probe. In samples of lesions, as well as normal samples, clones with 99 % similarities to Lactobacillus salivarius and Sarcina ventriculi were found.

Based on a phylogenetic tree these clones had 100 % similarity to Escherichia fergusonii and Enterococcus faecium. The Enterococcus were found colonising the mucosal surface, while E. fergusonii organisms were also demonstrated intraepithelial. Conclusion Gastric Helicobacter spp. could not be verified as being involved in lesions of the glandular stomach of the horse. Since E. fergusonii has been described as an emerging pathogen in both humans and animals, the finding of this bacterium in gastric erosion warrants further clarification to whether gastric infection with this type bacterium is important for horses. </p...|$|R
40|$|Urease is a nickel-containing urea {{hydrolase}} {{involved in}} nitrogen recycling from ureide, purine, and arginine catabolism in plants. The process of urease activation by incorporation of nickel into the active {{site is a}} prime example of chaperone-mediated metal transfer to an enzyme. Four urease accessory proteins are required for activation in Klebsiella aerogenes. In plants urease accessory proteins have so far been only partially defined. Using reverse genetic tools we identified four genes that are necessary <b>for</b> <b>urease</b> activity in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; ecotypes Columbia and Nössen). Plants bearing T-DNA or Ds element insertions in either the structural gene <b>for</b> <b>urease</b> or in any of the three putative urease accessory genes AtureD, AtureF, and AtureG lacked the corresponding mRNAs and were defective in urease activity. In contrast to wild-type plants, the mutant lines were not able to support growth with urea as the sole nitrogen source. To investigate whether the identified accessory proteins would be sufficient to support eukaryotic urease activation, the corresponding cDNAs were introduced into urease-negative Escherichia coli. In these bacteria, urease activity was observed only when all three plant accessory genes were coexpressed together with the plant urease gene. Remarkably, plant urease activation occurred as well in cell-free E. coli extracts, but only in extracts from cells that had expressed all three accessory proteins. The future molecular dissection of the plant urease activation process may therefore be performed in vitro, providing a powerful tool to further our understanding of the biochemistry of chaperone-mediated metal transfer processes in plants...|$|R
