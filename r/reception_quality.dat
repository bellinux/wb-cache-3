25|$|DAB is more {{efficient}} in its use of spectrum than analogue FM radio, and thus may offer more radio services for the same given bandwidth. DAB is more robust with regard to noise and multipath fading for mobile listening, since DAB <b>reception</b> <b>quality</b> first degrades rapidly when the signal strength falls below a critical threshold, whereas FM <b>reception</b> <b>quality</b> degrades slowly with the decreasing signal.|$|E
25|$|Low power gap-filler {{transmitters}} can {{be added}} to an SFN as and when desired in order to improve <b>reception</b> <b>quality,</b> although the way SFNs have been implemented in the UK up to now they have tended to consist of higher power transmitters being installed at main transmitter sites in order to keep costs down.|$|E
2500|$|The first 2,200 cars {{produced}} used a windshield-embedded antenna. This type of antenna {{proved to}} be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually [...] "seek", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna {{was added to the}} outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved, this time {{to the rear of the}} car. Automatic antennas were installed under the grills behind the rear driver's-side window. While giving the <b>reception</b> <b>quality</b> of a whip antenna, these completely disappear from view when not in use.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>reception</b> <b>quality</b> {{during the}} early stage of {{deployment}} of DAB was poor even for people who live well within the coverage area. The {{reason for this is}} that the old version of DAB uses weak error correction coding, so that when there are a lot of errors with the received data not enough of the errors can be corrected and a [...] "bubbling mud" [...] sound occurs. In some cases a complete loss of signal can happen. This situation has been improved upon in the new DAB standard (DAB+, discussed below) that uses stronger error correction coding and as additional transmitters are built.|$|E
2500|$|The TR.9D HF radio {{telephone}} set in fighters {{at the time}} of the Battle of Britain had two channels and the operating frequencies of the two could only be selected before take-off. One channel was used for voice communication with sector control, while the other was used by the [...] "pip-squeak" [...] system. With only one voice channel, set to a squadron-specific frequency, the TR.9D limited the ability to co-ordinate with other squadrons. The set was low power, with a range of about [...] air-to-ground and [...] air-to-air, which presented numerous problems with <b>reception</b> <b>quality.</b> The TR.9 originally operated on a band that was relatively empty, but by the time of the war it was much busier and interference was a constant problem.|$|E
2500|$|The old {{version of}} DAB uses {{punctured}} convolutional coding for its ECC. The coding scheme uses {{unequal error protection}} (UEP), which means that parts of the audio bit-stream that {{are more susceptible to}} errors causing audible disturbances are provided with more protection (i.e. a lower code rate) and vice versa. However, the UEP scheme used on DAB results in there being a grey area in between the user experiencing good <b>reception</b> <b>quality</b> and no reception at all, as opposed to the situation with most other wireless digital communication systems that have a sharp [...] "digital cliff", where the signal rapidly becomes unusable if the signal strength drops below a certain threshold. When DAB listeners receive a signal in this intermediate strength area they experience a [...] "burbling" [...] sound which interrupts the playback of the audio.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{investigates the}} effects of the Cyclic Delay Diversity (CDD) {{transmit}} diversity scheme on DVB-H networks. Transmit diversity improves <b>reception</b> and <b>Quality</b> of Service (QoS) in areas of poor coverage such as sparsely populated or obscured locations. The technique not only provides robust reception in mobile environments thus improving QoS, but it also reduces network costs in terms of the transmit power, number of infrastructure elements, antenna height and the frequency reuse factor over indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, the benefit and effectiveness of CDD transmit diversity is tackled through simulation results for comparison in several scenarios of coverage in DVB-H networks. The channel model used in the simulations is based on COST 207 and a basic radio plannin...|$|R
