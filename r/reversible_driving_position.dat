5000|$|Slingshot—early front-engined dragster, {{named for}} the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> behind the rear wheels (erroneously {{attributed}} to launch speed).|$|R
25|$|The first {{mid-engined}} {{car with}} central <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> (albeit Lancia deposited a patent for a central driven design in 1934).|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} are configured with {{a single}} cab, with <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> for both directions. The overhauled diesel engines are from Henschel.|$|R
50|$|Many {{parts were}} carried over, {{most notably the}} running gear. The raised <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> and the new {{instrument}} panel had, {{along with some of}} the suspension upgrades, already been introduced to the Cortina Mark III in 1975, so that from the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> the new car looked much more familiar to owners of recent existing Cortinas than from the outside. Cinema audiences received an early glimpse of the new Cortina (or Taunus) through its appearance in the James Bond The Spy Who Loved Me 1977 film.|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in Applied Ergonomics [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] primary purposes of a vehicle driver’s seat, is {{to allow them to}} complete the driving task comfortably and safely. Within each class of vehicle (e. g. passenger, commercial, industrial, agricultural), there is an expected <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> to which a vehicle cabin is designed. This paper reports a study that compares two <b>driving</b> <b>positions,</b> in relation to Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs), in terms of driver performance and driver discomfort. In the ‘elevated’ <b>driving</b> <b>position,</b> the seat is higher than usually used in road vehicles; this is compared to a standard <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> replicating the layout for a commercially available vehicle. It is shown that for a sample of 12 drivers, the elevated position did not, in general, show more discomfort than the standard position over a 60 minutes driving simulation, although discomfort increased with duration. There were no adverse effects shown for emergency stop reaction time or for driver headway for the elevated posture compared to the standard posture. The only body part that showed greater discomfort for the elevated posture compared to the standard posture was the right ankle. A second experiment confirmed that for 12 subjects, a higher pedal stiffness eliminated the ankle discomfort problem...|$|R
50|$|To {{keep the}} car compact despite the large engine, the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> {{was so far}} forward that {{the feet of the}} driver were beyond the front wheel axle.|$|R
50|$|To reduce weight, the {{locomotives}} had unusual inside framed bogies. Combined {{with the}} high <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> and rounded body, this gave the V 200 a very distinctive appearance.|$|R
50|$|The driver's cab and {{exterior}} {{design of the}} locomotives was undertaken by DCA Design, Warwick, UK. Side windows in the locomotive cab are omitted to prevent 'segment flicker' caused by fast running in the tunnel, a potential distraction and cause of driver drowsiness. The <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> was air conditioned and pressurised, and incorporated in-cab TVM 430 signalling. The driving cab also incorporates train manager's facilities, including safety systems such as CCTV, alarms and communication links. There is a second <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> for shunting {{at the rear of}} the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the wheel}} {{was a new}} {{instrument}} cluster, complete with tachometer, glowing in blue and red nuances behind its curvaceous housing. New, softer seats made for an elevated <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
50|$|The W196s monoposto <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> was {{modified}} to standard two-abreast seating, headlights were added, {{and a few}} other changes made to adapt a strictly track competitor to a 24-hour road/track sports racer.|$|R
50|$|Orthopedic {{seats were}} an {{expensive}} option {{from the factory}} but consisted of several different air cushions in the seat that the user can inflate and deflate to find the perfect <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Überlandwagen {{shared a}} common chassis with the A7V tank, with {{suspension}} derived from the American Holt tractor and twin 100 hp Daimler engines centrally mounted. A <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> was sited above the engines on a platform, with dual sets of controls for driving in either direction to avoid the need to turn the vehicle. A canopy was fitted over the <b>driving</b> <b>position,</b> and wooden dropsides and ends were fitted at {{the front and rear}} of the vehicle. Some examples had rails added to support a tarpaulin over the load spaces. Towing hooks were fitted {{at both ends of the}} chassis.|$|R
50|$|This {{was similar}} to the Mark 1, but had a forward <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b> It was a much longer vehicle, being 31 ft long {{compared}} with the 23 ft length of the Mark I.|$|R
50|$|While most of {{the older}} trams are unidirectional, and thus have to be turned on a loop in order to reverse direction, the newer ones are bi-directional, with <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> and doors on both end/sides.|$|R
5000|$|What Car? gave it 2/5 saying its pros {{were that}} it is [...] "pretty and affordable" [...] but its cons were [...] "The <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> and {{steering}} are not what you'd expect in such a sporty car." ...|$|R
50|$|Daewoo {{claimed the}} Mirae was the world's first {{versatile}} sports car combining {{the flexibility to}} alter seat layouts from 4 seat MPV to single seater. The pedal and steering wheel could move to provide left-hand, right-hand, or central <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
50|$|The line {{is unusual}} in that all {{platforms}} are {{on one side of}} this single track line. In view of this, the cars that run on it only have doors on one side but have <b>driving</b> <b>positions</b> at both ends.|$|R
5000|$|The {{order was}} made up of 192 motor cars and 228 trailers. The motor cars had wooden bodies on steel underframes and one motored bogie {{containing}} two GE69 traction motors each rated at [...] controlled with British Thomson-Houston (BTH) equipment. Both bogies carried shoegear, that were connected together by a power bus line. One hundred and twenty end motor cars had one <b>driving</b> <b>position,</b> the reminder with two diving positions were intended for the centre of trains. Twenty end motor cars were built with luggage compartments but these were soon replaced with seating. The trailer cars were built entirely of wood, thirty two having <b>driving</b> <b>positions.</b> The trains were fitted with the Westinghouse air brake.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{with the}} Lotus 18, the 20 {{had a much}} reduced frontal area and lower centre of gravity, aided by the fact the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> was {{reclined}} so the driver was nearly lying down, compared with being more upright in the Lotus 18.|$|R
50|$|The Triumph Dolomite was {{selected}} for improvement, {{due in part to}} the vehicle's combination of advanced engines and upright <b>driving</b> <b>position,</b> which offered a blend of modern and traditional luxuries. The Panther Rio was the result, and was launched in September 1975.|$|R
50|$|Visibility {{from the}} driver's seat and {{passenger}} seat was better {{due to the}} lower instrument panel design of the front window and a large windshield. And switches are arranged efficiently {{and at the time}} was the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> can be fine-tuned adjustments.|$|R
50|$|The Toyota DMT (Dual Mode Traveller) was {{a concept}} van made by Toyota and first {{shown at the}} October 2001 Tokyo Motor Show. The van had a high mounted <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> and a rear cabin {{designed}} to be useful as an office or studio.|$|R
5000|$|Ford's Type 315-A [...] "Standrive" [...] route {{delivery}} trucks {{featured a}} Raulang body upon the model's introduction in 1931. The [...] "Standrive" [...] models were built using a special Ford Model AA-112 drop-center chassis, which allowed {{a very low}} walk-in and standing <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
5000|$|ISIRI 13134 is a {{standard}} published by the Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran (ISIRI) in 2011 based on Directive 80/720/EEC. It defines [...] "Operating space, access to the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> and {{the doors and windows}} of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors".|$|R
25|$|The {{first ten}} had a central cab and {{were known as}} camel-backs, and these entered service in 1906. A year later another ten units with a box design and a <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> both ends arrived. These were {{replaced}} by more powerful units in the early 1920s.|$|R
50|$|This model {{represents}} a typical British {{light commercial vehicle}} of the interwar period. It has an enclosed rear body with twin rear-opening doors and an open <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b> It is painted dark green (DV1) or dark blue (DV2) with brass detailing and carries a Mamod livery.|$|R
50|$|These 2 rail buses saw {{a return}} to having only a <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> at one end only along with only having a door on one side. The door on these buses however was a siding door instead of the swing door on the {{previous}} rail buses.|$|R
5000|$|The high <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> {{and large}} glass area affords drivers with good all-round visibility, while the rear lamps are mounted {{high up on}} the {{structure}} so other road users can see them more prominently. Doors are fitted with anti intrusion bars with child locks at the rear.|$|R

50|$|In 1927, the Lanchester Motor Company {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} for a six-wheeled armoured car. By March 1928 two prototypes, D1E1 and D1E2 (the latter equipped with rear doors for a swift exit) were built with different armament and turret shapes, D1E2 also having an additional rear <b>driving</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary reports {{praised the}} all-round {{visibility}} and the commanding <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> while recording {{that it was}} necessary to lean forward a little to engage first and third gears due to the long travel distance of the gear lever. [...] The large 40 cm tall luggage compartment was also commended.|$|R
5000|$|Each of the {{two main}} classes {{exhibited}} variations: locomotive brakes could be operated by vacuum or steam pressure; the <b>driving</b> <b>position</b> {{could be on the}} right- or the left-hand side of the cab; and there were three sizes of coal bunker.
