50|$|<b>Running</b> <b>royalties</b> are {{predominantly}} used in patent, trademark and franchise licensing since they can theoretically be exploited without any other inputs from the licensor once the license has been executed.|$|E
50|$|Lumpsum {{royalties}} {{are most}} often encountered when the principal contribution of the licensor is providing formulae, documentation, designs and the like. That is, once the transmission of the latter is completed, the licensor has no involvement with the licensee {{so long as the}} caveats and rights of the license are respected. In some cases, the lumpsum merely represents the 'capitalization' (PV) of a part of the <b>running</b> <b>royalties.</b>|$|E
50|$|The organization's general counsel, James F. Coffee, and {{accountant}} Ernest Sonderling, {{were the}} architects of the successful business model whereby the designs and inventions were patented and licensed to various toy companies and manufacturers who would pay <b>running</b> <b>royalties</b> based on sales. Outside counsel, chairman and founder of the Intellectual Property Department at McDermott Will & Emery, Robert J. Schneider, was responsible for procuring the patents and protecting them from infringement. Mr. Schneider is currently Co-Chair of the Intellectual Property Department of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister LLP.|$|E

40|$|In a model {{where two}} {{competing}} downstream firms establish an input joint venture (JV), we analyze how different royalty rules for covering fixed costs affect channel profits. Under <b>running</b> <b>royalties</b> (regardless of whether based on predicted or actual output), the downstream firms' perceived marginal costs are above the true marginal costs since fixed costs are incorporated. We find that tougher {{competition between the}} JV partners may actually increase channel profit under such a scheme. We also show that <b>running</b> <b>royalties</b> based on predicted output are outperformed by royalties based on actual output, but that lump-sum financing of the JV is preferable if the competitive pressure is weak...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We analyze patent {{licensing}} by a patent holder to downstream technology users. We study how {{the structure and}} level of royalties depends on the patent’s strength, i. e., the probability it would be upheld in court. We examine the social value of determining patent validity before licensing, in terms of deadweight loss (ex post) and innovation incentives (ex ante). When downstream users do not compete against each other or the patent holder, license fees approximate the license fee for an ironclad patent times the patent strength, and reviewing validity before licensing would be unproductive (in expected value). But when downstream users compete, two-part tariffs for weak patents have high running royalty rates, combined with a negative fixed fee, and examining patent validity generates social benefits, both ex post and ex ante. Even without negative fixed fees, rival downstream firms will accept relatively high <b>running</b> <b>royalties,</b> so determining patent validity prior to licensing is socially beneficial...|$|E
5000|$|Following a three week jury trial, on November 6, 2012, a jury {{ruled in}} favor of Vringo's wholly owned subsidiary, I/P Engine, and against the {{defendants}} with respect to defendants' infringement of the asserted claims of the patents. After finding that the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit were both valid, and infringed by Defendants, the jury found that reasonable royalty damages should be based on a [...] "running royalty", and that the <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> rate should be 3.5%. [...] I/P Engine presented evidence at trial that the appropriate way to determine the incremental royalty base attributable to Google's infringement was to calculate 20.9% of Google's U.S. AdWords revenue, then apply a 3.5% <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> rate to that base. The U.S. District Court entered a judgment against the defendants in November 2012.|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} anticancer (antineoplastics) dataset, including the royalty-related data like <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> rate and up-front payment, regarding drug candidates for specific drug class of anticancer, by regression analysis between royalty-related data and multiple input descriptors like the attrition {{rate for the}} development phase, market size, TCT median value for the IPC code (IP) of the patent, and the revenue data of the license buyer for deriving the formula to predict royalty-related data.|$|R
50|$|Licensing {{agreements}} {{determine the}} form and scope of compensation to the intellectual property owner, which usually {{takes the form of}} a flat licensing fee or a <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> payment derived from a share of the licensee's revenue. The licenses can be terminated by the licensor, or may expire after a set date; however, the technology and knowledge, once transferred, cannot be rescinded, so even if the licensing agreement expires they remain in the licensee's possession.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to derive the formula to predict royalty-related data, such as <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> rate (back-end payments) and up-front payment (up-front fee[*]+[*]milestones), using the attrition rate for the corresponding development phase of the drug candidate within a specific drug class, such as anticancer (antineoplastics) or cardiovascular, and the revenue data of the license buyer (licensee) using regression analysis. Another purpose is to find the relationship between the formula to predict royalty-related data and eNPV.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Fujifilm {{successfully}} sued Jazz Photos, {{another company}} owned by Benun, for patent infringement and was awarded $30 million, forcing both Jazz and Benun {{to file for}} bankruptcy. Despite the district court's preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from infringing, Jazz Products purchased about 1.4 millon LFFPs made by Polytech and re-imported them into the US. In 2006, the district court found the defendants in contempt of the preliminary injunction, and approved $2 per infringing LFFP <b>running</b> <b>royalty.</b>|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} dataset, including the royalty-related data like <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> rate (back-end payments) and up-front payment (up-front fee[*]+[*]milestones), regarding drug candidates for specific drug classes, like anticancer or cardiovascular, by regression analysis. Then, the formula to predict royalty-related data is derived using the attrition {{rate for the}} corresponding development phase of the drug candidate for the license deal and the revenue data of the license buyer (licensee). Lastly, {{the relationship between the}} formula to predict royalty-related data and the expected net present value is investigated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{defendants}} {{contended that}} the <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> of $2.00 per infringing LFFP and the $2.5 million lump sum are [...] "excessive, punitive, and unsupported by substantial evidence." [...] Based on {{factors such as the}} defendants' dependence on a Fujifilm license, Customs excluding infringing LFFPs, and the defendants' inability to separate the infringing LFFPs from the non-infringing ones, Fujifilm demonstrated that the jury could have reached a royalty rate as high as $2.21; and a similar logic applies as well for the lump sum award.|$|R
5000|$|Rich {{also criticized}} {{the notion of}} using the staples tie-in as a {{counting}} device, based on the theory of selling the machine but not its use—reserving the latter with a license bearing a <b>running</b> <b>royalty.</b> Rich commented (seemingly sarcastically), [...] "It was indeed a great mind that conceived {{the idea of making}} the purchaser of anything pay the one who sold it to him a royalty according to the amount of its use, by separating the right to use from ownership and renaming the purchaser 'licensee.'&#8239;" ...|$|R

2500|$|Wisely, Pierre Wertheimer settled his business- and commercial-rights {{quarrel with}} Chanel, and, in May 1947, they renegotiated the 1924 {{contract}} that had established Parfums Chanel — she was paid $400,000 in cash (wartime {{profits from the}} sales of perfume No. 5 de Chanel); assigned a 2.0 per cent <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> from the sales of No. 5 parfumerie; assigned limited commercial rights to sell her [...] "Chanel perfumes" [...] in Switzerland; and granted a perpetual monthly stipend that paid all of her expenses. In exchange Gabrielle Chanel closed her Swiss parfumerie enterprise, and sold to Parfums Chanel the full rights to the name [...] "Coco Chanel".|$|R
5000|$|For most cases, the {{publishers}} advance an amount (part of the royalty) which can constitute {{the bulk of}} the author's total income plus whatever little flows from the [...] "running royalty" [...] stream. Some costs may be attributed to the advance paid, which depletes further advances to be paid or from the <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> paid. The author and the publisher can independently draw up the agreement that binds them or alongside an agent representing the author. There are many risks for the author—definition of cover price, the retail price, [...] "net price", the discounts on the sale, the bulk sales on the POD (publish on demand) platform, the term of the agreement, audit of {{the publishers}} accounts in case of impropriety, etc. which an agent can provide.|$|R
50|$|Defendant Marvel Entertainment, LLC {{makes and}} markets {{products}} featuring Spider-Man. Kimble sought {{to sell or}} license his patent to Marvel's corporate predecessor and met with its president to negotiate a contract. But the company instead began marketing the “Web Blaster”—a toy that, like Kimble’s patented invention, enables users to mimic Spider-Man by shooting foam string. Kimble sued Marvel in 1997, alleging breach of contract and patent infringement. The parties settled that litigation and Marvel agreed to purchase Kimble’s patent {{in exchange for a}} lump sum (of about a half-million dollars) and a 3% <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> on Marvel’s future sales of the Web Blaster and similar products. The parties set no end date for royalties, apparently contemplating that they would continue for as long as customers wanted to buy the product.|$|R
5000|$|Wayman {{formed a}} scheme to use the patents {{as a vehicle for}} fixing prices. [...] "That scheme was his. The purpose was merely to make money for himself by selling to the {{corporate}} defendants indulgences to sin against the Sherman act." [...] Wayman organized what {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Bathtub Trust." [...] He licensed sixteen corporations, which became defendants in this suit along with officers of the corporate defendants. The license agreements provided for a <b>running</b> <b>royalty,</b> 80% of which would be rebated in three months if the licensee obeyed the terms of the agreement; if it did not, that 80% would be forfeited. As the lower court explained: [...] "Each corporate defendant in this manner gave security that he would keep his bargain, or be good, as one of the licensees expressed it." ...|$|R
30|$|According to the {{preceding}} research, the main factors {{to drive the}} size of licensing deals in the life sciences area are development phase, drug class, contract type, contract scope, licensee, molecular structure, market, strategies, competition, IP, and novelty (Arnold et al. 2002). Market size, licensee revenue, molecular structure, and IP {{can be converted to}} numerical value and can be used for the input for prediction for royalty-related data such as <b>running</b> <b>royalty</b> rate (back-end payments) and up-front payment (up-front fee[*]+[*]milestones). In the case of molecular structure, it requires professional chemical software to convert chemical structure into numeric code and requires the collection of molecular structure information for the drug candidate. This study selected the attrition rate for the development phase, market size, CAGR, TCT median value for the IPC code (IP), and the revenue data of the license buyer as descriptors for input x-axis of regression.|$|R

Statistically speaking, this research derives the formula to predict royalty-related data using a single independent variable like royalty rate and up-front payment, (attrition rate * licensee revenue)/ 100]. Also, this research selected drug class, licensee revenue, and attrition rate for the development phase as descriptors for the input for the X-axis of regression. This study is limited to {{the relationship between the two}} drug classes of anticancer (antineoplastics) and cardiovascular and royalty-related data. For further studies, it is advised that the relationship be analyzed in more detail to involve more drug classes and royalty-related data using several independent variables through software like SPSS or SAS.|$|R

In the case of market size, it requires a great amount of time to estimate the proper market size for the subclass of a drug class (e.g., epidermal growth factor, anticancer immunity, ovarian cancer, alpha interferon as a subclass of the anticancer drug class). In the case of molecular structure, it requires professional chemical software to convert chemical structure into numeric code and requires the collection of molecular structure information for the drug candidate. In the case of IP, identifying what could be the unique descriptor for the drug-related patents for input for the X-axis of regression requires more thought (e.g., the technology cycle time median value for the International Patent Classification (IPC) code can be the descriptor candidate). This study selected drug class, licensee revenue, and attrition rate for the development phase as descriptors for the input for the X-axis of regression.|$|R
