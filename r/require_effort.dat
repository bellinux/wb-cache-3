500|$|A {{fundamental}} {{characteristic of the}} aesthete is immediacy. In Either/Or, there are several levels of immediacy explored, ranging from unrefined to refined. Unrefined immediacy is characterized by immediate cravings for desire and satisfaction through enjoyments that do not <b>require</b> <b>effort</b> or personal cultivation (e.g. alcohol, drugs, casual sex, sloth, etc.) Refined immediacy is characterized by planning how best to enjoy life aesthetically. The [...] "theory" [...] of social prudence given in Crop Rotation {{is an example of}} refined immediacy. Instead of mindless hedonistic tendencies, enjoyments are contemplated and [...] "cultivated" [...] for maximum pleasure. However, both the refined and unrefined aesthetes still accept the fundamental given conditions of their life, and do not accept the responsibility to change it. If things go wrong, the aesthete simply blames existence, rather than one's self, assuming some unavoidable tragic consequence of human existence and thus claims life is meaningless. Kierkegaard spoke of immediacy this way in his sequel to Either/Or, Stages on Life's Way, [...] "The esthetic sphere is the sphere of immediacy, the ethical the sphere of requirement (and this requirement is so infinite that the individual always goes bankrupt), the religious the sphere of fulfillment, but, please note, not a fulfillment such as when one fills an alms box or a sack with gold, for repentance has specifically created a boundless space, and as a consequence the religious contradiction: simultaneously to be out on 70,000 fathoms of water and yet be joyful. Just as the ethical sphere is a passageway-which one nevertheless does not pass through once and for all-just as repentance is its expression, so repentance is the most dialectical. No wonder, then, that one fears it, for if one gives it a finger it takes the whole hand. Just as Jehovah in the Old Testament visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the latest generations, so repentance goes backward, continually presupposing the object of its investigation. In repentance there is the impulse of the motion, and therefore everything is reversed. This impulse signifies precisely the difference between the esthetic and the religious as the difference between the external and the internal."

Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study was to examine the influence of perceived <b>required</b> <b>effort</b> and support availability on demand/resource evaluations, challenge and threat states, and motor performance. A 2 (required effort; high, low) × 2 (support availability; available, not available) between-subjects design was used with one hundred and twenty participants randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. Participants received instructions designed to manipulate perceptions of <b>required</b> <b>effort</b> and support availability before demand/resource evaluations and cardiovascular responses were assessed. Participants then performed the novel motor task (laparoscopic surgery) while performance was recorded. Participants in the low perceived <b>required</b> <b>effort</b> condition evaluated the task as more of a challenge (i. e., resources outweighed demands), exhibited a cardiovascular response more indicative of a challenge state (i. e., higher cardiac output and lower total peripheral resistance), and performed the task better (i. e., quicker completion time) than those in the high perceived <b>required</b> <b>effort</b> condition. However, perceptions of support availability had no significant impact on participants' demand/resource evaluations, cardiovascular responses, or performance. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect between perceptions of <b>required</b> <b>effort</b> and support availability. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at promoting a challenge state should include instructions that help individuals perceive that the task is not difficult and requires little physical and mental effort to perform effectively...|$|R

50|$|The Use Value is a {{subcategory}} of {{the theory}} of value. The Use Value is the value of a material by the utility, use or consumption, and in which a thing meets human needs. An example of this is if someone wants to build a wooden shed they would need a certain quantity and quality of wood and nails. Some Use-Value takes no effort to attain, for example the sun, or something like gravity both which humans need to survive but don’t need to do anything to obtain and still have value. Other Use-Values do <b>require</b> <b>effort</b> to attain, increasing their Use-Value. The needs an object fulfills and the physical properties, as in the uses to which the object can be put to work on, also tie in with the Use Value. Different Use-Values have different measures depending on their physical characteristics; for example, dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron. The value also depends on the labor needed to make the material and the quantity/quality of the object.|$|E

His lack of effort is also shown in Who Would Win when he states that he would rather play Kompy's Kastle than train. Jake's firm belief in determinism is underpinned, or at least is indicative, of a possible commitment to the philosophical creed of stoicism. In the episode [...] "Puhoy" [...] Jake consoles Finn's love induced melancholy by suggesting he 'focus on what's real' as opposed to [...] "getting all hung up on imaginary problems." [...] To explain this he throws his favorite cup out the window {{in order to make it}} [...] "not real" [...] so he does not care about it anymore. This is a direct reference to the third aphorism of stoic philosopher Epictetus' Enchiridion (135AD), which in turn may be the influence on the Enchiridion that was destroyed by the Lich. However, later that episode he fishes the cup out so his belief in determinism is somewhat inconsistent.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} argued by {{researchers}} that people use affect heuristics because as a first response to an issue, they rely on spontaneous affective reactions which make it more efficient than having to research and analyze external information. Slovic, Finucane, Peters and MacGregor (2005) contrast two modes of thinking: the analytic system and the experiential system. The analytic system, {{also referred to as}} the rational system, is thought that is considered to be slow and requires effort; it requires consciousness, probabilities, logical reasoning, and substantial evidence. The experiential system is the exact opposite. It is intuitive and mostly automatic which makes it more convenient for people because it does not <b>require</b> <b>effort</b> or consciousness. It relies on images, metaphors, and narratives which are then used to estimate the probability of a hazard. This is due to the experience of affect, in other words, a “gut feeling.” Affective reactions that accompany judgements are not necessarily voluntary, but are automatic responses. Zajonc states that “one might be able to control the expression of emotion, but not the experience of it itself.” However, he also clarifies that feelings are not free of thought and that thoughts are not free of feeling. The experiential system also takes past experiences into account. In other words, if a person has already experienced a certain issue, he or she is more likely to take more precautions towards the issue.|$|E

40|$|The biopsychosocial model (BPSM) {{offers a}} {{potential}} {{explanation for why}} individuals perform differently in pressurised motivated performance situations (e. g., sporting competitions). The aim of this thesis was to test the predictions of the BPSM to further our understanding of performance variability under pressure. Specifically, the BPSM suggests that individuals’ respond to a pressurised situation with either a challenge or threat state, with the former resulting in better performance. Three experimental studies were conducted to test this proposition and examine the immediate effect of challenge and threat states {{on the performance of}} laboratory-based motor tasks and real competition. Across all studies, a challenge state resulted in, or was associated with, superior performance. Importantly, this finding was consistent across different samples and research designs. In two of these studies, the proposed mechanisms (emotional, attentional, and behavioural) through which challenge and threat states might influence performance were also investigated. In both studies, a challenge state was associated with more favourable emotions (less anxiety and more facilitative interpretations) and attention (longer quiet eye durations and less conscious processing). Furthermore, in one study, a challenge state was also associated with more effective behaviour (lower muscle activity and superior clubhead movements). Crucially, mediation analyses indicated that challenge and threat states influenced performance by impacting the quality of task-related movements. The BPSM predicts that a range of factors influence whether an individual responds to a pressurised situation with a challenge or threat state (psychological and physical danger, familiarity, uncertainty, <b>required</b> <b>effort,</b> skills, knowledge and abilities, and the availability of support). In a fourth experimental study, two of these antecedents were examined; perceived <b>required</b> <b>effort</b> and support availability. In this study, although perceptions of support availability had limited impact, perceptions of low <b>required</b> <b>effort</b> led to a challenge state and better performance than perceptions of high <b>required</b> <b>effort...</b>|$|R
