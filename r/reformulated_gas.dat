40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to recycle and reuse the WEO as an {{alternative}} fuel for compression ignition (CI) engine. For this purpose the WEO was cracked in the catalytic fuel reformer by using the catalyst zeolite 4 A. The output of the catalytic fuel reformer is in the gaseous form which is condensed using water cooled condenser. The oil obtained after condensing the <b>reformulated</b> <b>gas</b> is named as WEOZ. To know the suitability of using the WEOZ as alternate fuel for IC engines, the different properties of WEOZ were determined. The different properties include specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, flash and fire point, gross calorific value, pour point, density. The properties of WEOZ were compared to that of diesel fuel. All the fuel properties are closer to that of the neat diesel fuel. The FTIR analysis was also be conducted for diesel and WEOZ. The result of FTIR analysis was compared to that of diesel fuel. The FTIR result revealed that the major transmittance spectrums peak for diesel and WEOZ were alkanes and the presence of the hydrocarbon was clearly seen in the WEOZ. Based on this investigation, it was suggested that WEOZ has a potential to be used as alternate fuel for diesel engine. Hence an environmentally unfriendly WEO can be recycled into a useful resource and serves as an alternative source of fuel for diesel engine...|$|E
40|$|THis report {{provides}} a methodology for analyzing full fuel cycle emissions of alternative fuels for vehicles. Included in this analusis is {{an assessment of}} the following fuel cycles relevant to vehicle use: gasoline, <b>reformulated</b> gasoline, natural <b>gas,</b> liquefied petroleum gas, electric power (with onboard battery storage), ethanol, and methanol fuels. The analysis focuses on basic criteria pollutants (reactive organic gases, SOx, and particulates less than 10 microns). EMissions of greenhouse gases (CO 2, CH 4, and nitrous oxide) are also defined. This analysis was conducted for two cases, United States and the State of California and two time frames, current and year 2000. ...|$|R
40|$|Flux Response Technology is a {{technique}} based on a capillary viscometer for the measurements of flow and viscosity changes. In previous works, {{it has been used}} to measure logarithmic viscosity gradients of ideal mixtures. Here, we extend its range of application to the measurement of non-ideal mixing volumes at low temperatures. The theory describing a Flux Response apparatus has been <b>reformulated</b> without assuming <b>gas</b> ideality and taking into account the mixing volume. A systematic error in the measurement of the viscosity has been identified and estimated. We report the excess volume measurements of CO 2 + CCl 2 F 2 mixtures obtained at 273. 15 K and 1. 11 bar...|$|R
40|$|Recently, an automata-based {{approach}} to portraying urban systems, {{based on the}} concept of Geographic Automata System (GAS) has been proposed. According to GAS paradigm, unitary urban objects are considered as automata of different types located in space, which are related to the other automata; ensembles of unitary automata are represented by relationships as well. The dynamics of GAS is defined by the transition rules that are applied to the automata and to the relationships. At the conceptual level, the majority, if not all, Cellular Automata and Multi-Agent urban models proposed until now can be <b>reformulated</b> in a <b>GAS</b> framework. The GAS-based view of urban systems has been recently implemented as an Object-Based Environment for Urban Simulation (OBEUS), which can be downloaded fro...|$|R
