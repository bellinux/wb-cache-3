5|$|As of 2010, {{approximately}} 12.7million {{people lived}} in the Colorado <b>River</b> <b>basin.</b> Phoenix in Arizona and Las Vegas in Nevada are the largest metropolitan areas in the watershed. Population densities are also high along the lower Colorado River below Davis Dam, which includes Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Yuma. Other significant population centers in the basin include Tucson, Arizona; St. George, Utah; and Grand Junction, Colorado. Colorado <b>River</b> <b>basin</b> states are among the fastest-growing in the U.S.; the population of Nevada alone increased by about 66percent between 1990 and 2000 as Arizona grew by some 40percent.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} solve {{essential}} eco-environmental problems (EEP) related to {{water in the}} Haihe <b>River</b> <b>basins,</b> and to encourage continued socio-economic development, {{the study of the}} carrying capacity of eco-environments related to water (WEECC) in the Haihe <b>River</b> <b>basins</b> enables determination of: the present ecological state of the <b>river</b> <b>basins,</b> and how many years are needed for the Haihe <b>River</b> <b>basins</b> eco-environment to reach a critical, bearable state under the sustainable development. The paper first deals with the main EEP related to water, then calculates the WEECC by multiobjectives optimization and time series analysis. We find that the <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> are now in a serious over-loaded eco-environment state but will reach a critical eco-environmental bearable state in 2033 under the water supply of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project, with gradual amelioration of the eco-environments and normal societal and economic development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes {{dividing}} of Black Sea Catchment Area's <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> {{into four}} morpho hydrographic regions – Dobrudja, East Balkan mountain, lowland of Burgas and Strandzha Mountain. It {{is based on}} geomorphologic and hydrographic characteristics of <b>rivers</b> and <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> (altitude, valleys, slopes, drainage density, river length, catchment shape, stream orders, and curve of the rivers). The work uses GIS to analyze and data of the rivers and the <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> collected from basic topographic maps. Digital Elevation Model (DEM), created {{on the base of}} satellite images, was also used. Based on the data collected for this study some basic hydrographical parameters were calculated. This is the first experiment of morpho-hydrographic dividing of the main catchment area in Bulgaria using <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> like basic units. It shows a way to unify separate <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> into major areas that can be useful for analyzing and research of water resources...|$|R

5|$|Groundwater {{is a very}} {{important}} resource in the Sava <b>River</b> <b>basin,</b> generally used for public water supply of potable water, as a source of water for industrial use, but also as the mainstay of aquatic ecosystems. There are 41 identified significant groundwater bodies in the Sava <b>River</b> <b>basin</b> of basin-wide importance, ranging in area size from , as well as numerous minor ground water bodies. Even though most of them are transboundary waters, eleven are considered to be largely located in Slovenia, fourteen in Croatia, seven in Bosnia-Herzegovina, five in Serbia and four in Montenegro.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the black}} storks that summer in Europe migrate to Africa, with those from western Germany and points west heading south via the Iberian Peninsula and the rest via Turkey and the Levant. Those flying via Spain spend winter in the Falémé <b>River</b> <b>basin</b> of eastern Senegal, Guinea, {{southern}} Mauritania, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and western and central Mali, while those flying via the Sinai end up in northern Ethiopia, the Kotto <b>River</b> <b>basin</b> in the Central African Republic, the Mbokou <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> in Chad and northeastern Nigeria. Black storks summering in western Asia migrate to northern and northeastern India, ranging mainly from Punjab south to Karnataka, and Africa. They are occasional visitors to Sri Lanka. Those summering further east in eastern Russia and China winter mainly in southern China, and occasionally in Hong Kong, Myanmar, northern Thailand, and Laos. They were first recorded in western Myanmar in 1998.|$|E

5|$|The {{eastern part}} of Terengganu {{district}} that faces the South China Sea is characterised by sandy coastal beaches that cover the entire stretch of both parts. Small bays and coastal plains can be found. The district is divided into four major drainage basins: Terengganu <b>River</b> <b>basin,</b> Nerus <b>River</b> <b>basin,</b> Ibai <b>River</b> <b>basin,</b> and other small rivers basin. Certain parts of the rivers of Kuala Terengganu are lined with swamp forests. Hills between 200–600 metres mostly dominate {{the western part of}} the district, with more than 70% of the district made up of lowlands less than 20 metres high because of its geographical proximity to the coast. The city itself has a few high points with the highest being Bukit Besar, followed by Bukit Kecil. Bukit Puteri is centrally located in the city, just near the Terengganu River estuary. The lowlands provide the district with suitable areas for plantations such as paddy, palm oil trees, and rubber trees.|$|E
5|$|These {{sedentary}} peoples heavily exploited their surroundings, practicing {{logging and}} harvesting of other resources {{on a large}} scale. The construction of irrigation canals {{may have led to}} a significant change in the morphology of many waterways in the Colorado <b>River</b> <b>basin.</b> Prior to human contact, rivers such as the Gila, Salt and Chaco were shallow perennial streams with low, vegetated banks and large floodplains. In time, flash floods caused significant downcutting on irrigation canals, which in turn led to the entrenchment of the original streams into arroyos, making agriculture difficult. A variety of methods were employed to combat these problems, including the construction of large dams, but when a megadrought hit the region in the 14thcentury A.D. the ancient civilizations of the Colorado <b>River</b> <b>basin</b> abruptly collapsed. Some Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley of central New Mexico and south-central Colorado, becoming the predecessors of the Hopi, Zuni, Laguna and Acoma people in western New Mexico. Many of the tribes that inhabited the Colorado <b>River</b> <b>basin</b> at the time of European contact were descended from Puebloan and Hohokam survivors, while others already had a long history of living in the region or migrated in from bordering lands.|$|E

5|$|Eastern South Dakota is {{generally}} wetter and features lower topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a higher region bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James <b>River</b> <b>Basin.</b> Numerous glacial lakes cover the Coteau, and it is largely drained by the Big Sioux River, a tributary of the Missouri. Further to the west, the James <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, also extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota.|$|E

40|$|Four <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> in Sierra Tejeda {{area have}} been studied {{by means of the}} {{correlation}} and spectral analysis. These <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> are formed by marbles and schists in their upper and lower part, respectively. The water comes from runoff mainly generated in the schists and groundwater from springs in the Sierra Tejeda carbonate aquifer. The application of this method to outflow data shows that the hydrographical basins with more extension of low permeability materials (Rubite and Algarrobo) have a scarce inertial behaviour. While, those <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> with more inertial behaviour (Bermuza and Almanchares basins) present less extension of schists and the most important springs. Consequently, the hydrodynamic behaviour in these rivers are controlled by groundwater and runoff: Bermuza and Almanchares <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> incorporate larger quantity of groundwater than Algarrobo and Rubite basin...|$|R
