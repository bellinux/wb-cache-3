50|$|On 6 July 2011, Foster's {{released}} VB {{packaged in}} limited edition 1958 heritage cans. The packaging had the original artwork of the 1958 VB product, but {{also included a}} standard <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> on each can, something which was lacking on the original.|$|E
50|$|The RingCrown (also {{known as}} RipCap, Ring-pull closure or pull off caps) is a bottle closure {{that can be}} opened without any tools. It has a ring that can be pulled in order to detach the cap from the bottle. The cap splits along scores in the cap, {{therefore}} loosens and can {{be removed from the}} bottle. Drink companies use <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> caps to differentiate themselves from competitors.|$|E

50|$|The first {{packaging}} that Britvic introduced, upon {{buying the}} brand in 1987, featured the word 'Tango' on a circle with an orange background. In 1989, the cast, material and graphic {{design of the}} can changed considerably. No longer molded {{in the shape of}} a baked bean can in a non reusable steel material, Tango was now available in a recyclable aluminium composition, with an innovative new <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> system. On the can itself, the word 'Tango' was featured inside an oval on a backdrop of half sliced oranges.|$|E
5000|$|Invalided {{out of the}} Army in 1947, Hibbert {{returned}} to CG Hibbert, his family's wine and spirits business, which {{was on the verge}} of collapse. [...] Finding [...] "the cut and thrust of commercial life", as he put it, [...] "as exciting as war with no prisoners taken," [...] he turned the firm around and rose to be its managing director. Among the diverse fields to which he extended it was soft-drink canning, in which he introduced the <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> can to the United Kingdom. [...] He received the Queen's Award for Industry.|$|E
50|$|Mikola Kondakow of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, {{invented the}} pull tab version for bottles in 1956 (Canadian patent 476789). Then, in 1962, Ermal Cleon Fraze (1913-1989) of Dayton, Ohio, United States, invented the similar {{integral}} rivet and pull-tab version (also known as <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> in British English), {{which had a}} ring attached at the rivet for pulling, and which would come off completely to be discarded. He received US Patent No. 3,349,949 for his pull-top can design in 1963 and licensed his invention to Alcoa and Pittsburgh Brewing Company, the latter of which first introduced the design on Iron City Beer cans. The first soft drinks to be sold in all-aluminum cans were R.C. Cola and Diet-Rite Cola, both made by the Royal Crown Cola company, in 1964.|$|E
40|$|The {{aluminium}} <b>ring</b> <b>pulls</b> {{associated with}} the latest designs of drinks cans can be relatively easily detached from their mounting {{on the top of}} the can and subsequently aspirated. Their small size predisposes them to lodge as foreign bodies (FBs) in the throat. The similarity of atomic number be-tween soft tissue (7. 5) and aluminium (13) makes detection of these FBs difficult on soft tissue radio-graphy. If aspiration is suspected direct visualization and removal may be indicated even if radiograph...|$|R

50|$|A handstand {{variation}} {{can also}} be used. With the opponent seated on the top turnbuckle facing the ring, the wrestler performs a handstand on the bottom turnbuckle, wrapping his or her shins or feet {{around the neck of}} the opponent. The wrestler then bends his or her legs forward towards the <b>ring,</b> <b>pulling</b> the opponent over and flipping him or her down to the mat onto his or her back. Former WWE wrestler Trish Stratus used this variation of the move as one of her signatures, calling it the Stratusphere.|$|R
50|$|Fullspot {{developed}} the O clock in 2010, a watch with a silicone strap and interchangeable faces. The original {{face of the}} watch, now called 'O clock Classic' consisted of a plain white face without numbers. The face can {{be removed from the}} strap allowing the colour of the strap or face to be changed. There were originally 15 straps but this has grown to 29 which are still in production. Fullspot’s watch packaging takes inspiration from the tin can, a cylindrical tin with a <b>ring</b> <b>pull.</b> O clock developed into a series with the Tone on Tone range consisting of 21 watch face colours to mix and match with 21 straps making a total of 441 possible combinations with Tone on Tone. Other O clock ranges include Camouflage, 80’ clock, Disney, Gold & Silver, Mirror, Numbers, Flower Power and Safari.|$|E
5000|$|However, in 2002, {{signs of}} an album release did briefly arise, when artwork for a promo EP surfaced, {{entitled}} Select New Recordings 2002. The promo featured four tracks; [...] "Dead Man," [...] "Conspiracy," [...] "Ring Pull" [...] and [...] "Could U Be," [...] while the artwork featured reused designs from My Big Hero. Claudia Sarne stated on the 12 Rounds website that the band sent fifteen tracks for mastering from the third album, twelve of which would compose the final tracklist. Though a title for the third album was never revealed, the final track list was later published on the 12 Rounds website; 1. High Times, 2. Conspiracy, 3. Could U Be, 4. Big Love, 5. <b>Ring</b> <b>Pull,</b> 6. Still Water, 7. Xocet, 8. Sioux '86, 9. Chicane, 10. Bits & Pieces, 11. Dead Man, 12. Shine On.|$|E
5000|$|... "Move Over" [...] {{is a song}} by British girl group, the Spice Girls. First {{released}} as an album track from the group's second studio album Spiceworld, it was eventually {{released as}} a promotional single in 1997, {{as part of their}} endorsement with Pepsi. The live version on the single is taken from their Istanbul concert recorded on 12 October 1997, and was given the additional subtitle [...] "Generationext" [...] (as one word) in reference to [...] "generation next", {{one of the most prominent}} lyrics from the song. Although not as publicized as their previous Pepsi single [...] "Step to Me", it was marketed in the same manner. In the fall of 1997, Pepsi consumers in the United Kingdom had to send off 18 <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> tabs in exchange for the single. Also part of this Pepsi campaign were live singles from other musical acts such as Hanson, Eternal, and Coolio, with some editions of the single having all four.|$|E

50|$|For 1951, Mutual {{substantially}} {{raised its}} advertising rates, and its primary sponsor, Perfect Circle Piston <b>Rings,</b> <b>pulled</b> its support. Mutual eventually {{decided to stop}} covering the event, and it appeared for a time that the 1951 race would not carried on radio. In early May of 1951, Speedway president Wilbur Shaw consummated a last-minute deal for WIBC-AM to cover the race, with Sid Collins as anchor. WIBC's format followed that of Mutual's, with live coverage at the start, the finish, and periodic updates throughout the race. WIBC provided its coverage to approximately 25 other Mutual affiliates.|$|R

5000|$|In 1997, Pepsi {{launched}} a £1 million 'generation next' TV {{campaign in the}} United Kingdom—running alongside sales promotion activities, notably one by where consumers collected twenty pink <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> tabs from promotional Pepsi cans, sent them off and received the free Spice Girls CD single [...] "Step to Me"—which was not available in high street retailers. Collectors were also entered into a free prize draw to see the Spice Girls play their first live concert in Turkey who Pepsi were sponsoring. The advertising and the promotion were integral to Pepsi's marketing strategy, television and press ads and the Pepsi Chart Show (screened on Channel 5) all spelt out {{that the only way}} to listen to the single was to buy Pepsi. Producing 92 million promotional packs of the cola, 600,000 CDs were redeemed with the promotion. With a redemption rate of nearly 10 percent, Pepsi recorded its biggest-ever take up on the promotion and saw its market share rise from 15.1% on 12 July to 19.6% on 9 August, its highest for several years.|$|E
5000|$|Yoshihiko - An {{inflatable}} 'love doll'. Wrestlers {{treat it}} as if it actually was an active wrestler, and actually sell moves [...] "done" [...] by him/her, mostly high flying moves. For some moves, like outside dives, Yoshihiko is helped by one or more assistants, who throw him out of the <b>ring,</b> <b>pull</b> his foot on the ropes, etc. Opposing wrestlers make like those assistants are not there and are part of Yoshihiko. The original Yoshihiko was [...] "killed" [...] by an Antonio Honda knee drop, which caused its head to burst open, and was replaced by a second Yoshihiko, who was also a 'love doll', only modified to resemble the Great Muta. The second Yoshihiko was killed by Kenny Omega by a giant swing that sent Yoshihiko out of the ring, thus splitting his head open and revealing cotton stuffing. Later on in that match however, a third Yoshihiko came out resembling The Undertaker's old American Bad Ass gimmick, even using the same theme music. Following that match, the third Yoshihiko was shot to death by Antonio Honda. A fourth Yoshihiko, resembling Hulk Hogan, debuted shortly afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|The nave is {{constructed}} in limestone with some brick, and the chancel is in lias. The nave is roofed with old tiles, while the tiles roofing the chancel {{are from the}} 20th century. [...] The plan of the church consists of a two-bay nave and a single-bay chancel with a south porch that {{was used as a}} vestry. At the west end is a single bellcote. The chancel measures 12 ft by 10 ft. The east window is a wheel window, and on the side walls are small round-headed windows. The nave measures 37 ft by 15 ft and contains two windows and a doorway in both {{the north and the south}} walls; the doorway in the south wall opens into a porch. At the west end is a two-light window. The communion rails date from the 18th century, while the font and other furnishings are later. [...] The north door dates from 1535 and is described as [...] "a work of national interest". [...] The door was damaged in 1994 by vandals, but it still retains its original uprights and wooden tracery, and a <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> set in a lion's mouth. At one time there was a sundial added in 1818, but this has disappeared. [...] There is a single bell that was cast from the two bells present before the restoration of 1844. The church plate includes a cup hallmarked London 1655. The parish registers date from 1562, but are incomplete before 1666.|$|E
