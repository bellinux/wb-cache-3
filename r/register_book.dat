5|$|Riel {{made his}} way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or assassination, vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in the House of Commons—Edward Blake, the Premier of Ontario, had {{announced}} a bounty of $5,000 for his arrest. Famously, Riel was the only Member of Parliament who was not present for the great Pacific Scandal debate of 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the interim prime minister, and a general election was held in January 1874. Although the Liberals under Mackenzie formed the new government, Riel easily retained his seat. Formally, Riel had to sign a <b>register</b> <b>book</b> at least once upon being elected, and he did so under disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had become the member for the electoral district of Lisgar.|$|E
5|$|In 1679, Newton {{returned}} to his work on (celestial) mechanics by considering gravitation {{and its effect on}} the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's <b>Register</b> <b>Book</b> in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the 19 th– 20 th-century first names of female servants {{in an apartment}} building in Budapest compared to the female first names used by the families that employed them. Sources were <b>register</b> <b>books</b> listing {{the inhabitants of the}} building between 1899 and 1947. Female servants arrived to the capital from over 40 % of the counties in the country at the time, while families employing them were mostly from Budapest. The most frequent first names in the <b>register</b> <b>books</b> coincide with the top 10 percent of first names in the country-wide statistics of the era. The assumption that mainly young unmarried female servants were listed in the <b>register</b> <b>books</b> by hypocoristic names has clearly not been justified. A comparison of the first names of the female servants and those of the female members of their employers’ families displays the approximate similarity of the most frequent first names. Differences between the two name stocks can only be observed with respect to female servants’ informal nicknames. The final conclusion of the paper is that first names borne exclusively by female servants did not exist...|$|R
