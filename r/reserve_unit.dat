5|$|To {{strengthen}} the city's firefighting capabilities, the city established a <b>reserve</b> <b>unit</b> called the Exempt Fireman's Company, so called {{because it was}} made up of firemen who were exempt from militia and jury duty.

5|$|Tracing its lineage {{back to the}} American Civil War, {{the brigade}} was {{deployed}} for both World War I and World War II.

5|$|While in {{law school}} in the late 1960s, an era of {{escalation}} in the Vietnam War, Burke received a draft deferment as a full-time student. After his marriage {{and the death of}} his father, he applied for and was granted a hardship deferment (3-A), as the sole support of his wife, mother, and two younger brothers. In June 1969, the Illinois Selective Service board of appeals reclassified him 1-A ("available for unrestricted military service"). At the same time, he was accepted into a Chicago-based United States Army <b>Reserve</b> <b>unit,</b> the 363rd civil affairs group, as a private. Political rivals expressed concern that special consideration allowed Burke to join the <b>Reserve</b> <b>unit</b> ahead of others, but an Army investigation found no evidence of manipulation in his favor.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the 100th {{became the}} first Army Reserve {{formation}} to be equipped with its own squadrons of M1 Abrams tanks. With {{the arrival of the}} M3 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, the division's mission profile changed from individual combat training to armor and armor reconnaissance training. By 1986, it was the largest <b>reserve</b> <b>unit</b> within the state of Kentucky, commanding fifty-eight percent of instate reservists.|$|E

The initial deployment proved problematic however, with a subsequent inquiry finding that the company had received less support for its pre-deployment preparations than was typical for regular units and that its training was inadequate. The 1st Commando Regiment contributed forces to several other Special Operations Task Group rotations.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} was disbanded in 1919, {{but since}} 1921 has been re-activated and merged several {{times as a}} <b>reserve</b> <b>unit,</b> initially as the 11th Battalion (City of Perth Regiment), which fought a brief campaign against the Japanese on New Britain during World War II.

5|$|The {{unit was}} once again {{designated}} as the 174th Infantry Brigade following a conversion and redesignation in March 1963. For the next 30 years, the brigade would continue as a <b>Reserve</b> <b>unit</b> in inactive status and would never be called on to participate in any conflicts. In 1997, the brigade was withdrawn from the Reserve and activated in the Regular Army at Fort Drum, New York, before being inactivated two years later.|$|E
5|$|An Israeli <b>reserve</b> <b>unit</b> {{was called}} in from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took {{positions}} around the town. At that point, Samakh (Tzemah) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages. They entrenched in the actual village, which had been abandoned by the residents in April 1948, with British escort. Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya neighborhood in the south, and the railway station. The Syrians set up their positions in an abandoned British military base {{just east of the}} village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>reserve</b> <b>unit,</b> the {{formation}} {{is not in}} existence on a permanent basis, but is instead only called upon when needed. The brigade's Headquarters and Headquarters Company is located in Gaithersburg, and it commands two other reserve military police battalions. These are the 336th Military Police Battalion and the 400th Military Police Battalion. The brigade commands numerous smaller company sized reserve military police units throughout the country. These units deploy to foreign theaters of operations with the brigade when it is called upon, and they also deploy to various installations throughout the United States when needed for participation in training and readiness exercises.|$|E

5|$|On 8 January 1941, {{the ship}} was {{reclassified}} from BB-7 to IX-15, and was renamed Prairie State so that her name {{could be used for}} the new battleship , which would be laid down a week later. Throughout World War II, she served with the U.S. Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School, based in New York. After the end of the war, Prairie State was kept as a barracks ship for a Naval <b>Reserve</b> <b>unit.</b> On 31 December 1955, the old ship was stricken and subsequently towed to Baltimore, where she was sold for scrap to the Bethlehem Steel Company on 18 May 1956.|$|E

He relinquished command of the battalion in 1907, going on to half pay, and later took up the position of assistant adjutant-general in Egypt in 1909. He held this posting until 1913, aged fifty, when he was transferred to command a <b>reserve</b> <b>unit,</b> the Devon and Cornwall Brigade of the Wessex Division in the Territorial Force.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was reactivated on 13 May 1947 at Oklahoma City as a <b>reserve</b> <b>unit.</b> However, {{it was not}} mobilized for any combat duties following World War II. In 1952, the division underwent reorganization, with the first change being {{the addition of the}} 291st Infantry Regiment of Tulsa, Oklahoma, from the 75th Infantry Division. The second change that year for the {{division was}} the withdrawal of assignment of the 377th Infantry Regiment from the 95th, which was transferred to the 75th Infantry Division.

5|$|The most {{decorated}} RAN {{unit of the}} war was the Bridging Train. A <b>reserve</b> <b>unit</b> {{commanded by}} Lieutenant Commander Leighton Bracegirdle, it supported the British at Suvla Bay during the Gallipoli Campaign by constructing piers and harbours in the bay. Afterwards it served in Egypt and Palestine, taking part in an amphibious assault in El Arish and the First Battle of Gaza before it was disbanded in 1917. A number of members later went on to serve with the AIF and RAN. During the war the RAN lost 171 men killed, including 15 officers and 156 sailors, of which six officers and 57 sailors had been on loan from the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Volunteers {{from the}} rural villages formed {{the bulk of the}} rebels' {{fighting}} force and {{during the course of the}} revolt, each village typically contained a 30-man <b>reserve</b> <b>unit.</b> However, Hananu's forces also included volunteers from Aleppo city, former Ottoman conscripts, Bedouin tribesmen (including some 1,500 Mawali fighters) and Turkish officers who served as advisers. The ′iṣābāt were rooted in the rural countryside, but also drew financial support from people in the cities. While the rebels functioned as a traditional rural Syrian autonomous movement wary of centralized authority or foreign intervention into their affairs, they also sought to establish close ties with the Arab nationalist movement and, until the Arab Army's defeat at Maysalun, with representatives of the Arab government based in the cities.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's Transformation Plan, the 3rd Brigade, 75th Division was redesignated as the 166th Aviation Brigade, {{under the}} command of Division West of the First Army. Its mission would be to train and {{mobilize}} aviation units of the Army's reserve and national guard components. It was to be the only brigade under the First Army that specialized in training for Army aviation units. It was activated 1 December 2006 as a <b>reserve</b> <b>unit</b> at Fort Riley. The brigade became a partner organization of the 1st Infantry Division, which was stationed at Fort Riley and could provide better support than the headquarters of First Army Division West, which was headquartered at Fort Carson, Colorado and maintained units all over the western United States. The brigade received a shoulder sleeve insignia on 13 June 2007, but it has not been authorized for wear due to First Army policy requiring its units to wear its SSI.|$|E
