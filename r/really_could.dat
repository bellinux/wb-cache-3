The best known was a scene similar to one featured in the film Casino Royale and featured both a Ford Mondeo and a Citroën 2CV parked behind the engines of a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400, in an experiment to investigate whether the thrust from the aircraft's four jet engines <b>really</b> <b>could</b> lift a car off the ground.|$|E

In a typical example, a girl that bit her nails was told that she was cheating herself of really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let some of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so that she <b>really</b> <b>could</b> derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of her nails long enough that she might really enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.|$|E

That's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid. You <b>really</b> <b>could</b> almost think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|E

500|$|Describing the packaging, Kellman {{noted that}} it [...] "was sharp but not elaborate– a {{clamshell}} box with each disc packaged in a paper LP-replica sleeve. While the box is a convenient and reasonably priced way to obtain most of Madonna's releases, an investment of that scope should entail all the stray hits from the same era. This <b>really</b> <b>could</b> have used a 12th disc", for adding all the other songs released by Madonna. The BBC described the packaging as a [...] "no-frills affair—CDs are housed in cardboard sleeves that won't stand up to house-party punishment" [...] Clash commented on the packaging more favorably, describing it as [...] "fairly lavish".|$|E

On 18 December 1982, the band helped co-ordinate a 24-hour squat in the empty west London Zig Zag club to prove [...] "that the underground punk scene could handle itself responsibly when it had to and that music <b>really</b> <b>could</b> be enjoyed free of the restraints imposed upon it by corporate industry". About 500 people attended; the bands playing (in running order) were Faction, D and V, Omega Tribe, Lack of Knowledge, Sleeping Dogs, the Apostles, Amebix, Null & Void, Soldiers of Fortune, the Mob, Polemic Attack, Poison Girls, Conflict, Flux of Pink Indians, Crass and DIRT.|$|E
500|$|Julian S. Huxley wrote a {{foreword}} (labelled 'Introduction') which {{defends the}} Darwinian concept of adaptation, especially of colour (in animals) and within that frame of mimicry.

Huxley quoted the now long-forgotten Aaron Franklin Shull's 1936 Evolution which stated [...] "These special forms [...] of the selection idea ... seem destined to be dropped, or at least relegated to very minor places in the Evolution discussion.", and more sharply that [...] "aggressive and alluring resemblance" [...] (Huxley's words) [...] "must probably be set down as products of fancy belonging to uncritical times."

500|$|Kate Flannery, {{who plays}} Meredith, called the episode {{one of her}} {{favorites}} to shoot because she [...] "was stuck in a van with Mindy Kaling, Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, Rashida Jones, Phyllis Smith and Steve Carell for two days." [...] Fischer agreed, calling it a [...] "fun episode to shoot" [...] due to having three days of filming with Carell and The Office women. Believing Meredith's minivan was [...] "another character" [...] in the series, Flannery enjoyed being able to drive and act simultaneously. In {{a reflection of the}} character's personality, the production crew added props such as bottles of alcohol, chips, crushed soda cans, garbage, and 14 air fresheners to the vehicle. The cast however soon developed headaches, leading to the air fresheners' removal. Flannery was able to perform her own stunts for the episode, explaining that she [...] "was nervous at first, but I think I <b>really</b> <b>could</b> be a demolition-derby star." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} {{discusses}} {{negative aspects of}} religion and society, and {{is seen as a}} [...] "companion piece" [...] to Enter Shikari’s A Flash Flood of Colour. Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society we really need to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we <b>really</b> <b>could</b> do and how we could stabilize what's really {{going on in the world}} right now".|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky had {{the idea}} for The Wrestler for over a decade. He hired Robert D. Siegal to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered {{negotiations}} in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film's protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was [...] "a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it <b>really</b> <b>could</b> have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race." [...] Cage responded, [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn't think I had enough time to achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do". The roughly 40-day shoot began in January 2008.|$|E

[...] Editors from Idolator wrote [...] "We like the song, though we don't see anything inherently 'Chris Brown' about this track — it <b>really</b> <b>could</b> have been recorded by anybody with similar results." [...] Ed Easton Jr. from WNOW-FM wrote that the song [...] "is a softer and sensitive side of Chris Brown as its lyrics {{are supposed to be}} meant to inspire others." [...] Joanne Dorken from MTV UK wrote that [...] "Brown's vocals are unrecognisable on this Ibiza-dance scene floor filler, which you can’t help but move to." [...] James Montgomery from MTV News praised Benassi's production skills, and wrote [...] "It's not a stretch to call 'Beautiful People' not only one of the year's most unexpected singles, but also one of the best." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy awarded [...] "Beautiful People" [...] five out of five stars, and called it a [...] "dancehall thumper about equality and believing in yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Laura Prudom {{noted that}} the episode [...] "proved to be an undeniably {{satisfying}} hour of television, deepening our understanding of Archie/Jiminy's character and giving us some welcome development in Mary Margaret and David's tragic romance. I don't know about you, but I <b>really</b> <b>could</b> watch a whole hour of those two playing hangman and innocently flirting and need nothing else from the show." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy wrote that while she [...] "ragged on Robert Carlyle initially, his campy Rumpel is quickly becoming {{one of my favorite}} parts of this show." [...] Tor.com's Teresa Jusino called Espenson's script [...] "so engaging" [...] because it deviated from the series' typical two-story format and [...] "incorporated a third, separate modern storyline" [...] that featured other characters in addition to Jiminy Cricket, in which [...] "each storyline got just enough attention." [...] She added that the episode's best parts were its [...] "intimate character moments, particularly the scenes between Archie/Jiminy and the boys in his life," [...] and attributed this to Espenson's strength as a writer. Jusino felt another highlight was Sbarge's performance, as he [...] "navigated both Archie and Jiminy’s journeys from being pawns to being their own men with precision and warmth." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{time period}} of {{recording}} was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards {{different styles of}} music: Joey's inspiration by pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny's keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band's sound, saying: [...] "I knew going in {{that this was not}} going to be the type of album I wanted. It <b>really</b> <b>could</b> have used another two of three punk songs...All I [...] want to do is keep our fans happy and not sell out. I'm fighting within the band. They are trying to [...] go lighter, looking for ways to be more commercial. I'm against the band for doing that." [...] Joey countered Johnny's point of preventing the band from selling out by explaining: [...] "By Road to Ruin [...] End of the Century, I was doing the majority of the songwriting. I started feeling that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band." [...] He went on to say that this method worked well in the beginning of their career, but would later annoy Joey since [...] "everything [...] wrote, the band would take credit for." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] {{was written}} to mimic genuine witch trials, some {{transcripts}} of which Pemberton and Shearsmith had read {{as part of}} the writing process. The fixation of the characters on [...] "teats" [...] and [...] "suckling", for instance, was something Shearsmith had seen in authentic trials. One writing challenge concerned the need for new information to be revealed with each of the trial's witnesses; this is what shaped the structure of the script. For Shearsmith, given that the trials were already absurd, they cannot be parodied. The humour of the episode, for him, comes precisely {{from the fact that the}} characters take the events so seriously, and do not see this absurdity. Pemberton said that the pair aimed for authenticity, and did not seek to produce a spoof of a period piece. To that end, he was complimentary of Yves Barr, a costume designer with whom the writers had worked for a number of years, who did [...] "a fantastic job creating this period on a shoestring". Given that, in his view, [...] "people don't do this period", Shearsmith was excited to film something set in the 17th century. The episode was the only period piece in the first two series, but the writers expressed willingness to do another; they felt that the setting showed that they <b>really</b> <b>could</b> go anywhere with the programme.|$|E

500|$|In October 1891, {{upon the}} {{formation}} of the first constitutional government in Zanzibar, Mathews was appointed First Minister, despite some hostility from Sultan Ali bin Said. In this capacity Mathews was [...] "irremovable by the sultan" [...] and answerable only to the Sultan and the British Consul. [...] His position was so strong that one missionary on the island is quoted as saying that his powers defied [...] "analytical examination" [...] and that Mathews <b>really</b> <b>could</b> say [...] "L'état est moi" [...] (...) [...] [...] Mathews was also known as the [...] "Strong man of Zanzibar". [...] The principal departments of government were mostly run by Britons or British Indians and Mathews' approval was required before they could be removed from office. [...] Mathews was rewarded by the Zanzibar government for his role with his appointment as a first class member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar, which he was granted licence by Queen Victoria to accept and wear on 17 May 1886. [...] Mathews used his position to suppress slavery in the country and in 1889 convinced the Sultan to issue a decree purchasing the freedom of all slaves who had taken refuge in his dominions and, from 1890, the prohibiting the slave trade. On 1 February 1891 Mathews was appointed Her Majesty's Commissioner and Consul-General to the British Sphere of Influence in East Africa. [...] He never took up the post and instead chose to remain in Zanzibar.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I <b>really</b> <b>could</b> do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on {{the applause}} {{given to the}} Madres during the PopMart concert in Buenos Aires, the U2 {{magazine}} Propaganda called the result [...] "about the most moving thing I've ever seen on a rock stage. It {{was one of those}} ideas that <b>really</b> <b>could</b> have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment." [...] Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv... anywhere music meant more than entertainment". He added [...] "to be able to address General Pinochet from the stage on live television in Chile and say, 'Give the dead back to the living. Please, General Pinochet, tell these women where the bones of their sons and daughters are.' That was an extraordinary moment... certainly in my life and U2's." [...] When asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band Bono said it had not, stating [...] "it's proof to me that a rock 'n' roll audience are not lemmings.... If they don't agree with you, they will let you know – but that doesn't mean they're not fans.... I was flattered that we weren't just playing to people who agreed with us." [...] U2's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the Chilean Parliament against Pinochet, who {{was in the process of}} becoming a Senator for life after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces. The opposition party brought in the Madres, who again held pictures of their disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies.|$|E
