40|$|The {{pursuit of}} a {{sustainable}} society has received more and more attention during the last decades, due to global problems of population growth, climate change, financial crises, and others {{the world has been}} confronted with. Over the years, universities have tried to take up their role within the process of achieving sustainable development, by sharing thoughts and ideas via conferences, the development and signing of declarations, and through individual actions in the field (e. g., development of SD courses, teacher trainings on SD, or “campus greening” initiatives). Despite the diverse array of sustainability integration initiatives undertaken by higher education institutions, it is very difficult for both their internal and external stakeholders to objectively assess {{the extent to which a}} university has implemented sustainability integration initiatives within the four major core functions of a university—i. e., education, research, operations and community outreach. The definition of appropriate accounting instruments that monitor, analyze and control the performance of sustainability initiatives and of the institution as a whole could contribute to resolving some of these problems for university stakeholders. Universities have tried to voluntarily report on their efforts of SD integration via sustainability reporting, following the upsurge of this type of reporting in the corporate world. Nevertheless, sustainability reporting in higher education is currently still in its early stages. This seminar will present some of the findings of the PhD <b>research</b> <b>started</b> <b>up</b> in 2011 on the topic of sustainability reporting in higher education, based on both literature review and case study research at HUB, the first Belgian higher education institution with a GRI sustainability report. status: publishe...|$|R

Some authors have proved how the Deficit and Attention/Hyperactivity Disorder may predispose {{to the development of}} other psychopathological attitude in adulthood. A recent study has underlined a common comorbidity between ADHD in childhood and Bipolar Disorder. The aim of the present was to verify the existence of an ADHD diagnosis in patients with depression (Unipolar and Bipolar) and to verify if such syndrome overstays in the present psychopathological picture. Moreover there has been even the intention to investigate on a difference in ADHD symptomatology in patients with Bipolar and Unipolar Depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study has been conducted on a sample of 67 patients with depression diagnosis (35 patients with bipolar depression diagnosis, 32 patients with depression unipolar diagnosis) enrolled at the Bipolar Disorders Unit of the Clinical Psychiatry and Drug Dependence Institute of the Policlinico Universitario A.

Following this project, a longitudinal <b>research</b> was <b>started</b> <b>up</b> by the University of Utrecht, which monitored the situation of the area every five years by carrying out a survey. As part of this research, a survey was held in 2010 concerning housing, mobility, and home-based economic activities. The former two are the subject of this dissertation. The main research question is: What are current trends in the housing and residential mobility situation of Zona 16 de Julio, El Alto, and what current policies and interventions are employed to ameliorate the housing situation? Current trend in residential mobility is the switch from rural-urban mobility to intra-urban mobility, motives to move to the Zona, the special role tenure plays, and housing priorities. Housing conditions leave much to be desired. The five indicators UN Habitat has stated for shelter deprivation are at least partially met, meaning part of the Zona population is deprived of sufficient shelter. Many households wanting improvement cannot realise their wish, mainly because of poverty. Different public housing programmes have been installed and have ended because the poor could not be reached. As long as the informal market and incremental housing are not thoroughly incorporated in the policies, most Alteños will not be reached.

40|$|PurposeThis study aims to {{construct}} an integrated social entrepreneur system in the rural area of Hengshan, Taiwan, that could benefit four stakeholders, namely, tourists, business, community and government. Two social entrepreneur cases demonstrate a mutually beneficial situation of lowering the structural unemployment rate, returning young human capital to villages and innovating rural tourism through the activism of service science. Design/methodology/approachQualitative approach was applied to data obtained from 12 research projects spanning three years. Service experience engineering (SEE) methods were used to conduct a service design for social entrepreneurs in an integrated service system. The service system aimed to innovate rural tourism through the activism of service science. FindingsSEE methods explain a series of service design processes that helped our <b>research</b> team <b>start</b> <b>up</b> two social entrepreneur projects as service prototypes to offer service innovation based on cultural creativity to innovate rural tourism. These two social entrepreneurs in rural tourism offer job opportunities to young people and senior citizens alike. In addition, an integrated service system of interdisciplinary knowledge, multi-stakeholders and local resources fulfills various requirements of stakeholders to promote sustainable rural tourism. Research limitations/implicationsReal action studies are limited in the research on social entrepreneurs. This case study provides research insights into service science and calls for action in practice to change {{the future of a}} local village.

40|$|O uso da tecnologia móvel tem provocado mudanças em vários segmentos da sociedade. Inseridos no cotidiano das pessoas, os dispositivos móveis digitais transformam a cada dia a maneira como as pessoas se comunicam, se relacionam, trabalham, consomem, se divertem e aprendem. Em busca de maior flexibilidade, comodidade e mobilidade, a sociedade se apropria cada vez mais da linguagem digital e imprime novas características às relações emissor-receptor, consumidor-empresa, trabalhador-empregador, imprensa-leitor e até a de cidadão-Estado. A chamada &# 8213;geração digital&# 8214; nasce, cresce, aprende e vive conectada a um mundo digital repleto de informações circulantes e mutantes, disponibilizadas por meio de dispositivos digitais móveis, como aparelhos celulares, netbooks, tablets etc. Diferentemente de gerações passadas, a atual geração demonstra habilidades para navegar em movimento nas informações de inúmeros canais e veículos, tudo ao mesmo tempo. Nesse contexto, a educação também não está imune aos efeitos da tecnologia móvel. De que maneira ocorre a apropriação desta tecnologia nas escolas? Como a educação &# 8213;formal&# 8214; percebe e lida com os aparelhos celulares dentro da sala de aula? Quais são os desafios? Este trabalho de pesquisa inicia uma reflexão interdisciplinar, que envolve tecnologia da informação e comunicação e educação, em busca de respostas para esses questionamentos. Com ênfase no aparelho celular, busca-se aqui saber se e como o ambiente escolar incorpora a tecnologia móvel no processo educacional. Este trabalho apresenta o estudo exploratório que foi realizado em uma escola pública da cidade de Mogi das Cruzes, localizada na Grande São Paulo, com alunos do 9 ano do curso Ensino Fundamental e 2 ano do curso Ensino Médio, que utilizam o aparelho celular como auxiliar em atividades pedagógicas desenvolvidas, de forma pontual e esporádica, pela educadora na área de conhecimento em HistóriaThe use of {{the mobile}} {{technology}} has caused several changes in all segments of society.

40|$|Under a {{constant}} applied load, {{the operation of}} a typical elastohydrodynamic lubrication involves three stages, namely the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> stage, the normal steady state operation stage and the shut down stage. Previous works focused on the second normal steady state operation stage, in which a continuous lubricant film is separating the contacting surfaces. This dissertation numerically and analytically studies the lubrication behavior in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> and shut down stages of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operations. ^ A mixed phase lubricated-solid contact model is developed to study the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> stage and demonstrates {{the transition from the}} initial solid to solid contact, to the mixed lubricated-solid contact, and finally to the fully lubricated contact. A surface temperature model is developed to calculate the surface temperature rise in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process of circular contact in sliding conditions. Because of the solid contact occurring during this process, significant frictional heat is generated and the surface temperature rise is very high. ^ The shut down process of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operation is studied and the numerical results are compared with the experimental results. Because of the characteristics of EHL flow, analytical expressions are derived to predict the pressure and film thickness changes during the shut down process and these predictions agree well with the numerical results. ^ Surface pocket effects in line contact <b>start</b> <b>up</b> condition are then examined in an effort to achieve beneficial tribological performance through surface modification. In the initial static contact situation, lubricant trapped inside the pocket generates hydrostatic pressure and reduces the pressure spikes and subsurface stresses, compared with the dry contact situation. When the surfaces start to move, this hydrostatic pressure enables a pocket lubricant film build up in addition to the inlet lubricant film build <b>up.</b> Essentially the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process is divided into two parallel micro-EHL <b>start</b> <b>ups.</b> The <b>start</b> <b>up</b> time is reduced and the solid contact vanishes faster than the smooth surface <b>start</b> <b>up.</b> As a result, the frictional heat in the <b>start</b> <b>up</b> process would be much smaller and subsequently the surface temperature rise would be much reduced, compared with the smooth surface <b>start</b> <b>up</b> condition. ...|$|R

A major concern {{at the time of}} the initial <b>start</b> <b>up</b> at the low loads and speed conditions is the wear of an engine. A significant proportion of the engine life gets compromised due to the adhesive engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wear. The <b>start</b> <b>up</b> wear does not exist during the normal engine operation due to the fully established elastohydrodynamic lubricating (EHL) film between the interacting surfaces of the piston assembly and the cylinder liner at the high loads, speeds and the optimum piston-to-bore radial clearances. Such arrangements do not exist in a few initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> cycles. Resultantly, the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring establish a physical contact with the liner and adhesive wear occurs. This PhD research work numerically models the lubrication of the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring in the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up.</b> The 2 -D hydrodynamic and EHL models of the piston skirts are developed in the initial engine <b>start</b> <b>up</b> conditions.

In standard soil cultivation, tipburn is controlled reasonably well by using traditional growing methods, {{combined with the}} selection of tolerant cultivars. However, when applying novel growing techniques such as hydroponics, current practices to prevent tipburn show to be no longer sufficient. Therefore, a <b>research</b> project was <b>started</b> <b>up,</b> aiming at {{the development of a}} more rational tipburn prevention strategy. In the first year, tipburn occurrence was studied in successive soil-grown lettuce crops at two locations. Out of several environmental factors, which might induce tipburn according to literature, low nightly air humidity (RH.) appeared {{to be the most important}} one in commercial growing conditions. Several successive experiments with hydroponic lettuce (NFT) confirmed that maintaining RHn at a high level is an efficient measure to decrease tipburn occurrence. Whereas 60 to 100 % of the control plants was affected by tipburn, maintaining RHn above 95 % markedly reduced tipburn injury to 3 to 50 %, respectively. This effect was associated with an improved Ca transport to the leaf margins (1 cm zone) of young lettuce leaves and values higher than 2 - 3 g Ca kg(- 1) DM were obtained. The most efficient technique to decrease tipburn occurrence by raising RHn was the combination of water spraying underneath the gullies with nebulization above the plants.
