40|$|Astronomy is {{increasingly}} encountering two fundamental truths: (1) The field {{is faced with}} the task of extracting useful information from extremely large, complex, and high dimensional datasets; (2) The techniques of astroinformatics and astrostatistics are {{the only way to make}} this tractable, and bring the required level of sophistication to the analysis. Thus, an approach which provides these tools in a way that scales to these datasets is not just desirable, it is vital. The expertise <b>required</b> <b>spans</b> not just astronomy, but also computer science, statistics, and informatics. As a computer scientist and expert in machine learning, Alex's contribution of expertise and a large number of fast algorithms designed to scale to large datasets, is extremely welcome. We focus in this discussion on the questions raised by the practical application of these algorithms to real astronomical datasets. That is, what is needed to maximally leverage their potential to improve the science return? This is not a trivial task. While computing and statistical expertise are required, so is astronomical expertise. Precedent has shown that, to-date, the collaborations most productive in producing astronomical science results (e. g, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey), have either involved astronomers expert in computer science and/or statistics, or astronomers involved in close, long-term collaborations with experts in those fields. This does not mean that the astronomers are giving the most important input, but simply that their input is crucial in guiding the effort in the most fruitful directions, and coping with the issues raised by real data. Thus, the tools must be useable and understandable by those whose primary expertise is not computing or statistics, even though they may have quite extensive knowledge of those fields.

40|$|Memristive cells {{based on}} {{different}} physical effects, that is, phase change, valence change, and electrochemical processes, are discussed {{with respect to}} their potential to overcome the voltage–time dilemma that is crucial for an application in storage devices. Strongly non-linear switching kinetics are <b>required,</b> <b>spanning</b> more than 15 orders of magnitude in time. Temperature-driven and field-driven crystallization, threshold switching, ion migration, as well as redox reactions at interfaces are identified as relevant mechanisms. In phase change materials the combination of a reversible threshold switching and extremely large crystal growth velocities at high voltages enables ultra-fast resistive switching whereas lower voltages will not be sufficient to overcome the energy barrier for crystallization. In electrochemical cells it depends on the voltage regime, which mechanism is the rate-determining one for switching. While electro-crystallization dominates at low voltages, electron transfer in the medium voltage range and a mixture of electron transfer and ion migration at high voltages. In valence change materials, ion migration is found to be accelerated by a combined effect of electric field and local temperature increase due to Joule heating. All discussed types of resistive switches can provide sufficient non-linearity of switching kinetics for overcoming the voltage time dilemma...|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, AODV and the {{spanning}} tree routing protocols are integrated together in AODV-ST [39] as a hybrid routing protocol. In the proposed hybrid protocol, the spanning tree protocol {{is used for}} finding routes to all existing gateways, whereas all nodes use AODV to establish a path among themselves. In contrary to the performed study by Ramachandran [39], the proposed hybrid routing protocol by Le [40] considers the mobility behaviors of nodes where selecting the routing method. Actually, it uses proactive mode {{to find the best}} possible path between a gateway and a fixed router, while the reactive routing protocol is used on mobile nodes. The main advantage of this hybrid routing protocol is that mobile nodes ignore RREQ messages which are periodically sent by gateways in order to construct the <b>required</b> <b>spanning</b> tree. In this regard, the established path between a node and a gateway consists of static nodes which lead to efficient data dissemination among them. However, the proactive routing exclusively builds proactive routes to the gateways. Our proposed routing protocol extends this approach by allowing the proactive discovery of any route formed by static routers, irrespective of this fact that the gateway is a node on the path or not.|$|R

This includes the pulse generation and transmission of the generated signals over 160 km of standard single mode fiber, passively dispersion compensated. As eight short pulse sources is not available in the lab, special emphasis has been put on the pulse generation. This included two types of pulse sources, namely a pulse source based on Four Wave Mixing (FWM) in a Highly Non-linear Fiber (HNLF) and super continuum. Especially the pulse source based on Supercontinuum is promising due to the relatively smaller amount of equipment needed compared to the one based on FWM. To optimise the SC generation, several configurations were investigated. This comprised an iterative process of optimisation in which power-levels, center wavelength of optical bandpass filters and length of HLNF were tuned. An 8 � 40 Gb/s RZ pulse source was characterised and the signals were transmitted over the <b>required</b> <b>span</b> of (SSMF).
