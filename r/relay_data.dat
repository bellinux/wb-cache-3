Player data such as game history, character progression, and various statistics {{can be accessed}} in game or via the Halo Waypoint website. The web services team at 343 Industries utilized the Windows Azure Service Bus messaging infrastructure to <b>relay</b> <b>data</b> from the Xbox Live network to back-end databases, where player data and information is stored. Halo 4 player data can also be accessed via the Xbox SmartGlass application.|$|E
25|$|Communications {{depends on}} an {{omnidirectional}} low-gain antenna communicating {{at a low}} data rate and a steerable high-gain antenna, both {{in direct contact with}} Earth. A low gain antenna is also used to <b>relay</b> <b>data</b> to spacecraft orbiting Mars.|$|E
25|$|Three telemetric {{units are}} {{installed}} on Mayon's slopes, which send {{information to the}} seven seismometers in different locations around the volcano.

25|$|Along with geologist-astronaut Harrison Schmitt, Lind {{helped to}} develop and {{demonstrate}} the flight plan for the Apollo 11 EVA (including the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages that would continue to <b>relay</b> <b>data</b> following the missions) and other tools used on the lunar surface. He {{also served as a}} capsule communicator on the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. Schmitt, Owen Garriott and Lind were the only scientist-astronauts to receive advanced helicopter training, a key prerequisite for piloting the Apollo Lunar Module. Due to standard crew rotations, it is believed that Lind would have followed Schmitt as the second scientist-astronaut Lunar Module Pilot on one of the canceled Apollo missions or projected long-range Apollo Applications Program lunar survey missions.|$|E
25|$|The 53d WRS {{maintains}} similarly configured {{satellite communications}} ground stations within CARCAH at the NHC and its facility at Keesler to receive and process {{data from the}} aircraft. The Keesler ground station is maintained as a backup to the primary system at NHC, which has greater data streaming capability, and would be manned by CARCAH personnel {{in the event of}} a long-term satellite communications failure at NHC. During temporary outages, 53d personnel at Keesler act as operators and <b>relay</b> <b>data</b> from the aircraft by land line to the CARCAH ground station. Processed data is transmitted to the Weather Product Management and Distribution System (WPMDS) of the Air Force Weather Agency at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, which then relays it to the NWS Telecommunication Gateway at Silver Spring, Maryland, for worldwide distribution. The Keesler site has direct communications capability with WPMDS in the event of land line/internet failure between Keesler and the NHC. The system also provides backup transmission paths to WPMDS using local NHC servers and satellite connection to Keesler in the event of internet outages, except if an outage originates at Offutt.|$|E
500|$|Altares is due {{to leave}} Delta on a mission beyond the Solar System to seek out Earth-like planets for {{possible}} colonisation. Due {{to the effects of}} time dilation, by which astronauts travelling at near-light speed age far more slowly than people on Earth, the ship will be crewed by two whole [...] "family units". Arriving in a United Nations shuttle, Doctors Tom and Anna Bowen (Brian Blessed and Joanna Dunham) board Altares with their son, David (Martin Lev). Meanwhile, Jane Masters (Katharine Levy) leaves her dog, Spring, in the care of station commander Jim Forbes (Don Fellows). Her father, Captain Harry Masters (Nick Tate), engages Altaress [...] "photon drive" [...] and the vessel starts its 4.3-light-year journey to the star Alpha Centauri, its first scheduled stop. As Altares nears the edge of the Solar System, Jane and David observe how Pluto appears to change colour from blue to red due to the shortening and lengthening of light waves caused by the Doppler effect. Arriving at Alpha Centauri, the crew launch a series of satellites to <b>relay</b> <b>data</b> back to Earth. Having completed their primary objective, the Masters and Bowen families then agree to push deeper into space.|$|E

30|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a new {{resource}} allocation algorithm for an uplink multiuser OFDMA relay {{network in the}} context of green communications where we aim to save battery life by minimizing the consumed transmit power. We consider a relaying system model where DF relays are simple users with advantageous positions to relay cell-edge users. The main novelty of this work is that <b>relays</b> forward <b>relayed</b> <b>data</b> to the BS and multiplex the <b>relayed</b> <b>data</b> with their own data in different RB. Multiplexing in the frequency domain allows all mobile users to fulfill their QoS constraints, even though some users help others through relaying. In the literature, fixed relays are generally investigated. In addition, <b>relays</b> have no <b>data</b> to transmit to the BS. The major contribution of this work is that relays are mobile users and that have their own information to transmit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying this system model where mobile relays multiplex their own <b>data</b> to the <b>relayed</b> <b>data.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Communications: Curiosity is {{equipped}} with several means of communication, for redundancy. An X band Small Deep Space Transponder for communication directly to Earth via the NASA Deep Space Network and a UHF Electra-Lite software-defined radio for communicating with Mars orbiters. [...] The X-band system has one radio, with a 15W power amplifier, and two antennas: a low-gain omnidirectional antenna that can communicate with Earth at very low data rates (15bit/s at maximum range), regardless of rover orientation, and a high-gain antenna that can communicate at speeds up to 32kbit/s, but must be aimed. The UHF system has two radios (approximately 9W transmit power), sharing one omnidirectional antenna. This can communicate with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter (ODY) at speeds up to 2Mbit/s and 256kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is only {{able to communicate with}} Curiosity for about 8 minutes per day. [...] The orbiters have larger antennas and more powerful radios, and can <b>relay</b> <b>data</b> to Earth faster than the rover could do directly. Therefore, most of the data returned by Curiosity (MSL), is via the UHF relay links with MRO and ODY. The data return via the communication infrastructure as implemented at MSL, and observed during the first 10 days was approximately 31 megabytes per day.|$|E
