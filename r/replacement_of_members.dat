500|$|Though Brezhnev's time {{in office}} {{would later be}} {{characterized}} as one of stability, early on, Brezhnev oversaw the replacement of half of the regional leaders and Politburo members. This was a typical move for a Soviet leader trying to strengthen his power base. Examples of Politburo members who lost their membership during the Brezhnev Era are Gennady Voronov, Dmitry Polyansky, Alexander Shelepin, Petro Shelest and Podgorny. Polyansky and Voronov lost their membership in the Politburo because they {{were considered to be}} members of the [...] "Kosygin faction."

5000|$|An {{important}} aim was {{to prevent}} too much power to become concentrated {{in the hands of}} one man. One {{of the authors of the}} new Constitution, François Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas, wrote to the Convention: [...] "We propose to you to compose an executive power of five members, renewed with one new member each year, called the Directory. This executive will have a force concentrated enough that it will be swift and firm, but divided enough to make it impossible for any member to even consider becoming a tyrant. A single chief would be dangerous. Each member will preside for three months; he will have during this time the signature and seal of the head of state. By the slow and gradual <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of the Directory, you will preserve the advantages of order and continuity and will have the advantages of unity without the inconveniences." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose improved expressions for the effective buckling length coefficient of columns in multi-story sway frames. To that effect, a complete set of rotational stiffness coefficients are derived, which are then used for the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> converging at the bottom and top ends of the column in question by equivalent springs. All possible rotational and translational boundary conditions at the far end of these members, as well as the eventual presence of axial force, are considered. An analytical expression and a corresponding graph similar to those used by Eurocode 3 are then proposed for the calculation of the effective buckling length coefficient. Examples of three-story sway frames are presented, where the proposed approach is found to be in excellent agreement with finite element results, while applications of Eurocode 3 and LRFD lead to significant inaccuracies.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of genetically encoded {{mutation}} rates within a "steady state" genetic algorithm {{in order to provide}} a self-adapting mutation mechanism for incremental evolution. One of the outcomes of this work will be a {{reduction in the number of}} parameters required to be set by the operator, thus facilitating the transfer of evolutionary computing techniques into an industrial setting. The NK family of landscapes is used to provide a variety of different problems with known statistical features in order to examine the effects of changing various parameters on the performance of the search. A number of policies are considered for the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of the population with newly created individuals and recombination of material between parents, and a number of methods of encoding for mutation rate are investigated.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a simplified approach to the evaluation of the critical buckling load of multi-story frames with semirigid connections. To that effect, analytical expressions and corresponding graphs accounting for the boundary conditions of the column under investigation are proposed for the calculation of the effective buckling length coefficient for different levels of frame sway ability. In addition, a complete set of rotational stiffness coefficients is derived, which is then used for the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> converging at the bottom and top ends of the column in question by equivalent springs. All possible rotational and translational boundary conditions at the far end of these members, featuring semi-rigid connection at their near end as well as the eventual presence of axial force, are considered. Examples of sway, non-sway and partially-sway frames with semi-rigid connections are presented, where the Proposed approach is found to be in excellent agreement with the finite element results, while the application of codes such as Eurocode 3 and LRFD leads to significant inaccuracies.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a method for the evaluation of the elastic critical buckling load of columns in frames consisting of members susceptible to non-negligible shear deformations, such as built-up members in steel frames, based on Engesser's approach. To that effect, a stability matrix is proposed and three general stability equations are derived for the cases of unbraced, partially braced and braced frames. Indicative graphic interpretation of the solutions for the stability equations of the braced and unbraced cases is shown. Slope-deflection equations for shear-weak members with semi-rigid connections are also derived and used for the presentation of a complete set of rotational stiffness coefficients, which are then used for the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> converging at the bottom and top ends of the column in question by equivalent springs. All possible rotational and translational boundary conditions at the far end of these members, as well as the eventual presence of axial force, are considered. Five examples are presented, dealing with braced, unbraced and partially braced frames, with rigid and semi-rigid beam to column connections, loaded with concentrated or uniformly distributed loads, in a symmetrical or non-symmetrical pattern. In all cases the proposed approach is in excellent agreement with finite element results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The Lisbon Treaty {{has given}} EU {{institutions}} power over {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI). The Commission has indicated that it will use these powers to develop an EU wide FDI policy. FDI policy consists of measures to protect investment, restrictions that apply to FDI and measures to promote investment including incentives. Initially, the new EU FDI policy {{is likely to be}} confined to the protection of investment and, more specifically, the gradual <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>member</b> states' bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with EU wide treaties. By leaving investment incentives and restrictions within the control <b>of</b> <b>member</b> states for the time being, the Commission is taking a pragmatic approach that seeks to minimize resistance from member states to its new powers. While some hurdles will need to be overcome, EU wide protection of investment can be argued to result in benefits for international businesses both inside and outside of the EU {{as well as for the}} EU itself. Further, an EU wide policy has the potential to pave the way for a global investment agreement which would create a more certain global environment for FDI and hence contribute to global economic stability.
