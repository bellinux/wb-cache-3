The theory and technology of predicting fatigue life is of great significance to improve the durability design and manufacturing of anti-vibration rubber products. According to {{the characteristics of the}} anti-vibration rubber products in service, the technical difficulties for analyzing fatigue properties of anti-vibration <b>rubber</b> <b>materials</b> are pointed out. The research progress of the fatigue properties of <b>rubber</b> <b>materials</b> is reviewed from three angles including methods of fatigue crack initiation, fatigue crack propagation and fatigue damage accumulation. It is put forward that some nonlinear characteristics of rubber under fatigue loading, including the Mullins effect, permanent deformation and cyclic stress softening, should be considered in the further study of <b>rubber</b> <b>materials.</b> Meanwhile, it is indicated that the fatigue damage accumulation method based on continuum damage mechanics might be more appropriate to solve fatigue damage and life prediction problems for complex <b>rubber</b> <b>materials</b> and structures under fatigue loading...|$|R
