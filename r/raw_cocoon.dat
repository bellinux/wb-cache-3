60|$|During {{the time}} of their struggles for {{enlarging}} this losing trade, which they considered as a national object,--what in one point of view it was, and, {{if it had not been}} grossly mismanaged, might have been in more than one,--in this part it is impossible to refuse to the Directors a very great share of merit. No degree of thought, of trouble, or of reasonable expense was spared by them for the improvement of the commodity. They framed with diligence, and apparently on very good information, a code of manufacturing regulations for that purpose; and several persons were sent out, conversant in the Italian method of preparing and winding silk, aided by proper machines for facilitating and perfecting the work. This, under proper care, and in course of time, might have produced a real improvement to Bengal; but in the first instance it naturally drew the business from native management, and it caused a revulsion from the trade and manufactures of India which led as naturally and inevitably to an European monopoly, in some hands or other, as any of the modes of coercion which were or could be employed. The evil was present and inherent in the act. The means of letting the natives into the benefit of the improved system of produce was likely to be counteracted by the general ill conduct of the Company's concerns abroad. For a while, at least, it had an effect still worse: for the Company purchasing the <b>raw</b> <b>cocoon</b> or silk-pod at a fixed rate, the first producer, who, whilst he could wind at his own house, employed his family in this labor, and could procure a reasonable livelihood by buying up the cocoons for the Italian filature, now incurred the enormous and ruinous loss of fifty per cent. This appears in a letter to the Presidency, written by Mr. Boughton Rouse, now a member of your Committee. But for a long time a considerable quantity of that in the old Bengal mode of winding was bought for the Company from contractors, and it continues to be so bought to the present time: but the Directors complain, in their letter of the 12th of May, 1780, that both species, and particularly the latter, had risen so extravagantly that it was become more than forty per cent dearer than it had been fifteen years ago. In that state of price, they condemn their servants, very justly, for entering into contracts for three years,--and that for several kinds of silk, of very different goodness, upon averages unfairly formed, where the commodities averaged at an equal price differed from twenty to thirty per cent on the sale. Soon after, they formed a regular scale of fixed prices, above which they found they could not trade without loss.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{that was}} a more cheerful time for {{observers}} and theorizers than the present; we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when America was beginning to be discovered, when a bold sailor, {{even if he were}} wrecked, might alight on a new kingdom; and about 1829 the dark territories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young adventurer. Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession. The more he became interested in special questions of disease, such as the nature of fever or fevers, the more keenly he felt the need for that fundamental knowledge of structure which just {{at the beginning of the}} century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of Bichat, who died when he was only one-and-thirty, but, like another Alexander, left a realm large enough for many heirs. That great Frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies, fundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be understood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally; but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues, out of which the various organs--brain, heart, lungs, and so on--are compacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in various proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest, each material having its peculiar composition and proportions. No man, one sees, can understand and estimate the entire structure or its parts--what are its frailties and what its repairs, without knowing the nature of the materials. And the conception wrought out by Bichat, with his detailed study of the different tissues, acted necessarily on medical questions as the turning of gas-light would act on a dim, oil-lit street, showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms of maladies and the action of medicaments. But results which depend on human conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of 1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the old paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which might have seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat's. This great seer did not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the living organism, marking the limit of anatomical analysis; but it was open to another mind to say, have not these structures some common basis from which they have all started, as your sarsnet, gauze, net, satin, and velvet from the <b>raw</b> <b>cocoon?</b> Here would be another light, as of oxy-hydrogen, showing the very grain of things, and revising all former explanations. Of this sequence to Bichat's work, already vibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was enamoured; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of living structure, and help to define men's thought more accurately after the true order. The work had not yet been done, but only prepared for those who knew how to use the preparation. What was the primitive tissue? In that way Lydgate put the question--not quite in the way required by the awaiting answer; but such missing of the right word befalls many seekers. And he counted on quiet intervals to be watchfully seized, for taking up the threads of investigation--on many hints to be won from diligent application, not only of the scalpel, but of the microscope, which research had begun to use again with new enthusiasm of reliance. Such was Lydgate's plan of his future: to do good small work for Middlemarch, and great work for the world.|$|E

40|$|Silk fibroin protein {{derived from}} Bombyx Mori silk cocoon {{is a natural}} polymer that widely used for {{application}} in tissue engineering. Silk Fibroin has remarkable properties that demonstrates biocompatibility, biodegradable and great mechanical properties. In this present study, regenerated silk fibroin {{can be obtained by}} multistep preparation which are degumming and solubilisation process. The small pieces of regenerated silk fibers were cut and then blended with Polyvinylalcohol (PVA) solution to enhance the mechanical property of scaffold. Electrospinning capable to fabricate scaffold with the high surface area. Result showed that by increased of concentration of solution silk/PVA, voltage and flowrate, more fibers were produced in the film. A thin white film was produced at film of silk/PVA at 14 % (w/v) without addition of chloroform. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) investigated the morphology of silk and revealed that applied voltage of 15 kV during electrospinning has narrowest of fiber diameter (0. 270 μm), less number of beaded, smaller beads and high average size of pore (1. 379 μm). Flowrate parameter showed that more electrospun fibers were produced at 3 ml/h with fiber diameter (0. 357 μm). The water contact angle measures the hydrophilicity of silk film where at 15 kV and 3 ml/h has highest in hydrophilicity with contact angle 27. 3 o and 20. 1 o respectively. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the <b>raw</b> <b>cocoon,</b> degummed silk, regenerated silk fibroin and silk/PVA solution. FTIR spectra showed that new characteristic peak of Amide III at 1445 to 1458 cm- 1 presence in degummed silk, regenerated silk fibroin and silk/PVA solution. The result indicate that β sheet was formed after degumming process. The result also indicated that all peaks at silk/PVA solution have become stronger with addition of PVA content due to chemical bonding of silk and PVA. The silk/PVA based scaffold produced by dialysis free technique in this study can be promising candidate as biomaterial for various tissue engineering application...|$|E
30|$|The cocoons {{were first}} treated with dilute {{hydrochloric}} acid (3  N) and after {{half an hour}} the cocoons were taken out and immersed in sodium-EDTA solution (0.4  M) stirred for 15  min and then these cocoons were taken out and washed thoroughly with plentiful of running water. These were then dried under ambient condition. These treated cocoons were subjected to microscopic analysis and gating experiments for comparison with the data obtained from native, <b>raw</b> <b>cocoons.</b> The leached out solution of cocoon has been treated to get back the calcium oxalate monohydrate which was washed out from the outer surface of the cocoons by acid treatment. It is well known that calcium oxalate can be readily solubilized in water by adding dilute hydrochloric acid, where by the oxalate ion gets protonated with the separation of oxalic acid and in forming calcium chloride. Therefore in order to recover calcium oxalate from this solution, it was first neutralized by adding ammonia solution under warm condition and this ammoniacal solution on digestion in the water bath resulted in the white precipitate of calcium oxalate monohydrate. This mixture was allowed to cool on standing and the precipitate was filtered off, washed couple of times with cold water and dried. This white residue is subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the crisis}} in Europe, the {{modernization}} of sericulture in Japan made it the world's foremost silk producer. By the early 20th century, rapidly industrializing Japan was producing as much as 60 percent of the world's raw silk, most exports shipping through the port of Yokohama. Italy managed to rebound from the crisis, but France was unable. Urbanization in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for more lucrative factory work. Raw silk was imported from Japan to fill the void.

30|$|Historically, sericin in B. mori silk {{triggered}} the scholars’ interest quite {{early in the}} development of the modern scientific investigation. The earliest report on sericin was published in 1785 by l'Abbé ('Father’) Collomb (Collomb 1785), who was the first to demonstrate its solubility in hot water. A rigorous study of the effects of water, alcohol, alkaline solutions, soap, and acids, and exposure to light on the silk yarn was published two decades later (Roard 1808), showing that the portion of the silk soluble in aqueous or alcoholic media contained at least four fractions, and two of them were assumed to be constituents of the gum coating, i.e. what we call now sericin. Throughout the next century, research has been focused on improved methods to remove and isolate sericin and to identify its constituents, as overviewed in some earlier publications (Shelton and Johnson 1925; Lucas et al. 1958). The extraction in boiling water or by autoclaving became the techniques of choice for extracting sericin from <b>raw</b> silk or <b>cocoons.</b>|$|R
30|$|There is {{significant}} research dedicated to fibroin and sericin, {{the two major}} proteinaceous components of the silk threads produced by the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori. While fibroin is accepted as an established biomaterial, sericin (BMSS) has been largely neglected in this respect on the account of a hypothetical allergenic activity. Research over the past decade, including our previous study (Prog Biomater 2 : 14, 2013), demonstrated the biocompatibility of sericin and feasibility of its use as a biomaterial. However, the current procedures for isolating BMSS from the <b>raw</b> silk <b>cocoons</b> can only provide degraded proteins, where the size and distribution of their molecular masses are significantly altered. Based on the plausible assumption that such effects can {{have a negative impact}} on the properties of sericin as a biomaterial, in this study we investigated comparatively four different extraction procedures in order to find the method that would cause the least hydrothermal degradation of BMSS. The products resulting from commonly used procedures (extraction in boiling water, alkaline extraction, and extraction in autoclave) were compared to those resulting from aqueous extraction in mild conditions as described a long time ago by Anderlini. The molecular mass distribution in BMSS resulting from each procedure was examined by electrophoretic analysis performed on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), while the conformational changes pertaining to secondary structure of BMSS were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectrometry. The electrophoretograms indicated that the aqueous extraction in mild conditions conducted at 50  °C for durations up to 4  weeks, with/without stirring, afforded the least degraded BMSS. The infrared spectrometric analysis showed that BMSS resulting from the mild extraction method contained predominantly β-sheet conformations, while the more degradative methods (alkaline, autoclave) led to BMSS where the random-coil conformations were preferential. The long-duration aqueous extraction at 50  °C (but not at 60  °C) appeared as a valid option for obtaining BMSS products where the hydrothermally induced fragmentation of the polypeptidic components is minimized.|$|R
