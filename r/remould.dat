This paper reports the results of stress path triaxial tests on bulk samples of the mudstone which have been subjected to varying amounts of mechanical <b>remoulding</b> representing the <b>remoulding</b> that occurs due to the action of the auger. In addition, the water content at which <b>remoulding</b> takes place has been varied. The tests were undertaken to investigate whether the silt sized aggregates of clay particles that exist [2] within this soil could be broken up by the mechanical <b>remoulding</b> and whether this would affect the compression and strength properties of the mudstone.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this dissertation examines the physical and chemical changes that occur to in situ soil at the soil-pile interface for continuous flight auger piles installed in the Mercia Mudstone Group. Four Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles were installed in the Gunthorpe Member of the Mercia Mudstone Group, central England. The effect on the soil-pile interface of overrotation of the auger during installation, {{and the addition of}} water during installation were investigated. Once the piles had been left to cure, they were excavated and returned to City University, London, with the surrounding soil. The excavated piles and soil were examined using a variety of microscopic and macroscopic techniques including inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) and X-ray diffraction (XRD); with water contents, chemical content (ICP) and mineralogical content (XRD) tested. Plastic index and particle size distribution tests were used to show the physical effects of piling on the host soil and preliminary strength testing was carried out to provide insight into the strength characteristics of the soil surrounding the pile. In all four piles a distinct zone of <b>remoulding</b> was observed around the pile shaft. In each case the <b>remoulded</b> zone was a brown to red, clay rich layer varying between 0 mm and 55 mm in thickness. In almost all cases this <b>remoulded</b> zone had a structure and fabric which was not related to the in situ soil. Around all piles it was further noted that vertical fissures were present, and fanned out from the pile shaft in a clockwise direction. Two of the piles were installed with the addition of water. Around these piles it was noted that the <b>remoulded</b> layer often split into two or three distinct layers, with one of these layers often containing millimetre scale aggregations of green silt. Tests showed a higher percentage of clays present within this <b>remoulded</b> zone, and indicated that SiO 2 (a major rock forming element and considered by some authors to be an aggregating agent within the Mercia Mudstone Group) was more abundant within <b>remoulded</b> than undisturbed soil. The clay fraction showed a low abundance of high swelling clays in all cases. It was concluded that installing piles within the Mercia Mudstone Group causes <b>remoulding</b> of the soil directly adjacent to the pile shaft. The least <b>remoulding</b> occurred when the pile was augered normally with no added water. All four <b>remoulded</b> zones contained fissures, fanning clockwise from the pile, however, these were more pronounced in the dry piles, while the wet piles had a more massive, granular texture to the <b>remoulded</b> zone. For all piles, except the pile which was over-rotated and installed with no added water, the percentage of clays within the <b>remoulded</b> zone was greater than outside the <b>remoulded</b> zone. This indicates that the aggregates of clays found naturally within the Mercia Mudstone Group may be split into their constituent clays during the piling process...|$|R

40|$|Unexpected {{swelling}} induced in foundation soils {{can cause}} distress to structures founded on them. In this paper, the swelling of kaolinitic soils due to interaction with alkali solution has been reported. The induced swelling {{is attributed to}} the formation of new minerals, which has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction patters and SEM studies. To understand the effect of alkali concentration and duration of interaction, two series of consolidation experiments have been carried out. In series 1, the specimen were <b>remoulded</b> with water and inundated with alkali solutions and in series 2, the specimen were <b>remoulded</b> and inundated with same alkali solutions. A steep compression during loading cycle and no abnormal swelling during unloading cycle has been noticed for the specimen <b>remoulded</b> with water and inundated with 1 N NaOH solutions. The steep compression is due to the segregation or break down of clay minerals due to alkali interactions. In case of specimen inundated with 4 N NaOH solutions, abnormal swelling has been observed during unloading cycle of the consolidation test. New minerals are formed on interaction of soil with 4 N solution as confirmed by X-ray diffraction patterns. These minerals are known to have very fine pores and possess high water holding capacity. The differences in the amount of swelling of samples <b>remoulded</b> with water and <b>remoulded</b> with alkali solution are due to variations in the concentration of alkali and duration of interaction...|$|R
40|$|Regain rate of {{strength}} in <b>remoulded</b> clays with {{time has been}} investigated and evaluated in this study. The clays loose much of the original strength after disturbance, especially in quick clay where the strength after disturbance drops to less than 0. 5 kpa depending on its sensitivity. Thereafter the structure of <b>remoulded</b> clays is rebuilt to a more stable and rigid one than the original structure. During this process a regain {{of strength}} is established overtime, but this process is affected by several factors and takes long time. In principle, these factors {{can be divided into}} two types; factors that are related to the mineralogical composition of clays, and the type of bonding between particles in the soil-water system. The second type of factors affecting the regain of strength is the surrounding conditions such as, climate, stress history and stress distribution, the thixotropic action, reconsolidation and water pressure. This study is conducted through experimental work with wide variations in the surrounding conditions and methodologies of testing. The experimental work is composed of field experiment in Tiller and laboratory small scale experiment on clay samples from Tiller. A new electrical vane shear test device, developed in the geotechnical laboratory in NTUN, was utilized to measure the strength of <b>remoulded</b> clays in the field. This apparatus is accurate and sensitive to measure the resistance in <b>remoulded</b> clays. The search includes also a real case study to evaluate the regain of strength in <b>remoulded</b> quick clay under natural conditions during installation of two tubular sheet piles in a quick clay zone. This work includes field and laboratory tests on <b>remoulded</b> quick clay after 1 year. From this study, the important findings were: - The clay recovered its strength, or even regain more than the original strength, but the required time is extensive, in terms of years. - The time required to recover the original strength is varying depending on the specific boundary conditions after disturbance. Summary of the work as well as recommendation for further work has been presented and discussed.

60|$|Of all nations, the United States, with veins full of poetical stuff, most needs poets, {{and will}} doubtless have the greatest, {{and use them}} the greatest. Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their poets shall. Of all mankind, the great poet is the equable man. Not in him, but off from him, things are {{grotesque}} or eccentric, or fail of their sanity. Nothing out of its place is good, and nothing in its place is bad. He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportions, neither more nor less. He is the arbiter of the diverse, {{and he is the}} key. He is the equaliser of his age and land: he supplies what wants supplying, and checks what wants checking. If peace is the routine, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building vast and populous cities, encouraging agriculture and the arts and commerce--lighting the study of man, the soul, immortality--federal, state or municipal government, marriage, health, free-trade, intertravel by land and sea--nothing too close, nothing too far off,--the stars not too far off. In war, he is the most deadly force of the war. Who recruits him recruits horse and foot: he fetches parks of artillery, the best that engineer ever knew. If the time becomes slothful and heavy, he knows how to arouse it: he can make every word he speaks draw blood. Whatever stagnates in the flat of custom or obedience or legislation, he never stagnates. Obedience does not master him, he masters it. High up out of reach, he stands turning a concentrated light; he turns the pivot with his finger; he baffles the swiftest runners as he stands, and easily overtakes and envelops them. The time straying toward infidelity and confections and persiflage he withholds by his steady faith; he spreads out his dishes; he offers the sweet firm-fibred meat that grows men and women. His brain is the ultimate brain. He is no arguer, he is judgment. He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling around a helpless thing. As he sees the farthest, he has the most faith. His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things. In the talk on the soul and eternity and God, off of his equal plane, he is silent. He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement: he sees eternity in men and women,--he does not see men and women as dreams or dots. Faith is the antiseptic of the soul,--it pervades the common people and preserves them: they never give up believing and expecting and trusting. There is that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate person that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius. The poet sees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be just as sacred and perfect as the greatest artist.

40|$|This study investigates a slope failure {{complex in}} loess at Allandale, Lyttelton Harbour. Literature {{relevant}} to the slope stability and strength of Banks Peninsula loessial soils is reviewed. Laboratory and in situ strength testing shows that both C and P layer loess in a partially saturated state displays {{a significant reduction in}} undrained shear strength with increasing degree of saturation. Strength reduction can be attributed to reduced pore water tension due to capillary suction which results from an increased degree of saturation. The moisture controlled strength component in partially saturated loess can be defined by any two of dry density, moisture content and degree of saturation. When comparing loess C and P layer <b>remoulded</b> strengths with peak strengths, the P layer is significantly more sensitive to <b>remoulding</b> than C layer. Drained direct shear testing of C layer loess produces <b>remoulded</b> and peak strength parameters of c'=O, Ø'= 28. 4 ° and c'= 6 kPa, Ø '= 28. 4 ° respectively. Drained direct shear testing of P layer loess produced <b>remoulded</b> and peak shear strength parameters of c'=O, Ø '= 28. 4 ° and c'= 20 kPa, Ø '= 28. 4 ° respectively. The slope failure complex investigated has been formed by an earthflow initiated by a tension crack in C layer loess (which acts as an unconfined leaky aquifer). Subsequent retrogressive upslope and lateral migration of the slope failure complex involves "turfmat slides" in S layer loess which also acts as an unconfined leaky aquifer, and more tension crack initiated earth flows in C layer loess. Back analysis suggests both forms of slope movement may have failed by translational sliding at the base of their respective loess layer, with a piezometric level coincident with the ground surface. Mobilisation of the "turfmat slide", requires drained <b>remoulded</b> shear strengths, whereas mobilisation of the earth flow is more likely to involve drained peak shear strengths...|$|R
