40|$|Abstract: Biomass and {{microbial}} {{activity in}} backwashing processes of a biofilter for tertiary treatment were investigated. The microbial groups revealed new distribution along the biofilter depth after {{low flow rate}} backwashing for a short time. Then the start-up process was accelerated by backwashing. The biomass profile and microbial activity profile both varying with depth before and after backwashing, can be mathematically described by quadratic equations. Using the profiles, the difference of oxygen demand can be calculated to determine the airflow rate during backwashing. Combined with the difference between biofilters and <b>rapid</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>filters,</b> analysis of biomass and microbial activity can determine more accurately the required airflow rate during backwashing...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rapid</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>filters,</b> {{the final}} {{particulate}} barrier in many water treatment systems, are typically monitored using on-line turbidity, flow and head loss instrumentation. Current metrics for assessing filtration performance from on-line turbidity data were critically assessed and observed not to effectively and consistently summarise the important properties of a turbidity distribution {{and the associated}} water quality risk. In {{the absence of a}} consistent risk function for turbidity in treated water, using on-line turbidity as an indicative rather than a quantitative variable appears to be more practical. Best practice suggests that filtered water turbidity should be maintained below 0. 1 NTU, at higher turbidity we can be less confident of an effective particle and pathogen barrier. Based on this simple distinction filtration performance has been described in terms of reliability and resilience by characterising the likelihood, frequency and duration of turbidity spikes greater than 0. 1 NTU. This view of filtration performance is then used to frame operational diagnosis of unsatisfactory performance in terms of a machine learning classification problem. Through calculation of operationally relevant predictor variables and application of the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm the conditions associated with the greatest risk of poor filtration performance can be effectively modelled and communicated in operational terms. This provides a method for an evidence based decision support which can be used to efficiently manage individual pathogen barriers in a multi-barrier system...|$|R
40|$|The <b>rapid</b> rate <b>gravity</b> <b>filter</b> is {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} surface water supplies. It consists of a structure to house the unit, the filter media, an under- rain system, a surface washer, and a waste disposal system. The filter area should be divided into at least two separate units to allow operational flexibility. Some form of pre-treatment of the raw water, such as sedimentation, is usually needed. In the filtering process, water flows onto the top of the filter media and is driven through it by gravity. In passing through the small spaces between the filter's grains, impurities are removed. The water continues its way through the support gravel, enters the under-drainage system, and then flows to the reservoir. It is the filter media, composed of sand or anthracite, which actually removes the particles from the water. The filter media is routinely cleaned by means of a backwashing process...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{results of}} a series of studies investigating the removal of two common taste and odour compounds, 2 -methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin, from drinking water using biologically active sand filtration. A combination of full-, pilot- and laboratory-scale studies were carried out. A review of long term water quality data from a South Australian water treatment plant indicated that the conventional plant was capable of removing MIB and geosmin to below detection limit without the need for additional treatment. A series of laboratory studies were carried out, validating the theory that the geosmin removal was occurring through biological activity in the <b>rapid</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>filters</b> of the water treatment plant. Microorganisms capable of geosmin removal were found to be present in the settled water of two South Australian water treatment plants, Morgan and Happy Valley. Laboratory sand column experiments were conducted with these waters and a range of sand media, investigating the effect of biofilm development on MIB and geosmin biodegradation. It was found that the process could produce effective removals, however long start-up periods were often required. A laboratory-scale column utilising new sand fed with Happy Valley settled water took in excess of 300 days before it was capable of removing MIB and geosmin by greater than 80 %. Studies on sands with inactivated pre-existing biofilms required much shorter biofilm development periods, from 30 to 40 days. The results of the column studies indicated that a method to encourage sand filters to operate biologically for MIB and geosmin removal would be advantageous. Two methods were studied: preozonation and bacterial inoculation. Pre-ozonation was carried out at a pilot plant, constructed at the Happy Valley water treatment plant. Additional factors investigated during this study were the length of the biofilm development period and the impact of empty bed contact time (EBCT). Preozonation is often used in tandem with biological filtration to increase the fraction of biodegradable organic matter and in turn increase the biomass activity of the filter. The pilot plant consisted of two sand filters; one fed with settled water and one fed with preozonated settled water. Pre-ozonation did not enhance the biodegradation of MIB or geosmin. The pre-ozonated column was run for 550 days. Removals of MIB and geosmin were inconsistent throughout the trial. The maximum removal obtained during the study was 80 % for MIB and geosmin, at an EBCT of 45 minutes, after 380 days of operation. The settled water column was run for over 650 days. By day 560, the column was able to remove 60 % of the influent geosmin and 40 % of the influent MIB at an EBCT of 10 minutes, which is close to that used in full-scale plants. Significant effects of empty bed contact time were not noted in the range of 10 to 30 minutes. Bacterial inoculation studies were carried out at laboratory-scale. The inoculum comprised of a geosmin-degrading consortium of three Gram-negative bacteria previously isolated from the biofilm of the Morgan water treatment plant filter sand. A sand column with a pre-existing biofilm was inoculated with the organisms, achieving 70 % removal of geosmin. Inoculation of columns without biofilms gave lower geosmin removals, with an average of 41 % removal. These were preliminary studies only, and further work is required. A biomass activity assay, based on the concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), was developed {{over the course of the}} project. This assay was particularly helpful when studying the attachment of the inoculum in the laboratory columns. Other methods to study biomass were flow cytometry to enumerate the water-borne and biofilm associated bacteria, and scanning electron microscopy to obtain a visual observation of the biofilms on various sands. This work demonstrated the potential of biological sand filtration for MIB and geosmin control. It was shown that long biofilm development periods are evident before effective removal of the compounds can occur. The potential to minimise these long biofilm development periods by inoculation of filters with geosmin degrading organisms was demonstrated. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Information gathered included ownership and design capacity of the plants, water sources, and various methods of disinfection, equipment currently employed and performance of the treatment plants. In general, the majority (over 80 %) of the SWTPs surveyed in the designated provinces were owned by the district municipalities. The designed capacities of these plants varied between 1 and 60 Mℓ/d; the smallest capacity was 100 m 3 /d and the largest 120 Mℓ/d. The small water treatment plants abstracted their raw water from either surface or groundwater {{or a combination of}} both water sources with greater preponderance for surface water sources (over 86 %). Water treatment practices were noted to be the conventional types mainly coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. Two types of coagulants namely polyelectrolyte (66 %) and alum (18 %) were commonly used by the water treatment plants across the provinces studied. <b>Rapid</b> <b>gravity</b> filtration, pressure <b>filter</b> and slow sand filtration systems accounted for 60 %, 23 % and 9 % of the filtration systems across the provinces, respectively. The predominant types of disinfectants employed were chlorine gas (69 %) followed by sodium (15 %) and calcium (14 %) hypochlorite. Over 50 % of the various SWTPs did not comply with the SANS 241 Class I (< 1 NTU) and Class II (1 to 5 NTU) recommended turbidity values. The recommended target range of 0. 3 to 0. 6 mg/ℓ free chlorine residual concentrations at the point of use was not always met by 40 % of the plants. Seventy percent of the SWTPs complied with the SANS 241 criteria of microbiological safety of drinking water vis-à-vis total and faecal coliforms. Operational problems affecting the efficiency of small water treatment plants included: inability to appropriately determine the flow rate, chemical dosage and turbidity, lack of chlorine residual at the point of use and lack of water quality monitoring. To produce safe drinking water, appropriate operational practices must be implemented in all small water treatment plants...|$|R
40|$|This item is Closed Access. Sand {{has been}} the main filter media used in <b>rapid</b> <b>gravity</b> {{filtration}} since its introduction.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of a {{drinking}} water treatment plant is to provide safe drinking water for its consumers. Historically, this was accomplished through monitoring the influent and effluent water quality {{to ensure that the}} water quality met a set of guidelines and regulations. However, as the limitations of relying on compliance monitoring become more evident, water utilities and drinking water treatment plants are beginning to utilize risk management frameworks to help provide safe drinking water and to mitigate potential risks. Applying a risk management framework requires an evaluation of potential risks. This systematic evaluation can be performed through using risk analysis methods. The overall goal of this research is to analyze and evaluate risk analysis methodologies that are used in a variety of engineering fields, select two risk analysis methods, and use them to evaluate the probability of producing non-compliant drinking water from a <b>rapid</b> <b>gravity</b> filtration unit with respect to turbidity. The risk analysis methodologies that were used in this research were the consequence frequency assessment and computer modelling combined with probabilistic risk analysis. Both of the risk analysis methodologies were able to determine the probability of producing non-compliant water from a <b>rapid</b> <b>gravity</b> filtration unit with respect to turbidity. However, these methodologies were found to provide different numerical results with respect to each other. The consequence frequency assessment methodology was found to be easier to implement; however, the consequence frequency assessment was only able to be performed on one parameter at a time. Computer modelling and probabilistic risk analysis enabled the inclusion of multiple parameters which provided a more comprehensive understanding of the filtration unit. The primary conclusion from this research is that the risk analysis methods, as they are described in this thesis, are not sufficient to use directly on a <b>rapid</b> <b>gravity</b> filtration unit without further modification. Furthermore, although the risk analysis methods provided some guidance, these methods should only be used {{as a part of a}} complete risk management process...|$|R
