50|$|In 1901 the Taff Vale Railway Company {{successfully}} {{sued the}} Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, a trade union, for damages due to losses accrued during a strike by their members, who were seeking {{to compel the}} company to recognise the union. The Company was awarded £23,000 by decision of the court, <b>reversing</b> the <b>belief</b> that trade unions were immune to damages from the actions of their members. Following the change of government in 1906, the Trade Disputes Act 1906 was passed, giving trade unions immunity from such claims.|$|R
5000|$|In 1873, the {{lighthouse}} was painted in its distinctive {{black and white}} diagonal checkerboard, or diamond, pattern. [...] There are those who believe the Cape Hatteras Light and the Cape Lookout Light paint schemes were <b>reversed.</b> This <b>belief</b> arose since the Cape Hatteras Light protects ships from Diamond Shoals and should therefore have the diamond pattern. However, the daymark patterns were randomly assigned {{and there is no}} evidence to suggest that the Cape Lookout and Cape Hatteras patterns were switched. Diamond City, a community that once stood on the eastern end of Shackleford Banks, was named after the daymark pattern on the nearby Cape Lookout Lighthouse.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} predicting the outcomes of a sequence of discrete random variables that are almost uniform, {{in the sense that}} they are generated from a random process that is designed to produce independent uniform outcomes but may not do so exactly. Using assumptions based around this notion we derive a useful stochastic ordering. We reject the gambler’s belief as unsound and find that the <b>reverse</b> gambler’s <b>belief</b> is the optimal prediction method. This method arises under a wide class of Bayesian models. One of the main contributions of this paper is that it uses only weak and intuitive prior assumptions and should therefore be more palatable to sceptics than existing Bayesian models...|$|R
40|$|TORQUATO TASSO AND THE DISCORSO DELLA VIRTU' FEMINILE E DONNESCA The essay {{shows an}} {{innovative}} {{interpretation of the}} Discorso, linked, together with the Dialoghi, to the contradiction between Platonism and Aristotelianism within Tasso’s thought. On the one hand, Tasso’s work strengthens the traditional idea of women’s natural inferiority, {{but at the same}} time, through the “heroic women” typology, he <b>reverses</b> this <b>belief</b> recognizing the equality of nature between men and women. Two features, in particular, are reconstructed: the inner and mystical nature of the Discorso, and on the other hand, the substantial courtly world representing its historical reference, with on the background the troubled Erasmian Christianity and the women representing its protagonists in Italy...|$|R
40|$|Assisted {{reproductive}} techniques {{not only}} nourish great and sometimes illusive hopes of couples who yearn for babies, but also spark new debates by <b>reversing</b> opinions, <b>beliefs</b> and values. Applications made to infertility clinics are increasing {{due to the}} influences such as broadcasts made by the media concerning assisted reproductive techniques and other infertility treatments, increase {{in the knowledge that}} people have about these problems, late marriages and postponement of childbearing age owing to sociological changes. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a technique applied to couples who are known to carry genetic diseases or who have children with genetic diseases. This technique is conducted by doctors in Turkey for its important contribution to decreasing the risk of genetic diseases and in order to raise healthy generations. In this paper, the general ethical debates and the legal situation in Turkey will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{measures}} {{purchasing power}} parity (PPP) {{by means of}} the dynamic-factor errorcorrection model (DF-ECM) approach. Under this new approach, PPP is embedded in latent disequilibrium factors, which are extracted from a large variable set of bilateral price disparities; the factors are then used as error-correction leading indicators to explain exchange rate and inflation. Modelling experiments on five OECD countries using monthly data show promising results, which <b>reverse</b> the common <b>belief</b> that PPP is at best a very long-run relationship at the macro level.

50|$|The sisters woke up {{and found}} {{that they were in}} a Weapon X {{experiment}} facility, and remembered nothing of the events that brought them there. Though not feeling any different except for their slight amnesia, they were more than surprised when they got up and looked at each other, the sisters realize that their bodies had been tampered with as they only saw their once mutant forms; cat-like in appearance. Whatever had been done to them had, in their <b>beliefs,</b> <b>reversed</b> their depowering and they were both mutants again.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} value of public {{information}} in a competitive endowment economy. We provide a global result that an early release {{of information about the}} future state of the economy is desired by all agents, or Pareto improving, if agents disagree about the prospect of the economy and asset markets are complete. We further prove that for certain levels of agents’ disagreement, all agents prefer an early release of information even if agents cannot trade in asset markets before the information arrives (incomplete asset markets). Thus, the introduction of heterogeneous <b>beliefs</b> <b>reverses</b> the well-known Hirshleifer effect...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the next}} twenty-eight years, Regina ruled Storybrooke as its tyrannical mayor Regina Mills. Her undoing came when, in 2001, with Mr. Gold (Rumplestiltskin)'s help, she adopted Henry Mills, the {{grandson}} of her nemesis Snow White. Due to this, Snow's daughter Emma Swan (the Savior) arrived in 2011, after Henry began to realize the truth about that town. Regina originally sent her son to therapy sessions to <b>reverse</b> his <b>beliefs</b> in the curse. After a kiss from Emma caused her lover Graham Humbert (the Huntsman) to remember who he was, Regina killed him {{in order to protect}} the curse and also out of revenge for his breaking up with her. The power struggle between Regina and Rumplestiltskin continued in Storybrooke where she was often at odds with Mr. Gold. Initially unbeknownst to him, Regina kept Gold's true love Belle captive, after telling him she had died. She tried to prevent the relationship between David Nolan (Prince Charming) and Mary Margaret Blanchard (Snow White), by implicating her in David's wife Kathryn Nolan (Charming's fiancee Princess Abigail) false murder. After Emma threatened to take back her son, Regina tried to curse her with the same sleeping curse that took her mother. However, Henry consumed the curse instead. This finally caused Emma to believe in magic, awakening Henry with true love's kiss and breaking the curse.|$|R
50|$|Thomas D'Arcy Etienne Hughes McGee, (13 April 1825 - 7 April 1868) was an Irish-Canadian politician, Catholic spokesman, journalist, poet, and a Father of Canadian Confederation. The young McGee was a Catholic Irishman {{who hated}} the British rule of Ireland, {{and worked for}} a peasant {{revolution}} to overthrow British rule and secure Irish independence. He escaped arrest and fled to the United States in 1848, where he <b>reversed</b> his political <b>beliefs.</b> He became disgusted with American republicanism and democracy, and became intensely conservative in his politics and in his religious support for the Pope. He moved to Canada in 1857 and worked hard to convince the Irish Catholics {{to cooperate with the}} Protestant British in forming a Confederation that would make for a strong Canada in close alliance with Britain. His fervor for Confederation garnered him the title: 'Canada's first nationalist'. He fought the Fenians in Canada, who were Irish Catholics who hated the British and resembled his younger self politically. McGee succeeded in helping create the Canadian Confederation in 1867, but was assassinated by Fenian Elements in 1868.|$|R
40|$|Almost 80 % of South African {{citizens}} are of black African origin, yet are significantly underrepresented in numerous leisure activities and especially at national parks: they {{accounted for only}} 8. 8 % of visitors to South African parks&# 039; recreational spaces in 2010 / 2011. A review of literature on this issue finds a series of research shortcomings. Using a sample of 466 respondents from Soweto (414 self-administered surveys and 52 in-depth interviews), this paper re-examines the significant barriers deterring black South Africans from visiting national parks. Economic impediments to travel were frequently reported but other previously ignored barriers emerged, including lack of paid holidays, leisure "immobilities" fostered under apartheid, transport issues, time constraints, and lack of understanding and knowledge {{of what to do}} in national parks. All maintain the perception of parks as unwelcome spaces for many black South Africans. While park management is now largely done by black South Africans, and valuable policy statements now exist, the problems remain. The paper suggests potential actions to <b>reverse</b> the common <b>belief</b> that national parks remain exclusive white South African domains, including deconstructing the parks&# 039; historical relationship with oppression, better promotion, specialised tour development, and work with schools. Links are made to comparable situations elsewhere...|$|R
