For two locally compact Tychonoff spaces X and Y, the Stone-Čech <b>remainders</b> (i. e., the <b>remainders</b> of the Stone-Čech compactifications) βX and βY are homeomorphic if and only if the posets K(X) and K(Y) of all Hausdorff compactifications of X and Y are isomorphic...|$|R

40|$|We study {{rational}} <b>remainders</b> {{associated with}} gluon amplitudes in gauge theories coupled to matter in arbitrary representations. We find that these terms depend on {{only a small}} number of invariants of the matter-representation called indices. In particular, rational <b>remainders</b> can depend on the second and fourth order indices only. Using this, we find an infinite class of non-supersymmetric theories in which rational <b>remainders</b> vanish for gluon amplitudes. This class includes all the "next-to-simplest" quantum field theories of arXiv: 0910. 0930. This provides new examples of amplitudes in which rational <b>remainders</b> vanish even though naive power counting would suggest their presence. Comment: 10 + 4 pages.

40|$|A recent {{direction}} within {{belief revision}} theory {{is to develop}} a theory of belief change for the Horn knowledge representation framework. We consider questions related to the complexity aspects of previous work, leading to questions about Horn envelopes (or Horn LUB’s), introduced earlier in the context of knowledge compilation. A characterization is obtained of the <b>remainders</b> of a Horn belief set with respect to a consequence to be contracted, as the Horn envelopes of the belief set and an elementary conjunction corresponding to a truth assignment satisfying a certain body building formula. This gives an efficient algorithm to generate all <b>remainders,</b> each represented by a truth assignment.
