50|$|The planalto foliage-gleaner (Syndactyla dimidiata), {{also known}} as the <b>russet-mantled</b> <b>foliage-gleaner,</b> is a species of bird in the Furnariidae family. It is found in Brazil and Paraguay. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests.|$|E
40|$|<b>Russet-mantled</b> <b>Foliage-gleaner</b> is an {{extremely}} poorly known species, the range of which is centered in the Brazilian Cer-rado, where it inhabits riparian forests. Two subspecies are recognized, but {{the limits of their}} ranges are controversial. Fur-thermore, it was recently suggested that the species {{is one of the few}} in the family Furnariidae to show sexual dichromatism. In this paper we examined the plumage coloration and morphometrics of 33 study skins (85 % of the avail-able specimens). We conclude that the geographic variation and sexual dichromatism reported for S. dimidiata originated from misinterpretation of the plumage variation observed in this species, which is best considered monotypic. We also present natural history data on Russet-mantled Foliage-gleaners and suggest considering it a globally Vulnerable species...|$|E
