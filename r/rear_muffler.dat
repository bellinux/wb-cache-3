50|$|An {{electronically}} controlled <b>rear</b> <b>muffler</b> {{is used to}} {{keep the}} B4 quiet at low road speeds. The pipe that leads into the <b>rear</b> <b>muffler</b> is divided in two, with one pipe equipped with a flapper valve. The ECU - working with an actuator and cable - opens this valve when travelling at medium-to-high road speeds. This increases exhaust gas flow.|$|E

5000|$|The Australian and New Zealand {{models were}} {{significantly}} different from the other Camry models around the world and had around 77% locally developed components to suit Australian and New Zealand roads and driving conditions. The brakes, body panels (which would only fit on the Australian made body and chassis), headlights, seats, radio antenna and suspension were all locally developed after 10,000 km of extensive testing in New Zealand under the supervision of Toyota engineers.

5000|$|Replacing the 2.7-litre 'biturbo' V6 {{engine of}} the {{previous}} generation B5 S4, the new B6 S4 powertrain gained an all-aluminium alloy 4.2-litre, 40 valve (five valves per cylinder) V8 engine (parts code prefix: 079.C, identification code: BBK), with chain-driven double overhead camshafts, roller-finger rocker arm cam followers, and included variable inlet camshaft timing. It also utilised a strengthened alloy crankshaft bedplate for the five main bearings, and a two-part baffled oil sump, and a light-alloy variable intake manifold (VIM), containing the fractionally sequentially actuated fuel injectors. This petrol engine, based on the unit from the Audi A8, displaces , and it produces a motive power output of [...] at 7,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), and generates torque of 410 Nm at 3,500 rpm, making it more potent than the RS2 Avant, and nearly as powerful as the B5 RS4. Engine management was {{by way of a}} Bosch Motronic ME 7.1.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), utilising a Bosch 'E-Gas' drive by wire electronic throttle, and powering eight individual spark coils with longlife quad-electrode Bosch spark plugs. Ignition timing is a mapped direct ignition, with cylinder-selective knock control with the aid of four knock sensors.
