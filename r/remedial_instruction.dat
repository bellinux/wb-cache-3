40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} ongoing {{research in}} the development of speech technologies that strives to raise the efficacy of computer-aided pronunciation training, especially for Chinese learners of English. Our approach is grounded on the theory of language transfer and involves a systematic phonological comparison between the primary language (L 1 being Chinese) and secondary language (L 2 being English) to predict possible segmental and suprasegmental realizations that constitute mispronunciations in L 2 English. The predictions are validated based on a specially designed corpus that consists of several hundred hours of L 2 English speech. The speech data supports the development of automatic speech recognition technologies that can detect and diagnose mispronunciations. The diagnosis aims to support the design of pedagogical and <b>remedial</b> <b>instructions,</b> which involves text-tospeech synthesis technologies in audiovisual forms. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to apply an {{integrated}} approach to evaluate the English reading performances among college students because finding the optimal teaching strategy for an individual student is difficult. The unified English reading exam with forty questions was used to clarify the different performances between day-time and extension classes which have thirty-eight students and thirty-seven students, respectively. The GSP (Grey Student-Problem) chart, which includes the equation of Rasch model, was then generated by coding the data into the S-P (Student-Problem) chart, and using the GRA (Grey Relational Analysis) method. The results indicate that the teachers could provide adaptive teaching methods and <b>remedial</b> <b>instructions</b> based on the graphic models. Also, parents could understand their children’s learning conditions better by reading the clear graphs. We suggested that the GSP chart can not only be applied to the educational field, but also be used in real-life applications, like medical data analysis, engineering, or decision-making fields...|$|R

40|$|This work aims {{to derive}} salient mispronunciations made by Chinese (L 1 being Cantonese) {{learners}} of English (L 2 being American English) {{in order to}} support the design of pedagogical and <b>remedial</b> <b>instructions.</b> Our approach is grounded on the theory of language transfer and involves systematic phonological comparison between two languages to predict possible phonetic confusions that may lead to mispronunciations. We collect a corpus of speech recordings from some 21 Cantonese learners of English. We develop an automatic speech recognizer by training cross-word triphone models based on the TIMIT corpus. We also develop an “extended ” pronunciation lexicon that incorporates the predicted phonetic confusions to generate additional, erroneous pronunciation variants for each word. The extended pronunciation lexicon is used to produce a confusion network in recognition of the English speech recordings of Cantonese learners. We refer to the statistics of the erroneous recognition outputs to derive salient mispronunciations that stipulates the predictions based on phonological comparison.

A number of reading programs and initiatives {{have been developed to}} address this issue, including programs based on increasing boys' motivation, improving behaviour, embracing the use of computers, and so forth. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the hypothesis that effective <b>remedial</b> reading <b>instruction</b> is equally effective for boys as well as girls. The sample comprised 398 low-progress students (239 boys, 159 girls) in Years 5 and 6, who attended an off-site tutorial centre for two school terms between the years 2005 and 2010. All boys and girls in the sample participated in the Schoolwise Program, a non-categorical, empirically-based reading program, for three hours daily. Participants were assessed pre- and post- intervention on five reading and related measures. Both boys and girls made substantial gains, analyses of covariance confirming that their rates of progress were very similar. Small effect sizes were also reported. It is concluded that boys and girls do not require different forms of reading instruction if both are provided with effective systematic <b>remedial</b> reading <b>instruction.</b> 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the performance of senior secondary students of the secondary schools in the province of Biliran, Philippines in the national achievement test and to examine whether non-intellective variables significantly influenced the achieved ratings of the said test. Sixteen (16) secondary schools were involved in the study comprising eight (8) municipalities and 1, 470 student-respondents who took the test. It used the descriptive method where it described the data obtained from the survey. The performance of the senior students in the national achievement test was above average.

Young and female examinees performed better than their counterpart in the achievement test. Big secondary schools performed better than the small secondary schools while vocational secondary schools achieved better than the national secondary schools in the said test. Considering age and gender of senior students as determinants influencing achievement results, it is recommended that special classes and <b>remedial</b> <b>instructions</b> for the low achievers should be provided by the concerned school principals and administrators.
