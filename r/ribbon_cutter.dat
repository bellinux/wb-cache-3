25|$|The Labor Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, was to {{open the}} bridge by cutting a ribbon at its {{southern}} end. However, just as Lang was about to cut the ribbon, a man in military uniform rode in on a horse, slashing the ribbon with his sword and opening the bridge {{in the name of}} the people of New South Wales before the official ceremony began. He was promptly arrested. The ribbon was hurriedly retied and Lang performed the official opening ceremony. The uninvited <b>ribbon</b> <b>cutter</b> was Francis de Groot, a member of a right-wing paramilitary group called the New Guard, opposed to Lang's leftist policies and resentful of the fact that a member of the Royal Family had not been asked {{to open the}} bridge.|$|E

5000|$|The 1929 {{bridge was}} 850 ft in length, {{consisting}} of eleven 80 ft spans. The construction used [...] {{of dirt and}} [...] of steel. Planning for the span took about five years to hammer out the details between the two states. Setbacks during construction included flooding of the coffer dams used {{in the building of}} the piers that supported the bridge. The bridge opened in December 1929, just months after the October 29 stock market crash. The dedication ceremony for the bridge was held on June 6, 1930 and included governors Walter J. Kohler, Sr. of Wisconsin and Fred W. Green of Michigan. The <b>ribbon</b> <b>cutters</b> included Princess Kenoke of the Menominee Tribe.|$|R
50|$|That land sat vacant and overgrowing with kudzu {{for more}} than 20 years. Shortly after the 1990 {{selection}} of Atlanta for the 1996 Olympic Games, Mayor Maynard Jackson brokered a solution allowing the current parkway to be completed out to Ponce de Leon Avenue {{to the north and}} Moreland Avenue to the east. The strip of land further to the east, and land along the new parkway segment, was converted into a linear park with the help of PATH. The 207-acre (84-hectare) Freedom Park was officially dedicated on September 19, 2000 with <b>ribbon</b> <b>cutters</b> Jimmy Carter, then-current Governor Roy Barnes, and Mayor Bill Campbell. Since then it has hosted a number of outdoor sculpture displays and is a popular jogging, bike riding, and dog-walking park.|$|R

40|$|Why should {{economic}} cycles (or "long waves" or "long-term pulsations {{in social}} behaviour") {{have a place}} in the Core Concepts project? Such cycles, surely, are a familiar concept, neither newly emergent nor in need of clarification. In this paper, Marchetti, questions these assumptions. They are called economic cycles, he argues, because they were first discussed by economists but, in fact, economic indicators are not nearly as successful in establishing the existence and nature of such cycles as are "physicals. " So the concept is not so clear after all, but does it have some emergent quality? Does it threaten to change the conversation of applied systems analysis? Yes, says Marchetti, it changes {{the way in which we}} see our client [...] the decision maker. At present, we tend to see the decision maker as the Great Controller, the Great Initiator, but, as we clarify the cycles by using physical rather than economic indications, so we begin to see him more as the <b>Ribbon</b> <b>Cutter.</b> Decision makers are downgraded and become only "the active tendrils of Big Brother, the System. ...|$|E
