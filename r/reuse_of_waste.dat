This {{is due to the fact}} that domestic waste which is reused is essentially removed from the waste stream. This study adopted a quantitative approach and aimed at describing suburban communities’ attitudes and behaviour towards the <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>waste.</b> The investigation was non-experimental, cross-sectional and descriptive. Residents of three suburbs in the Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni area were surveyed by means of a structured questionnaire through a simple random sampling method. The outcome of the study showed that residents’ reused domestic waste; received much <b>of</b> their domestic <b>reuse</b> information from the media as opposed to environmental health practitioners or government departments and felt that the <b>reusing</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>waste</b> was a positive activity that would help future generations.

40|$|Western Australia (WA) is {{considered}} as a major mining jurisdiction because of its lucrative mining. The state holds large reserves of mineral deposits including iron and gold ores. The treatment processes of the ores are associated with large volumes <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> generation. Some <b>of</b> the <b>wastes</b> are mine tailings, waste rocks, fly ashes, and slags.

40|$|Although {{much has}} been written on how to improve the {{management}} <b>of</b> construction <b>waste</b> and increase the use of recycled materials, little progress has been made to address the <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>waste.</b> Yet there is a consensus in the literature that waste reuse practices have a decisive role to play in improving reduction <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> and that institutional barriers are the most problematic obstacles to implementing identified reuse strategies. This paper examines the literature from the last 10 years on the issues facing different stakeholders around <b>reuse</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>waste</b> in Australia, and the causes and effects of the institutional barriers encountered. Key texts from before this period are also referenced. The findings reveal that institutional impediments are related to problems outside of the construction industry, such as social, economic and political barriers to change.
