5|$|The North American <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. The mammal {{was identified as}} a species of otter and has a variety of common names, including North American <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> northern <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> common otter and, simply, <b>river</b> <b>otter.</b> Other documented common names are American otter, Canada otter, Canadian otter, fish otter, land otter, nearctic <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> and Prince of Wales otter.|$|E
5|$|The right lung of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> {{is larger}} than the left, having four lobes {{compared}} with two for the left. Reduced lobulation of the lungs is presumed to be adaptive for underwater swimming. In addition, the length of the trachea of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is intermediate between that of terrestrial carnivores and marine mammals. The mean tracheal length of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is , or 23.2% of the body length. A shorter trachea may improve air exchange and increase lung ventilation in diving mammals.|$|E
5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> the southern <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> and the marine otter. (The North American <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E

40|$|Populations of North American <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> (Lontra canadensis) {{declined}} throughout {{large portions}} of the continent during the early 1900 s due to habitat degradation and unregulated trapping. <b>River</b> <b>otters</b> had been extirpated in North Dakota (ND), but the Red River Valley has since been recolonized, with potential source populations including the neighboring states of Minnesota or South Dakota, or the Canadian province of Manitoba (MB). We genotyped 9 microsatellite loci in 121 samples to determine the source population of <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> in the Red River Valley of ND, {{as well as to}} assess population structure and diversity of <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> in central North America. Overall, genetic diversity was high, with an average observed heterozygosity of 0. 58. Genetic differentiation was low (FST < 0. 05) between <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> in ND and those of Minnesota, suggesting that eastern ND was recolonized by <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> from Minnesota. <b>River</b> <b>otters</b> from MB were genetically distinct from all other sampled populations. Low genetic differentiation (FST = 0. 044) between South Dakota and Louisiana (LA) suggested that reintroductions using LA stock were successful. The genetic distinctiveness of <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> from different geographic regions should be considered when deciding on source populations for future translocations...|$|R
50|$|Brown {{coached the}} Missouri <b>River</b> <b>Otters</b> of the UHL during the 2005-06 season, {{replacing}} head coach Kevin Kaminski, {{who was fired}} after the team began {{the season with a}} 11-27-3 record. Under Brown, the <b>River</b> <b>Otters</b> improved, going 13-18-4, however, the club failed to make the playoffs. After the season, the <b>River</b> <b>Otters</b> folded.|$|R
5|$|The <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{are more}} obtainable by the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> {{during the spring}} and summer as a result of breeding activity, appropriate temperatures, and water supply for the prey.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> can be deduced by {{analyzing}} either scat {{obtained in the}} field, or gut contents removed from trapped otters.|$|E
50|$|The <b>River</b> <b>Otters</b> also boasted veteran NHL'ers like Jim Montgomery, Dennis Vial, and Lonnie Loach, {{who wore}} #33 {{and is the}} only person to have his number retired with the Missouri <b>River</b> <b>Otters.</b>|$|R

50|$|Loach {{came out}} of {{retirement}} for the 2005-2006 season with the <b>River</b> <b>Otters,</b> skating in 21 games with the team before retiring again in 2006. He had his #33 retired by the <b>River</b> <b>Otters,</b> the only player to have his number retired by the team.|$|R
5|$|Communication among North American river otters is {{accomplished}} mainly by olfactory and auditory signals. Scent marking is imperative for intergroup communication. The <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> scent-marks with feces, urine, and possibly anal sac secretions. Musk from the scent glands {{may also be}} secreted when otters are frightened or angry.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park also {{provides}} habitats for eastern woodland mammals. Black bear and white-tailed deer inhabit the woods, as do Virginia opossum, raccoon, American mink, muskrat, North American <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> fox, and bobcats. The endangered red wolf has been reintroduced to eastern North Carolina, including Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 {{terrestrial}} vertebrate {{species and}} 28 fish species. The most common large animals are mule deer and elk, but other mammals present include moose, black bears, cougar, coyote, yellow-bellied marmot, beaver, porcupine, Canadian lynx, mountain goat, pika, <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> muskrat, pronghorn, mink, bobcat, marten, and timber wolves.|$|E

50|$|Raccoon (Procyon lotor) {{tracks and}} scats abound on all divisions. Their sign most often appears {{along the edges}} of tidal creeks and salt pannes, where they search for green crabs and small fish. Care must be taken to {{distinguish}} raccoon sign from that of <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> (Lutra canadensis), another mammal that forages extensively in the marshes. <b>River</b> <b>otters</b> are observed infrequently in the salt hay {{along the edges of}} tidal creeks. Most recently, <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> were seen in the Merriland River and Branch Brook in the Upper Wells Division.|$|R

5|$|Records of otters preying upon beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it {{has been}} {{reported}} in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba. Trappers in Alberta, Canada commonly assert otters are major predators of beavers. A 1994 <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> study reported findings of beaver remains in 27 of 1,191 scats analyzed. However, many other studies did not report any findings of beaver remains in the scat sampled.|$|E
5|$|Small mammal {{species that}} inhabit along the trails are beaver, squirrel, <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> chipmunk, porcupine, bobcat, {{two species of}} fox, boar, woodchuck, raccoon, and coyote. Bird species that reside in the trails are wild turkey, ruffed grouse, {{mourning}} dove, raven, two species of eagle, wood duck, three species of owl, and three species of hawk as well as warblers.|$|E
5|$|The North American <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is {{considered}} a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List, as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> populations had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas. Reintroduction projects have been particularly valuable in restoring populations {{in many areas of}} the United States. However, river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States. Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places, the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives. Reintroduction of river otters may present a problem in that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.|$|E

5|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} {{growing in the}} {{riparian}} zones along the Rogue River include willows, red alder, white alder, black cottonwood, and Oregon ash. A few of the common animal and bird species seen along the river are American black bear, North American <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> black-tailed deer, bald eagle, osprey, great blue heron, water ouzel, and Canada goose.|$|E
5|$|A highly active predator, the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> has {{adapted to}} hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. <b>River</b> <b>otter</b> pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E

5|$|Aquatic life ties North American <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|R
5|$|Fish are {{the primary}} {{component}} of the river otter's diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year. However, river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by river otters includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.|$|E
5|$|Otters do not {{dramatically}} reduce prey {{populations in}} the wild, generally speaking. When a copious supply of food dwindles or other prey becomes available, otters either transfer to a new location or convert their dietary choices to the most adequate prey. When left unchecked, though, otter depredations can be quite significant under certain circumstances (e.g. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other escape options). Resolution of such conflicts will usually require removal and/or relocation of nuisance otters. Even in larger bodies of water, they may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, low-flow, or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even such fast-swimming species as trout become lethargic in extremely cold water, with a commensurate increase in their vulnerability to predation. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> the deciding factor whether the <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> can establish itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish.|$|E
5|$|The North American <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} North America, inhabiting inland waterways and coastal areas in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic states, and the Gulf of Mexico. River otters also currently inhabit coastal regions throughout the United States and Canada. North American river otters also inhabit the forested {{regions of the}} Pacific coast in North America. The species is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, and the north slope of the Brooks Range.|$|E

5|$|Mammals {{are rarely}} {{consumed}} by <b>river</b> <b>otters,</b> {{and are not}} a major dietary component. Mammals preyed upon by otters are characteristically small or are a type species found in riparian zones. The few occurrences of mammals found in the <b>river</b> <b>otter's</b> diet include: muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus); meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus); eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus); and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus).|$|R
