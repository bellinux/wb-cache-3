When estradiol (E 2) -treated animals were fasted for 4 – 5 days, {{the activity of the}} GnRH pulse generator was gradually suppressed, and the volley interval at the end of fasting was significantly prolonged, compared with that during the feeding period (67. 4 vs. 49. 3 min, n � 5, P � 0. 01). On the other hand, such a significant effect on the pulse generator was not observed in OVX goats.

40|$|Static <b>recording</b> <b>characteristic</b> of super-resolution {{near-field}} {{structure with}} antimony (Sb) is investigated in this paper. The recording marks are observed by a {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), a high-resolution optical microscopy with a CCD camera and an atomic force microscopy (AFM). The super-resolution mechanism is also analyzed based on these static recording marks. Results show that the light reaching on recording layer is composed of two parts, one is the linear transmissive light (propagating field) {{and the other is}} the nonlinear evanescent light in the optical near field. The evanescent light may be greatly enhanced {{in the center of the}} spot because Sb will transit from a semiconductor to a metal when it is melted under the high laser power irradiation. This local melted area in the spot center may be like a metal tip in the optical near field that can collect and enhance the information that is far beyond the diffraction limit, which leads to the super-resolution recording and readout.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{contains}} {{an introduction to}} holography, holographic optical elements and coupled wave theory. Chapter 2 contains a detailed review of dichromated gelatin based on published literature and on experimental observations made during work for this thesis. In Chapter 3 the non-linearity of the <b>recording</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{and changes in the}} bulk properties of the material during processing are determined. In Chapter 4 the non-uniformity of planar gratings is investigated by making a detailed comparison with a coupled wave theory in which the grating parameters are functions of depth. The effect of different processing procedures on these non-uniformities is demonstrated. In Chapter 5 the mechanism behind the formation of real-time gratings in dichromated gelatin is determined by applying a dynamic form of coupled wave theory. The source of diffraction is found to be a pure absorption grating. In Chapter 6 the use of dichromated gelatin as a medium for copying holograms and for recording efficient noise gratings is demonstrated. In Chapter 7 a theoretical model of holographic optical elements based on vectorial coupled wave theory is presented and is used to investigate the effects of polarisation. In Chapter 8 an optical method for the measurement of distance is developed using the dispersive properties of an on-axis holographic lens. Conclusions are then presented in Chapter 9...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{dichromated}} gelatin (DCG) for {{the formation}} of holographic optical elements is investigated. In particular, a study is made of the possible sources of spurious recording and replay in such diffracting media. The formation of spurious gratings due to boundary mismatch, when recording a transmission grating in air, is investigated. Experimental results are treated using a simple linear theory which is capable of predicting the relative modulation strengths of each of six recorded gratings. The efficiencies of each of these gratings is related to Fresnel's Laws of reflection and therefore the beam ratio. A brief experimental study of the beam ratio is made. It is found that linear theories do not explain replay of gratings recorded at high exposure energies. This is because DCG exhibits a saturating <b>recording</b> <b>characteristic.</b> A theoretical model is developed to verify experimental results of modulation versus exposure energy for the recording of single and double exposure transmission gratings and their subsequent harmonics. This gives good agreement for most cases, however, it does not explain fully the replay of a difference grating formed due to nonlinearities in the double exposure hologram. A coupled wave theory is therefore developed to take account of both multiple grating interactions between the two primary recordings and the recording of a third grating with a spatial frequency equal to the difference of the two fundamental frequencies. The model gives good agreement with experimental results for varying replay angles and wavelengths. DCG is finally used as a tool to investigate the formation of noise gratings in silver halide emulsions. In particular, results are presented for experiments which were performed to study the effect of high angular scatter upon the selectivity of the noise grating and the recording of reflection noise gratings...|$|E

40|$|Please {{be advised}} that this {{information}} was generated on 2016 - 03 - 03 and {{may be subject to}} change. The <b>recording</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the monopolar needle in three dimensions have not been well established. A simple spherical recording territory is commonly assumed with the very tip proposed to have a greater spatial recording sensitivity by some authors. We demonstrate by enlarged physical modeling in a homogeneous volume conductor that the recorded amplitude diminishes more gradually radially away from the conical surface than distally past the tip or proximal to the insulation edge. The sensitivity over the exposed metallic surface is found to be uniformly proportional to the area, which results in relatively less sensitivity at the tip than the middle and proximal portions of the conical recording surface. The overall spatial amplitude re cording characteristics can be better described by an apple shape than a sphere, centered at the midportion of the exposed conical surface. A better appreciation of the actual spatial <b>recording</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the monopolar needle electrode can result in more accurate physiologic interpretations of quantitative motor unit analysis. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
