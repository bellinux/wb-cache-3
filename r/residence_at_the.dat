5|$|After the war started, the FBB {{provided}} wider security {{protection for}} Hitler when in <b>residence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Berghof, as he travelled by vehicle to front-line command posts and at military headquarters.

The FBK would ride with Hitler and the RSD men would ride in a separate car during the trips.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to foreign dignitaries, the President's Guest House {{has traditionally been}} made available by the outgoing President of the United States to the President-elect in the five days prior to his inauguration.

5|$|Flanagan's first {{concert was}} around 1945, with trombonist Frank Rosolino. Given Flanagan was only around 15 {{years old at}} the time, he could not stay in the bar area of the club; between sets, therefore, he went to another room and did some homework. As a teenager, he played in a band led by Lucky Thompson that also {{contained}} Pepper Adams and Kenny Burrell. Still in his teens, Flanagan also sat in on piano for some appearances by Charlie Parker in Detroit. During 1949, Flanagan had his first <b>residence,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Blue Bird Inn in Detroit. In 1950 he played with Rudy Rutherford, until the clarinetist returned to the Count Basie band. Flanagan then played jazz and rhythm and blues with saxophonist George Benson in Toledo, before being drafted into the army in 1951.|$|E
5|$|He then {{returned}} to academia, taking up <b>residence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Chicago Law School from 1977 to 1982, though he spent one year as a visiting professor at Stanford Law School. During Scalia's time at Chicago, Peter H. Russell hired him {{on behalf of the}} Canadian government to write a report on how the United States was able to limit the activities of its secret services for the McDonald Commission, which was investigating abuses by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The report – finished in 1979 – encouraged the commission to recommend that a balance be struck between civil liberties and the essentially unchecked activities of the RCMP. In 1981, he became the first faculty adviser for the University of Chicago's chapter of the newly founded Federalist Society.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Han was the {{founding}} President of the Sculpture Society (Singapore), and remains its Honorary President.

The project, sponsored by the Asia Pacific Breweries Foundation Inspire Programme, was intended to provide sculptors and installation artists with studio space and a chance to interact with the public in a park environment. Han {{was a member of the}} Fourth Singapore Note and Coin Advisory Committee between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2011, where her duties included advising the Monetary Authority of Singapore on designs for new currency.|$|E

5|$|The Montreal Forum, {{which in}} later decades became {{synonymous with the}} Canadiens, was opened in 1924 to house the {{expansion}} Montreal Maroons. The Canadiens were invited to inaugurate the arena as the natural ice surface at the Mount Royal Arena {{was not ready to}} host NHL games. The team played the first game in Forum history on November 29, 1924, a 7–1 victory over the Toronto St. Patricks. The Canadiens took <b>residence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Forum in 1926, sharing it with the Maroons until the latter ceased operations in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The Yorkist Edward IV gave Farleigh Hungerford Castle to {{his brother}} Richard, then Duke of Gloucester, in 1462. Edward and Richard's brother George Plantagenet may have taken up <b>residence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> castle; his {{daughter}} Margaret was certainly born there. Richard became king in 1483 and gave the castle to John Howard, the Duke of Norfolk. Meanwhile, the late Robert's youngest son, Sir Walter, had become a close supporter of Edward IV; nonetheless, he joined the failed revolt of 1483 against Richard and ended up detained in the Tower of London. When Henry Tudor invaded England in 1485, Walter escaped custody and joined the invading Lancastrian army, fighting alongside Henry at the Battle of Bosworth. Victorious, the newly crowned Henry VII returned Farleigh Hungerford to Walter in 1486.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} at the Paley Center for Media in New York City on October 20, 2010. It {{was shown in}} conjunction with the Robert M. Batscha University Seminar Series. The Paley Center screening included an online streaming broadcast—the first simultaneous film screening and panel question-and-answer for online and local audiences. The panel discussion was moderated by The New York Times journalist Noam Cohen, and featured both co-directors, in addition to Wikimedia Foundation representative Samuel Klein and Wikipedian in <b>Residence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> British Museum Liam Wyatt. After the event, SnagFilms subsequently made the film available for free for six days to viewers in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Their {{income was}} modest, with George's small per annum living; Cassandra brought the {{expectation}} of a small inheritance {{at the time of}} her mother's death to the marriage. They took up temporary <b>residence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1970s, Glenmalure Park {{regularly}} hosted attendances in {{the region}} of 20,000 people, but as the majority of the Irish public turned its back on Irish football, those numbers declined and despite winning the League of Ireland four times in succession in the 1980s, the attendances for the period averaged approximately a quarter of that figure. The sale of the stadium contributed to a further decline in support. During the homeless years, particularly those spent on the Northside, attendances continued to fall with the exception of those recorded during the club's <b>residence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> RDS, which included an opening attendance of 22,000. Prior to the relocation to Tallaght, the club's support base had been reduced to a hardcore group of over a thousand people. It currently includes approximately 2,700 season ticket holders.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War began, Bax {{moved to}} Sussex, taking up <b>residence</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White Horse Hotel, Storrington, {{where he lived}} {{for the rest of}} his life. He {{abandoned}} composition and completed a book of memoirs about his early years, Farewell, My Youth. The Times found it at times waspish, at times reticent, surprising in parts, and regrettably short. Later in the war Bax was persuaded to contribute incidental music for a short film, Malta G. C.; he subsequently wrote music for David Lean's Oliver Twist (1948) and a second short film, Journey into History (1952). His other works from the period include the short Morning Song for piano and orchestra, and the Left-Hand Concertante (1949), both written for Cohen. Bax and the Poet Laureate, John Masefield, worked on a pageant, The Play of Saint George in 1947, but the project was not completed.|$|E
