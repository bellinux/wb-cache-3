5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles <b>rotate</b> <b>forward</b> 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E

50|$|Though {{shift work}} itself remains {{necessary}} in many occupations, employers can alleviate {{some of the}} negative health consequences of shift work. The United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends employers avoid quick shift changes and any rotating shift schedules should <b>rotate</b> <b>forward.</b> Employers should also attempt to minimize the number of consecutive night shifts, long work shifts and overtime work. A poor work environment can exacerbate the strain of shift work. Adequate lighting, clean air, proper heat and air conditioning, and reduced noise can all make shift work more bearable for workers.|$|E
50|$|The Che-25 has a flat sided, {{two step}} hull formed from a vacuum moulded {{fibreglass}} sandwich. The integral fin forms a cruciform tail with a swept, tapered, straight edged fin initially carried a balanced rudder, though the Che-25M variant with its higher tailplane abandoned the balance. The underwing cabin has dual controls and is entered via gull wing doors. There is a water rudder attached just aft {{of the rear}} step. The optional land undercarriage has mainwheels on mid-fuselage mounted legs, which <b>rotate</b> <b>forward</b> through 90° to allow water landings, and a tailwheel fixed to the water rudder.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic problem}} {{inherent}} in rotor design {{is the difference}} in airspeed for the advancing and retreating blades. Among the many effects this causes is one of interest; the blades <b>rotate</b> <b>forward</b> and backward around the hub as drag increases and decreases. Consider a blade as it reaches {{the rear of the}} aircraft and starts to rotate forward; during this time the relative airspeed starts increasing rapidly, and the blade is pushed further and further back by the increasing drag. This force is absorbed in a drag bearing. During the brief period while it rotates around this bearing, the overall speed of the blade is decreased, slightly offsetting the speed due to forward motion.|$|E

50|$|The {{ornithopter}} obtains thrust by flapping its wings. When {{the wing}} flaps, {{as opposed to}} gliding, it continues to develop lift as before, but the lift is <b>rotated</b> <b>forward</b> to provide a thrust component.|$|R

50|$|Males {{have been}} {{reported}} as large as 250 kg; their average weight is about 126 kg. Males can be 2 meters long. Females are between 30-50 kg on average, and can be as long as 1.5 meters. Pups are 3.3-3.9 kg on average, and between 40 and 55 cm long. At 290 days old males are about 14.1 kg, and females are about 12.6 kg. They have external ears and hind flippers that <b>rotate</b> <b>forward,</b> which visibly distinguish them from other seals. They have a pointy nose with long pale whiskers. The fur seals are covered by two layers of fur. The coat is grey-brown on their back, and lighter on their belly. Some have white tips on longer upper hairs, which can give them a silver-like appearance.|$|E
50|$|Flap back or {{blowback}} is {{a phenomenon}} affecting the rotor of a helicopter as it overcomes dissymmetry of lift through flapping. In forward flight, rotor blades experience more lift as they <b>rotate</b> <b>forward.</b> This increased lift {{is a result of}} an increased relative speed causing the blade to flap up and decrease its angle of attack. As the blade continues to rotate, it achieves its maximum upflapping displacement over the nose of the aircraft and maximum downflapping displacement over the tail. This results in the rotor disk being tilted to the rear and is referred to as flap back, as if the rotor disk had flapped or tilted back, or {{as if it had been}} blown back by the relative wind. The effect is more pronounced at higher airspeeds but more easily recognized as the aircraft accelerates to translational lift airspeeds from a hover. Flap back results in a slowing of the aircraft and the pilot counters the effect by applying forward input to the cyclic control.|$|E
50|$|As {{the bullet}} {{travelled}} {{down the barrel}} after firing, it eventually passed a hole drilled {{in the bottom of}} the barrel known as a port. The hot gasses behind the bullet flow into the port and push down on a plug, marked p in the diagrams. This causes the plug to pop out of the hole with some velocity. The plug is attached to one end of a short lever, l, the other end of the lever is connected to a hinge below the barrel. The motion of the plug causes the entire lever to rotate down and to the rear, around the hinge point. This action is essentially front-to-back version of the typical back-to-front motion of a lever action rifle. The end point of this motion can be seen in the lower diagram, with the lever having traveled through an arc of about 160 degrees. A spring located at the hinge is compressed by this motion, and eventually causes the lever to <b>rotate</b> <b>forward</b> again, forcing the plug back into the port and holding it there when it is not in motion.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of VVT is cam-phasing, {{whereby the}} phase {{angle of the}} camshaft is <b>rotated</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards relative to the crankshaft. Thus the valves open and close earlier or later; however, the camshaft lift and duration cannot be altered with a cam-phasing system.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{begins when}} {{dramatic}} drum beats starts to play. Orchestral music starts {{to play as}} the top spin rotates backwards and the main gondola locks in position nearing the top. The ride <b>rotates</b> <b>forwards</b> and unlocks the gondola, inverting it {{two to three times}} as water bomb effects blast out. The top spin continues <b>rotating</b> <b>forward</b> and stops as the gondola locks in position at the top. The top spin slowly tips over as fire burst in the surrounding water and giant ancient head in front. Again, the top spin repeats the first section of the cycle while hasher fire and water bomb effects go on. The gondola inverts another five to six times until the music stops and you are let down.|$|R
50|$|The special pedal cranks allowed both pedals to be <b>rotated</b> <b>forward</b> so {{that the}} pedals would form motorcycle-style {{footrests}} in normal operation. To engage the pedals, the left-hand pedal crank could be <b>rotated</b> <b>forward</b> and locked and a drive gear engaged allowing the user to pedal. A short chain connected the pedal drive to the main engine-chain drive system. Pedalling was hard work for the rider: there was no freewheel and the pedal gearing was very low. The engine could be started with pedal drive engaged, causing the pedals to rotate under engine power when the bike was in gear. In practice, the cam and shaft arrangement to engage the pedals frequently seized (in normal operation, a rider would very rarely engage pedal-drive as it was less tiring to push than to pedal).|$|R
5000|$|When {{the first}} {{attempts}} were made to replace leather with modern materials it was found that early plastics simple had too little flex to allow the boot to be built in the same manner. Generally the shells would be so stiff that they could not be opened sideways along the tongue, making it very difficult to enter the boot. New plastics introduced in the 1960s offered the required amount of flexibility to get into them, but when buckled closed they offered almost no forward flex. This made walking very awkward, reduced the feel of the ski on the snow, and made the impacts between the boot and calf painful. Bob Lange solved this problem by splitting the boot into two parts, one over the foot with an overlap closure to seal out snow, and another for the lower leg. These were joined together with rivets at the ankles to allow the upper cuff to <b>rotate</b> <b>forward.</b> At the same time, Henke's first plastic boots used a three-piece shell, with an open tub for the foot, a hinged cuff, and an external [...] "shell-tongue" [...] to close and seal the lower section.|$|E
30|$|However, {{in studies}} {{which showed that}} OP itself {{experiences}} physiological growth-related changes, Chang et al. [21] found that the occlusal plane tended to <b>rotate</b> <b>forward</b> due to growth in patients with normal occlusion, and Vukusic et al. [31] also described that the angle between OP and cranial base decreased from 19.75 ° to 16.44 ° in patients between 10 and 18  years old. The {{study also found that}} the changes seem to be different among different skeletal configurations [2]. Thus, the effect of growth on the change of the occlusal plane angle between each group in this study needs to be taken into consideration.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a most unusual aircraft, called the Tiltrotor XV- 15, which combines the versatility of the helicopter with {{the characteristics of a}} conventional aircraft. Two large, three-bladed propellers are mounted at the tips of the wings. For takeoff, the propellers and their engines are rotated 90 degrees, and the XV- 15 can climb vertically into the air as a helicopter. When the vehicle is off the ground, propellers and engines <b>rotate</b> <b>forward,</b> and the lift is transferred from the propellers to the wings. As a conventional aircraft, the Tiltrotor can cruise for more than two hours. Operating as a vertical-takeoff aircraft, the XV- 15 can fly twice as fast as a helicopter and deliver payloads on half the fuel when traveling distances greater than 185 kilometers. The results of {{the first three years of}} flight-testing are discussed, taking into account the relationship of rotor vibrations and/or air turbulence to resonance of a section of the Tiltrotor's wing...|$|E
