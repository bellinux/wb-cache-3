The second radar set was emplaced on the <b>rear</b> <b>main</b> battery gun director. The Seetakt sets operated at 368megacycles, initially at 14kW, though the sets were upgraded to operate at 100kW, on the 80cm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|Roma {{was damaged}} again by two bombs in another raid on 2324 June. One hit the ship aft and to {{starboard}} of the <b>rear</b> <b>main</b> battery turret and obliterated several staterooms, which were promptly flooded from broken piping. The second landed atop the rear turret itself, but little damage was suffered {{due to the}} heavy armor in that location. This attack did not seriously damage Roma or cause any flooding, but she nevertheless sailed to Genoa for repairs. Roma reached the city on 1 July, and returned to La Spezia, on 13 August, once repairs were complete.|$|E

500|$|The wing {{leading edges}} were swept {{back to a}} point inline with the engine nacelles, while the {{trailing}} edges were angled forward slightly. The wing contained two 700L (190US gal) fuel tanks between the inner wing main spars, while {{at the head of}} the main spar the oil coolers were fitted. Between the outer spars, a second pair of reserve fuel tanks were located, carrying an individual capacity of 910L (240US gal) of fuel. The outer trailing edges were formed by the ailerons and flaps, which were met by smooth wing tips which curved forward into the leading edge. The outer leading edge sections were installed in the shape of a curved [...] "strip nosed" [...] rib, which was positioned ahead of the main spar.

The bombers scored five hits in an almost straight line on the starboard side, parallel to the centerline. Three of the bombs were [...] armor-piercing bombs, {{and the other two}} were [...] high-explosive bombs. One of the 227kg bombs hit the deck just forward of the starboard 15cm twin turret next to the conning tower. It passed through the upper and middle decks before exploding on the main armored deck, which contained the blast. The joints with the torpedo bulkhead were weakened enough to cause leaking. The second 227kg bomb fell forward of the <b>rear</b> <b>main</b> battery turret and penetrated the first two decks. It also exploded on the armored deck and tore a small hole in it. The explosion caused splinter damage and disabled the ammunition hoists for the 37mm anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Brest, Gneisenau {{was the subject}} of repeated British air raids. The first attack took place on the night of 30–31 March, and a second occurred on 4–5 April. During the second raid, a [...] armor-piercing (AP) bomb narrowly missed the ship. As a result of the attacks, the ship was moved out of the dry dock and moved to the harbor. On 6 April, the ship was attacked by British torpedo bombers, which managed to score a single hit. The Bristol Beaufort that struck the ship was piloted by Flying Officer Kenneth Campbell. The torpedo struck Gneisenau {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>main</b> battery turret. Some [...] of water flooded the ship and caused a 2degree list to starboard. The flooding also disabled several components of the ship's propulsion system. The explosion caused significant destruction to the side plating as well as the starboard and centerline propeller shafts. The concussive shock also caused widespread damage to the ship's electronic components. A salvage tug came alongside to assist in the pumping effort. Following the attack, Gneisenau returned to the drydock for repairs.|$|E
500|$|The I-3 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. It was provided with differential Frise-type ailerons. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers and the tailskid was made from duralumin. The main gear could be replaced by skis like those fitted to the Polikarpov R-1. The engine's semi-retractable radiator extended below the fuselage behind the <b>rear</b> <b>main</b> gear struts. Two fuel tanks were fitted, the main one in the fuselage, but a small [...] tank, mainly used to start the engine, was in the center section of the upper wing, along with the engine coolant tank. A total of [...] of fuel was carried. Initially the I-3 was fitted with two fixed [...] synchronized Vickers machine guns, but these were later replaced by PV-1 machine guns. A central OP-1 optical gunsight was provided with a KP-5 ring sight offset to starboard. Some aircraft had bomb racks to carry two [...] bombs.|$|E
