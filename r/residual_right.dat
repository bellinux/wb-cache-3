Simply put by Lord Denning, [...] "it is the right for everyone to meet and assemble with his fellows to discuss their affairs and to promote their views". It has traditionally been regarded as a <b>residual</b> <b>right</b> which individuals are free to exercise so long as the law does not preclude them from doing so. According to Dicey, [...] "at no time has there in England been any proclamation of the right to liberty of thought or to freedom of speech, [...] it can hardly be said that our constitution knows of such a thing as any specific right of public meeting". There are no common law rights to hold meetings on public land or in public buildings and the owners of quasi-public spaces such as shopping centres may exclude members of the public. Peaceful meetings may be held on the highway so long as they do not restrict access by other road users.|$|E

Although the blame for this {{abandonment}} is given due to a bridge washout at Cottonwood Creek it is more than likely due to the merger of the Burlington Northern Railroad and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Trains from Enid now run on the Avard sub to Perry, Oklahoma and then [...] "west" [...] to Guthrie. [...] On October 23, 1998, the Surface Transportation Board approved the BNSF Railway request to abandon 42.80 miles of its line of railroad between milepost 73.60 near Fairmont and milepost 116.40 near Guthrie [...] The line was railbanked, and the Oklahoma Department of Transportation was designated as the holder of rights to develop it for trail use. On Feb 19, 2010, a petition was filed by Montoff Transportation, LLC, of Seattle WA, to acquire from BNSF its <b>residual</b> <b>right</b> to reactivate the line and from ODOT its right to develop a trail. The stated purpose at that time was to put the line back in service, and initially to develop portions of it for railcar storage.|$|E

We define the firm as being composed of its assets. We present a theory of costly contracts which emphasizes that contractual rights can be of two types: specific <b>rights</b> and <b>residual</b> <b>rights.</b> When it is too costly to list all specific rights over assets in the contract, it may be optimal to let one party purchase all <b>residual</b> <b>rights.</b> Ownership is the purchase of these <b>residual</b> <b>rights.</b> We show {{that there can be}} costs associated with the wrong allocation of <b>residual</b> <b>rights.</b> Contracts; Horizontal Integration; Theory of the Firm; Vertical Integration...|$|R

Given the incompleteness of the employment contract, <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> of control over labour need to be specified. This paper analyses the allocation of these <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> of control. It is argued that equilibrium employment contracts will tend to give the employer <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> of control over labour, if workers are potential substitutes and give workers <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> of control if workers are complements.

3000|$|Essentially, {{arbitration}} {{works as}} a governance device that overcomes the need to transform a meta-organization into a single firm, allowing parties to benefit from (knowledge) specialization and the more targeted investment incentives vested in a semi-integrated organizational structure. One may argue that arbitration is a [...] "contracting institution" [...] that can constitute a comparative advantage against other contractual arrangements when the coordination of specific assets is center stage (Casella 1996; Antràs 2014). In particular, {{it can be argued}} that arbitration creates and sustains an organizational architecture that allows for contingent investment levels by the owners into the meta-organization. Even though the arbitrator does not have any property rights, he has the competence to ultimately execute the <b>residual</b> <b>right</b> of control and to allocate the <b>residual</b> <b>right</b> of income. Unlike in an ordinary court, an arbitrator is able to do so because he can be understood as an integral part of the architecture of the meta-organization who can observe and assess the investments of the cooperating parties.|$|E

40|$|In 1992, the U. S.

However, if a shipper does not use some of its contracted firm transportation capacity, the pipeline can resell that capacity as interruptible transportation. That is, the pipeline has <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> with respect to firm transportation capacity contracted for by shippers. We demonstrate that these <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> can {{have a significant effect on}} the competitiveness of the secondary market for natural gas transportation.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} notion of {{ownership}} in economics, taking our point of departure in the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach. We criticize the exclusive identification of ownership with <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> to control in this approach, and argue that economic organization may be rendered determinate under complete contracting (contrary to the GHM approach). Crucially, we argue that under complete contracting, some control rights may be appropriable because of measurement and enforcement costs. This holds {{the key to a}} theory of ownership that is not dependent on {{the notion of}} <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> to control, but rather relies on appropriable control rights.

Despite their various legal forms, all these organizational arrangements consist of legally autonomous organizations and hence can be classified as meta-organizations (Gulati et al. 2012). 1 Meta-organizations do not usually have a formal, internal authority because the assets are jointly owned by the participating parties. Thus, no party individually holds the <b>residual</b> <b>right</b> of control. As a consequence, no single party has exclusive authority to determine {{the use of the}} assets (Hart 1995, 30).|$|E

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{property}} rights and monitoring cost explanation for the allocation of residual income and decision rights between the carriers and truck drivers under internal governance. First, by applying the property rights theory, we argue that the structure of <b>residual</b> income <b>rights</b> depends {{on the importance of}} noncontractible (intangible) assets of the truck driver to generate residual surplus. The more important the truck driver's intangible knowledge assets, the more <b>residual</b> income <b>rights</b> should be transferred to him. Second, we controlled for the monitoring costs as an additional explanatory variable of the allocation of <b>residual</b> income <b>rights.</b> According to agency theory, the variable proportion of the driver's income should be higher where monitoring costs are higher. Third, we investigate the relationship between residual income and <b>residual</b> decision <b>rights</b> under internal governance. If the contractual relation is governed by an employment contract, residual decision and <b>residual</b> income <b>rights</b> may be substitutes because, under fiat, a certain incentive effect of the governance structure may result either from the allocation of high-powered incentives or the transfer of <b>residual</b> decision <b>rights</b> to the driver. These hypotheses were tested by using data from the Hungarian trucking industry. The data provide partial support for the hypotheses. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|Co-operative {{firms have}} been the subject of {{criticism}} by many economists, who base their arguments on property rights and agency theory: members do not control management, investments are short term, accumulated investments are below the economic optimum, etc. Nevertheless, many co-operative organisations do function well for their members. An analysis of the assumptions underlying the criticism reveals that this is not generally justified. As it focuses mainly on the functioning of capital markets, it disregards the vertically integrated character of the co-operatives, i. e. that their purpose is to counteract market failures on product markets. For many co-operatives, however, the critique is valid. Individual ownership in the form of tradable <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> is thus motivated in many co-operatives.

After outlining the model, <b>residual</b> <b>rights</b> to cash flows are linked to residual risks. Then, the underlying information sets to cash flows are brought to light, stressing the nurturing factors behind conflicts of interest: bounded rationality, asymmetric information, opportunistic behavior and transaction costs. Next, decision rights and organization forms are included into the frame of the paper. Finally, the core subject section shows how incremental cash flows come in handy to root out conflicts of interest, firstly by disclosing the residual information sets that divide managers, stockholders and creditors and, secondly, by advocating the design of ex~ante restrictive covenants on the uses and sources of incremental expected cash flows. cash flow, conflict of interest, information set, <b>residual</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|R

40|$|The simple view {{of joint}} ventures and venture {{businesses}} {{is that both}} partners will cooperate to maximize their equity value. In reality, however, there is no guaranty that each partner always behaves to maximize {{the value of the}} equity, because partners may have conflicting interests. The unpredictability that the fellow partner will not cooperate will distort your own incentive to cooperate. The combination of equity and monitoring contracts are used to reduce this unpredictability. The goal {{of this paper is to}} describe the game between the partners and to outline good business planning. The straightforward way to reduce the unpredictablity about cooperation of your partner is to obtain the <b>residual</b> <b>right</b> of the corporation. In this scenario you could exclude your partner if he fails to cooperate. The problem will not, however, be solved because a substitute for your partner is usually costly in joint ventures and venture businesses. The threat of exclusion will distort your partners incentive to cooperate. To encourage cooperation, you must minimize both your own unpredictability and your partner's unpredictability. Partners use "monitoring contracts" such as vetoes, to modify the situation where one partner has complete <b>residual</b> <b>right</b> and to share the unpredictability. The optimal way of sharing the unpredictability depends on which partner provides more critical human capital, how strong the bargaining power of each partner is, and how the reputational bond will work for each partner. In this paper, I describe the organizational game of allocating the unpredictability to cooperate. The game is played as follows. The relative value of human capital, the bargaining power of each partner, and the reputational bond are given. The partners negociate the mixture of equity sharing and monitoring contracts under the given conditions. Each partner tends to minimize his own unpredictability too much and, as a consequence, does not maximize his long-term interest. I conclude by describing how the outcome of negotiation could be improved...|$|E

Eventually, the nonsurgical procedures were concluded to be of limited use, and residual anterior sectionectomy of the liver, including the leaking ducts, was planned preoperatively based on volumetric analysis (ratio of estimated hepatic resection volume 22.1 %) because BBF believed to be healed if bile leakage stopped. However, <b>residual</b> <b>right</b> bisectionectomy was actually performed because residual anterior sectionectomy might cause bile leakage although the patient had a risk of the postoperative hepatic failure due to major hepatectomy.
