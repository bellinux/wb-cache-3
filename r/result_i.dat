25|$|Ideally a bowler of John Snow's {{tremendous}} pace {{should be}} used in short spells with adequate rest in between and he is usually more impressive and effective as a <b>result.</b> <b>I</b> knew this as well as he did but much as I wanted to help him, I had to be tough with John. Often I was forced to keep him on for lengthy spells because this was necessary for the team's success.|$|E
500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the book, Spurr said that he {{made no attempt to}} [...] "gloss over the facts, unpalatable though they may be to either side." [...] He added, [...] "The <b>result,</b> <b>I</b> trust, presents more than the story of a ship or a sortie, but offers some insight into the agonizing dilemma of a misguided, courageous people who persisted in continuing a hopeless war." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I collect some recent {{results on the}} {{approximation}} of conservation laws by vanishing viscosity. The exposition is organized as follows. In the first chapter I provide a general introduction to the motivations of my work and a short overview of the <b>results</b> <b>I</b> obtained, I recall the tools and the main ideas involved in the proves, and I give the main references. Chapters 2 and 3 are devoted to present the <b>results</b> <b>I</b> obtained in collaboration with prof. A. Bressan, dealing with the viscous approximation of a scalar conservation law, [10], [11]...|$|R
500|$|One of Hsu's most {{tenacious}} supporters was Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, {{who called}} Hsu [...] "one {{of the best}} 10 people I've met." [...] Later, Rendell said, [...] "Though Norman is my friend and remains so, his failure to appear casts a new light on his assertions regarding the original [...] case. As a <b>result</b> <b>I</b> will follow other elected officials and donate the money he contributed to me to charity." ...|$|E
500|$|In his Wisden obituary, Jardine was {{described}} as one of England's best captains, while Jack Hobbs rated him the second best captain after Percy Fender. Warner {{also said that he}} was a fine captain on and off the field, and in dealing with administrators. In fact, he stated that, [...] "If ever there was a cricket match between England {{and the rest of the}} world and the fate of England depended upon its <b>result,</b> <b>I</b> would pick Jardine as England captain every time." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 2010, Rangel {{was charged}} by the {{committee}} with 13 counts of violating House rules and federal laws. [...] Rangel's lawyers continued to insist {{that he had not}} intentionally violated any law or regulation, had not handed out political favors, and had not misused his office for personal financial gain. [...] Rangel somberly said only this on the day the charges were announced: Sixty years ago, I survived a Chinese attack in North Korea. And as a <b>result</b> <b>I</b> wrote a book that, having survived that, that I haven't had a bad day since. Today I have to reassess that.|$|E

In this report I will state the <b>results</b> <b>I</b> have obtained so far. I will start by giving the <b>results</b> <b>I</b> have obtained concerning Semicomplete Multipartite Digraphs, which is the main research area I have been involved in. I will thereafter state <b>results</b> which <b>I</b> have obtained in other areas of graph theory. Finally I will describe future research plans for the last four semesters of my Ph. D. work...|$|R

500|$|Manson {{stated that}} {{eliminating}} the corporate pressure and indifference, {{as well as}} the band having a relaxed approach to the making of the record was pivotal for a healthy regroup, writing and recording process. [...] "We didn't put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album... We just took our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm sure we would have started getting on each others' nerves. So we did two weeks and then we'd take some time off and then when everybody felt ready we'd get back in [...] again. As a <b>result,</b> <b>I</b> think everybody really enjoyed our time together and really plugged in", she remarked. Never much enjoying being in a studio, Manson relished the record-making process this time around.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} 300 writer Frank Miller said, [...] "The inaccuracies, {{almost all of}} them, are intentional. I took those chest plates and leather skirts off of them for a reason. I wanted these guys to move and I wanted 'em to look good. I knocked their helmets off a fair amount, partly so you can recognize who the characters are. Spartans, in full regalia, were almost indistinguishable except at a very close angle. Another liberty I took was, they all had plumes, but I only gave a plume to Leonidas, to make him stand out and identify him as a king. I was looking for more an evocation than a history lesson. The best <b>result</b> <b>I</b> {{can hope for is}} that if the movie excites someone, they'll go explore the histories themselves. Because the histories are endlessly fascinating." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{acknowledging}} {{the possibility that}} humans may be partially responsible for climate change, Johnson rejects government action to control or limit it - including cap and trade - as ineffective. [...] "When {{you look at the}} amount of money we are looking to spend on global warming — in the trillions — and look at the <b>result,</b> <b>I</b> just argue that the result is completely inconsequential to the money we would end up spending," [...] he said. [...] "We can direct those moneys to other ways that would be much more beneficial to mankind." [...] Johnson has signed the Western Governors' Association resolution, which aims at [...] "collaborative, incentive driven, locally-based solutions," [...] and has advocated for free market solutions to environmental problems. He has stated that he will not [...] "compromise when it comes to clean air, clean land, or clean water." [...] Johnson supports nuclear energy and fossil fuels, but has stated that the government has a role to protect Americans against businesses that would harm human health or property, including environmental harm.|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} songs {{recorded}} for the album were [...] "Any Way The Wind Blows" [...] and [...] "Who Are the Brain Police?" [...] When Tom Wilson heard the latter, {{he realized that}} The Mothers were not merely a blues band. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa wrote [...] "I {{could see through the}} window that he was scrambling toward the phone to call his boss—probably saying: 'Well, uh, not exactly a [...] "white blues band", but... sort of.'" [...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, [...] "he was so impressed he got on the phone and called New York, and as a <b>result</b> <b>I</b> got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book. [...] "It wasn't as if we had a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept." ...|$|E
500|$|Thom Brennaman {{immediately}} {{hailed the}} game {{as one of the}} greatest upsets in the history of sports; Charissa Thompson told coach Jerry Moore that it was [...] "one of the greatest upsets in college football history." [...] Many media outlets described it as one of, if not the greatest, upsets in the history of college football. The win marked the first time an FCS team had beaten a ranked FBS program. [...] Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports wrote that: [...] "This game was supposed to be the prime example of what had gone wrong in money hungry college football. The powers that be had expanded the season a couple years back, adding an extra game so big schools could bring in cream-puff opponents while collecting millions in revenue. Michigan had never played a I-AA opponent in its history. Now we know why, the Wolverines were ducking them. Instead of an easy tune-up for Michigan, Appalachian State leaves with its most profound victory ever and a check for $400,000 that was supposed to be their pay for getting punished." [...] Sports Illustrated writer Stewart Mandel wrote that he felt [...] "utterly unqualified" [...] to put the game into perspective, and said [...] "there's no logical reason whatsoever this should have happened. But it did. And it wasn't the slightest bit fluky." [...] He also expressed disappointment that he would not be able to vote for the Mountaineers in his AP Poll ballot, explaining that [...] "it may well turn out that Michigan was grossly overrated, but all I know is this: There will not be 25 other teams that accomplish more this opening weekend than Appalachian State did Saturday. There won't even be five." [...] Pat Forde of ESPN.com called it [...] "the most astonishing college football <b>result</b> <b>I</b> can remember," [...] saying that [...] "we'll still be talking about it a few decades from now. Especially in the locker rooms of every huge underdog, where they'll say, 'If Appalachian State can beat Michigan, why can't we shock the world, too?.'" [...] He felt the upset was particularly impressive because upsets of such a magnitude do not happen often in college football. The New York Times writer Viv Bernstein called the game [...] "one of the biggest upsets in college football history" [...] and called it [...] "a stunning upset by any measure." [...] The game was the lead story on SportsCenter and was the cover story for the following week's edition of Sports Illustrated; Appalachian State wide receiver Dexter Jackson was featured on the cover, which has the headline [...] "Alltime Upset: Appalachian State Stuns No. 5 Michigan." ...|$|E

2500|$|England {{football}} coach Roy Hodgson said the racism allegations were [...] "the biggest negativity in England... As a <b>result</b> <b>I</b> think we’ve {{lost a lot}} of fans who didn’t come because of a lot of horror stories about how life would be in the Ukraine and Poland." [...] Hodgson added that he had nothing but positive impressions of Poland and Ukraine.|$|E

2500|$|After {{moving his}} {{broadcast}} operation to Palm Beach, Florida {{in the late}} 1990s, Limbaugh railed on his program about high state income tax rates in New York. In the spring of 2009, New York State adopted a temporary income tax surcharge on wealthy individuals, at which time Limbaugh threatened to sell his condominium and leave the city forever. A transcript of the show on Limbaugh's website was titled, [...] "El Rushbo to New York: Drop Dead." [...] New York Governor David Paterson made light of Limbaugh's criticism, saying, “If I knew {{that would be the}} <b>result,</b> <b>I</b> would’ve thought about the taxes earlier.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The way he {{was asked}} to portray Mexicans {{disturbed}} him, so Montalbán, along with Richard Hernandez, Val de Vargas, Rodolfo Hoyos Jr., Carlos Rivas, Tony de Marco and Henry Darrow established the Nosotros ("We") Foundation in 1970 to advocate for Latinos in the movie and television industry. He served as its first president and was quoted as saying: [...] "I received tremendous support, but there also were some negative repercussions. I was accused of being a militant, and as a <b>result</b> <b>I</b> lost jobs." [...] Ironically, he and the Nosotros Foundation were instrumental in taking roles away from Nico Minardos, a Greek-American actor who in the 1970s often played Latino roles because of his appearance and accent. Minardos similarly became outspoken and, according to his agent and others, it cost him a recurring role as a Mexican mayor in an episode of Alias Smith and Jones.|$|E
