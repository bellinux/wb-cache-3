5|$|On March 24, Zahorchak's {{proposal}} for district wide <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> be put before the Allentown School Board. The plan for reform is {{based primarily on}} financial expectations within the district. While {{the plan calls for}} the hiring of new teachers who will not be full-time and not on district payroll, it also calls for the termination of 300+ teachers. Staff members from each of the Allentown School District's schools will attend the meeting in order to overhaul the plan.|$|E

25|$|From late 2005 {{a gradual}} {{reform of the}} lower courts is under way. When passed, the <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> {{transform}} {{the role of the}} County and High Courts, as well as ensuring that the Supreme Court only handles cases which are principal in nature.|$|E

25|$|Other {{issues for}} the session are migration, nuclear disarmament, the MDGs and disabilities and a High-Level {{thematic}} debate, mandated by the General Assembly, on investment in Africa {{and its role in}} achieving development objectives. United Nations Security Council <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> also be an issue, though according to Ashe it will be an uphill battle.|$|E
25|$|A {{constitutional}} referendum {{on a number}} of changes to the constitution was held in Turkey on 12 September 2010. The results showed the majority supported the constitutional amendments, with 58% in favour and 42% against. The changes were aimed at bringing the constitution into compliance with European Union standards. Supporters of Turkish EU membership hope constitutional <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> facilitate the membership process.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, China's {{progress}} in the control of tuberculosis and public-health <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> depend {{on the degree of}} political commitment to address these challenges. In this regard, the indication by Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking at the National People's Congress in March 2006, that public health is a key component of the country's 11th 5-year development plan is very encouraging. He highlighted the need to improve rural and urban health services, making them affordable for all, and specifically mentioned the need to control HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis. With increased governmental commitment and funding to improve public health, China has {{reason to believe that the}} prevalence of tuberculosis and deaths caused by the disease can be halved within the next decade.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), which {{included}} representatives from all countries with Portuguese {{as the official}} language, reached an agreement on the reform of the Portuguese orthography to unify the two standards then in use by Brazil {{on one side and}} the remaining Lusophone countries on the other. This spelling reform went into effect in Brazil on 1 January 2009. In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the President on 21 July 2008 allowing for a 6-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies co-existed. All of the CPLP countries have signed the reform. In Brazil, this <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> be in force as of January 2016. Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries have since begun using the new orthography.|$|E
25|$|While {{this reform}} was {{eventually}} accomplished, other challenges must be surmounted. Mexico's shale {{oil and gas}} development close to the US border is hampered by the activities of organized criminal groups that include the theft of pipeline products and the extortion to companies in the extractive industries, along with lack of adequate infrastructure; overall, this {{has resulted in the}} low economic competitiveness of Mexico's shales in comparison with those across the border in the United States soil. It {{remains to be seen if}} the awaited Mexican energy <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> overcome these drawbacks. Owing to Mexico's weak rule of law and poor success in previous major industry reforms, the legal changes brought about might as well end up worsening the drawbacks in the energy sector and namely in the development of the country's shale resources.|$|E
25|$|The decimalisation {{movement}} even entered fiction. In Anthony Trollope's Palliser novels (and {{more so in}} {{the television}} series based on them), Plantagenet Palliser is a passionate advocate of decimalisation, a cause the other characters seem to find intensely boring. Palliser's scheme would have divided the shilling into ten (presumably revalued) pennies. This would have changed the threepence into 2.5 new pence, the sixpence into fivepence and the half crown into a two shilling, five pence piece. It would also have required the withdrawal and reissuance of the existing copper coinage. At {{the end of the}} fifth book in the series, The Prime Minister, Palliser (now Duke of Omnium) muses that the <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> not be accomplished, since it can only be done by a Chancellor of the Exchequer sitting in the House of Commons, and the Duke now sits in the House of Lords.|$|E

25|$|Mexican state social {{investment}} depends to a {{great extent}} on the profits from oil exports controlled by Pemex as a state monopoly. The leftist political movement National Regeneration Movement has expressed concern that Pemex will be systematically excluded as a commercial competitor by the government. They believe that Pemex's infrastructural decline was due to a deliberate strategy of self-sabotage by the government through lack of reinvestment, and fear that the Mexican oil rent may be taken over by private corporations. The leftist opposition is concerned that energy reform may be a concealed maneuver for privatization. They also worry that laws derived from the constitutional reforms are not explicit in demonstrating that energy <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> avoid having the oil rent be controlled by the private sector. There are questions as to how the Mexican system of public health, education and subsidized transportation (not to mention the newly created presidential fund for retirement and umemployment) would be funded if there is privatization of the oil rent.|$|E
2500|$|Labor has {{supported}} constitutional change {{to become a}} republic since 1991 and has incorporated republicanism into its platform. Labor is currently the only party that proposes a series of plebiscites to restart the republican process. Along with this, Labor spokesperson (and former federal attorney general) Nicola Roxon has previously said that <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> [...] "always fail if we seek to inflict a certain option on the public without their involvement. This time round, the people must shape the debate".|$|E
2500|$|On December 18, 2015, the Western Australian Transport Minister Dean Nalder {{revealed}} sweeping regulatory {{changes to}} ridesharing {{services in the}} state. The <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> require [...] ridesharing services to apply for an omnibus licence, similar to limousines and small charter vehicles. The announcement made clear that taxis would remain the only player in the rank and hail space. Mr. Nalder also insisted on security cameras for all taxis but not [...] "omnibuses", believing these should remain optional. Uber Perth City Lead Tom White said he was delighted the government was [...] "welcoming ridesharing" [...] and providing certainty for its drivers. [...] "This forward-thinking decision will open up economic opportunity and choice {{to the people of}} WA", he said. Taxi Industry Forum WA chairman Howard Lance said the changes were long overdue and would provide certainty but Uber compliance was paramount.|$|E

50|$|The {{bill would}} reform medical {{malpractice}} laws, including limiting non-economic damages to $250,000, {{in an effort}} to reduce costs of healthcare. Critics have noted that medical liability costs represent only about 2.4% of health care spending, so <b>reforms</b> <b>will</b> have minimal impact.|$|R
50|$|On 26 October 2006 the {{government}} announced a number of changes to the welfare system. Then Minister for Social Development and Employment David Benson-Pope later stated that, when implemented, the <b>reforms</b> <b>will</b> move between 3,000 and 6,000 people off the Sickness Benefit.|$|R
2500|$|Duterte's verbal attacks {{especially}} to the US and EU is viewed by many Filipinos {{as a threat to}} their jobs especially those working for foreign companies. Mark Williams, chief of Asia economist at Capital Economics, said, [...] "Certainly, investors are worried by some of the things he's saying, he's really unnerved people". The Philippine government, however, expects that employment, especially in BPO industries, will continue to keep on rising.. Despite Duterte's bluster and the messy local politics however, the long-term view for the Philippine economy looks good and has even pessimists conceding that gross domestic product should grow close to 7% over {{the next three to five}} years. “Twin catalysts of infrastructure spending and tax <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> drive the market over the next two years,” Dante Tinga, head of research at BDO Nomura in Manila, tells Barron’s. “There’s an investment boom under way, which I believe will help in rerating the market over the next 12 months.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Italian Constitution prescribes {{that both}} {{chambers}} must accept every modification {{to the constitution}} twice within three months, and, if it passes with less than {{two thirds of the}} votes at the second scrutiny, a national referendum on the modification can be held (the <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> make it always possible to call such a referendum). Since the centre-left opposition opposed to the new constitutional reform, describing it as [...] "dangerous", [...] "separatist", and [...] "antidemocratic", the first procedural step, that is, the approval by the Chamber of Deputies, was done successfully in October 2004, but with less than ⅔ of the lower-house votes, making possible the confirmative referendum. The second favourable polling, in Senate, was done in March 2005, whereas the third one occurred on October 20. During the third polling, former UDC leader Marco Follini announced he would abstain from the final vote, not support anymore the constitutional reform, followed by his party fellow Bruno Tabacci.|$|E
2500|$|In {{speeches and}} interviews, Zoya {{frequently}} speaks about her experiences to describe conditions in Burma. In 2009, {{she worked with}} Damien Lewis to publish her autobiography, [...] Little Daughter: a Memoir of Survival in Burma and the West, 2009. It is published by Simon & Schuster. [...] In May 2010, {{it was published in}} the United States under the title Undaunted: My Struggle for Freedom and Survival in Burma. [...] She said that the goal of her book was to share her story as a Karen living in Burma, and to raise international awareness of the ongoing fighting and human rights abuses in Burma, especially in the east, which she says does not receive enough attention. At the end of the book, she also expresses her extreme scepticism over the upcoming elections, criticising the UN and governments who believe that real <b>reform</b> <b>will</b> be attained. She maintains that the situation in Burma is exactly the same as when she fled the country, and that only pressure and sanctions from other countries will bring about the reform necessary to create democracy within Burma. [...] The book has received positive reviews from papers such as the Globe and Mail and the Independent.|$|E

40|$|Although {{funding and}} accrediting {{agencies}} often want schools of engineering to {{provide evidence that}} recent <b>reforms</b> <b>will</b> endure, institutionalization is typically assessed superficially [...] -if at all. Penn State's Center for the Study of Higher Education (CSHE) developed indicators to assess predictors of institutionalization of curricular reforms initiated by the Engineering Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL). This article defines regulative, normative, and cognitive indicators of institutionalization, describes how they were derived from interview data, and illustrates the institutionalization indicator measures CSHE has developed to assess the likelihood that ECSEL curricular <b>reforms</b> <b>will</b> endure after NSF funding for the coalition is complete. The article illustrates how others might use the indicators to assess institutionalization of reforms at their own schools...|$|R
