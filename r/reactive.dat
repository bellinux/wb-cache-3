5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more <b>reactive</b> than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more <b>reactive.</b> In addition to being far more <b>reactive</b> than radon, oganesson may be even more <b>reactive</b> than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a <b>reactive</b> ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is <b>reactive,</b> the specimen is reported as repeatedly <b>reactive</b> and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly <b>reactive</b> by ELISA and positive by IFA or <b>reactive</b> by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E
5|$|Inert gas, for any {{gas that}} is not <b>reactive</b> under normal circumstances.|$|E
5|$|On {{the early}} Earth, <b>reactive</b> elements, such as iron and uranium, existed in a reduced form that would react with any free oxygen {{produced}} by photosynthesising organisms. Oxygen {{would not be}} able to build up in the atmosphere until all the iron had rusted (producing banded iron formations), and all the other <b>reactive</b> elements had been oxidised.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen is {{a highly}} <b>reactive</b> {{substance}} and must be segregated from combustible materials.|$|E
5|$|Some self <b>reactive</b> T cells {{escape the}} thymus {{for a number}} of reasons, mainly {{due to the lack of}} {{expression}} of some self antigens in the thymus. Another type of T cell T regulatory cells can down regulate self <b>reactive</b> T cells in the periphery. When immunological tolerance fails, autoimmune diseases can follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} state for sodium is +1. It is generally less <b>reactive</b> than potassium and more <b>reactive</b> than lithium. Sodium metal is highly reducing, {{with the standard}} reduction potential for the Na+/Na couple being −2.71 volts, though potassium and lithium have even more negative potentials.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} these <b>reactive</b> oxygen species, cells contain numerous antioxidant systems, including antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C {{and vitamin}} E, and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases, which detoxify the <b>reactive</b> species, limiting {{damage to the}} cell.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally carbenes {{are viewed}} as so <b>reactive</b> that were only studied indirectly, e.g. by {{trapping}} reactions. This situation has changed dramatically {{with the emergence of}} persistent carbenes. Although they are fairly <b>reactive</b> substances, i.e., undergoing dimerization, many can be isolated as pure substances.|$|E
5|$|Although sodium is less <b>reactive</b> than potassium, {{this process}} works because at such high {{temperatures}} potassium is more volatile than sodium and {{can easily be}} distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{is used in}} some {{high-temperature}} {{industrial processes}} where ordinarily non-reactive substances become <b>reactive.</b> For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning.|$|E
5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly <b>reactive</b> hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less <b>reactive</b> bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E
5|$|Dermal and {{subcutaneous}} growths {{result from}} (1) <b>reactive</b> or neoplastic proliferation of cellular {{components of the}} dermis or subcutaneous tissue, or (2) neoplasms invading or aberrantly present in the dermis.|$|E
5|$|Germane (GeH4) is a {{compound}} similar in structure to methane. Polygermanes—compounds {{that are similar}} to alkanes—with formula GenH2n+2 containing up to five germanium atoms are known. The germanes are less volatile and less <b>reactive</b> than their corresponding silicon analogues. GeH4 reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH3 which contain the GeH3− anion. The germanium hydrohalides with one, two and three halogen atoms are colorless <b>reactive</b> liquids.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of <b>reactive</b> oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging <b>reactive</b> oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals are {{primarily}} found as lithophiles (rock-loving) or chalcophiles (ore-loving). Lithophile heavy metals are mainly f-block elements {{and the more}} <b>reactive</b> of the d-block elements. They have a strong affinity for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low density silicate minerals. Chalcophile heavy metals are mainly the less <b>reactive</b> d-block elements, and period 4–6 p-block metals and metalloids. They are usually found in (insoluble) sulfide minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles, hence sinking lower into the crust {{at the time of}} its solidification, the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant than the lithophiles.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least <b>reactive</b> noble gas after neon, and thus the second least <b>reactive</b> of all elements. It is {{chemically}} inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with its sulfur counterpart (sulfur hexafluoride), selenium hexafluoride (SeF6) is more <b>reactive</b> {{and is a}} toxic pulmonary irritant.|$|E
5|$|In some {{reactions}} between highly <b>reactive</b> metals (usually from Group 1 or Group 2) {{and highly}} electronegative halogen gases, or water, the atoms can be ionized by electron transfer, a process thermodynamically understood using the Born–Haber cycle.|$|E
5|$|In theory, radon is more <b>reactive</b> than xenon, and {{therefore}} should form chemical bonds {{more easily than}} xenon does. However, due to the high radioactivity and short half-life of radon isotopes, only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have been formed in practice.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing basic ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Ionic compounds without these ions are also known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. Ionic compounds can also be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation of their solvent, precipitation, freezing, a solid-state reaction, or the electron transfer reaction of <b>reactive</b> metals with <b>reactive</b> non-metals, such as halogen gases.|$|E
5|$|Less <b>reactive</b> than iodine, {{astatine}} is {{the least}} <b>reactive</b> of the halogens, although its compounds have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their radioactive disintegration. The reactions involved have been typically tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of iodine. Acting as a carrier, the iodine ensures there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques (such as filtration and precipitation) to work. Like iodine, astatine {{has been shown to}} adopt odd-numbered oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, lithium {{has a single}} valence {{electron}} that is easily given up to form a cation. Because of this, lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity {{as well as a}} highly <b>reactive</b> element, though it is the least <b>reactive</b> of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).|$|E
5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly <b>reactive</b> alkali metals, through the less <b>reactive</b> alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophil granulocytes—the most {{abundant}} type of white blood cell—enter the muscle tissue, producing an inflammatory reaction and releasing <b>reactive</b> oxygen species, particularly after crush injury. Crush syndrome may also cause reperfusion injury when {{blood flow to}} decompressed muscle is suddenly restored.|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} of systemic conditions associated with aphthous-like ulceration include <b>reactive</b> arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), and recurrent erythema multiforme.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reactive</b> neutrophilic {{cutaneous}} conditions {{constitute a}} spectrum of disease mediated by neutrophils, and typically associated with underlying diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and hematologic malignancy.|$|E
5|$|Some of germanium's artificially-produced {{compounds}} {{are quite}} <b>reactive</b> and present an immediate hazard {{to human health}} on exposure. For example, germanium chloride and germane (GeH4) are a liquid and gas, respectively, {{that can be very}} irritating to the eyes, skin, lungs, and throat.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a <b>reactive</b> form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ornithine decarboxylase can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species. This <b>reactive</b> form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form <b>reactive</b> oxygen species, which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signalling. One species produced by the body, the superoxide anion (−), is possibly involved in iron acquisition. Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of <b>reactive</b> oxygen species. Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of <b>reactive</b> oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust {{has been}} known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly <b>reactive</b> hydroxyl radicals and other <b>reactive</b> radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E
5|$|The {{draft of}} the {{proposed}} DSM-V suggests dividing RAD into two disorders, <b>Reactive</b> Attachment Disorder for the current inhibited form of RAD, and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of RAD, with some alterations in the proposed DSM definition.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} , a white solid, {{is highly}} <b>reactive</b> (by fluorination), easily sublimes (emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas), {{and is the}} most volatile compound of uranium known to exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} the period 7 {{congener}} of the noble gases, oganesson (Og), is not known—it {{may or may not}} be a noble gas. It was originally predicted to be a noble gas but may instead be a fairly <b>reactive</b> solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential, due to relativistic effects. On the other hand, if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112, copernicium (as is thought to be the case), oganesson may turn out to be a noble gas after all, albeit more <b>reactive</b> than either xenon or radon. Regardless, oganesson is predicted to be a nonmetal, and probably the only one in period 7.|$|E
5|$|These highly <b>reactive</b> {{molecules}} {{were previously}} known {{to contribute to}} building complex organics in the Interstellar Medium, therefore highlighting a possibly universal stepping stone to producing complex organic material.|$|E
