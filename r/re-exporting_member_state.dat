This Directive sets out the basic framework for EU VAT, but does allow <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> some degree of flexibility in implementation of VAT legislation. For example, different rates of VAT are allowed in different EU <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> However Directive 2006/112 requires <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to have a minimum standard rate of VAT of 15% and one or two reduced rates not to be below 5%. Some <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> have a 0% VAT rate on certain supplies; these <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> would have agreed this as part of their EU Accession Treaty (for example, newspapers and certain magazines in Belgium).

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest. Finally, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> do not appear to have changed their behavior toward the Court since the passage of the Single European Act...|$|R
