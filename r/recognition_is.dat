Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia.

In Experiment 1, participants learned shapes with a rectangular background that was oriented differently from their viewpoint, and then recognized target shapes, which were created by splitting study shapes along different intrinsic axes, at different views. Results showed that <b>recognition</b> <b>was</b> quicker when the study shapes were split along the axis parallel to {{the orientation of the}} rectangular background than when they were split along the axis parallel to participants' viewpoint. In Experiment 2, participants learned shapes without the rectangular background. The results showed that <b>recognition</b> <b>was</b> quicker when the study shape was split along the axis parallel to participants' viewpoint. In both experiments, <b>recognition</b> <b>was</b> quicker at the study view than at a novel view.

5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of <b>recognition</b> <b>is</b> possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin <b>recognition</b> <b>is</b> by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E
5|$|Nest mate <b>recognition</b> <b>is</b> {{widespread}} in many eusocial insects. However, {{when there are}} no physical differences in either diet or nesting materials, many can no longer discriminate nest mate from other conspecifics. Recently, however, it has been indicated that many insects have the ability to discriminate relatives even having lived in identical environments with their non-relative counterpart. Studies have indicated that in Polistes fuscatus, former nestmates would nest in areas located close together near their natal nests the following spring. Social halictid bees also are able to recognize their relatives. In Polistes exclamans, it has been indicated that discrimination of relatives from non-relatives, even having lived in identical environments, is possible. This was found by Allen, Schulze Kellman, and Gamboa through an experiment in which hibernating wasps from different nests were put in a box together after being raised in identical environments. As the number of unrelated groups of wasps increased, the more clumps were formed in the box. This indicates that the wasps were capable of differentiating relative from nonrelative, an adaptive ability in the defense of their nest.|$|E

5|$|To {{qualify for}} {{recognition}} by the American Kennel Club, a national breed club must first be established and a written request needs {{to be sent to}} the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service. The next step is to qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full <b>recognition</b> <b>is</b> granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee.|$|E
