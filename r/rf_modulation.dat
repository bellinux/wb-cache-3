For example, equipment sold in Europe, South Africa and Hong Kong used UHF channels 30-39 for this purpose. Equipment sold in Japan used channel 1 or 2 (Channel 13-16 is for cable converters).

40|$|The {{synchrotron}} {{equation of}} motion in quasi-isochronous (QI) storage rings was transformed to a universal Weier-strass equation, where solution is given by Jacobian ellip-tic functions. Scaling properties of QI Hamiltonian were derived. The effects of phase space damping and the sen-sitivity of particle motion to external harmonic modulation were studied. We found that <b>rf</b> phase <b>modulation</b> is partic-ularly enhanced in QI storage rings. This means that the operators of QI storage rings should {{pay special attention to}} <b>rf</b> phase <b>modulation.</b> Exact formula and sum rules for resonance strength coefficients were derived. In the pres-ence of radiation damping and <b>rf</b> phase <b>modulation,</b> QI sys-tem exhibits a sequence of period-two bifurcation enroute towards global chaos (instability) in a region of modula-tion tune. The critical modulation amplitude for the onset of global chaos shows a cusp as a function of modulation tune. This cusp was shown to arise from the transition from the 2 : 1 to the 1 : 1 parametric resonances. We also studied the effect of <b>rf</b> voltage <b>modulation</b> and found that the toler-ance of <b>rf</b> voltage <b>modulation</b> is much larger than that of <b>rf</b> phase <b>modulation.</b> ...|$|R

This paper describes the possibility of measuring the machine chromaticity via <b>RF</b> phase <b>modulation</b> and continuous tune tracking. The <b>RF</b> phase <b>modulation</b> can be done at much higher frequencies than a classical RF frequency variation and thus, allows chromaticity measurements with a time resolution below the second.

40|$|AbstractA radial {{frequency}} (RF) stimulus {{is strongly}} masked by a second, surrounding RF stimulus {{that follows the}} first after a critical stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of around 100 ms. We sought {{to determine whether a}} mask-dependent attentional cuing effect, like that found when detecting pattern-masked sinusoidal gratings, would be obtained with RF stimuli. Observers detected <b>RF</b> <b>modulations</b> in cued or miscued stimuli that were masked with a simultaneous (SIM) RF mask or a delayed (SUC) RF mask that followed it after 100 ms. There were large cuing effects in the SUC condition and small cuing effects in the SIM condition, replicating previous findings. The data are well described by a model in which masks affect the informational persistence of stimuli and cues affect the rate at which stimulus information is transferred into visual short-term memory...|$|R

Each frame of a television image is composed of lines drawn on the screen. The lines are of varying brightness; the whole set of lines is drawn quickly enough that the human eye perceives it as one image. The next sequential frame is displayed, allowing the depiction of motion. The analog television signal contains timing and synchronization information, so that the receiver can reconstruct a two-dimensional moving image from a one-dimensional time-varying signal.|$|E
50|$|Multi-channel RF {{modulators}} {{are commonly}} used in home audio/video distribution. These devices have multiple audio and video inputs and one RF output. Audio/video outputs from source devices such as a DVD player, VCR, or DSS receiver {{are connected to the}} audio/video inputs on the modulator. The modulator is then programmed to broadcast the signals on a certain frequency. That RF broadcast is then received by the connected TV. When the TV is tuned to the programmed channel, the video and audio signal of the source device is accessed. <b>RF</b> <b>modulation</b> can become difficult in a CATV system. High pass, low pass, and notch filters must be used to block certain frequencies, or channels, so that the modulator can broadcast the audio/video signal of the source device on that channel.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this paper, {{we present}} a <b>RF</b> {{directional}} <b>modulation</b> technique using a switched antenna array for physical layer secure communication. The main idea is that a switching scheme of the switched antenna array is designed according to a spreading sequence {{for the purpose of}} spreading spectrum of the transmit signal. The transmit signal is associated with the spreading sequence and the direction of the desired receiver because of information data modulated both in the baseband and the antenna level. In this way, the desired receiver with a single antenna can demodulate the receive signal as traditional spread-spectrum signal, while eavesdroppers can not extract any useful information from the receive signal even if eavesdroppers know the spreading sequence of the <b>RF</b> directional <b>modulation</b> signal. Simulation results show that the proposed technique offers a more secure transmission method for wireless communication comparison with traditional spread-spectrum signal. 1...|$|R

50|$|Radio {{frequency}} over glass (RFoG) {{is a type}} {{of passive}} optical network that transports RF signals that were formerly transported over copper (principally over a hybrid fibre-coaxial cable) over PON. In the forward direction RFoG is either a stand-alone P2MP system or an optical overlay for existing PON such as GEPON/EPON. The overlay for RFoG is based on Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM) -- the passive combination of wavelengths on a single strand of glass. Reverse RF support is provided by transporting the upstream or return RF onto a separate wavelength from the PON return wavelength. The Society of Cable and Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) Interface Practices Subcomittee (IPS) Work Group 5, is currently working on IPS 910 RF over Glass. RFoG offers backwards compatibility with existing <b>RF</b> <b>modulation</b> technology, but offers no additional bandwidth for RF based services. Although not yet completed, the RFoG standard is actually a collection of standardized options which are not compatible with each other (they cannot be mixed on the same PON). Some of the standards may interoperate with other PONs, others may not. It offers a means to support RF technologies in locations where only fiber is available or where copper is not permitted or feasible. This technology is targeted towards Cable TV operators and their existing HFC networks.|$|E

We also propose a theoretical model of the damping mechanism, in which the increase of the spread in synchrotron frequencies inside the bunches produced by phase modulation is responsible for damping the centroid dipolar coherent motion caused by an external excitation, which could be a Higher Order Mode (HOM) of the RF cavities driving the coupled bunch mo-tion. We measured the coherent synchrotron oscillation damping of a single bunch under two circumstances, with and without phase modulation, and determined the amount of extra damping due to the modulation. With this experi-ment we could also measure the frequency of small oscilla-tions around the stable islands formed by phase modulation and its behavior when the <b>RF</b> phase <b>modulation</b> amplitude and frequency are changed.

40|$|An all-optical {{photonic}} microwave {{phase shifter}} that can realize a continuous 360 Â° phase shift {{over a wide}} frequency range is presented. It {{is based on the}} new concept of controlling the amplitude and phase of the two <b>RF</b> <b>modulation</b> sidebands via a Fourier-domain optical processor. The operating frequency range of the phase shifter is largely increased compared to the previously reported Fourier-domain optical processor based phase shifter that uses only one <b>RF</b> <b>modulation</b> sideband. This is due to the extension of the lower RF operating frequency by designing the amplitude and phase of one of the <b>RF</b> <b>modulation</b> sidebands while the other sideband is designed to realize the required RF signal phase shift. The two-sideband amplitude-and-phase-control based photonic microwave phase shifter has a simple structure as it only requires a single laser source, a phase modulator, a Fourier-domain optical processor and a single photodetector. Investigation on the bandwidth limitation problem in the conventional Fourier-domain optical processor based phase shifter is presented. Comparisons between the measured phase shifter output RF amplitude and phase responses with theory, which show excellent agreement, are also presented for the first time. Experimental results demonstrate the full âˆ’ 180 Â° to + 180 Â° phase shift with little RF signal amplitude variation of less than 3 dB and with a phase deviation of less than 4 Â° over a 7. 5 GHz to 26. 5 GHz frequency range, and the phase shifter exhibits a long term stable performance...|$|E
