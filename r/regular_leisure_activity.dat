40|$|Despite {{the real}} and {{perceived}} benefits of reading—cognitive, social and psychological—many women do not choose to read, particularly books, as a <b>regular</b> <b>leisure</b> <b>activity.</b> In this paper, using empirical evidence and personal construct psychology[1] as the framework, {{it is argued that}} women develop reading constructs that, by the time of adolescence, become core constructs forming part of the self-concept that remain stable throughout the life span. These constructs are shaped by the individual’s environment, particularly family and friends, and influence their perception of their reading behaviour and skills. When considering the reading construct, it is a common belief that a reader is someone who reads books and a non-reader is someone who either reads nothing or reads other materials, e. g., magazines. A woman who believes herself to be a reader may read books throughout her lifespan, whereas a woman who believes herself to be a non-reader will probably not read books after her primary schooling is completed. Women who consider themselves to be non-readers may change their reading behaviour as adults if there are certain conditions present to encourage them to start, but they exercise limited agency in their reading practices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} for the beneficial effects of physical activity in diabetes. There has been little research demonstrating a dose-response relationship between physical activity and self-rated health in diabetics. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the dose-response association between leisure time physical activity and self-rated health among diabetics in Taiwan. Methods Data came from the 2001 Taiwan National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Inclusion criteria were a physician confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and age 18 years and above (n = 797). Self-rated health was assessed by the question "In general, would you say that your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?" Individuals with a self perceived health status of good, very good, or excellent were considered to have positive health status. Results In the full model, the odds ratio (OR) for positive health was 2. 51 (95 % CI = 1. 53 - 4. 13), 1. 62 (95 % CI = 0. 93 - 2. 84), and 1. 35 (95 % CI = 0. 77 - 2. 37), for those with a total weekly energy expenditure of ≥ 1000 kcal, between 500 and 999 kcal, and between 1 and 499 kcal, respectively, compared to inactive individuals. Those with duration over 10 years (OR = 0. 53, 95 %CI = 0. 30 - 0. 94), heart disease (OR = 0. 50, 95 %CI = 0. 30 - 0. 85), and dyslipidemia (OR = 0. 65, 95 % CI = 0. 43 - 0. 98) were less likely to have positive health than their counterparts.

This work is divided in two parts, theoretical one and practical one. The theoretical part describes the ageing process, old age, its periodical division, physical, psychological and social changes connected with this process and the demographic trends related to the ageing of the population in the Czech Republic. It also includes a general description of a rest home, outlines the work of the leisure time pedagogue and discusses the topic of <b>leisure</b> time <b>activities</b> in a rest home. The practical part includes description of three rest homes situated in the South Moravian Region, where the survey was carried out in February and March 2010. This survey was mainly focused on <b>leisure</b> time <b>activities</b> of subjects and the work of leisure time pedagogues. The last part of the thesis contains the examination of hypotheses by the results of the conducted survey. Hypotheses were stated as follows: 1.

40|$|In June 2010, European Union (EU) Heads of State and Government {{adopted a}} social {{inclusion}} target {{as part of}} the new ‘Europe 2020 Strategy’: to lift at least 20 million people in the EU from the risk of poverty and exclusion by 2020. One of the three indicators used to monitor progress towards this target is the EU indicator of severe material deprivation (MD). A main limitation of this indicator is the weak reliability of some of the items it is based on. For this reason, a thematic module on MD was included in the 2009 wave of the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey. This article assesses the 2009 EU-SILC MD data and proposes an analytical framework for developing robust EU MD indicators. It carries out a systematic item by item analysis at both EU and country levels to identify the MD items which satisfactorily meet suitability, validity, reliability and additivity criteria across the EU. This approach has resulted in a proposed 13 -item MD indicator covering some key aspects of living conditions which are customary across the whole EU covering a broad range of basic (food, clothes, shoes, etc.) as well as social (Internet, <b>regular</b> <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> etc.) necessities...|$|R

The frequency of receiving physiotherapeutic interventions were described as a variable of interest. A total population of 364 children with verified CP aged 7 - 17 years living in the Skåne region in Sweden was studied using cross-sectional data from the CP follow-up programme (CPUP). Proportional odds ratios showed the most severe gross motor limitations Gross Motor Function Classification System Expanded and Revised (GMFCS-E&R) to be a characteristic for low participation in physical education at school (PE) and GMFCS-E&R level III to be a characteristic for low participation in <b>regular</b> physical <b>leisure</b> <b>activity.</b> The age group of 7 - 11 years and obesity were characteristics associated with high participation in PE, whereas thinness was associated with low participation in <b>regular</b> physical <b>leisure</b> time <b>activities.</b> The highest proportion of children receiving physiotherapeutic interventions was found in GMFCS-E&R level III, while mental retardation, especially if moderate or severe, proved to be an independent characteristic associated with low frequency of physiotherapeutic interventions.

40|$|Back {{pain and}} neck pain are very common {{and among the}} most {{frequent}} causes of sick-leave and disability pension, thereby greatly affecting {{the individual and the}} community. This stresses the need for prognostic research regarding these conditions. Aim: The main aim of the present work was to study prognostic factors, including manual therapy, for back and neck pain. The specific aims were, to investigate the influence of <b>regular</b> <b>leisure</b> physical <b>activity</b> and the body mass index (BMI) on the recovery from persistent low back pain (Study I), to study the influence of healthy lifestyle behaviour on the prognosis of occasional low back pain (Study II), to explore the long-term effects (up to one year) of naprapathic manual therapy for patients with non-specific back and/or neck pain (Study III), and to develop a prediction model for the recovery from whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) in patients who consulted physiotherapy (Study IV). Methods: Studies I and II were based on the Stockholm Public Health Cohort, and comprised data from four questionnaire-based public-health surveys conducted between 2002 and 2010. Study I included 1836 individuals reporting persistent low back pain at baseline in 2002 and answering the follow-up in 2007, while Study II involved 8994 individuals with occasional low back pain at baseline in 2006 responding to the 2010 survey. Information on exposures and potential confounders was collected at baseline. The exposures were, <b>regular</b> <b>leisure</b> physical <b>activity</b> and BMI (Study I), and “healthy lifestyle behaviour”, a combination of four lifestyle factors (smoking habits, alcohol consumption, <b>leisure</b> physical <b>activity</b> and consumption of fruit and vegetables) (Study II). Both Studies I and II assessed men and women separately. Study III was based on a Swedish randomized controlled trial of 409 patients with non-specific back and/or neck pain. It compared naprapathic manual therapy with evidence based support on staying active and on pain coping strategies. Questionnaires at 26 and 52 weeks provided the follow-up data. Study IV included 680 patients with WAD consulting physiotherapy, using data retrieved from the Saskatchewan Government Insurance study, Canada (1997 - 1999). A prediction model for recovery from WAD was developed and internally validated by assessing twenty-five possible prognostic factors, using survival analyses. Results and Conclusions: <b>Regular</b> <b>leisure</b> physical <b>activity</b> improved recovery from persistent low back pain among women. No such association was found among men, or between BMI and recovery regardless of sex (Study I). Healthy lifestyle behaviour decreased the risk of long duration troublesome low back pain among women with occasional low back pain. No clear association was found among men (Study II). Compared to evidence-based care, naprapathic manual therapy implied greater long-term improvement in pain and disability for patients with non-specific back and/or neck pain (Study III). The prediction model developed includes seven clinically important prognostic factors, and has acceptable predictive ability (Study IV). The conclusions in this thesis are, that lifestyle factors are of importance for the prognosis of low back pain among women, that combined manual therapy, such as naprapathy, has a long-term effect on non-specific back and/or neck pain, and that the present prediction model for recovery from WAD has acceptable predictive ability but has to be further validated to be used in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To compare two methodological approaches: the multinomial {{model and}} the zero-inflated gamma model, {{evaluating}} the factors associated with the practice and {{amount of time spent}} on <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity.</b> METHODS Data collected from 14, 823 baseline participants in the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil – Estudo Longitudinal de Saúde do Adulto) have been analysed. <b>Regular</b> <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> has been measured using the <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> module of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The explanatory variables considered were gender, age, education level, and annual per capita family income. RESULTS The main advantage of the zero-inflated gamma model over the multinomial model is that it estimates mean time (minutes per week) spent on <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity.</b> For example, on average, men spent 28 minutes/week longer on <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> than women did. The most sedentary groups were young women with low education level and income CONCLUSIONS The zero-inflated gamma model, which is rarely used in epidemiological studies, can give more appropriate answers in several situations. In our case, we have obtained important information on the main determinants of the duration of <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity.</b> This information can help guide efforts towards the most vulnerable groups since physical inactivity is associated with different diseases and even premature death...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{knowledge}} about <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> {{and the body}} mass index (BMI) as prognostic factors for recovery from persistent back pain. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the influence of <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> and BMI on recovery from persistent back pain among men and women in a general population. Methods: The study population (n= 1836) in this longitudinal cohort study consisted of participants reporting persistent back pain in the baseline questionnaire in 2002 - 2003. Data on <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity,</b> BMI and potential confounders were also collected at baseline. Information on recovery from persistent back pain (no back pain periods >= 7 days during the last 5 years) was obtained from the follow-up questionnaire in 2007. Log-binomial models were applied to calculate Risk Ratios with 95 percent Confidence Intervals (CI) comparing physically active and normal weight groups versus sedentary and overweight groups. Results: Compared to a sedentary leisure time, all measured levels of <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> were associated with a greater chance of recovery from persistent back pain among women. The adjusted Risk Ratios was 1. 46 (95 % CI: 1. 06, 2. 01) for low <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity,</b> 1. 51 (95 % CI: 1. 02, 2. 23) for moderate <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity,</b> and 1. 67 (95 % CI: 1. 08, 2. 58) for high <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity.</b> There were no indications that <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> influenced recovery among men, or that BMI was associated with recovery from persistent back pain either among men or among women.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether leisure-time activities were associated with psychological distress. Methods: A population-based questionnaire survey was conducted in 2009 in a suburban area of northern Japan using complete enumeration. Of 16, 996 residents aged 30 – 79  years who received the questionnaire, 14, 261 (83. 9 %) responded and 9908 (58. 3 %) responses were eligible for analysis. The relationship between psychological distress and physical, artistic, outdoor, and volunteer leisure-time activities was assessed separately and simultaneously by sex. Results: The percentage of reported psychological distress was 2. 8 % for men and 3. 9 % for women. Each category of leisure-time activity was related to psychological distress separately. The simultaneous analyses revealed that engaging in <b>regular</b> outdoor <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> was associated with less psychological distress in both men (odds ratio [OR] =  0. 38; 95 % confidence intervals [CI]: 0. 23, 0. 63, p <  0. 001) and women (OR =  0. 39; 95 % CI: 0. 25, 0. 59, p <  0. 001).

Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in 4 rural communities of Deqing County located in East China in 2006 - 07, including 4, 506 subjects aged 18 to 64 years. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was measured. Subjects were considered to have impaired fasting glucose (IFG) if FPG was in the range from 5. 6 to 6. 9 mmol/L and to have diabetes mellitus (DM) if FG was 7. 0 mmol/L or above. Results The crude prevalences of IFG and DM were 5. 4 % and 2. 2 %, respectively. The average ratio of IFG/DM was 2. 5, and tended to be higher for those under the age of 35 years than older subjects. After adjustment for covariates including age (continuous), sex, BMI (continuous), smoking, alcohol drinking, and <b>regular</b> <b>leisure</b> physical <b>activity,</b> subjects in the high household income group had a significantly higher risk of IFG compared with the medium household income group (OR: 1. 74, 95 % CI: 1. 11 - 2. 72) and no significant difference in IFG was observed between the low and medium household income groups. Education and farmer occupation were not significantly associated with IFG. Conclusions High household income was significantly associated with an increased risk of IFG. A high ratio of IFG/DM suggests a high risk of diabetes in foreseeable future in the Chinese transforming rural communities. </p...|$|R

Objective: To determine the prevalence of MSx and related variables among office workers. Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated 1488 office workers in Qom province, Central Iran, by using a multi-stage cluster sampling. Diagnosis of MSx was based on blood HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, and fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels and waist circumference, and blood pressure. Results: The overall prevalence of MSx was 35. 9 % (95 % CI 33. 5 % to 38. 3 %), higher in men (37. 2 %) than in women (20. 6 %), and increased with age. The most common laboratory findings of MSx were hypertriglyceridemia (45. 9 %) and low HDL-cholesterol level (45. 5 %). Office workers with MSx had a significantly (p< 0. 001) higher body mass index than those without MSx. Lack of <b>regular</b> <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> (p= 0. 003), and low intake of fruits (p= 0. 02) were associated with MSx.

40|$|Background: Some {{markers of}} chronic {{inflammation}} {{have been recognized}} as predictors of cardiovascular risk in apparently healthy subjects and in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). High sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) {{appears to be the}} most useful marker in clinical settings. Several studies reported associations between inflammatory markers and other cardiovascular risk factors, such as age, obesity, cholesterol levels, the presence of diabetes mellitus, physical activity, social level and smoking habits. We focussed on the association between C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen and <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> (LTPA). Methods: This report deals with the results observed in a sub-sample of the BELSTRESS study. 892 male subjects, free from clinical CHD and major ECG abnormalities, working in the same environment, aged 35 - 59 years, were selected. A questionnaire was used to estimate the level of <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity.</b> Associations between CRP, SAA, fibrinogen and <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> were evaluated through univariate and multivariate methods. Subjects taking statins or other lipid lowering medication were excluded from the study. Results: <b>Regular</b> <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> is associated with reductions of several cardiovascular risk factors, such as body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio and the lipid profile. Smokers and low educated subjects had a lower physical activity status. Age adjustment did not alter the means of inflammatory parameters according to the levels of <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity.</b> After correction for personal characteristics (BMI, current smoking status, educational level, presence of diabetes and alcohol consumption) no significant relation was found between <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity</b> and levels of inflammatory markers. The differences of CRP and fibrinogen according to the level of physical activity, found in bivariate analysis, seem to be explained by linked differences in BMI, or related to current smoking habits. <b>Leisure</b> time physical <b>activity,</b> as reported in this study, is not significantly related to C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A or fibrinogen levels, after correction for other cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusion: These data indicate that <b>leisure</b> time physical <b>activity,</b> as reported in our study, is not an independent predictor of C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A or fibrinogen levels. Possible interactions of physical activity and other cardiovascular risk factors might explain the (indirect) relation we found in the bivariate analysis. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Background: currently, {{assessment}} of outcomes after joint replacement is predominantly centred on impairment and activ-ity limitation (e. g. walking), with little consideration of participation restriction. Method: structured telephone interviews about participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> {{were conducted with}} 56 total hip replace-ment (THR) and 60 total knee replacement (TKR) patients before and 1 year after joint replacement. Findings: before surgery, THR patients participated in 209 <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> {{with an average of}} four <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> per person. TKR patients participated in 171 <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> with an average of three <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> per person. The <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> were coded into four categories: sports/exercise, hobbies, social activities and holidays. Between 89 and 95 % of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> were rated as important by THR and TKR patients prior to surgery. Before surgery, THR patients rated 82 % of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> as difficult to perform because of joint problems, which decreased to 25 % of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> by 1 -year after surgery. TKR patients rated 86 % of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> as difficult to perform because of joint problems, which decreased to 32 % after surgery. Conclusion: this research highlights that participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> is important to patients undergoing joint replace-ment, but that approximately a quarter of patients are unable to perform their valued <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> after surgery...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{examined}} the relationships between physical health and <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> and between <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> and well-being, but, to our knowledge, none has examined these relationships simultaneously. Objective: This study investigated the relationships between <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> health and well-being considering the role of age, and whether <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> mediate the relationship between physical health and well-being. Methods: Utilizing a cross-sectional database of 259 adults (ages 18 - 81 years) who completed several questionnaires, linear regression models and mediation models were tested. Results: Regression analyses indicated that physical health was related to <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> and <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> were related to well-being. When physical health was measured by subjective ratings, age had a stronger relationship with <b>leisure</b> <b>activities.</b> However, when physical health was indicated by health restrictions, physical health had a stronger relationship with <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> than did age. <b>Leisure</b> <b>activities</b> were a partial mediator of the relationship between physical health and well-being. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the reduction in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> with age {{has more to do with}} physical health limitations than with older age itself. In addition, regardless of age, the benefits of physical health for well-being are due in part to the level of <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation. These results highlight the importance of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> for successful aging throughout the adult life span. Interventions designed to improve well-being through increasing <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation should take physical health into consideration, particularly fo...|$|R

40|$|Background. Physical and <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> {{are proven}} health {{promotion}} modalities {{and have not}} been examined in older wheelchair users. Main Objectives. Examine physical and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> in older wheelchair users and explore associations between wheelchair use and participation in physical and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity,</b> and wheelchair use, physical and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity,</b> and perceived health. Methods. 8301 Canadians ≥ 60 years of age were selected from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Sociodemographic, health-related, mobility-related, and physical and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> variables were analysed using logistic regression to determine, the likelihood of participation in physical and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity,</b> and whether participation in physical and <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> mediates the relationship between wheelchair use and perceived health. Results. 8. 3 % and 41. 3 % older wheelchair users were physically and leisurely active. Wheelchair use was {{a risk factor for}} reduced participation in physical (OR = 44. 71) and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> (OR = 10. 83). Wheelchair use was a risk factor for poor perceived health (OR = 10. 56) and physical and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> negatively mediated the relationship between wheelchair user and perceived health. Conclusion. There is a need for the development of suitable physical and <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> interventions for older wheelchair users.

40|$|Although {{activity}} {{participation is}} promoted as cognitively-protective, critical questions of causality remain. In a cohort followed {{every five years}} from age 75 to 85 years, potential reciprocal associations between level and change in <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation and level and change in cognitive abilities were examined. Participants in the Glostrup 1914 Cohort, a longitudinal study of ageing, completed standardised cognitive ability tests and reported their <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> participation (11 <b>activities</b> defined a <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> score) at ages 75, 80 and 85. Higher <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> was associated with higher cognitive ability (significant correlations ranged from. 15 to. 31, p <. 05). Between ages 75 and 85, participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> and cognitive ability declined significantly. Growth curve models, which provided latent variables for level of and 10 -year change in both <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> and cognitive ability, confirmed the positive association between levels of <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> and cognitive ability (path coefficient =. 36, p <. 001); however, <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> level or change {{was not associated with}} cognitive change. Although a positive association between <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> and cognitive ability was reported—the likely precedents of this are discussed—there was no evidence that a higher level or maintenance of <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> was protective against cognitive decline across a 10 -year follow-up...|$|R

50|$|Data was {{collected}} {{from a group}} of Croatian citizens ranging across various age groups. The participants estimated their SWB and time spent participating in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities.</b> These <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> included active socializing and going out (sports, going to clubs, eating dinner out etc.), visiting cultural events (reading books, going to concerts, going to movies etc.), and family and home activities (going to church, visiting family, watching television etc.). The results of the study found specific <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> to be a predictor of SWB across age groups. For people ages 31-60 participation in visiting cultural events, family <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> and active socializing and going out contributed to SWB. A significant positive correlation was found between family <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> and SWB of men and women across different age groups. This study concluded that participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> lead to SWB, though the importance of such specific <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> vary across different age and genders. Essentially, people may improve their SWB by participating in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> especially in family and home activities.|$|R
