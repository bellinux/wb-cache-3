50|$|The <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> {{takes on}} {{more than a single}} mate (it is polygamous). The nesting habit of <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is to use the nest of another bird (brood parasitism). About fifteen {{different}} species of small bird are parasitised but the most common hosts are the Cape robin-chat (Cossypha caffra), the Cape wagtail (Motacilla capensis) and the white-throated robin-chat (Cossypha humeralis).The surrogate family then raise the chick. The bird lays eggs which are brown in colour and number between 20 eggs per season in different nests.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} in Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, DRC, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In Southern Africa {{it is a common}} {{breeding}} migrant, found throughout the area except for the drier west. The preferred habitats for the <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> are woodlands. The <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is normally seen by itself rather than in the company of birds of the same species.|$|E

50|$|Nests are raided {{by small}} mammals such as shrews and rodents, {{as well as}} more rarely by large mammals like civets and monkeys. They are also {{targeted}} by brood parasites, principally <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoos</b> (six out of 85 nests checked in South Africa) but also other species like African emerald cuckoos.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Cuculus solitarius) is {{a species}} of cuckoo in the family Cuculidae. It is a {{medium-sized}} bird found in Africa south of the Sahara. In Afrikaans, it is known as [...] "Piet-my-vrou", after its call.|$|E
50|$|First {{breeding}} {{can occur}} at {{two years of}} age, but typically later, as potential territories are usually occupied. The Cape robin-chat is a host of the <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo.</b> Predators often raid the nests, and replacement nests are common.|$|E
50|$|They are preyed {{on by the}} African goshawk, {{and their}} nest {{contents}} fall prey to the grey-headed bushshrike. They may be killed by ants or come under attack by territorial boubou shrikes. They are parasitised by the black cuckoo and emerald cuckoo, besides perhaps klaas's cuckoo and the <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo.</b>|$|E
50|$|The spotted ground-thrush is of {{particular}} note, as Pigeon Valley {{is one of the}} places where this endangered bird can be most reliably found in winter. It arrives typically in late March or early April, and is present until August or September; in 2015 it was present until 5 October. Summer migrants include, occasionally, black cuckoo, <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> and red-backed shrike.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is {{a medium-size}} cuckoo about 31 cm in length. The male has slate-grey upper parts, pale grey throat {{and sides of}} head and dark grey tail tipped with white. The breast is rufous or cinnamon, often with barring, and the belly is creamy-white or pale buff. The female is similar but the colour of the breast is duller and with {{variable}} amounts of barring.|$|E
50|$|The African {{pied wagtail}} is monogamous, the {{cup-shaped}} nest {{is lined with}} grass and feathers and is usually situated near water in a convenient tangle of sticks. In settlements the nest may be located on buildings. The nests of the African pied wagtail are parasitised by the <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> Cuculus solitarius and the diderick cuckoo Chrysococcyx caprius. While chicks have been recorded as prey of Burchell's coucal Centropus burchellii.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} monogamous. The oval nest is usually suspended, {{as with most}} sunbirds, or {{constructed}} inside a bush. The female incubates one to three dark-blotched, greenish eggs for two weeks. The chicks are fed by both parents until fledging time, and the chicks will for a time return to the nest to roost. The malachite sunbird is often double-brooded, and may be parasitised by Klaas's cuckoo or <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo.</b> It is territorial and aggressive when nesting, but highly gregarious when not breeding, forming flocks of over 1,000 birds.|$|E
50|$|The chorister robin-chat is {{generally}} solitary. This robin-chat skulks in dense foliage {{in the forest}} canopy. In winter it may forage on ground, but usually gleans insects from leaves. It also follows other fauna in its habitat that might disturb insects, which it then hawks. Its diet consists mainly of insects, millipedes, spiders, ticks and fruit in winter. The chorister robin-chat breeds from October to January; it peaks during November. There has been a record where it plays host to <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> a brood parasite.The chorister robin-chat moves from the interior to coastal forests in winter.|$|E
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in the spring, principally in October and November. The nest is usually on or near the ground, in a hollow stump, near the root of a vine or in a {{discarded}} utensil. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs, dry grasses and leaves and lined with rootlets, tendrils, stalks and fragments of leaves. There are usually two or three eggs and the incubation is done solely by the hen bird and lasts fourteen to fifteen days. Both parents feed the chicks, which leave the nest after about a fortnight but remain dependent on the adults for another six or seven weeks. The white-throated robin-chat is so sefwefwfeswfwefeswfewf metimes parasitised by the <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Cuculus solitarius).|$|E
40|$|Despite major {{differences}} between human and avian colour vision, {{previous studies of}} cuckoo egg mimicry have used human colour vision (or standards based thereon) to assess colour matching. Using ultraviolet-visible reflectance spectrophotometry (300 - 700 nm), we measured museum collections of eggs of the <b>red-chested</b> <b>cuckoo</b> and its hosts. The first three principal components explained more than 99 % {{of the variance in}} spectra, and measures of cuckoo host egg similarity derived from these transformations were compared with measures of cuckoo host egg similarity estimated by human observers unaware of the hypotheses we were testing. Monte Carlo methods were used to simulate laying of cuckoo eggs at random in nests. Results showed that host and cuckoo eggs were very highly matched for an ultraviolet versus greenness component, which was not detected by humans. Furthermore, whereas cuckoo and host were dissimilar in achromatic brightness, humans did not detect this difference. Our study thus reveals aspects of cuckoo-host egg colour matching which have hitherto not been described. These results suggest subtleties and complexities in the evolution of host-cuckoo egg mimicry that were not previously suspected. Our results also have the potential to explain the longstanding paradox that some host species accept cuckoo eggs that are non-mimetic to the human eye...|$|E
