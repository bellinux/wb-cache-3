Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a broader <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>parameters</b> than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E
