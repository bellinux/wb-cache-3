5|$|The Henschel version used a {{conventional}} hull design with sloped armour resembling {{the layout of}} the Panther tank. It had a <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine</b> and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimeter-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on transverse torsion bars, in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls, the wheels were only overlapping without being interleaved — the full Schachtellaufwerk rubber-rimmed roadwheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the TigerI and Panther.|$|E
25|$|The DMC-12 {{features}} {{a number of}} unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted stainless-steel body panels, and a <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before the {{rebranding}} to Scania in 1968, Scania-Vabis {{had delivered}} {{a very limited}} number of CR76 chassis-frameworks (less actual bodywork) with transversally <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine</b> for external bodying, based on the complete bus with the same name. From 1968 it was also delivered as a standard bus chassis known as BR110.|$|E
25|$|Following two designs styled simply monoplanes Nos. 1 and 2, ASL's third {{design was}} called the Valkyrie. All three were of tail-first or canard layout with <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines</b> and pusher propellors.|$|R
50|$|The BRDM-2 is {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} Hungarian D-442 FUG and D-944 PSzH amphibious scout cars, which also have <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines.</b> What distinguishes them from the BRDM-2 {{is that they have}} twin waterjets, whereas the BRDM-2 has a single triangular water jet.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} balance the twin <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines</b> properly, the forward {{fuselage}} was lengthened by 4 feet. In the A500, the front engine is balanced by the rear engine and empennage. In the A700, the longer front fuselage balances the rear engines and empennage.|$|R
25|$|Built {{mostly from}} aluminum, the XV-1 {{fuselage}} {{consisted of a}} streamlined tube mounted on skid landing gear, with a <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine</b> and a pusher propeller. It also had tapered stub wings mounted high on the fuselage. In turn, twin tailbooms and twin vertical surfaces, interconnected by a horizontal stabilizer elevator, were mounted to the wings. A three-bladed main rotor powered by blade tip pressure jets was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, above the wing roots.|$|E
25|$|Under license from Cierva in the 1920s and 1930s, the Pitcairn & Kellett {{companies}} made further innovations. Late-model autogyros {{patterned after}} Etienne Dormoy's Buhl A-1 Autogyro and Igor Bensen's designs feature a <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine</b> and propeller in a pusher configuration. The term Autogiro was a trademark of the Cierva Autogiro Company, and the term Gyrocopter {{was used by}} E. Burke Wilford who developed the Reiseler Kreiser feathering rotor equipped gyroplane {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. The latter term was later adopted as a trademark by Bensen Aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, the 3-series was introduced, {{continuing}} the main {{models of the}} 2-series. In 1990, the new L113 became available, with a longitudinally <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine</b> which was inclined 60° to the left, to make a lower height than the K113. The 4-series was launched in 1997, continuing all model characteristics from the 3-series, but {{with all of them}} being just modular configurations of the basic chassis. The 8.5-litre engine was replaced by a 9-litre, and the 11-litre was replaced by an 11.7-litre. They were joined by a 10.6-litre engine in 2000.|$|E

50|$|Claveau’s first “4CV” model {{featured}} an aerodynamic silhouette and {{was offered}} as a sedan/saloon or as a cabriolet roadster. A choice of <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines</b> was offered, either an air-cooled four-cylinder unit or a two-cylinder two-stroke unit. In 1930, a model was offered with a front-mounted engine and front-wheel drive.|$|R
5000|$|Gutbrod was a German {{manufacturer}} of cars, motorcycles and small agricultural machinery. The firm {{was founded in}} Ludwigsburg by Wilhelm Gutbrod in 1926. It originally built [...] "Standard" [...] branded motorcycles. In 1933 the company relocated to the nearby Stuttgart suburb of Feuerbach, and from 1933 to 1935, Standard Superior cars were built with <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine</b> {{made the}} {{aircraft}} ideal for ground-attack since fire {{would be coming}} from the front-bottom quarter and was less likely to hit the engine and its cooling systems. The arrangement proved to be very vulnerable to attacks from above and behind and nearly any hit on the fuselage from an attacking enemy fighter was virtually guaranteed to disable the cooling system and lead to the prompt demise of the engine and thus the aircraft. Flying at its upper altitude limits, the Airacobra was extremely vulnerable to any enemy fighter with decent high altitude performance.|$|E
25|$|Alpine Renault {{continued}} {{to develop their}} range of models all through the 1980s. The A310 was the next modern interpretation of the A110. The Alpine A310 was a sports car with a <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine</b> and was initially powered by a four-cylinder 1.6 L sourced Renault 17 TS/Gordini engine. In 1976 the A310 was restyled by Robert Opron and fitted with the more powerful and newly developed V6 PRV engine. The 2.6 L motor was modified by Alpine with a four-speed manual gearbox. Later they would use a Five-speed manual gearbox and with the group 4 model get a higher tune with more cubic capacity and 3 twin barrel Weber carburetors.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Deere {{replaced}} the 6620, 7720, and 8820 {{with a new}} line of completely redesigned 'Maximizer' combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines were completely redesigned and featured a center-mounted cab, <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine,</b> and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, PTO shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.|$|E
5000|$|The Vickers VC10, (first flight 1962) {{which was}} {{designed}} to meet BOAC requirements for a large airliner that could operate medium range flights from short runways in southern Asia and Africa. The <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines</b> gave a more efficient wing and made them less vulnerable to runway debris. The resulting high fuel consumption compared to the contemporary Boeing 707 prompted all other major airlines to dismiss the VC10.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, Nihon Diesel Industries, Ltd, in Kawaguchi, Japan on the {{outskirts}} of Tokyo was established. The company started production of KD-series 2-cycle diesel engines. In 1940 production of 4.5-ton-payload TT6 series trucks started. In development of 7.5-ton-payload TN93 series trucks, featuring the largest payload capacity in the Japanese market, and the nation's first monocoque-type BR3 series buses with <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines.</b> In 1949 development of 7.5-ton-payload TN93 series trucks started.|$|R
50|$|The two-door Up concept debuted at the 2007 IAA International Motor Show Germany in Germany, with a rear-wheel drive, <b>rear-mounted,</b> boxer <b>engine</b> and 18 inch wheels.|$|R
2500|$|Development {{began in}} 1936 when Büssing-NAG {{was given a}} {{contract}} to develop an advanced half-track chassis with a <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine</b> specifically designed {{for use as a}} tank destroyer. Four prototypes of the HKP 902 chassis, No. 9009-2012, were built, two of which had Rheinmetall-Borsig's [...] L/40.8 gun mounted in an open-topped, low-profile turret.|$|E
2500|$|The Lamborghini Countach is a rear mid-engined, V12 {{sports car}} {{produced}} by Italian car manufacturer Lamborghini from 1974 to 1990. Its design pioneered and popularized the wedge-shaped, sharply angled look popular in many high-performance sports cars. It also popularized the [...] "cab forward" [...] design concept, which pushes the passenger compartment forward {{to accommodate a}} larger <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Clément was a {{director}} of Panhard-Levassor, and when the factory could not meet the production requirements for circa 500 units of the 1898 'voiture légère' ('dog cart') model, he undertook manufacture under licence at his factory in Levallois-Perret. It was designed by airship pioneer Commandant Arthur Krebs, of Panhard, and used a tubular chassis, centre-pivot steering, near-horizontal [...] <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine</b> with automatic inlet valve and hot-tube ignition, driving through a constant-mesh gear-train, and final drive by side chains; early models had no reverse gear.|$|E
5000|$|The first truck, of 1.5 tons payload, {{was sold}} to London's British Motor Syndicate Ltd on October 1, 1896. Its <b>rear-mounted</b> Phoenix <b>engine</b> {{produced}} [...] at 700 rpm.|$|R
25|$|In 1986, MD-11 was launched, an {{improved}} and upgraded version of DC-10. The MD-11 {{was the most}} advanced trijet aircraft to be developed. It sold 200 units, but was discontinued in 2001 after the merger with Boeing as it competed with the Boeing 777. The final commercial aircraft design {{to be made by}} McDonnell Douglas came in 1988. The MD-90 was a stretched version of the MD-80, equipped with International Aero Engines V2500 turbofans, the largest <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines</b> ever on a commercial jet. The MD-95, a modern regional airliner closely resembling the DC-9-30, was the last McDonnell Douglas designed commercial jet produced.|$|R
25|$|Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the accident. A separate criminal investigation was opened to investigate allegations of breaching transport and fire safety rules. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder were recovered from the wreckage of the aircraft. Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations stated that the initial investigations pointed towards an electrical short circuit being the cause of the fire, which started in the central area of the fuselage, ahead of the <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines.</b> The fire started between frames 65 and 68. In a statement issued on 4 January, the MAK ruled out the engines or auxiliary power unit as the cause of the fire.|$|R
2500|$|Prototypes {{of the car}} {{called the}} [...] "KdF-Wagen" [...] (German: Kraft durch Freude– [...] "Strength through Joy"), {{appeared}} from 1938 onwards (the first cars had been produced in Stuttgart). The car already had its distinctive round shape and air-cooled, flat-four, <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine.</b> The VW car {{was just one of}} many KdF programs, which included things such as tours and outings. The prefix Volks— ("People's") was not just applied to cars, but also to other products in Germany; the [...] "Volksempfänger" [...] radio receiver for instance. On May 28, 1937, Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH ("Company for the Preparation of the German Volkswagen Ltd."), or Gezuvor for short, was established by the Deutsche Arbeitsfront in Berlin. More than a year later, on September 16, 1938, it was renamed to Volkswagenwerk GmbH.|$|E
2500|$|The Valiant {{was less}} radical in {{configuration}} than General Motors' compact Chevrolet Corvair, {{which had a}}n air-cooled <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engine,</b> but was considered more aesthetically daring than the also-new Falcon which had a more conventional look; the Valiant boasted a radical design that continued Exner's Forward Look styling with [...] "sleek, crisp lines which flow forward in a dart or wedge shape." [...] The flush-sided appearance was a carried-over feature from Chrysler's Ghia-built D'Elegance and Adventurer concept cars which also gave the Valiant additional inches of interior room. With its semi-fastback and lengthy hood line, many automotive publications of the time thought the Valiant's styling was European inspired. While the Valiant was all new, specific design elements tied it to other contemporary Chrysler products. Features such as the canted tailfins tipped with cat's-eye shaped tail lamps and the simulated spare tire pressing (or continental tire) on the deck lid were thematically similar to those on the Imperial and the 300F. According to Exner, the stamped wheel design was used not only to establish identity with other Chryslers, but to [...] "dress up the rear deck area without detracting {{from the look of}} directed forward motion." ...|$|E

50|$|At 18:42 EST, the DC-9 {{touched down}} in a field within the airport boundary, about 0.5 mi from the {{threshold}} of runway 18R. It then crashed through the airport fence and impacted several trees, breaking apart while skidding down a residential street {{that was on the}} airport boundary. The plane broke into four major sections; the front 40 ft of the airplane, including the cockpit and the unoccupied first class passenger cabin, came to rest in the middle of Wallace Neel Road. The rear section of the fuselage, including the tail and the <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines,</b> came to rest in the carport of a house.|$|R

50|$|These engines were {{installed}} on the airliner via an unconventional manner, having been mounted above the wings upon pylons at a mid-wing position. This arrangement had several advantages, such as avoiding the structural weight penalties imposed by <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>engines</b> and the potential ingestion risks present when engines were mounted low down underneath the wings. The engine configuration allowed {{the adoption of a}} short, sturdy undercarriage, which was specially suited to performing operations from austere or otherwise poorly-prepared runways. The position of the engine over the wing, compared to under-wing, also shielded people on the ground from intake noise during flyovers; this shielding effect is also present for aft-mounted engines.|$|R
