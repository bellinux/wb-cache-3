Acute <b>radiodermatitis</b> is a burn injury that varies in severity according to both treatment and inherent patient factors. Most acute <b>radiodermatitis</b> reactions resolve after several weeks but some reactions persist and can cause complications. Late-onset <b>radiodermatitis</b> is characterized by telangiectasia that forms on atrophic and fragile skin. These <b>radiodermatitis</b> reactions can have a significant negative impact on concomitant and subsequent therapeutic protocols and most particularly on the patient’s quality of life. Today, treatment of <b>radiodermatitis</b> reactions is in its infancy. Although there is insufficient evidence available to form recommendations that would prevent or reduce <b>radiodermatitis,</b> some advances have been made using low level light therapy (LLLT) or vascular lasers to control the symptoms. Some recent preclinical and clinical research suggests that LLLT has biostimulating properties which allow the tissues to regenerate and heal faster, reduce inflammation, and prevent fibrosis. Also, in late-onset <b>radiodermatitis</b> pulsed dye laser treatment {{has been shown to be}} beneficial in clearing radiation-induced telangiectasia. In the absence of evidence-based recommendations, the objective of this paper is to review how to prevent or manage the symptoms of <b>radiodermatitis</b> reactions.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{study was to investigate}} the incidence and risk factors of secondary infected <b>radiodermatitis</b> in patients receiving radiotherapy and to determine isolated microorganisms’ resistance profiles to different antimicrobial agents. Materials and Methods: The study comprised 62 patients admitted to the Regional Training and Research Hospital from January 2009 to January 2010. <b>Radiodermatitis</b> was graded according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria version 3. 0. Potential risk factors for secondary infection were recorded and evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: In 62 patients, grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 <b>radiodermatitis</b> were observed in 33 (53. 2 %), 11 (17. 7 %), 8 (12. 9 %) and 10 (16. 2 %) patients, respectively. Skin infection secondary to <b>radiodermatitis</b> occurred in 14 patients (infected patients), 21. 4 %, 21. 4 % and 57. 2 % of whom had grade 2, 3 and 4 <b>radiodermatitis,</b> respectively. Forty-eight patients were found to be colonized with micoorganisms (colonized patients). In the univariate analysis, concurrent endocrine therapy and <b>radiodermatitis</b> grade differed significantly between infected and colonized patients (p< 0. 05). Multivariate analyses showed that the <b>radiodermatitis</b> grade was an independent risk factor for the acquisition of infection (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Background, <b>Radiodermatitis</b> {{following}} invasive radiographic procedures {{has been}} reported recently in the literature, mainly after cardiac catheterization. Only two publications are related to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), a recently introduced angiographic technique for achieving portal decompression. Case reports, We report four cases of <b>radiodermatitis</b> following a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. A 63 -year-old woman developed in 1997 a chronic <b>radiodermatitis</b> under the right scapula; a shunt was placed in 1992; from 1992 to 1997, she had a second transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and thereafter four dilatations. A 50 -year-old man developed in 1994 a radio-induced ulceration in the same area, one week after a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; the same year the shunt was expanded. The patient had a second transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in 1995; at that time, the cutaneous lesions evolved into chronic <b>radiodermatitis.</b> In 1995 a 67 -year-old man developed chronic <b>radiodermatitis</b> under the right scapula; a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was placed in 1992; endoprosthesis was dilated four rimes from 1992 to 1995. A 82 -year-old women developed in 1993 an ulcerated <b>radiodermatitis,</b> five days after a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Discussion. The major advantage of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt {{is the ability to}} provide portosystemic decompression without major surgery. However, radiation exposure during the procedure is sometimes very high. Otherwise the prosthesis is readily blocked up; this side-effect requires repeated angiographic dilatations. The procedures were very long by all our patients. This explains the high absorbed radiation doses. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and cardiac catheterization are not the only procedures at risk.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{two patients}} in whom chronic <b>radiodermatitis</b> with therapy-resistant ulceration {{of the right}} scapular region developed, following percutaneous coronary intervention with fluoroscopic imaging. Contrary to most reported cases in the literature, which involve numerous cardiac catheterization procedures, in both patients described here the total radiation dose was given during two successive procedures, involving difficult and prolonged coronary intervention with stent implantation. In both cases, local treatment of the ulcerative lesions was insufficient, necessitating excision of the <b>radiodermatitis</b> area and replacement with a skin graft, with good therapeutic result. The incidence of <b>radiodermatitis</b> after percutaneous coronary interventions is rising with the increasing number and complexity of these procedures. The main risk factor is a long duration of fluoroscopy using the same incidence. The skin lesions encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from erythema, telangiectasia, atrophy, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation to necrosis, chronic ulceration and squamous cell carcinoma. The lesions can appear from 15 days to 10 years after the procedure. To prevent radiation-induced injury, the radiation dose has to be limited and monitored.

40|$|Background: Breast {{neoplasms}} are {{the second}} most common type of cancer worldwide, and radiation therapy is a key component of their treatment. Acute skin reactions {{are one of the most}} common side effects of radiation therapy, and prevention of this adverse event has been investigated in several studies. However, a clinically applicable, preventative treatment remains unavailable. It has been demonstrated that application of a low-power laser can promote tissue repair. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an indium gallium aluminum phosphorus (InGaAIP) laser operated at 660 nm in preventing <b>radiodermatitis</b> in women undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer. Methods/Design: This is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial. A total of 52 patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer (stages I to III) will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group to receive laser therapy (n = 26) or a control group to receive a placebo (n = 26). the laser or placebo will be applied five days a week, immediately before each radiotherapy session. Skin reactions will then be graded weekly by a nurse, a radiotherapist, and an oncologist (all of whom will be blinded) using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) developed by the National Cancer Institute and the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria developed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Patients will also answer a modified visual analogue scale for pain (a self-evaluation questionnaire). Primary and secondary outcomes will be the prevention of <b>radiodermatitis</b> and pain secondary to <b>radiodermatitis,</b> respectively. Discussion: the ideal tool for preventing <b>radiodermatitis</b> is an agent that mediates DNA repair or promotes cell proliferation. Application of a low-power laser has been shown to promote tissue repair by reducing inflammation and inducing collagen synthesis. Moreover, this treatment approach has not been associated with adverse events and is cost-effective. Thus, the results of this ongoing trial may establish whether use of a low-power laser represents an ideal treatment option for the prevention of <b>radiodermatitis.</b> Hosp Canc Barretos, Dept Oncol, BR- 14784400 Barretos, SP, BrazilUniv Vale Sapuca, Dept Physiotherapy, BR- 37550000 Pouso Alegre, MG, BrazilHosp Canc Barretos, Dept Radiotherapy, BR- 14784400 Barretos, SP, BrazilOncominas, Dept Radiotherapy, BR- 37550 Pouso Alegre, MG, BrazilUniv Vale Sapuca, Dept Plast Surg, BR- 37550000 Pouso Alegre, MG, BrazilUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, Dept Plast Surg, BR- 04024002 São Paulo, BrazilUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, Dept Plast Surg, BR- 04024002 São Paulo, BrazilWeb of Scienc...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Skin is a {{specific}} target of new cancer treatments. Xerosis, inflammatory lesions and <b>radiodermatitis</b> are the most frequent skin reactions. They can decries patients {{quality of life and}} compromise their compliance with cancer therapy. Vitamin E is well known for its antioxidant action, for which it is used in many inflammatory skin diseases. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a medical device based on vitamin E for the treatment of xerosis, of consequent effects of papulopustular rash and <b>radiodermatitis.</b> Materials and methods. We selected 20 women between 35 and 60 years old, affected by xerosis, consequent effects of papulopustular rash and <b>radiodermatitis.</b> The protocol provided for the application of a topical product consisting of tocopherols and tocotrienols to 10 % to 0. 3 % twice a day to the affected area. The evaluations were carried out at the beginning of treatment (TO) and after 40 days (T 1) using the following methods: photographic assessment; clinical evaluation; evaluation of Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) by corneometry; assessment of skin color by colorimeter X-Rite̊ 968 according to the L *a*b* system; assessment of tolerability with a questionnaire; assessment of adherence to therapy through the completion of a daily diary. Statistical analysis was performed by calculating the Student's t. Results. Photographic evaluation shows a significant improvement of the lesions from T 0 to T 1. Clinical evaluation showed a good improvement in 13 of 20 patients (65 %). TEWL in patients with xerosis went from a value of 19. 86 at T 0 to a mean value of 14. 62 at T 1. The outcomes of patients with papulopustular rash presented at T 0 an average value of TEWL of 17, 25, which was of 15. 42 at T 1. In patients with previous <b>radiodermatitis,</b> the TEWL was 35. 06 at T 0 and it was 13. 23 at T 1. Colorimetry showed a L * value of 58, 06 at T 0 while it was 60. 04 at T 1 in patients with xerosis.

The present study concerns the protective effect of a 1 % sucralfate lotion. We propose joint fundamental and clinical points of view. METHODS: The free radical scavenging capacity of sucralfate was measured with electron spin resonance and was supported by theoretical calculations. The clinical effects of sucralfate lotion were evaluated on 21 women treated for breast cancer. Breast skin response was evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 Gy, according to (1) the radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) acute toxicity scale and (2) spectrophotometry data obtained with X-Rite SP 60. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sucralfate appeared as a relatively poor free radical scavenger (compared to reference compounds such as vitamin E). The sucralfate-containing lotion {{used in the present study}} did not provide systematic <b>radiodermatitis</b> prevention. Spectrophotometric evaluation of the skin response to irradiation appeared to be a very effective and more sensitive technique than the RTOG scale. Its use should be recommended to study cutaneous radioprotective action...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, lipofilling has {{established}} itself {{as one of}} the most effective and least invasive techniques to treat connective dystrophy subsequent to radiotherapy. We report the case of a patient diagnosed with intraductal carcinoma of the right breast in 1996, at the age of 41. The patient underwent quadrantectomy with ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Four years later, a recurrence led the patient to undergo a subcutaneous mastectomy and immediate reconstruction, involving the submuscular insertion of a permanent implant. In 2007 the patient suffered both <b>radiodermatitis</b> and capsular contracture around the implant, causing constant pain and significant functional limitation. She first took a leukotriene inhibitor (Zafirlukast, 20 mg daily for 8 months) to reduce the capsular contracture. She then underwent lipofilling (Coleman’s technique) of the area affected by <b>radiodermatitis,</b> in which the skin was considerably thinned and visibly ischemic. A second session followed four months later. Clinical, photographic and ultrasound examination revealed clear and lasting thickening of the superficial tissues, increased coverage of the implant, and reduced skin discoloration and tension...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{angiography}} produces one of {{the highest}} radiation exposures of any commonly used diagnostic x ray procedure. Recently, serious radiation induced skin injuries have been reported after repeated therapeutic interventional procedures using prolonged fluoroscopic imaging. Two male patients, aged 62  and 71  years, in whom chronic <b>radiodermatitis</b> developed one to two years after two consecutive cardiac catheterisation procedures are reported. Both patients had undergone lengthy procedures using prolonged fluoroscopic guidance in a limited number of projections. The resulting skin lesions were preceded, in one case, by an acute erythema and took the form of a delayed pigmented telangiectatic, indurated, or ulcerated plaque in the upper back or below the axilla whose site corresponded to the location of the x ray tube during cardiac catheterisation. Cutaneous side effects of radiation exposure result from direct damage to the irradiated tissue and have known thresholds. The diagnosis of radiation induced skin injury relies essentially on clinical and histopathological findings, location of skin lesions, and careful medical history. Interventional cardiologists should be aware of this complication, because chronic <b>radiodermatitis</b> may result in painful and resistant ulceration and eventually in squamous cell carcinoma.    Keywords: catheterisation; angiography; radiation; radiodermatitis; skin injur...|$|E
40|$|Calendula is {{a topical}} agent {{derived from a}} plant of the {{marigold}} family Calendula Officinalis. Containing numerous polyphenolic antioxidants, calendula has been studied in both the laboratory and clinical setting for the use in treating and preventing radiation induced skin toxicity. Despite strong evidence in the laboratory supporting calendula’s mechanism of action in preventing radiation induced skin toxicity, clinical studies have demonstrated mixed results. In light of the controversy surrounding the efficacy of calendula in treating and preventing <b>radiodermatitis,</b> the topic warrants further discussion...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Radiodermatitis</b> in its {{acute and}} chronic presentations {{represents}} {{a set of}} specific adverse effects resulting from ionizing radiations. Skin-field cancerization is another condition associated to or independent of clinically recognizable <b>radiodermatitis.</b> This condition leads {{to the risk of}} later occurrence of skin malignancies. METHOD: Review of the current and most pertinent peer-reviewed publications with the addition of personal perspectives. RESULT/CONCLUSION: The presence of field cancerization encompasses subclinical changes, precursors of malignant alterations, as well as single or multiple primary neoplasms and local neoplastic recurrences. These tumours commonly require repeated treatments over time and cause significant morbidity. In general, specific tumour-directed treatments using ablative or destructive techniques require regular follow-up and screening for disclosing any further neoplasm. Another strategy corresponding to field-directed treatment targets a larger area of irradiated skin {{to reduce the risk of}} developing second neoplasms and local recurrences. Imiquimod is an immune response modifier of the imidazoquinoline class. It is the archetype drug used to control skin-field carcinogenesis. Cryotherapy, topical 5 -fluorouracil, diclofenac and conventional photodynamic therapy are supposed to bring effects differing by their indications, healing rates and remission rates. The possibility of inducting a radiation recall dermatitis by some of these therapeutic modalities has not been thoroughly evaluated, and at present cannot be ruled out with confidence.
