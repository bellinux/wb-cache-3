The inclusion of drug trafficking has generated significant controversy in Colombia.

40|$|The ACT Department of Justice and Community Safety {{commissioned}} the Australian Institute of Criminology to undertake research {{in relation to}} sexual assault and <b>related</b> <b>offences</b> in the ACT. The objectives of this three-stage project were to: examine the feasibility of an integrated justice information system by focusing on sexual assault and related offences; gauge the type of sexual assault and <b>related</b> <b>offences</b> data available from ACT criminal justice agencies; develop a minimum crime and justice dataset on sexual assault and related offences; and, examine a snapshot of sexual assault and <b>related</b> <b>offences</b> in order to explore {{the nature of these}} offences. This report is the product of stage three of the project and is divided into two parts: the first addresses data tracking, and the second provides a snapshot of sexual assault and <b>related</b> <b>offences</b> in the ACT. This report on the project aims to: outline the processes involved in compiling data across the ACT criminal justice system and highlight the key lessons learnt regarding interagency information tracking; contextualise the current project, by discussing key concepts and issues linked to sexual assault and <b>related</b> <b>offences</b> and providing statistical information drawn from a range of sources; provide a snapshot of sexual assault and <b>related</b> <b>offences</b> in the ACT, including a discussion of attrition from the AC...|$|R

50|$|In R v MacKenzie, the accused, Benjamin Cain MacKenzie, {{was charged}} with {{possession}} of a controlled drug {{for the purpose of}} trafficking. Police pulled MacKenzie over during a highway traffic stop and, {{through the use of a}} sniffer-dog, discovered a large amount of marihuana. MacKenzie alleged that the dog's sniff violated his section 8 Charter rights against unreasonable search and seizure, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion that he was involved in a drug <b>related</b> <b>offence.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Northern Ireland, Diplock Courts tried anyone {{charged with}} a {{politically}} <b>related</b> <b>offence</b> and provided for delays in permitting legal access to suspects where the suspect could be interrogated for up to seven days.

One notable case, of many, arising from the British political courts in Northern Ireland is that of Belfast man Christy Walsh case.|$|E
50|$|The provinces have {{continued}} to seek ways of controlling prostitution without infringing Parliament's jurisdiction over the Criminal Code. The Traffic and Highway Acts in several provinces have been amended to allow police to seize, impound and sell vehicles of clients. Manitoba enacted this in 1999. In 2001 and 2002, Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan followed. Ontario went further in 2002 with a civil law allowing the province to ask the courts to freeze, seize and forfeit to the Crown property that is the proceeds of unlawful activity including prostitution, without involving criminal charges. Other provincial Acts authorize the suspension of a driver’s licence on conviction of a prostitution <b>related</b> <b>offence</b> involving a motor vehicle.|$|E

50|$|The Victorian Drug Court {{is located}} in Dandenong and {{services}} defendants within a specific geographical catchment area. Only adult defendants who are addicted to illicit drugs, likely to be imprisoned for a drug <b>related</b> <b>offence</b> and prepared to plead guilty are eligible. If {{they are willing to}} enter the program, they are placed on a Drug Treatment Order. These orders have two components; a custodial sentence of not more than two years and a treatment and supervision component. Failure to compete the order renders the participant liable for re-sentencing. Other Victorian courts can place defendants within the Court Referral and Evaluation for Drug Intervention and Treatment (CREDIT) program. The 12-week program provides assessment, treatment and support for defendants on bail.|$|E
50|$|Anyone {{convicted of}} (or who pleads guilty to) Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle Causing Death {{is subject to}} a maximum term of 14 years, but can be sentenced to up to life {{imprisonment}} if the <b>related</b> <b>offence</b> is a street racing one. A sentence of greater than 14 years, on the death-by-dangerous-driving charge, can only otherwise be imposed {{if any of the}} remaining charges of which the offender is convicted carry a maximum prison sentence of more than 14 years (e.g. a conviction for Causing death by criminal negligence, as in R v Smith, because that charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment) or the judge decides to sentence the offender to serve a sentence, on a different charge (e.g. hit and run), consecutively to the death-by-dangerous-driving sentence.|$|E
50|$|The {{court will}} not {{normally}} accept {{the testimony of}} a single witness, no matter how credible, as being the truth unless there is further evidence via corroboration. It {{is worth noting that}} not every witness presented to the court must have the same story, or be believable. Even if you have ten witnesses with eight of them presenting contradicting stories, if two witnesses provide a similar version of events which ties in with the <b>related</b> <b>offence,</b> guilt can be found based on the two witnesses alone. It will make the prosecution harder for the Procurator Fiscal as the defence will utilise this contradiction to sway the Sheriff, but otherwise this is acceptable evidence. Commonly this can be found in colours of vehicles, where many witnesses will have a distorted recollection of the actual colour.|$|E

[...] The punishment was unprecedented, the last time someone {{was removed from the}} race for a non-doping <b>related</b> <b>offence</b> was Tom Steels in 1997, for throwing his water bottle at a competitor during the sprint finish — an offence rated much more severe and unsportsman-like.

3000|$|For a given {{city with}} R regions (known as meshblocks or census regions), {{we aim to}} {{identify}} the regions where {{a certain type of}} crime event will happen in the next time interval. Several types of crime event are studied including Theft, Unlawful Entry, Drug Offence, Traffic <b>Related</b> <b>Offence,</b> Fraud, and Assault. The criminal offence which includes the illegal taking of other persons belonging without consent to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner is defined as Theft. When a person enters a building (e.g. office, bank, shop etc.) with an intention to commit crime can be classified as Unlawful Entry. Drug Offence includes any form of sale, dealing, importing or exporting, manufacture or cultivation of illegal drugs or other substances.

They are the Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression Model (LR), and the introduced ensemble method (Ensemble). In particular, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is used in SVM. RBF is a real-valued function which calculates the Euclidean distance of the input variables from its origin [51].
