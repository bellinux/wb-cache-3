The aim {{of this study was to}} compare HRQoL in diabetic patients with and <b>without</b> <b>foot</b> ulcers and to determine demographic and clinical factors influencing HRQoL. Methods: There were no variables affecting HRQoL except for gender in diabetic patients <b>without</b> <b>foot</b> ulcers. Demographic and clinical variables were recorded and HRQoL was evaluated using the Short Form 36 (SF- 36) survey for all participants. The summary physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) and eight domains of HRQoL were compared in the two groups. Linear regression analysis was also used to investigate sociodemographic and clinical characteristics as predictors of quality of life as measured by SF- 36. Results: The overall score, PCS, and MCS, were significantly higher in patients <b>without</b> diabetic <b>foot</b> ulcers. Except for gender, none of the variables affected HRQoL in diabetic patients <b>without</b> <b>foot</b> ulcers. Male gender had a higher score in all domains of quality of life than female gender in diabetic patients <b>without</b> <b>foot</b> ulcers. Living alone, a low educational level, and having at least one complication were all associated with a lower HRQoL score in patients with foot ulcers. High-grade ulcers determined by Wagner&rsquo;s classification and poor glycemic control as measured by HbA 1 C predicted HRQoL impairment in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Conclusion: Because Wagner&rsquo;s grade was one of the strongest variables associated with HRQoL, this scale is recommended for monitoring of patients with diabetic foot ulcers in order to prevent continuing deterioration of HRQoL by treatment of foot ulcers at an earlier stage.

40|$|Background. Specific {{regions of}} the foot are {{responsible}} for the gait tasks of weight acceptance, single-limb support, and forward propulsion. With region foot pain, gait abnormalities may arise and affect the plantar pressure and force pattern utilized. Therefore, this study’s purpose was to evaluate plantar pressure and force pattern differences between adults with and <b>without</b> region-specific <b>foot</b> pain. Methods. Plantar pressure and force data were collected on Framingham Foot Study members while walking barefoot at a self-selected pace. Foot pain was evaluated by self-report and grouped by foot region (toe, forefoot, midfoot, or rearfoot) or regions (two or three or more regions) of pain. Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression with generalized estimating equations was used to determine associations between <b>feet</b> with and <b>without</b> <b>foot</b> pain. Results. Individuals with distal foot (forefoot or toes) pain had similar maximum vertical forces under the pain region, while those with proximal foot (rearfoot or midfoot) pain had different maximum vertical forces compared to those <b>without</b> regional <b>foot</b> pain (referent). During walking, there were significant differences in plantar loading and propulsion ranging from 2 % to 4 % betwee...|$|R
