40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} properties of Milano <b>rib</b> <b>knit</b> fabric reinforced composites have been previously characterized [1 – 5]. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to theoretically pre-dict the stiffness and tensile strength of these composites. Attention has been focused on simplicity and user-friendliness. The complicated Milano <b>rib</b> <b>knit</b> fabric structure has been approximated by several simpler plain stitches, for which an analytical geometric model is applicable. After discretizing the representative volume element of the Milano fabric com-posite into sub-elements which contain only straight yarn segments, the overall stiffness and strength of the composite are obtained by assembling the contributions of a number of unidirectional fibrous composites. A recently developed micromechanics model, the bridging model [6], is applied to estimate the stiffness and strength of each unidirectional composite. The predicted stiffness and strength of the Milano fabric composites have been compared with the available experimental results. Reasonably good correlation has been found between the predictions and the experiments.

Three twist levels of 900 [*]turns/m, 1050 [*]turns/m, and 1200 [*]turns/m with respective twist multipliers of 3. 6, 4. 2, and 4. 8 are used.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that synthetic fibres provide high UV protection capability of textile products, while cellulose fibres have low UV absorption capacity. However, textile materials made {{of synthetic fibres}} are {{not considered to be}} comfortable for wear in warm weather, whereas cellulose-based textile materials are considered to be much more comfortable to wear, especially in the summer months. For this research, the idea was to produce specially blended knitted fabrics from staple/fi lament hybrid yarns in order to provide clothing materials with eff ective UV protection properties, keeping satisfactory comfort properties as well. To obtain hybrid yarns, folding technique was used. The Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), as a quantitative measure of the eff ectiveness of the material to protect human skin against UV radiation, was determined for the <b>rib</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics by in vitro test method according to the European standard. The physical properties of the knitted fabrics related to their UV protection properties: bulk density, porosity and air permeability were also determined. The hybrid yarns, from which the <b>rib</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics were produced, having always hemp yarn as a staple component, caused the differences in UV protection capability of the <b>rib</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics through the influence of a filament spun component. The hybrid yarn aggregation within knitted fabrics also fibrestheir UPF values. Even though the pure hemp knitted fabric was marked as “UPF> 50 ” (according to European standard) due to natural pigments and lignin in hemp fibres which act as UV absorbers, most of the hemp/fi lament hybrid yarn knitted fabrics exhibited even higher UPF. Therefore, the engineering approach proposed in this research was confi rmed as an eff ective way to design clothing materials with optimal UV protection capability and other wear comfort parameters...|$|R
40|$|The mode I inter-laminar {{fracture}} toughness of advanced knitted textile composites was investigated. Two complex weft-knitted glass fabrics {{were selected for}} the study: a triple <b>rib</b> <b>knit</b> and a Milano knit were impregnated with a tough epoxy resin and tested using a double cantilever beam geometry. For both knitted composites, {{the influence of the}} growth direction was studied by investigating crack propagation in both the wale and course directions. The {{fracture toughness}} was quantified by determining the critical strain energy release rate (G(IC)) using the modified beam theory. The specimens had to be stiffened with layers of glass woven composites added on top and bottom of the beams. This was necessary in order to avoid plastic deformation of the beams and crack deviation out of the inter-laminar plane. The results clearly showed that knitted fabric composites have exceptional inter-laminar fracture toughness properties, namely, more than 7000 J/m(2). The origin of the high G(IC) values, which are superior to woven or UD laminates, lies in the very complex fabric architecture. The three-dimensional loop structure induces various energy consuming mechanisms, which do not occur in other composites. Toughening mechanisms such as crack branching, friction, yam bridging and breakage were identified using scanning electron microscopy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Different {{materials}} {{have been used}} to fabricate summer (warm environment) clothing, such as cotton, nylon, neoprene, polyester and 100 % synthetic fibers.

30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose yarn knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier yarn knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double plied yarn had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied yarn fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while carded yarn fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed yarn <b>rib</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|R
