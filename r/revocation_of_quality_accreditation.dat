The conclusion of the work is the assertion of the need to develop a new form <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>accreditation</b> in the form of international accreditation.

40|$|Introduction: Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} {{is a major}} morbid outcome among {{intensive care}} unit (ICU) patients. Providing oral care for intubated patients is an important task by the ICU nursing staff in reducing the mortality and morbidity. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the attitudes and knowledge of ICU nurses regarding oral care delivery to critically ill patients in Saudi Arabian ICUs. The findings were further correlated to the presence <b>of</b> healthcare <b>quality</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> the institution. Materials and Methods: The nurses′ knowledge, attitudes, and healthcare <b>quality</b> <b>accreditation</b> status <b>of</b> the hospital were recorded. Two hundred fifteen nurses conveniently selected from 10 random hospitals were included in this study from Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. This is a cross-sectional study {{in the form of a}} questionnaire. Results: When comparing the knowledge of the participants to their level of education, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups of nurses. The majority of the nurses agreed that the oral cavity is difficult to clean and that oral care delivery is a high priority for mechanically ventilated patients. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the attitudes between nurses working in accredited and nonaccredited hospitals. Conclusion: The presence <b>of</b> healthcare <b>quality</b> <b>accreditation</b> did not reflect any significance in attitudes or knowledge of the ICU nurses in regard to mechanically ventilated patients. Factors affecting oral care delivery should be evaluated on the personal and institutional level to achieve better understanding of them...|$|R

The study, based on interviews with Chief Librarians, investigates the adoption <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>accreditation</b> method as a ground work towards effective management of the library, thus meeting customer expectations. The study involved libraries of 3 public Universities that have obtained the MS ISO 9001 : 2000 certification. The study {{focuses on the}} problems faced during initial stages of preparation for certification, establishment <b>of</b> the <b>quality</b> system, maintenance and benefits of the system. Generally all libraries agree that the standards can be effectively used by libraries with correct interpretation of the requirements. The main reason for seeking the certification is ‘to improve library’s quality image in the university’ and ‘the mandate from the Government’. The major problem faced in the initial stages were ‘resistance from staff because of their lack of understanding of ISO requirements’ and ‘too much documentation’. However these libraries managed to overcome these problems through vigorous training sessions. The benefits reaped from the QMS based on MS ISO 9001 : 2000 are evident, though not exactly as high as the library had expected initially. This study has shown some insights to the QMS of university libraries as a commitment to quality services for students, staff and researchers...|$|R

The main goal of the research was to assess which were {{the most commonly used}} ET protocols or 'best practices' that can be used and adapted in a variety of organisations. The research was based on a detailed literature survey and drew on the results from a postal questionnaire survey of 94 different organisations of varying size, age and having a variety <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>accreditations.</b> The respondents were mostly from the 36 - 45 age group, males, first degree holders, specialised in business administration, middle managers and had spent 1 - 5 years in their organisation.

The 'best practices' of ET in organisations surveyed were identified as: those possessing environmental policies and training policies; conducting training needs assessments using a combination of methods such as discrepancy, democratic, diagnostic and analytic; including ET in their human resource development plan; delivering ET by external consultants and involving trainees in their environmental management system. In addition, these organisations delivered at least 1 - 5 ET courses per year, used in house courses and lectures, conducted ET evaluations and are committed to ET in the near future.

The research’s central concern is providing a better understanding for the spreading worldwide <b>quality</b> assurance and <b>accreditation</b> practices in higher education sectors. Through the lens of new-institutional theory, this study aims to illustrate the agendas behind their adoption and how these practices were integrated and implemented in higher education institutions. German and Saudi Arabian higher education institutions represent cases in which this phenomenon can be analyzed to provide explanations for its expansion and application worldwide. This research investigates the reasons behind the adoption <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> assurance and <b>accreditation</b> practices in both countries {{and the ways in}} which these educational reforms are implemented, as well as how to explain the differences between these two cases in this regard. The first part of this research identifies the local systems <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> assurance and <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> higher education in Germany and Saudi Arabia. In its second part, the applied study, this research includes two vertical case studies of the literature and policy documents of German and Saudi higher education systems regarding application of these procedures as well as expert interviews from these countries. The research found that the different relationships and events at each level <b>of</b> the <b>quality</b> assurance and <b>accreditation</b> phenomena (macro-meso-micro) and in the different directions of the two case studies (transversal-vertical-horizontal) contributed to creating the changes and reforms in both higher education systems.
