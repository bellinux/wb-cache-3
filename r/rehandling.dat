40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a container terminal depends {{primarily on the}} smooth and orderly process of handling containers, especially during the ship's loading procedure. The loading plan is mainly determined by two considerations: ship stability and minimum number of <b>rehandles</b> required. These two basic considerations are often in conflict. Most containerships have a cellular structure, imposing a strong restriction {{on the order of}} the container loading sequence. To preserve a ship's stability, some containers may be stowed in a ship hold in middle vertical locations. A similar loading problem exists in the stacking of yard containers. If these containers are stacked in the yard under others which are to be picked up later, then the loading process requires a number of container <b>rehandles.</b> This paper is concerned with a ship's container load planning which satisfies these two considerations and minimises the number of <b>rehandles.</b> International Journal of Maritime Economics (2002) 4, 126 – 148. doi: 10. 1057 /palgrave. ijme. 9100041...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{paper is}} aimed to analyse the {{existing}} car traffic organization at the marshalling yard aimed to reduce downtime of cars. Methodology. The methods of mathematical statistics allowed building the histogram of car traffic flow distribution at the marshalling yard {{and assessment of}} their parameters. The key quantitative and qualitative indicators of the station operation were analyzed. In order to analyze the effect of <b>rehandling</b> volume on the rehandled transit car downtime elements at the station we plotted the dependence graph of the car downtime elements on the <b>rehandling</b> volume. The curve variation on the graph clearly shows the effect of <b>rehandling</b> volume on two downtime elements: during formation and in expectation of operations. Findings. The question of reducing the average downtime of all car categories at the station should be solved by reducing unproductive downtime was proved. The correct determination of the average time spent by a rehandled transit car at the station is essential, especially in the conditions of new system of economic incentives. But still there is no separate methodology for determining the car downtime, which would allow to objectively consider the equipment and operation technology and exclude the possibility for subjective decisions. Originality. One of the main kinds of unproductive downtime during {{the carriage of goods}} by rail is a downtime on the marshalling yards in expectation of technological operations because of the system congestion. Reduction of this indicator is possible due to rational use of the marshalling yard capacity provided the rational distribution and car – and train flows between the major marshalling yards of Ukrzaliznytsia. Practical value. The analysis of changes in downtime elements, depending on the <b>rehandling</b> volume allows not only to identify the car downtime reduction methods, but also to make a correct assessment of station staff work, as well as to adjust the rate of idle wagons. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} {{paper has}} a purpose to choose rational technological {{parameters of the}} transportation organization process, which would enable the freight train movement with the most efficient train traffic arrangement, the decrease in idle time due to the increased speed of cargo delivery {{and the increase in}} the working capacity of the marshalling yard. Methodology. The work presents the technical and operational characteristics of marshalling yards in Europe and Ukraine. The research methods include the station operation analysis, the car traffic flow analysis, analysis of the train sheet, the DU- 1 natural sheets upon arrival and departure of trains. Schemes were developed for calculating working capacity of necks, <b>rehandling</b> capacity of marshalling hump, acceptable levels of system loading. Findings. The research resulted in the calculated working (<b>rehandling)</b> capacity of the main elements of the station. Daily loads of marshalling hump and turnout tracks vary significantly by variations and gradations of movement volume. This affects the idle time of trains and, in general, the value of the criterion according to which the optimal technical equipment, optimum interaction of the subsystems and gridiron of the station will be chosen. This criterion must take into account the costs of technical equipment, construction of tracks, locomotives, as well as related operating costs in all cases. Thus, the selection of the optimal interaction should establish the economically viable level of operational reliability of the sub-systems, their technical and track capacity. Originality. By increasing the productivity of train departure channel, marshalling hump and turnout tracks it is possible the thetrain handling processes and reduce the car idle time. Intensification of production processes in marshalling yards provides a reduction in car turnover and in idle time and high economic efficiency of capital investments. The work covers the issues related to improving the efficiency of functioning of marshalling yards in the railway transport reforming conditions. Practical value. Using the methods of determining the rational working (<b>rehandling)</b> capacity of marshalling yards for distribution of train traffic flows between them makes it possible to improve the quality indicators of marshalling yard operation...|$|E

40|$|A {{container}} terminal {{is devoted to}} transfer containers from sea to land and vice versa in the most efficient way. The main objective of a {{container terminal}} is to optimize, in terms of times and costs, the activities related to container handling and forwarding. As regards the hinterland side, a crucial activity is represented by train loading/ unloading, considering also the increasing importance assumed by rail transportation in allowing the move of large volumes of goods in/out of the logistic transportation nodes. This article pursues the modelling and comparison of different train loading policies by varying the storage area strategies in order to evaluate them and determine the most effective policy for ensuring quickness and efficiency in the terminal. With respect to the train loading policies, all the possible configurations are taken into account, starting from a pure sequential loading by the rail overhead travelling crane, which consequently implies some <b>rehandling</b> operations in the yard, up to the opposite situation in which non-sequential loading operations are allowed {{in order to avoid}} <b>rehandling</b> activities. These loading policies are analysed by varying the stacking strategies adopted in the yard where containers can be stored taking into consideration different factors (commercial priorities, weights, and so on). By using real data in relation to the physical characteristics of containers, trains and wagons, a proper experimental campaign has been performed in order to test the effectiveness of the different scenarios described above...|$|E

While maintaining the grade objective, the mining sequence must be technically feasible, removing overlying material in sequence, with walls within a safe height. The problem is NP hard, with astronomically many feasible sequences for mining several thousand ore blocks. The unattainable global optimum necessitates a “satisficing ” mining sequence. The multiple-grade objective is recast as minimising a single dimensionless “stress ” measure.
