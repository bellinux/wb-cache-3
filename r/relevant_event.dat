25|$|The biggest {{irritants}} came in 1982. In that year, the ABA discarded {{their system}} in which how well a pro did during the season had at least some bearing on who became Number one Pro for the year. Previously to 1982, who won the most money decided who was number one Pro. A pro's winnings were his points. The reason for the change was that Kevin McNeal, the ABA Number One Pro for 1981, had a runaway season and had wrapped up the title a full month before the Grand National, rendering the event vis a vis Number one Pro irrelevant. This resulted in a low turnout of big-name pros like Stu Thomsen and Greg Hill, both of whom opted to attend the NBL-sanctioned $10,000 pursed Knott's Berry Farm Mongoose International Grand Championships race being held the same weekend. Lack of pro attendance due to a foregone conclusion would mean lack of publicity for the ABA in the BMX press, which in turn would breed reluctance in both various BMX Industry and non-BMX industry-related companies to sponsor the Grand Nationals. The ABA {{wanted to make sure}} in 1982 that the pros attended their Grand Nationals and it was a <b>relevant</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E

50|$|BCI2000 is a {{software}} suite for brain-computer interface research. It {{is commonly used}} for data acquisition, stimulus presentation, and brain monitoring applications. BCI2000 supports a variety of data acquisition systems, brain signals, and study/feedback paradigms. During operation, BCI2000 stores data in a common format (BCI2000 native or GDF), along with all <b>relevant</b> <b>event</b> markers and information about system configuration. BCI2000 also includes several tools for data import/conversion (e.g., a routine to load BCI2000 data files directly into Matlab) and export facilities into ASCII.|$|E
50|$|The most <b>relevant</b> <b>event</b> of {{this new}} era was the {{establishment}} in 1993 of the new Department of Translation and Interpreting of the University of Granada, which is now responsible for teaching and research. Two new languages C (second foreign languages) were included (Dutch and Modern Greek) and also a new first foreign language: Arabic. Thus, the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting of Granada became the first Spanish college in granting, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the qualification of sworn translator and interpreter (Spanish: Traductor/Intérprete jurado) with Arabic as first foreign language (language B).|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, {{the event}} loop, message dispatcher, message loop, message pump, or run loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. It works {{by making a}} request to some internal or external [...] "event provider" [...] (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), and then it calls the <b>relevant</b> <b>event</b> handler ("dispatches the event"). The event-loop {{may be used in}} conjunction with a reactor, if the event provider follows the file interface, which can be selected or 'polled' (the Unix system call, not actual polling). The event loop almost always operates asynchronously with the message originator.|$|E

5000|$|Close-out netting: In {{the event}} of {{counterparty}} bankruptcy or any other <b>relevant</b> <b>event</b> of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated (i.e. effected), all transactions or all of a given type are netted (i.e. set off against each other) at market value or, if otherwise specified in the contract {{or if it is}} not possible to obtain a market value, at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the non-defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract. The alternative would allow the liquidator to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to (and thus potentially [...] "cherry pick"). There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested. Bare bants.|$|E
50|$|Smallpox was {{an unknown}} disease {{not only in}} Mexico, but in the Americas, {{before the arrival of}} Europeans. It was {{introduced}} to Mexican lands by the Spanish, a <b>relevant</b> <b>event</b> in history as it was a factor in the downfall of the Aztec Empire. Hernán Cortés departed from Cuba and arrived to Mexico in 1519, sent to start trade relations on the Veracruz Coast. However, he disobeyed the Cuban governor and began to invade the mainland. The Cuban governor sent Pánfilo de Narváez after Cortés. Narvaez’s forces had at least one active case of smallpox, and when the Narvaez expedition stopped at Cozumel and Veracruz in 1520, the disease gained a foothold in the region.|$|E
5000|$|Recently, a {{book has}} been {{presented}} in the Azpeitia Town Council by Aranzadi {{and supported by the}} Basque government. It is about the impact of a very <b>relevant</b> <b>event</b> such as the Spanish Civil War and the first years of Franco´s regime in Azpeitia. Its name is [...] "Azpeitia 1936-1945". It makes a point about how those historical events affected daily life. The {{book has been}} written as a detailed comment about those events, but also as homage to the men and women that lost the war (basque nationalist and left-wing republican militants) and suffered the repression of the dictatorship afterwards. The book has, notably, an alphabetic index in which we can find many citizens of Azpeitia of the time (with a summary of their political militancy and activities during and after the Civil War). Moreover, many images of the historical documents of the time {{can be found in the}} book.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{uses the}} empirical framework developed by Easton, Harris and Ohlson (1992) {{to examine the}} relative ability of the accrual and cash flow accounting models to capture value <b>relevant</b> <b>events.</b> In particular, components of clean surplus accrual earnings are compared with components of total cash flows to determine their relative abilities to recognise value <b>relevant</b> <b>events</b> in a timely manner. The {{results indicate that the}} association between stock returns and earnings is higher than that with total cash flows for return intervals of between one and ten years. Cash flows from operations and current accruals are able to recognise value <b>relevant</b> <b>events</b> in a timely manner, while non-current and non-operating accruals only became consistently value relevant when longer return intervals are considered. Cash flows from investing and financing activities are less value relevant than the other components considered, especially over longer return intervals...|$|R

5000|$|Timelines are {{the main}} feature and {{research}} tool of the website: 32 timelines have been published as of June 2012, profiling more than 19,700 events and more than 18,000 entities, e.g. individuals, governments/agencies, businesses and organizations. Other timelines are in the planning and development stage. The term [...] "timeline," [...] though accurate, {{is something of a}} misnomer. The content (dated summaries of events) is organized into chronological timelines, but the term [...] "project" [...] is somewhat more descriptive as many timelines/projects have a broad scope due to the complexity of the topic focus, and consist of multiple, subsidiary, cross-referenced timelines. The homepage of each project displays a table of contents, with links to subsidiary timelines and actual individual entries. The timelines are dynamic: By clicking on the title of an event summary, a [...] "scalable context timeline" [...] is produced, the scope of which can be narrowed or broadened depending on the proximity of other events or entities in relation to that particular event summary. Timelines can also be rendered by clicking on reference links or tags in an event summary, or by searching names, keywords or dates; this returns a timeline including the <b>relevant</b> <b>event</b> summaries. Each event summary cites at least one authoritative source, e.g. governments, organizations, mainstream media, scholars, investigative journalists and other recognized experts. All projects are works in progress; the goal is to provide the most current, comprehensive and detailed overview of each project's subject, and the related time periods, events and entities.|$|E
