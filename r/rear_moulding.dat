25|$|In 1989 Plaxton {{responded to}} a request from the privatised National Express for a further version of Paramount III to be leased to its {{contractors}} by a joint venture of Plaxton, National Westminster Bank and National Express. The Paramount Expressliner was created from the Mark III Paramount on a Volvo chassis and was tailored to National Express' specific requirements which included a closed back with the double N logo etched into the fibre glass <b>rear</b> <b>moulding.</b> This period of coach design seemed to introduce the windowless rear as a design feature for most coaches.|$|E

50|$|The T60/4 was {{produced}} from October 1960 and are mechanically and outwardly {{similar to the}} late T60. It was the same length and width as the standard T60, but differed in having extra room in the back for two seats, the additional space being created by a revised <b>rear</b> body <b>moulding,</b> thus creating proper seats in the back for two children. The rear bench seat was fastened {{to the car and}} the centre backrest had a bulge in it because of the revised rear wheel arch. The Car was available in both soft-top and hardtop forms. These cars used the revised front and rear suspension layouts used on the very late T60s.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced for 1980 models, an {{optional}} resettable trip meter was installed on speedometers and the mileage counter {{was moved to}} the top of the speedometer as part of the optional Sport Instrumentation Group. The Sport Instrumentation Group also included the optional tachometer in the center of the cluster, as well as oil and ammeter gauges. In 1984, the body moulding and interior trim were updated. In 1985-1986 models, the upper accent mouldings were moved below the front marker. For 1985, the <b>rear</b> tailgate <b>moulding</b> on XLT models was updated and previewed the design of the 1987 model. This molding has become increasingly rare and fetches a high price. A cargo light was available as an option and was included in the Light Group option package. (A Combination Stop/cargo lamp was not required until September 1, 1993 for the 1994 year model.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Mark III was {{presented}} at the London Motor Show in October 1965, described at the time as [...] "even more luxuriously trimmed and furnished". It was again available in two 4-door body styles, coupé and saloon. The Mark III used the same engine as its predecessor, but it now produced [...] Externally it could be distinguished by the full-length trim strip along the body and Mark III badging; internally it replaced the rear bench seat with two individually <b>moulded</b> <b>rear</b> seats, making it more comfortable to ride in for four occupants but less so for five.|$|R

50|$|After 1942, Packard {{concentrated}} on the new Clipper styling that was developed for an upper-class sedan the previous year. There were Super Clippers and Custom Super Clipper in the One-Sixty and One-Eighty tradition until 1947. After a heavy facelift, the name Clipper was dropped. The most senior Super Eight One-Eighty became the Custom Eight, while its slightly lower-priced sibling, the Super Eight One-Sixty, once again became simply the Super Eight. Clipper Custom Super Eights and Custom Eights were very close relatives to their respective Super models, distinguished outside {{by the lack of}} an eggcrate grille and small <b>rear</b> chrome trim <b>moulding</b> under the trunk lid on Supers. In 1949, a new Super Eight Deluxe was added to the line. This car had also the Custom Eight's eggcrate grille, but not the rear trim.|$|R
5000|$|Manchester's war {{memorial}} is a cenotaph, {{flanked by}} twin obelisks, and a Stone of Remembrance, all in Portland stone on a raised coved platform. The memorial covers {{an area of}} approximately 93 ft by 53 ft. The cenotaph is 42 ft high made from 160 LT of Portland stone. The pylon is surmounted by a sculpture of an unknown soldier, partially covered by his greatcoat, lying on a catafalque. The pylon rises from the base in diminishing stages, narrowing as it rises. Below the catafalque, {{on the front and}} <b>rear,</b> are <b>moulded</b> swords and imperial crowns, and to the sides are Manchester's coat of arms surrounded by laurel wreaths. The cenotaph bears inscriptions below the coat of arms: [...] "TO THE HONOURED MEMORY OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY" [...] (on the north-west side) and [...] "O LORD GOD OF OUR FATHERS KEEP THIS/FOREVER IN THE IMAGINATION OF THE THOUGHTS OF THE HEART OF THY PEOPLE" [...] (on the south east). Identical, 23 ft high obelisks stand either side of the cenotaph and the Stone of Remembrance is set in front. The stone, a monolith in the shape of an altar, is 12 ft long and curved so slightly as to barely be visible (entasis); it is devoid of decoration and inscribed, [...] "THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE".|$|R
5000|$|Mitsubishi {{released}} a new Colt Ralliart Version-R in Japan on 30 May 2006. Its 4G15 engine, with MIVEC {{variable valve timing}} and turbocharger, produces [...] at 6000 rpm and 210 Nm at 3500 rpm for manual model, [...] at 6000 rpm and 180 Nm at 2500 rpm for CVT model.

The CVT version is officially sold in Singapore and Hong Kong under the same designation as Japan.|$|R
