5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1996 regular season, the Nebraska Cornhuskers boasted the No. 4 rushing offense in Division I-A college football, averaging 292 <b>rushing</b> <b>yards</b> per game and 422 overall yards per game. Despite those figures, the Cornhuskers' two leading rushers were hampered by injury and their participation was in doubt.

The No. 2 rusher, DeAngelo Evans, had 776 <b>rushing</b> <b>yards</b> and a team-high 14 rushing touchdowns, but was limited by a groin injury.
