5000|$|The engineer's {{controller}} has 18 starting notches, {{of which}} only 4 {{are classified as}} running notches (allowing prolonged operation of the motors in this notch). Acceleration is mainly controlled by means of resistances which are initially connected into the traction motor circuit and then incrementally notched out by means of shorting with special contactors. These contactors (19 in all) are grouped together in one drum controller. The ER2 uses an indirect control system: the engineer only has to place his (or her) controller handle in the desired notch, and the control system automatically notches out the drum controller to reach that notch. (The drum controller is pneumatically operated). For slow movement, as when shunting, the engineer places the controller in the first notch, designated M ("manevrovoe", i.e. [...] "shunting"); this closes both line contactors, the bridge contactor, and contactors #7 and #8, connecting all 4 traction motors in series and engaging all of the starting resistances (total resistance 17.66 ohm). Moving the controller handle to the next notch (<b>running</b> <b>notch</b> #1) initiates an incremental notching-out (shorting-out) of the starting resistances; unlike most Russian electric locomotives, on which the engineer directly controls {{the selection of the}} starting notches, in the ER2 the intermediate starting notches are switched automatically by means of an accelerating relay which regulates the train's acceleration (by monitoring the traction current's change, see also: Traction motor#Automatic acceleration), although the engineer can override it and select the intermediate notches manually. In starting notch #9, all of the starting resistances are shorted out, and only the series-connected traction motors remain in the circuit, their fields at 100% strength. This corresponds to <b>running</b> <b>notch</b> #1 on the engineer's controller. Further notching out of the controller weakens the traction motors' field: in starting notch #10, the field strength is reduced to 67%, and in starting notch #11 to 50%. Starting notch #11 corresponds to <b>running</b> <b>notch</b> #2 on the engineer's controller.|$|E
50|$|To {{accelerate}} the train still further, the traction motors are reconnected in series-parallel connection (2 parallel circuits with 2 series-connected traction motors in each). For this purpose, in starting notch #12 the controller closes {{a pair of}} parallel contactors and opens the bridge contactor. After this the controller moves to starting notch #13, which closes contactors #1 and #2 and opens both field-weakening contactors; this assembles 2 parallel circuits, each of which comprises 2 traction motors {{and a group of}} starting resistances connected in series and has a total resistance of 4.97 ohm. Further notching out of the controller shorts out the starting resistances in pairs until in starting notch #16 all of the starting resistances are shorted out; this corresponds to <b>running</b> <b>notch</b> #3 on the engineer's controller. Moving the controller to starting notch #17 weakens the traction motor field to 67%, and in starting notch #18 the field is weakened to 50%. Starting notch #18 corresponds to <b>running</b> <b>notch</b> #4 on the engineer's controller; this is the maximum notch and allows the train to reach top speed. To coast, the engineer moves the controller handle to 0; this opens the line contactors, thereby shutting off all power to the traction motors, and moves the controller into starting notch #1 (therefore if the traction motors are turned on again, they are connected in series and all the starting resistances are in the circuit).|$|E
50|$|The trains use {{conventional}} transformer {{technology with}} fixed <b>running</b> <b>notches,</b> {{which can be}} felt by the passengers while the train is accelerating, and are equipped with regenerative brakes. They feature an automatic speed control system, which allows the engineer to simply select the desired speed while the train chooses the <b>running</b> <b>notches</b> automatically, accelerating, decelerating or maintaining speed as desired.|$|R
50|$|There {{were three}} {{varieties}} of locomotive. The MFO types {{got a very}} fast hopper controller to choose the <b>running</b> <b>notches.</b> The SAAS type hopper controller could not be switched arbitrarily fast as the MFO variety could be, due to a constraining device which limited {{the rate at which}} the <b>running</b> <b>notches</b> could be switched upwards. The BBC locomotives, in contrast, had a flat switch with a contact slide.|$|R
50|$|Current {{collection}} is by single-pan air operated pantographs, which feed the main power circuits by a high-speed circuit breaker. The main resistances {{were made by}} Metropolitan-Vickers' parent company, Associated Electrical Industries. The four traction motors are permanently connected in series pairs, with series-parallel combinations between pairs. Parallel and 12 field weakening positions give a total of 55 <b>running</b> <b>notches.</b> The four traction motors have Alsthom quill drives.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{technical}} equipment is installed below the passenger compartment, leading to a higher than usual floor level than ordinary carriages had. Some of the equipment and the toilet is installed {{in the middle of}} the multiple unit, instead of passenger compartments. The conventional transformer technology with its rough step controller (28 <b>running</b> <b>notches)</b> together with occasional heavy vibrations led to the nickname [...] "Schüttelbecher" [...] ("shaker").|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{design is}} similar to the Re 4/4II, as are the driver's controls and the conventional transformer technology with fixed <b>running</b> <b>notches,</b> which was applied for the last time for this locomotive. In contrast to the Re 4/4II, the Re 6/6 has two transformers (one power and one control transformer), which are mounted on the frame between the bogies. Due to the higher roof, the Re 6/6 looks more brawny than the Re 4/4II, especially when seen from the front side.|$|R
2500|$|... "If in <b>running</b> a <b>Notch,</b> the Wicket {{is struck}} {{down by a}} Throw, before his Foot, Hand, or Bat is over the Popping-Crease, or a Stump hit by the Ball, though the Bail was down, it's out".|$|R
25|$|Or if in <b>running</b> a <b>notch,</b> the wicket {{is struck}} {{down by a}} throw, or with the ball in hand, before his foot, hand, or bat is {{grounded}} over the popping-crease; but if the bail is off, a stump must be struck {{out of the ground}} by the ball.|$|R
5000|$|Audiences began {{drifting}} {{to television}} in the late forties. MGM {{found it difficult to}} attract them to theaters. With its high overhead expenses, MGM's profit margins continued to decrease. Word came from Nicholas Schenck in New York: find [...] "a new Thalberg" [...] who could improve quality while paring costs. Mayer thought he had found this savior in Dore Schary, a writer and producer who had found success at <b>running</b> RKO. Top <b>notch</b> musicals were Schary's focus, with hits like Easter Parade and the various films of Mario Lanza (most famously, The Great Caruso) keeping MGM afloat.|$|R
40|$|The {{locomotive}} {{traction motor}} electric dynamics {{and its impact}} on the rail and vehicle have not been investigated deeply in transient wheel–rail contact conditions. Such transient traction behaviour could be more significant to dynamic traction performance and track degradation (i. e. corrugation formation, fatigue, wear, etc.) than steady state behaviour. In order to study this, detailed numerical simulations are performed to investigate the locomotive multi-body dynamic response to a change in contact conditions with an AC and DC electrical traction motor respectively. In particular, creep response, locomotive vibration, and dynamic normal and tractional forces are determined using a developed full scale locomotive dynamics model. The model includes the detailed AC and DC motor dynamics. Further investigation has been undertaken to understand the wear caused during and after the change of friction conditions from dry to wet and wet to dry. The result shows the GT 46 Ace locomotive AC drive can achieve higher traction efficiency compared to the equivalent DC drive <b>running</b> under <b>notch</b> 8, especially in the wet condition. It is also demonstrated that the AC drive produces slightly lower wear on average than the DC drive after the transient. However, the transient dynamic oscillation of wear caused by the AC drive is significantly higher than the DC drive...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the middle}} of a {{terminal}} strip of a breadboard, one typically finds a <b>notch</b> <b>running</b> in parallel to the long side. The notch is to mark the centerline of the terminal strip and provides limited airflow (cooling) to DIP ICs straddling the centerline. The clips on the right and left of the notch are each connected in a radial way; typically five clips (i.e., beneath five holes) in a row {{on each side of the}} notch are electrically connected. The five rows on the left of the notch are often marked as A, B, C, D, and E, while the ones on the right are marked F, G, H, I and J. When a [...] "skinny" [...] dual in-line pin package (DIP) integrated circuit (such as a typical DIP-14 or DIP-16, which have a 0.3 in separation between the pin rows) is plugged into a breadboard, the pins of one side of the chip are supposed to go into row E while the pins of the other side go into row F on the other side of the notch. The columns are numbered 1 - 50 or whatever number of columns there are.|$|R
