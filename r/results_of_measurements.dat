25|$|A {{significant}} difference between respirator performance in the laboratories compared to the efficiency at the workplaces not allowed to use the laboratory results to predict the degree of protection offered in practice. And instability of respirators' protective properties (for the same RPD design, {{and in the same}} usage conditions) prevented evaluate their efficiency. For solving these problems, scientists Donald Campbell and Steven Lenhart suggested to use the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of Workplace PF values for development of Assigned (expected in practice) PF values (APF) - as the lower 95% confidence interval of WPF values. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of WPF has been used in the development of APF by ANSI (for the recommended standard, that is not mandatory).

25|$|The {{handbook}} {{discusses the}} <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of respirators' performance. The dust concentration was reduced by 92% {{with the use}} of half mask respirators while working longwall shearer; and decreased three times (in average). Helmet with forced filtering air supply (PAPR) reduces the concentration of dust in half. The expected decrease in dust concentration of the two types of respirators are 10 and 25 respectively. In subsequent publications of CDC (on the subject of reducing the dust content in underground mining) RPE are not mentioned at all.|$|E
25|$|The experts {{used the}} <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> at the {{laboratories}} {{and at the}} workplaces to develop more completely terminology for description of the respirators' performance; and this terminology has been applied officially, and {{in the preparation of}} research results for publication. Specialists began to use different terms to describe the protection factors, which were measured at workplaces with continuous use of respirators; and measured in the workplace when the workers used of respirators intermittently; measured not in the workplace while fit testing; measured in the laboratories under the simulation workplace's conditions; and for the protection factors, that can be expected (in most cases) when the workers properly used the respirators at the workplace.|$|E
25|$|But {{the results}} of the first {{workplace}} {{studies have shown that the}} effectiveness of respirators all designs - is very fickle, and strongly depend on the correctness of their use (continuous use in polluted atmosphere, etc...), and on the leakage of contaminated air under the mask through the gaps between it and the worker's face. It was found that respirators' efficiency in the workplaces were much lower, as compared to laboratory conditions. This has led to revise the boundaries of the application of RPE different designs, and prompted to develop requirements for the organization of their application, fixing them in the national legislation. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> forced to pay more attention to the technical methods of protection (sealing, ventilation, automation, changing technology, and others.).|$|E

25|$|Between 21March and mid-July, around 27PBq of caesium-137 (about 8.4kg) {{entered the}} ocean, with about 82percent having flowed {{into the sea}} before 8April.

The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, due to the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil.

It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima.

25|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} in October 2011 by the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, between 21 March and mid-July around 2.7×1016Bq of caesium-137 (about 8.4kg) entered the ocean, about 82percent having flowed into the sea before 8 April. This emission of radioactivity into the sea represents the most important individual emission of artificial radioactivity into the sea ever observed. However, the Fukushima coast {{has some of the}} world's strongest currents and these transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements. The <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Further, some coastal areas might have less-favorable dilution or sedimentation characteristics than those observed so far. Finally, the possible presence of other persistent radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the coast of Fukushima district. Organisms that filter water and fish {{at the top of the}} food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima.

2500|$|According to Martin Gardner, the [...] "other" [...] {{worlds of}} MWI have two {{different}} interpretations: real or unreal; {{he claims that}} Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg both favour the unreal interpretation. Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured {{by the majority of}} physicists, whereas the [...] "realist" [...] view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and Bryce DeWitt. Hawking has said that [...] "according to Feynman's idea", all the other histories are as [...] "equally real" [...] as our own, and Martin Gardner reports Hawking saying that MWI is [...] "trivially true". In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded the MWI as [...] "self-evidently correct" [...] but was dismissive towards questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, [...] "When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, I reach for my gun." [...] In the same interview, he also said, [...] "But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities—in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities." [...] Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the [...] "reality" [...] of physical theories with that of his colleague Roger Penrose, saying, [...] "He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements.</b> Quantum theory does this very successfully." [...] For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of quantum gravity negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.|$|E
60|$|A Priori it {{is quite}} clear that we {{must be able to}} learn {{something}} about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations of transformation, for the magnitudes z, y, x, t, are nothing more nor less than the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks.

6000|$|In {{order to}} have a {{complete}} description of the motion, we must specify how the body alters its position with time i.e. for every point on the trajectory it must be stated at what time the body is situated there. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of time that, in virtue of this definition, these time-values can be regarded essentially as magnitudes (<b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements)</b> capable of observation. If we take our stand on the ground of classical mechanics, we can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the following manner. We imagine two clocks of identical construction the man at the railway-carriage window is holding one of them, and the man on the footpath the other. Each of the observers determines the position on his own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick of the clock he is holding in his hand. In this connection we have not taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the velocity of propagation of light. With this and with a second difficulty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later.|$|E
