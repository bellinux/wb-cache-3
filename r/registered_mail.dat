25|$|Today it {{is known}} that similar teeth are found in {{juvenile}} specimens of Daspletosaurus, and it is likely that teeth referred to Aublysodon came from that genus. In October 2000, the type specimen of Aublysodon went missing when being sent by <b>registered</b> <b>mail</b> from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia to the Field Museum of Natural History. Because of the presence of Aublysodon-type teeth in other juvenile tyrannosaurines than Daspletosaurus, such as those of Tyrannosaurus, remains of which can also be found in Montana, Thomas Carr no longer considered the name to represent a real biological taxon, but to be a nomen dubium.|$|E

The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were accordingly invited to exchange their medals. All six Australian Albert Medal recipients living at the time opted to accept the offer, and were invited to attend an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace to receive their new insignia. Bagot was not fit enough to travel to London, and requested the medal be forwarded to him by <b>registered</b> <b>mail.</b> The medal was subsequently sent to the Governor of Western Australia, who presented it to Bagot on 26 November 1972.|$|E
25|$|The MPS also {{supports}} mail delivery for U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas and to deployed personnel in combat zones worldwide. Most USPS extra services, such as Certified Mail, <b>registered</b> <b>mail,</b> delivery confirmation, insured mail, certificate of mailing, return receipt, restricted delivery and return receipt for merchandise {{are available to}} the MPS. Mail sent from one military post office (MPO) to another MPO can be sent for free as inner/intra-theater delivery service (IDS) {{as long as it}} does not transit the United States. Military postage rates are equivalent to U.S. domestic postage rates because the Services pay the second destination transportation (SDT) costs to, from, and between MPOs. The postage paid on mail to/from MPOs only covers the cost of transporting the mail within the U.S. All military mail between the U.S. and overseas locations is subject to customs inspection in the country of destination, and customs declarations must normally be attached to packages and larger mail pieces.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{examine the}} nexus between road traffic {{accident}} (RTA) and some relevant variables in Saudi Arabia over the period 1971 - 2012, using the autoregressive distributed lag ADRL model (Pesaran and Shin, 1999) for co-integration in Saudi Arabia, with the co-integration test.

With these findings, we affirm that there is a strong relationship and effect between road traffic accidents and its population, GDP, road <b>mails,</b> <b>registered</b> vehicles, and the number of driver license. The findings suggest that the ECTt- 1 coefficients are negative signed and statistically significant in all VECMs, implying that there is bi-directional causality between the variables of interest in the long run. ...|$|R
