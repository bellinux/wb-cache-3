5000|$|As Washington's {{personal}} physician, Craik was one {{of three}} doctors to attend on him during his final illness on 14 December 1799. Washington complained of respiratory distress, described by Craik as [...] "cynanche trachealis". When Washington proved unable to swallow medicines orally, Craik and the other two physicians (Dr. Elisha C. Dick and Dr. Gustavus Richard Brown) treated his condition with bloodletting, the application of various poultices, and a <b>rectal</b> <b>solution</b> of calomel and tartar. Washington's condition continued to deteriorate, but Craik and Brown decided against Dick's suggestion of a tracheotomy (which might have been lifesaving, but likely would have spread the infection and caused sepsis), and Washington died at 10:10 p.m. Brown and Craik co-published an account of their treatment in December 1800.|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{migraine}} {{patients were}} administered 2 mg ergotamine tartrate in a partial cross-over design as a single, oral tablet, rectal suppository and <b>rectal</b> <b>solution.</b> Eight {{of these patients}} were in a previous investigation given 0. 5 mg ergotamine tartrate intravenously. The blood samples were taken up to 54 h after oral and suppository while it was followed for only 3 h after <b>rectal</b> <b>solution.</b> The chemical analysis was performed by applying h. p. l. c. method with a limit of sensitivity of 0. 1 ng/ml ergotamine base in plasma. No ergotamine was detected in the blood samples after the oral route, whereas small and very variable quantities was found in blood after the rectal route. Regular calculation of bioavailability could therefore not be performed. An estimate of the maximal possible bioavailability was found to yield a mean value of 2 % (tablets); 5 % (suppositories) and 6 % (<b>rectal</b> <b>solution).</b> <b>Rectal</b> <b>solution</b> elicited faster absorption {{and the extent of}} absorption was significantly higher (P less than 0. 05) than for the suppository...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceutical {{development}} and manufacturing process optimization work was undertaken {{in order to}} propose a potential paediatric rectal formulation of azithromycin {{as an alternative to}} existing oral or injectable formulations. The target product profile was to be easy-to-use, cheap and stable in tropical conditions, with bioavailability comparable to oral forms, rapidly achieving and maintaining bactericidal concentrations. PEG solid solution suppositories were characterized in vitro using visual, HPLC, DSC, FTIR and XRD analyses. In vitro drug release and in vivo bioavailability were assessed; a study in rabbits compared the bioavailability of the optimized solid solution suppository to <b>rectal</b> <b>solution</b> and intra-venous product (as reference) and to the previous, non-optimized formulation (suspended azithromycin suppository). The bioavailability of azithromycin administered as solid solution suppositories relative to intra-venous was 43 %, which compared well to the target of 38 % (oral product in humans). The results of 3 -month preliminary stability and feasibility studies were consistent with industrial production scale-up. This product has potential both as a classical antibiotic and as a product for use in severely ill children in rural areas. Industrial partners for further development are being sought. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|Diazepam {{could be}} {{administered}} via different routes: orally, intravenous injections, <b>rectal</b> <b>solutions,</b> <b>rectal</b> gels, and suppositories [17]. Generally, oral administration of Diazepam is {{the route of}} choice in the daily practice of pharmacotherapy. However, abuse of diazepam can have serious consequences, even causing death when taken in overdose [18].|$|R
40|$|Acute {{seizures}} {{are readily}} recognizable episodes requiring urgent treatment. This {{study was conducted}} to compare the efficacy and safety of suppository use of <b>rectal</b> diazepam <b>solution</b> [Stesolid <b>rectal</b> tube (SRT), Alpharma, Inc., Lierskogen, Norway] with those of intravenous diazepam (IVD), Li Ta Pharma Co, Ltd., Taichung, Taiwan for control of acute seizures in children with intractable epilepsy. Methods: Subjects were patients, aged 1 – 18 years, with intractable epilepsy under at least three kinds of antiepileptic treatments. Caregivers were trained to rectally administer SRT or IVD (dosage varying from 0. 2 to 0. 5  mg per kilogram of body weight) and to monitor respiration condition, seizure severity, and adverse drug effects. Results: Among the 24 subjects, 9 males and 15 females, treated for a period of 3 months, the ages ranged from 2 to 18 years, with a mean of 9. 1 years. Seizure types were generalized tonic and/or clonic. Seizure frequency varied from once per week to 20 times per day. Twenty-one (87. 5 %) of them had mental retardation and/or developmental delay, and 103 of the 127 (81. 1 %) IVD administrations and 90 of the 103 (87. 3 %) SRT administrations resulted in rapid cessation of seizures within 10 minutes. Each first dose failed to control seizures in 24 and 13 episodes, respectively. A second dose of IVD achieved cessation of seizure in 21 of the 24 episodes and a second dose of SRT in 12 of the 13 episodes within another 10 minutes. Four episodes (3 with rectal IVD and 1 with SRT) of prolonged seizure beyond 20 minutes needed IVD injection at our emergency room. Sedation occurred in 17 % of patients, which was attributed to IVD in 8 % and SRT in 9 % of patients. No respiratory depression was attributable to IVD or SRT. There was no significant statistical difference in efficacy and safety between these two forms of diazepam. Conclusion: <b>Rectal</b> diazepam <b>solution,</b> administered by capable caregivers, is as effective and safe as rectal administration of IVD for children with intractable epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|This {{prospective}} study evaluated {{the efficacy of}} transvaginal ultrasonography combined with water-contrast in the rectum (RWC-TVS) in the diagnosis of rectal infiltration in 35 women with rectovaginal endometriosis. After mechanical bowel preparation, a 6 -mm catheter was inserted into the rectal lumen up to a 20 -cm distance from the anus. The rectum was distended by injecting saline <b>solution.</b> <b>Rectal</b> infiltration was diagnosed when a rectovaginal hypoechoic mass penetrated into the intestinal wall thickening the muscolaris mucosa. Ultrasonographic findings were compared with surgery and histology. The sensitivity of RWC-TVS in identifying rectal infiltration reaching at least the muscular layer was 100 %, the specificity was 85. 7 %, the positive predictive value was 91. 3 %, and the negative predictive value was 100 %. In 4 of 5 (80. 0 %) nodules reaching the submucosa, the depth of infiltration was underestimated by RWC-TVS. The RWC-TVS reliably determined the largest diameter of the endometriotic nodules and was well tolerated by the patients. Transvaginal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, rectal endoscopic ultrasonography, multislice computerized tomography combined with the distension of the colon by rectal enteroclysis have previously been proposed for the diagnosis of bowel endometriosis. Combining RWC-TVS with multislice computerized tomography enteroclysis may improve our ability to diagnose rectal endometriosis before surgery...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Temperature {{sensitive}} Pluronic (Plu) and pH-sensitive {{polyacrylic acid}} (PAA) were successfully mixed in different ratios {{to form in}} situ gelling formulations for colon cancer therapy. The major formulations were prepared as the liquid and solid suppository dosage forms. Epirubicin (Epi) was chosen as a model anticancer drug. In vitro characterization and in vivo pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of Epi in six Plu/PAA formulations were evaluated. Our in vitro data indicate that Epi in Plu 14 %/PAA 0. 75 % of both solid and liquid suppositories possess significant cytotoxicity, strong bioadhesive force, long-term appropriate suppository base, sustained release, and high accumulation of Epi in rat rectums. These solid and liquid suppositories were retained in the upper rectum of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats for at least 12 h. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study using SD rats showed that after rectal administration of solid and liquid suppositories, Epi had greater area under the curve and higher relative bioavailability than in a <b>rectal</b> <b>solution.</b> These solid and liquid suppositories exhibited remarkable inhibition on the tumor growth of CT 26 bearing Balb/c mice in vivo. Our findings suggest that in situ thermogelling and mucoadhesive suppositories demonstrate a great potential as colon anticancer deliver...|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether there is an evidence base for drug manipulation to obtain the required dose, a common feature of paediatric clinical practice. A systematic review of the data sources, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, IPA and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews, was used. Studies that considered the dose accuracy of manipulated medicines of any dosage form, evidence of safety or harm, bioavailability, patient experience, tolerability, contamination and comparison of methods of manipulation were included. Case studies and letters were excluded. Fifty studies were eligible for inclusion, 49 of which involved tablets being cut, split, crushed or dispersed. The remaining one study involved the manipulation of suppositories of one drug. No eligible studies concerning manipulation of oral capsules or liquids, <b>rectal</b> enemas, nebuliser <b>solutions,</b> injections or transdermal patches were identified. Twenty four of the tablet studies considered dose accuracy using weight and/or drug content. In studies that considered weight using adapted pharmacopoeial specifications, the percentage of halved tablets meeting these specifications ranged from 30 % to 100 %. Eighteen studies investigated bioavailability, pharmacokinetics or clinical outcomes following manipulations which included nine delayed or modified release formulations. In each of these nine studies the entirety of the dosage form was administered. Only one of the 18 studies was identified where drugs were manipulated to obtain a proportion of the dosage form, and that proportion administered. The five studies that considered patient perception found that having to manipulate the tablets did not {{have a negative impact on}} adherence. Of the 49 studies only two studies reported investigating children. This review yielded limited evidence to support manipulation of medicines for children. The results cannot be extrapolated between dosage forms, methods of manipulation or between different brands of the same drug...|$|R
