Importance and phases of records management were explained, and then information about preparing <b>retention</b> <b>periods</b> was given. Thesis consists of five chapters. First chapter mentions about importance of records management in an association. Furthermore, it contains main duties, responsibilities, functions of records management, records inventory, archive studies. Besides tangible and intangible utilities of records management, Second chapter contains effects on staff of records {{management and the}} information arrival, controlling on circulation of records. The information of <b>retention</b> <b>periods</b> is given on third chapter. On the fourth chapter there are samples about <b>retention</b> <b>periods</b> of Alternatifbank. It was given place to appendix on the fifth chapter. Furthermore, The history, the mission, the vision, the organization chart, the units and functions of Alternatifbank, the archive procedure and the duty definitions of record managers are given on the fifth chapter...|$|R

50|$|Another major {{criticism}} of the data retention regime was the two-year data <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> specified in s 187C. The CCLS urged the government to reduce the data <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> because it is high compared to mass data retention regimes in other jurisdictions. The CCLS submitted statistics showing that most data accessed for investigations of terrorism and complex criminal offences is accessed within 6 months of being captured and that following this period the percentage of data used decreases significantly. The Communications Alliance and AMTA {{also noted that the}} majority of requests made by agencies to access telecommunications data held by ISPs related to data less than 6 months old. Similarly, the APF was concerned that the <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> was excessive and disproportionate, and that it imposed disproportionate costs on carriers and ISPs. The APF recommended a <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> of 1 year be trialed for the first 3 years of the scheme’s operation.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{skeletal}} {{and dental}} changes immediately after rapid maxillary expansion (RME) in Class II Division 1 malocclusion patients {{and after a}} <b>retention</b> <b>period,</b> using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging. METHODS: Seventeen children with Class II, Division 1 malocclusion and maxillary skeletal transverse deficiency underwent RME following the Haas protocol. CBCT were taken before treatment (T 1), {{at the end of}} the active expansion phase (T 2) and after a <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> of 6 months (T 3). The scanned images were measured anteroposteriorly (SNA, SNB, ANB, overjet and MR) and vertically (N-ANS, ANS-Me, N-Me and overbite). RESULTS: Significant differences were identified immediately after RME as the maxilla moved forward, the mandible moved downward, overjet increased and overbite decreased. During the <b>retention</b> <b>period,</b> the maxilla relapsed backwards and the mandible was displaced forward, leaving patients with an overall increase in anterior facial height. CONCLUSION: RME treatment allowed more anterior than inferior positioning of the mandible during the <b>retention</b> <b>period,</b> thus significantly improving Class II dental relationship in 75 % of the patients evaluated...|$|R

5000|$|The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) drew {{attention}} to the Evaluation Report on the EU Data Retention Direction in 2011, which considered that the shortening of mandatory retention would improve the proportionality of the scheme. The Report also found that 67% of accessed data was under 3 months old and only 2% of requested data was over 1 year old across the EU. The AHRC also pointed to the decision of the CJEU in Digital Rights Ireland, in which a <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> of no less than 6 months and up to 2 years was assessed. The CJEU held that the data <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> was arbitrary and not limited to what was 'reasonably necessary' to achieve the objective pursued. Accordingly, the AHRC considered the 2 year <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> as unreasonable and disproportionate. The LCA also considered the two-year period as unusually long by international standards and not satisfactorily justified.|$|R

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} implicates {{sleep in}} the consolidation of various kinds of memories. We investigated the effect of sleep on memory for face identity, a declarative form of memory that is indispensable for nearly all social interaction. In the acquisition phase, observers viewed faces that {{they were required to}} remember over a variable <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> (0 – 36 hours). In the test phase, observers viewed intermixed old and new faces and judged seeing each before. Participants were classified according to acquisition and test times into seven groups. Memory strength (d 9) and response bias (c) were evaluated. Substantial time spent awake (12 hours or more) during the <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> impaired face recognition memory evaluated at test, whereas sleep per se during the <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> did little to enhance the memory. Wakefulness during retention also led to a tightening of the decision criterion. Our findings suggest that sleep passively and transiently shelters face recognition memory from waking interference (exposure) but does not actively aid in its long-term consolidation...|$|R

5000|$|Disposition is the {{practice}} of handling information that is less frequently accessed or has met its assigned <b>retention</b> <b>periods.</b> Less frequently accessed records may be considered for relocation to an inactive records facility until they have met their assigned <b>retention</b> <b>period.</b> [...] "Although {{a small percentage of}} organizational information never loses its value, the value of most information tends to decline over time until it has no further value to anyone for any purpose. The value of nearly all business information is greatest soon after it is created and generally remains active for only a short time --one to three years or so-- after which its importance and usage declines. The record then makes its life cycle transition to a semi-active and finally to an inactive state." [...] <b>Retention</b> <b>periods</b> are based on the creation of an organization-specific retention schedule, based on research of the regulatory, statutory and legal requirements for management of information for the industry in which the organization operates. Additional items to consider when establishing a <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> are any business needs that may exceed those requirements and consideration of the potential historic, intrinsic or enduring value of the information. If the information has met all of these needs and is no longer considered to be valuable, it should be disposed of by means appropriate for the content. This may include ensuring that others cannot obtain access to outdated or obsolete information as well as measures for protection privacy and confidentiality.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the quantitative effects of various emotions and <b>retention</b> <b>periods</b> on the color vividness of visual memory. Background: Although numerous studies have focused on the effects of emotions on memory such as visual detail and vividness of emotional events compared to neutral events, the relationship between emotion and visual memory is ambiguous yet. Furthermore, there were few studies on the effect of emotion on vividness of visual memory. Method: A total of 68 subjects were participated in serial experiments proceed on online and the experiments had two phases: recognition phase and reproduction phase. The 15 photographs were used as visual stimuli and all experiments were conducted over the internet(experiment website) and the results were collected on the web database. Results: The <b>retention</b> <b>period,</b> sleep-arousal emotion and subjective saturation of visual stimuli had a significant effect on the color vividness of visual memory.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of middle–power–laser irradiation (19 mW wave length and 904 nm) on bone regeneration after rapid midpalatal expansion of the sagital suture in Wistar albino strain rats. Methodology: 10 rats were divided in two groups: in the first group the midpalatal suture was expanded but nonirradiated and the <b>retention</b> <b>period</b> lasted seven days. The second group was treated like the first one but irradiation was applied during 8 minutes per day during the <b>retention</b> <b>period.</b> Rats from both groups were sacrificed in a CO 2 chamber for posterior histological examination. Results: Microscopic observation showed significant acceleration on bone regeneration in the irradiation group when compared with the control group. Conclusions: This findings suggest that middle-power-laser irradiation can accelerate bone regeneration in the midpalatal suture after rapid palatal expansion. The mechanism by which laser irradiation promotes bone formation is not fully understood but it probably works by increasing angiogenesis, ATP and collagen synthesis and calcium ions deposits due to modification in the cellular membrane permeability.
