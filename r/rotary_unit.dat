40|$|Filament winding {{technique}} is developed {{as the primary}} process for composite cylindrical structures fabrication at low cost. Fibres are wound on a rotating mandrel by a filament winding machine where resin impregnated fibres pass through a pay-out eye. This paper aims to develop and optimize a 3 -axis, lightweight, practical, efficient, portable filament winding machine to satisfy the customer demand, which can fabricate pipes and round shape cylinders with resins. There are 3 main units on the 3 -axis filament winding machine, which are the <b>rotary</b> <b>unit,</b> the delivery unit and control system unit. Comparison with previous existing filament winding machines in the factory, it has 3 degrees of freedom and can fabricate more complex shape specimens based on the mandrel shape and particular control system. The machine has been designed and fabricated on 3 axes movements with control system. The x-axis is for movement of the carriage, the y-axis is the rotation of mandrel and the z-axis is {{the movement of the}} pay-out eye. Cylindrical specimens with different dimensions and winding angles were produced. 3 -axis automated filament winding machine has been successfully designed with simple control system...|$|E

But they do require periodic downtime for mechanical maintenance, such as ball bearing replacement. In larger systems redundancy of the system ensures the availability of processes during this maintenance. Battery-based designs do not require downtime if the batteries can be hot-swapped, which is usually the case for larger <b>units.</b> Newer <b>rotary</b> <b>units</b> use technologies such as magnetic bearings and air-evacuated enclosures to increase standby efficiency and reduce maintenance to very low levels.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of controlling rotary dynamics {{at the molecular}} level has been recognized by several authors. 1, 2 In that context, we have been interested in structures that emulate macroscopic gyroscopes while in the rigid environment of their crystalline solids. 3, 4 Up to now, these have been constructed with phenylene rotators linked by dialkynyl axles to bulky triarylmethanes (trityls) or triptycenes. 4 Using solid state 2 H NMR, we have shown that the rotary dynamics depend primarily on steric shielding. While structures with simple triptycyls are static, molecular gyroscopes with trityl groups display 180 ° rotation 5 with rates of ca. 500 Hz at 300 K, and compounds with tert-butyl-substituted trityl frames reach rates that are> 100 MHz at the same temperature 6 (Figure 1).

The Smart Space Drilling System (SSDS), which is currently being developed at Northeastern University (NU), is a compact self-propelled, steerable electromechanical drilling system that can penetrate into large depths in planetary bodies. In this paper we present the detailed design and modeling of the SSDS. Its main components are: a) the drill bit/cuttings bucket, b) the <b>rotary</b> propulsion <b>unit</b> including three 3 -degree of freedom (DOF) propulsion actuators, c) the power/control module, d) the non-rotating steering unit including three 1 -DOF steering actuators and e) the communication module. Three 3 -DOF propulsion actuators uniformly distributed around the <b>rotary</b> propulsion <b>unit</b> impart rotating, linear motion to the drilling bit, while another three 1 -DOF steering actuators provide the steering force for automatic directional control. The SSDS is propelled {{in the manner of}} a turning screw, which offers simpler kinematics structure, higher efficiency and thus, potential for miniaturization and deep drilling. Mathematical modeling and analysis of the SSDS were conducted to predict, design and optimize its performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Pesticide {{application}} efficiency from aircraft {{could be}} increased substantially, and required downwind buffer distances to avoid drift damage reduced significantly, if sharp issuing points or pins {{were added to}} existing rotary cage atomizer designs.
