5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent <b>response</b> <b>rate.</b> The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E
5|$|Transport links {{generally}} {{are regarded as}} an important factor which affects a company’s decision on where to locate, and thus invest, although the latest survey shows quality of telecommunications moving above transport in importance. Survey evidence indicates that a quarter of companies regard access to air services as {{an important factor in}} the decision of where in the UK to locate operations, whilst one in ten companies report that the absence of good air transport links has affected their decision to invest in the UK. The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> and therefore open to bias, though this issue has been recognised and rationalised by the report's authors.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{find ways}} to improve <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> of medical and health surveys. We {{investigated}} whether a prenotification letter instead of a second reminder and varying senders of the questionnaires would affect <b>response</b> <b>rates.</b> Study Design and Setting: We present the results of two studies. In the first study, four groups were compared that either received a prenotification letter (group 1 and 2) or a second reminder letter (group 3 and 4); received the questionnaire from either a research institute (group 1 and 3) or a health insurance company (HIC; group 2 and 4). In the second study, we compared two groups that received the questionnaire sent by either a HIC or a hospital. <b>Response</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>response</b> speed, respondent characteristics, item nonresponse, and mean scores on quality aspects and global ratings were compared. Results: <b>Response</b> <b>rates</b> {{did not differ significantly}} between groups. Prenotification groups returned their questionnaires faster. No other significant differences were found for response speed, respondent characteristics, item nonresponse, or mean scores. Conclusion: A prenotification letter does only increase initial response speed and does not increase total <b>response</b> <b>rates.</b> A prenotification letter should be considered when quick response is desirable.

The <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> in solid tumors where rapalogs have been used as a single-agent therapy have been modest.
