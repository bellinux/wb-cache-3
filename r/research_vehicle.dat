25|$|The Mississippi State University XV-11A Marvel was an {{experimental}} American STOL research aircraft of the 1960s. The MARVEL (Mississippi Aerophysics <b>Research</b> <b>Vehicle</b> with Extended Latitude) was a single-engined pusher monoplane {{fitted with a}} boundary layer control system. The first all-composite aircraft, it carried out its initial program of research {{on behalf of the}} US Army in the late 1960s, and was rebuilt in the 1980s as a proof-of-concept for a utility aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Canted {{vertical}} stabilizers {{are another}} distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high {{angle of attack}} ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge flaps and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha <b>Research</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65–70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes. F/A-18 stabilators were also used as canards on NASA's F-15S/MTD.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Zora Arkus-Duntov {{and other}} GM {{engineers}} had become fascinated with mid and rear-engine designs. It {{was during the}} Corvair's development that Duntov took the mid/rear-engine layout to its limits in the CERV I concept. The Chevrolet Experimental <b>Research</b> <b>Vehicle</b> was a lightweight, open-wheel single-seat racer. A rear-engined Corvette was briefly considered during 1958–60, progressing {{as far as a}} full-scale mock-up designed around the Corvair's entire rear-mounted power package, including its complicated air-cooled flat-six {{as an alternative to the}} Corvette's usual water-cooled V-8. By the fall of 1959, elements of the Q-Corvette and the Sting Ray Special racer would be incorporated into experimental project XP-720, which was the design program that led directly to the production 1963 Corvette Sting Ray. The XP-720 sought to deliver improved passenger accommodation, more luggage space, and superior ride and handling over previous Corvettes.|$|E

2500|$|... "At {{the time}} of the initial {{conception}} of the Short SB5 research aircraft (1949), it was recognised that the trend towards higher angles of sweepback was likely to continue, and this was emphasised by the existence of a design for an operational fighter aircraft, the English Electric P1 (Lightning), which was to have a sweepback of 60°. There was then no flight experience with wings of this amount of sweepback. The SB5 was designed to allow a gradual approach to this configuration, flying initially with 50° sweepback before conversion to 60° when it would resemble, aerodynamically, a seven-eighths scale model of the Lightning. To increase its usefulness as a <b>research</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the aircraft was capable of further modification to operate with 69° of wing sweepback." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a vertical takeoff (VTO) fighter, the proposed fighter {{was intended to be}} launched from an inclined ramp. Already in the early design stage at Fairey, the Ministry of Supply (MoS) decided to have the aircraft built as a more conventional jet-powered <b>research</b> <b>vehicle</b> to Ministry specification E.10/47. The Fairey Type R design was a mid-wing tail-less delta monoplane, with a circular cross-section fuselage and engine air-inlet at the extreme front. The engine was a Rolls-Royce Derwent 8 centrifugal turbojet. Although designed as a transonic aircraft, the Delta 1 had a short-coupled, [...] "portly" [...] appearance, completely at odds with Fairey's next design, the sleek and elegant Delta 2. Three aircraft were ordered with the name [...] "Fairey Delta" [...] applied to the project; subsequently, the name was changed to Fairey Delta 1.|$|E

[...] As a result of these studies, the US Army awarded the Department a contract to develop a new STOL research aircraft: the XV-11 MARVEL ("Mississippi Aerophysics <b>Research</b> <b>Vehicle,</b> Extended Latitude"). [...] The new aircraft was to feature a novel form of wing warping to deflect the wing trailing edges to vary the wing's camber instead of conventional flaps, while the wings were to be built of glassfibre {{in order to ensure that}} the wing was as smooth as possible. In order to test these features, it was decided to build a smaller and less powerful test-bed.|$|E
2500|$|Developed by the Advanced Projects Group, a June 1958 {{report by}} Avro's Engineering Department {{described}} a Space Threshold Vehicle intended to [...] "get a man into {{the threshold of}} space and recover him, flying back through the corridor", [...] where winged flight was possible between maximum altitude that could sustain lift from a winged vehicle and maximum tolerable structural temperature. [...] This {{was estimated to be}} an altitude of between 150,000 and 200,000 feet. The STV would be single-stage-to-orbit aircraft, similar to Lockheed's X-30 and the UK's HOTOL proposals of the 1980s, with capability for in-flight refueling, and an expected speed of 6,000mph (Mach 8.5+). Avro's computer capacities provided capability in developing theories and methods similar to modern 3-dimensional modeling of fluid dynamics. Avro envisioned a delta-shaped vehicle with downward winglets (similar to the TSR-2's), varying engine nacelle positions, titanium skin, and first flight of a <b>research</b> <b>vehicle</b> in 1962. [...] It should be noted that many engineers involved in this and similar Avro designs were later heavily involved in NASA Projects Mercury Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2014, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin a {{contract}} to study the feasibility of building the SR-72's propulsion system using existing turbine engine technologies. [...] The $892,292 contract funds a design study to determine the viability of a TBCC propulsion system by combining one of several current turbine engines, with a very low Mach ignition Dual Mode Ramjet (DMRJ). [...] NASA previously funded a Lockheed Martin study that found speeds up to Mach 7 could be achieved with a dual-mode engine combining turbine and ramjet technologies. [...] The problem with hypersonic propulsion {{has always been the}} gap between the highest speed capabilities of a turbojet, from around Mach 2.2 to the lowest speed of a ramjet at Mach 4. Typical turbine engines cannot achieve high enough speeds for a ramjet to take over and continue accelerating. [...] The NASA-Lockheed Martin study is looking at the possibility of a higher-speed turbine engine or a ramjet that can function in a turbine engine's slower flight envelope; the DARPA HTV-3X had demonstrated a low-speed ramjet that could operate below Mach 3. [...] Existing turbofan engines powering jet fighters and other experimental designs are being considered for modification. [...] If the study is successful, NASA will fund a demonstrator to test the DMRJ in a flight <b>research</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
