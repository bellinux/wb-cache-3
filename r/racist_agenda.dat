50|$|At {{the onset}} of World War I as Florida teemed with a never-before-seen wave of Anti-German sentiment, Catts {{attempted}} to exploit this to further his own previously mentioned Anti-Catholic and <b>racist</b> <b>agendas.</b> The governor publicly theorized that the monks of St. Leo Abbey near Tampa (many of whom were either German-Americans or German immigrants) were planning to arm Florida's African American community for a popular revolt in favor of Kaiser Wilhelm II, after which Pope Benedict XV (a well documented pacifist, who was Italian, not German) would take over Florida and move the Holy See to nearby San Antonio and close all of the Protestant churches. This actually caused {{a fair number of}} German settlers to move to friendlier parts of the country. The abbot of St. Leo, Right Rev.

[...] "Racism," [...] then, is the use of racialist assumptions to promote social or political ends, a course that Todorov regards as leading to [...] "particularly catastrophic results."

(My book has been published in the same series as that under review). Jacqueline Fear-Segal, senior lecturer in American history at the University of East Anglia, England, acknowledges her debt to this literature. Yet she validly insists on the importance of her contribution. Believing that previous studies have not 2 ̆ 2 fully unpacked 2 ̆ 2 issues of race, Fear-Segal contrasts the overt egalitarian rhetoric of white educators with what she sees as covert <b>racist</b> <b>agendas,</b> while probing the complex responses of Indian children and adults, many from the Great Plains region. Briefly placing the campaign of acculturation in the context of tribal education, rising American racism, and missionary enterprises, she proceeds in her core chapters to make creative use of archival and less-exploited source materials, such as pupil artwork, school newspapers, maps, and photographs. She compares the racial pessimism of General Samuel C. Armstrong, founder of the Hampton Institute in Virginia (schooling both Indians and African Americans), with the apparent optimism of General Richard H. Pratt, founder of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. Fear-Segal critiques the 2 ̆ 2 monstrous power game 2 ̆ 2 of surveillance at Carlisle; moreover, her depiction of the spatiality of racism is a major contribution to the literature. Regardless of Pratt 2 ̆ 7 s rhetoric, 2 ̆ 2 Indian children lived and dined separately from whites and if they died, they were buried in a segregated cemetery. 2 ̆ 2 The last part of White Man 2 ̆ 7 s Club examines the diverse effects of boarding schooling on students and later tribal generations, but also demonstrates Indian resilience and manipulation of white learning...|$|R

40|$|Current {{interest}} in traditional music is driving {{a search for}} new repertoire as scholars and enthusiasts seek to unearth working musical manuscripts from {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries. This thesis looks at a selection of such compilations, examining their origins and cultural contexts and re-contextualizing them within the current revivalist milieu. It examines the journey of melody from printed sources to performance, a process in which the manuscripts represent a key step: they are a conduit, a means through which music is created. The first chapter sets the scene for the thesis, exploring the origins and contexts of the manuscripts that will be considered. It offers a review of literature and presents a challenge to some of the accepted notions surrounding folk and traditional music, such as genre (a relatively recent construct), authenticity and the acquiring of melodies as an end in itself. The second chapter explores the current drive toward establishing regional styles, which are unstable constructs, and it examines the use of music as a catalyst for nationalist and <b>racist</b> <b>agendas.</b> It also concerns music as a product of the critical political economy and addresses aspects of repertoire, variation and the downward filtration of culture. It contextualizes twentieth-century {{interest in}} traditional music. Chapter Three approaches the chronological starting point of the thesis, John Playford's English Dancing Master. It considers Playford's impact on the many subsequent publications of country-dance music and the adoption of country-dance melodies into popular usage. As evidence of the deployment of these melodies along with military music and popular song, the pre- 1800 manuscripts of Henry Atkinson, William Vickers and Joshua Jackson are scrutinised. Chapter Four addresses the main focus of the work, the anonymous Campbell I manuscript (circa 1810), which demonstrates a melange of dance music, military music, art music and song. The chapter highlights the interdependence of these musics and the social settings from which they emanate. Chapter Five, which considers the nineteenth-century manuscripts of Lawrence Leadley, Amelia Benwell, Francis Rippon and William Norris, shows how developments in musical instrument technology and industrialisation combined with a broadening complexity of technique and expertise to produce greater diversity. The final chapter argues that genre boundaries, as currently understood, are not borne out by the evidence presented in the manuscript compilations. The epilogue looks at the continuing use of score for the creation of music for social interaction through an examination of a recent manuscript, Campbell II. The thesis as a whole highlights a mismatch between the current perception of vernacular music and the actuality of that music in its original context. ...|$|R

40|$|This is the {{introduction}} to a special issue on Righting Feminism. In recent years, we have witnessed the multifarious ways in which feminism as an emancipatory project dedicated to women's liberation has increasingly “converged” with non-emancipatory/racist, conservative, and neo-liberal economic and political agendas. Today, feminist themes are not only being "mainstreamed" but are also increasingly being mobilized to bolster existing power hierarchies as well as neo-liberal and right-wing xenophobic political agendas. The convergence of feminism with these dominant ideologies and forces has taken many forms in the West. In Europe, right-wing nationalist parties have utilized gender equality to further a <b>racist,</b> anti-immigrant <b>agenda.</b> In the US, not only has gender equality been brandished to justify imperialist interventions in countries with majority Muslim populations, but, more recently, high-powered corporate women have publicly endorsed a form of feminism that is informed through and through by a market rationality. This themed issue intervenes and queries {{what appears to be}} the “righting of feminism”. For us, this notion refers not only to feminism’s rightward turn but also to the way in which rights language, namely, women’s rights, have been mobilized to advance non-emancipatory goals. And, yet, righting feminism simultaneously – and crucially – connotes a political desire and aspiration to make feminism “right” again by reclaiming its emancipatory potential. This issue includes an extensive critical introduction which provides an overview of the field and presents the work of the contributors. Each of the six essays in the issue then discuss crucial aspects of the ways in which feminism has been increasingly associated with either neoliberal or right-wing xenophobic ideologies and propose original analyses in order to shed new light on this perplexing phenomenon...|$|R

In the former Comas (1961) lashed out against Garret for his circular arguments.

40|$|Created {{to comment}} on Antebellum and Reconstruction literature, the tragic mulatto concept is habitually applied to eras beyond the 19 th century. The tragic mulatto has become an end rather than a means to {{questioning}} <b>racist</b> and abolitionist <b>agendas.</b> Rejecting the pathetic and self-destructive traits inscribed by the tragic label, this dissertation uses geographic, cultural, and racial boundary crossing to theorize a rereading of mixed race characters in Harlem Renaissance literature. Focusing on train, automobile, and boat travel, the study analyzes {{the relationship between the}} character, transportation, and technology whereby the notion of race is questioned. Furthermore, the dissertation divides travel into departure, interstitial, and arrival phases. With the ability to extend perception and experience, media is also interpreted here as transportation. Using figurative and literal travel, the selected narratives move between localities to allegorize 20 th mixed race subjectivity. Socially ambiguous and anonymous, interstitial moments suspend the normative performance of race and enable the selected authors’ investigations of race binarism. After the introduction establishes a theoretical frame composed of transnational and migration studies methods, the ensuing chapters demonstrate the interpretive function of travel in Jean Toomer’s Cane, Nella Larsen’s Quicksand, and Walter White’s Flight. This reading is aided by the connection between modernism and mixed race identity as expounded upon in the works of Robert E. Park, Mark Whalan, Cherene Sherrard-Johnson, Jeanne Scheper. However, it differs from these in its assertion of travel as an interpretive mode for mixed race literature as a tradition...|$|R

5000|$|Compulsory {{or forced}} sterilizations and abortions may also {{occur in the}} context of {{population}} control policies.From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other. At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City population control policies came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies.

In 2014, the Sweden Democrats, a party conceptualised as culturally racist, was re-elected with 13 % of the votes, with {{a presence in}} almost all municipalities.

40|$|Water {{issues have}} {{for a long time}} been of central {{political}} concern in South Africa due to the scarcity of the resource. During the apartheid era, the distribution of water was deeply intertwined with a nationalist and <b>racist</b> <b>agenda.</b> In the transition to democracy in 1994, water became an important issue, both symbolically and materially, for a redistribution of resources within the country. This thesis explores the effects of this shift in water politics in the local context of eThekwini municipality. The municipality has been argued to be an exemplary case in relation to global norms of water management. It has, however, also been the target of severe critique. Based on narrative interviews with water users in the municipality the thesis inquires into how the arrangement of water service delivery matters in terms of people’s lives. On the basis of these narratives, the thesis shows how water governance can be understood as biopolitically performative in the way that notions of Self and Other and distinctions between different lifestyles are shaped. Ultimately, such a biopolitical reading of the water users’ narratives illustrates how an implementation of the right to basic water can work so as to (re) produce, or further entrench, distinctions between different forms of life...|$|E
40|$|From the Nation to the People of a Potential New Historical Bloc: Rethinking Popular Sovereignty through Gramsci Abstract During {{the past}} decades {{traditional}} notions of sovereignty have been challenged in Europe. First, {{we have the}} erosion of sovereignty induced {{by the process of}} European Integration. Secondly, the new waves of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe and the anti-immigrant and anti-refugee policies of ‘Fortress Europe’ and ‘closed borders’ along with the intensification of racism and islamophobia, both as ideological climate but also as official state policy, have opened up the debate regarding the relation between sovereignty and ethnicity. On the one hand, any attempt towards a rupture with the embedded and constitutionalised neoliberalism of the EU in order to initiate processes of social transformation and emancipation, should necessarily {{take the form of a}} reclaiming of popular sovereignty and democratic control over crucial aspects of economic and social policy. On the other hand, we must deal with the association of sovereignty with nationalism, racism and colonialism, tragically exemplified in the way the Far Right links the question of sovereignty to its own authoritarian <b>racist</b> <b>agenda.</b> To deal with these challenges I take a critical position to both neo-Kantian conceptions of cosmopolitan rights and ‘neo-republican’ defences of the nation-state and the people as common history and shared values.

40|$|Bachelor’s Thesis in Journalism Title: One Hundred Years of Swedishness. A Study of Vidi, Den Svenske Nationalsocialisten, Nydemokraten and SD-kuriren Authors: Nils Gruvebäck and Rebecca Lundberg Academic {{term and}} year: Spring term 2015 Department: Journalism, Media and Communication Supervisor: Tomas Andersson Odén Examiner: Mathias A. Färdigh During {{the last two}} decades {{nationalist}} movements have mobilized throughout Europe. In Sweden the growing party is called the Sweden Democrats. During these years they have been accused of having a <b>racist</b> <b>agenda,</b> but since 2005 when Jimmy Åkesson became leader of the party, they have changed their logotype from a burning torch to a blue and yellow hepatica, their popularity has grown and they have tried to dissociate themselves from their rightwing past. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how nationalist movements in Sweden have developed during the last one hundred years. By starting with Vidi, an antisemitic newspaper from 1914, moving through the 1930 ’s and the Nazi party National Socialist Worker’s Party, to 1994 and the populist party New Democrats and the Sweden Democrats 2014 we want to see how these parties differ from one another - and what they have in common. By using the ECA-method (Ethnographic Content Analysis) we are exploring how swedishness is portrayed and constructed in four nationalist magazines associated to these movements: Vidi, Den Svenske Nationalsocialisten, Nydemokraten and SD-kuriren. Through a postcolonial perspective we investigate how the idea of Swedishness changes throughout the years, in relation to how the idea of the other changes. We see how the idea of Swedishness is created by how the other is portrayed, and how the two are in one way symbiotic and get meaning from one another. We also examine how media is portrayed in these magazines. In a Swedish nationalist discourse it is not unusual to accuse media for censorship, lies and “Swedish hostility”. As this study will show, the idea of Swedish hostility was vital already in 1914...|$|E
40|$|At {{first glance}} Thomas Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 s presidential actions {{concerning}} the Haitian Revolution seem to denote racially motivated decisions predicated upon fear. However, through a deeper analysis of primary documents, Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 s position appears more economically and politically ambitious. By 1791, the French colony of Saint Domingue held {{the title of}} the richest colony in the Caribbean and the world 2 ̆ 7 s leading producer of sugar. In addition, Saint Domingue consumed about sixteen percent of all of America 2 ̆ 7 s exports. Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 s personal opinions concerning revolution and trade on the island of Saint Domingue contradict the statements of his administration. Partisan politics manifested a stern voice within the Republican Party that cried out for an end to all trade with the island. Thomas Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 s republican and revolutionary ideals of freedom, as well as the ideals of many Americans, became transformed by the social transgression of the Caribbean blacks against white hegemony. Their actions, along with press accounts, become 2 ̆ 2 grotesque 2 ̆ 2 in comparison to pure republican and revolutionary ideals. Jefferson, though publicly in tune with the wishes of his party, used his chief advisors to carry out a foreign policy that appeased the South and allowed for continued trade with Saint Domingue. Contemporary historians often categorize Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 s foreign policy concerning Haiti as a completely <b>racist</b> <b>agenda.</b> For example, historians frequently cite Jefferson as having said he would, 2 ̆ 2 reduce Toussaint to starvation, 2 ̆ 2 but in reality this excerpt comes from a report sent by Louis Pinchon, the French chargé d 2 ̆ 7 affaires, to his superiors. While labeling this report false seems excessive, ignoring the possibility of exaggeration by Pinchon and placation by Jefferson becomes a dangerous oversight. Through a fresh analysis of primary documents, especially those used out of context, an understanding emerges that portrays Jefferson not as a racial equalitarian or as 2 ̆ 2 a man intellectually undone by his negrophobia, 2 ̆ 2 but as a political figure who acknowledges the republican values inherent in revolution and, at the same time, the necessity of economic prosperity to sustain the United States...|$|E
40|$|The {{two decades}} {{following}} World War I witnessed {{the collapse of}} the international trade, capital flows, and migration that had united much of world in the late 19 th century. Germany lay {{at the center of this}} global economic crisis, which in many ways led to National Socialism and the Second World War. As Adam Tooze has illustrated, rather than meekly accepting its place in a global order dominated by Great Britain and America, the “originality” of Nazi Germany was to mount an epic challenge through the conquest of territory in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Formal empire in the east, however, was only one solution to the de-globalizing world that German elites pursued during the 1920 s and 1930 s. My dissertation shows how a diverse group of German businessmen and academics used the economic crisis to shift their nation’s commercial ties away from America and the West and toward Central and Southeastern Europe. They created a continental economic bloc dominated by Germany, one that in many ways had more in common with the liberal imperialism of Great Britain and France than with the highly <b>racist</b> <b>agenda</b> of National Socialism. My research helps us re-conceptualize Germany’s place in Europe in two ways. First, it demonstrates how German businessmen used soft power to make their nation’s hard, economic preponderance legitimate to the commercial elites of Southeastern Europe. Scholars conventionally use this term to describe the foreign policy of liberal states like America, but I show how authoritarian regimes like Nazi Germany have also deployed soft power. German area studies institutes, trade fairs, and business associations operated through a network of agents in Southeastern Europe to cultivate personal contacts with local elites, train local merchants, lobby local governments, advertise for German products, and ease the flow of information between the commercial centers of Southeastern Europe and Germany. By centering my study of German imperialism on private institutions instead of the state, I argue that imperialism rests as much on webs of co-opted sociability as raw military or political power. Second, I show how a German-led European economic bloc remained a policy pursued by German leaders until late into the 1930 s. Historians usually frame Nazi Germany’s foreign policy as a tense combination of Pan-German Nationalism and the drive for Lebensraum in Eastern Europe. Yet in the 1920 s German business elites designed a third path— Grossraumwirtschaft, or large area economy—that would bring stability to their industries during this period of crisis. This strategy represents a clear line of continuity between the Weimar Republic and Third Reich, since many business elites in both periods believed a continental bloc offered a better long-term strategy for Germany than either free trade or autarchy and war. And in contrast to Eastern Europe—the heart of Nazi Germany's radical plans for re-population and genocide—these businessmen planned to develop the economies of Southeastern Europe by fashioning them into a complementary economic space that would serve German industry. I conclude my dissertation by recounting how this alternative imperial vision succumbed to the allure of the Nazi’s more radical re-ordering of Europe after 1938. By then Germany's private organizations progressively lost their freedom to maneuver, and tacked with the wind by adopting certain aspects of National Socialist ideology. They helped remove Jewish merchants from German-Balkan commerce, and they eventually used their expertise to use Southeastern Europe for the Nazi war machine...|$|E
