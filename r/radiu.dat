5000|$|Overnight the Front commander, Marshal I.S. Konev, {{ordered a}} {{regrouping}} {{of the attack}} forces. The 81st and the 72nd Guards were to concentrate on a narrow 4 km sector between Mount Hushenei and <b>Radiu.</b> They were to penetrate the German defenses northwest of Târgu Frumos and support the commitment of 5th Tank Army forces into the penetration. But this assault met [...] "with completely no success", and the division suffered considerable losses. In the words of its official history: [...] "After an agonizing six days of attempts to penetrate the Târgu Frumos fortified region, the armies of General Shumilov Guards and Marshal Rotmistrov Guards Tank did not succeed.

The 81st Guards was attacking {{in the first}} echelon of its corps, {{with support from the}} 27th Guards Tank Brigade plus the leading brigades of 29th Tank Corps, and the division's {{official}} history describes its mission as follows: [...] "After an artillery and mortar preparation, in cooperation with the tanks of 5th Guards Tank Army, penetrate the enemy's defenses along the Cuza Voda Station and Mount Hushenei front... The immediate mission is to capture Cuza Voda, <b>Radiu,</b> and Mount Hushenei. Subsequently, capture Harmanasu and Helestieni and seize a foothold on Mount Krivesti by day's end." [...] The attack began at 0400 hrs., and in the early going the 7th Guards Army advanced from 4 - 10 km, in the direction of Târgu Frumos. According to the official history: [...] "The resistance offered by the Romanian infantry was weak. As soon as the Soviet tanks appeared in front of their trenches, with infantry advancing steadily behind them, few of them remained..." [...] But this resistance increased as the Romanians retreated southwards. [...] "Retreating southward, the enemy clung to every house and hillock, trying with all of his might to halt us as far as possible forward from the fortified region... between the Seret and Prut Rivers. The Royal forces offered particularly strong resistance in the sector from the village of Helestieni to Mount Hushenei..." [...] By midday the division had bypassed and isolated several of Grossdeutschland's strong points and advanced up to 12km southwards, capturing several other fortified villages and approaching the outskirts of Târgu Frumos by late afternoon, before being intercepted by a battlegroup from the 3rd SS Panzer Division. In addition, Grossdeutschland committed a battery of 88s and its tank reserves against the Soviet armor. This served to force the 81st, and its support, back up the valley as far as <b>Radiu.</b>|$|E

When this potential is introduced in the effective potential and Kohn-Sham equations are solved by iterations, calculated total energies and eigen values reproduce with high accuracy the experimental values. Total electronic densities obtained with this scheme are employed to find numerically the point where the derivatives of the kinetic energy respect to the total electronic density equal either the exchange correlation potential or half the effective Kohn-Sham potential.

In a {{statistical}} {{study of the}} decay of individual sunspots based on DPR data {{we find that the}} mean instantaneous area decay rate is related to the spot radius r and the maximal radius r 0 as D = CD r/r 0, CD = 32. 0 ± 0. 26 MSH/day. This implies that sunspots on the mean follow a parabolic decay law; the traditional linear decay law is excluded by the data. The validity of the Gnevyshev–Waldmeier relationship between the maximal area A 0 and lifetime T of a spot group, A 0 /T ≃ 10 MSH/day, is also demonstrated for individual sunspots. No evidence is found for a supposed supergranular “quantization ” of sunspot areas.
