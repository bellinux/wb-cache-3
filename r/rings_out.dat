5|$|When {{the great}} bell <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> every full hour, {{struck by a}} large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek {{personification}} of time, is traditionally nicknamed Hans von Thann by the Bernese. The wooden bell-striker, which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nürnberg, while the current and most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{construct}} new <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> of given ones. The aim of such constructions is often to improve certain properties of the ring so as to make it more readily understandable. For example, an integral domain that is integrally closed in its field of fractions is called normal. This is a desirable property, for example any normal one-dimensional ring is necessarily regular. Rendering a ring normal is known as normalization.|$|E
50|$|The game {{uses the}} <b>ring</b> <b>out</b> system, {{which is a}} forcible {{maneuver}} that ejects the opponent from the arena and gains an automatic victory for the round. To achieve a <b>ring</b> <b>out,</b> a character must be knocked outside the ring by an enemy (the player cannot accidentally or deliberately get a <b>ring</b> <b>out</b> by hopping <b>out</b> of the <b>ring).</b> The only exception to this rule is Cervantes and SoulEdge, who can get a <b>ring</b> <b>out</b> by themselves upon performing a certain special attack, {{as long as they}} are near the edge of the arena.|$|R

25|$|A Wells Fargo agent, Ashby, {{enters and}} announces {{that he is}} chasing the bandit Ramerrez and his gang of Mexicans. Rance toasts Minnie, the woman who owns the saloon, as his future wife, which makes Sonora jealous. The two men begin to fight. Rance draws his {{revolver}} but at that moment, a shot <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> and Minnie stands next to the bar with a rifle in her hands ("Hello, Minnie!"). She gives the miners a reading lesson from the Bible ("Dove eravamo?").|$|E
25|$|Present in the D Ring is a finescale {{structure}} with waves 30km apart. First {{seen in the}} gap between the C Ring and D73, the structure was found during Saturn's 2009 equinox to extend a radial distance of 19,000km from the D Ring to the inner edge of the B Ring. The waves are interpreted as a spiral pattern of vertical corrugations of 2 to 20 m amplitude; the fact that the period of the waves is decreasing over time (from 60km in 1995 to 30km by 2006) allows a deduction that the pattern may have originated in late 1983 with the impact of a cloud of debris (with a mass of ~1012 kg) from a disrupted comet that tilted the <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> of the equatorial plane. A similar spiral pattern in Jupiter's main ring has been attributed to a perturbation caused by impact of material from Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994.|$|E
500|$|If, however, God forbid, anyone {{swollen with}} diabolic spirit should {{be tempted to}} {{diminish}} or annul this brief document of my arrangement and confirmation, {{let him know that}} on the final and great day of judgment, when the archangel's shrill trumpet <b>rings</b> <b>out,</b> when graves burst open by themselves and give up the bodies now revived, when every element trembles, with the traitor Judas, who is called [...] "son of perdition" [...] by the Sower's merciful Offspring, he is to perish in eternal confusion within the hungry flames of unspeakable torments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ringing</b> <b>out</b> is {{particularly}} important when mixing monitors, or foldback. As the performer or musician is usually behind the main PA system, the monitors are so they can hear themselves. As such, a microphone {{is much more likely}} to feedback through the monitor loudspeakers than the main PA. <b>Ringing</b> <b>out</b> can become quite complex when working with a large number of microphones and monitors. Indeed, with larger touring acts, one of the major advantages of the rise in use of in-ear monitors is the minimal <b>ringing</b> <b>out</b> that needs to be done.|$|R

500|$|The tenor {{and bass}} duet [...] "" [...] (An unfathomable light fills the entire orb of the earth), {{is focused on}} the light {{mentioned}} by Simeon, expressed in a joyful mood. The Hofmann notes: [...] "The playful character is shown by the extended, circling coloratura on the word 'Kreis' ('circle' or 'orb'), and the baroque sound effect of statement and response unfolds to the words 'Es schallet kräftig fort und fort' (Powerfully there <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> time after time.)" [...] Jones comments that the trio sonata of two violins and continuo which accompanies the voices [...] "in its vigour and fluency perhaps represents the powerful, continuous sound to which the text refers." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{a meeting}} between Follmer and Regali, Follmer says he is {{finished}} consorting with him, but Regali reminds him he was being bribed, and threatens to blackmail him. In the meantime, Mimms tells Scully that he first noticed the case of Luke Doggett when he read it in a newspaper. He further states that he lied about his name {{so that he could}} help solve the case. At the end, he still pushes that Regali is the real murderer of Doggett's son, and not him. Later on, Doggett approaches Regali. Regali tells him a [...] "hypothetical" [...] story about how a pedophile took a young boy to his home. A [...] "businessman" [...] then walked in on the incident, realized that the boy has seen his face, and feared that the boy might associate him with the crime. The businessman then found a solution to the boy seeing his face: he murdered him. Regali then walks away and Doggett, filled with rage, unholsters his gun and follows. But a gunshot <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> and when Doggett gets outside, he sees Regali has been killed by Follmer. Later, Doggett and Barbara scatter Luke's ashes into the ocean, finally achieving the release he has sought.|$|E
500|$|Barker's drum {{track was}} labeled by Drummerworld as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{creative}} beats of his career," [...] and mainly consists of the same basic beat repeated in sections throughout the verses. The first measure begins with the kick drum and splash cymbal playing on the downbeat, followed by a hit on the bell of the ride cymbal on beat two, preceding an open hi-hat that <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> for a full count on beat three. [...] "The kick, snare, and floor tom are all hit simultaneously on beat four, followed by floor tom hits on the last two sixteenth-note triplets of beat four." [...] The snare is hit on beats two and four, respectively. The song [...] "gradually builds to a powerful, piano-laden crescendo," [...] and the song's final chorus and conclusion take a more uplifting view of the world: [...] "Tomorrow holds such better days / Days when I can still feel alive/ When I can't wait to get outside." [...] DeLonge noted that over six guitar parts were recorded for the [...] "gigantic, sad" [...] choruses, but upon mixing, only four were used. [...] "The extra ones didn't really do anything besides {{make it a little}} more unclear what was going on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Formation of the {{polynomial}} ring, {{together with}} forming factor rings by factoring out ideals, are important tools for constructing new <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> of known ones. For instance, the ring (in fact field) of complex numbers, {{which can be}} constructed from the polynomial ring [...] over the real numbers by factoring out the ideal of multiples of the polynomial [...] Another example is the construction of finite fields, which proceeds similarly, starting out with the field of integers modulo some prime number as the coefficient ring [...] (see modular arithmetic).|$|E
2500|$|Frodo departs for the Undying Lands in the West with Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, {{and many}} Elves, {{including}} Elrond, and Galadriel. [...] Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel all {{carry with them}} the Three Elven <b>Rings</b> <b>out</b> of Middle-Earth. [...] With their departure, the Third Age ended. Sam, Merry, and Pippin watch Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo, and the Elves depart and return home. Now heir to all of Frodo's possessions, Sam returns to Bag End, saddened by Frodo's departure. [...] When Sam returns {{home at the end}} of the book, though, he is greeted by Rosie and his daughter, Elanor.|$|E

[...] He hesitates over various means of death, poison, a noose, etc. [...] He stabs himself with a saber; the blade goes in and out his sleeve. [...] Then he gets a gun, unhooks the mirror from the wall, sets it against the carafe, stands in a good {{position}} to see himself, his image appearing in the mirror. [...] The shot <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> and Pierrot falls, thinking himself dead. [...] When he comes to, he flees the theater of his crime, boards a boat, is taken with seasickness, shipwrecks {{in the middle of the}} most terrifying storm, swims to safety and collapses, exhausted, on a desert island.|$|E

2500|$|The outrage in the North {{was loud}} and strong. Thousands {{attended}} rallies {{in support of}} Sumner in Boston, Albany, Cleveland, Detroit, New Haven, New York, and Providence. [...] More than a million copies of Sumner's speech were distributed. Two weeks after the caning, Ralph Waldo Emerson described the divide the incident represented: [...] "I do not see how a barbarous community and a civilized community can constitute one state. [...] I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom." [...] Conversely, Brooks was praised by Southern newspapers. The Richmond Enquirer editorialized that Sumner should be caned [...] "every morning," [...] praising the attack as [...] "good in conception, better in execution, {{and best of all}} in consequences" [...] and denounced [...] "these vulgar abolitionists in the Senate" [...] who [...] "have been suffered to run too long without collars. They must be lashed into submission." [...] Southerners sent Brooks hundreds of new canes in endorsement of his assault. [...] One was inscribed [...] "Hit him again." [...] Southern lawmakers made <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> of the cane's remains, which they wore on neck chains to show their solidarity with Brooks.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} Peace Bells in the Peace Park. The smaller one is {{used only for}} the Peace Memorial Ceremony. Except that day, it is {{displayed}} in the east building of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. The more well-known Peace Bell stands near the Children's Peace Monument and consists of a large Japanese bell hanging inside a small open-sided structure. Visitors are encouraged to ring the bell for world peace and the loud and melodious tolling of this bell <b>rings</b> <b>out</b> regularly throughout the Peace Park. The Peace Bell was built {{out in the open}} on September 20, 1964. The surface of the bell is a map of the world, and the [...] "sweet spot" [...] is an atomic symbol, designed by Masahiko Katori , cast by Oigo Bell Works, in Takaoka, Toyama. The inscriptions on the bell are in Greek (γνῶθι σεαυτόν), Japanese, and Sanskrit. It is translated as [...] "Know yourself." [...] The Greek embassy donated the bell to the Peace Park and picked out the most appropriate ancient Greek philosophical quote of Socrates. The Sanskrit was translated by the Indian ambassador, and the Japanese by a university lecturer.|$|E
2500|$|A new sign at {{the diner}} {{indicates}} that bare-knuckle fighting will be taking place. The mechanics and their girlfriends, including Luca and Lana, arrive. First, they decide to go drag racing. After the cars crash, they head for the diner. Lana and Luca pull down the shutter of the diner, to see the word [...] "MURDERER" [...] painted in bold, red letters – they hurriedly push the shutter up. The men begin the fighting competition. The fighting areas are marked out using tyres, and a blackboard inscribed [...] "Fight club – score" [...] is hung from a wall. Eight men take part in separate two-men fights, and the winners of each match fight each other successively. Luca is defeated {{by one of the}} mechanics. Lana goes upstairs to her apartment, and is also taken hostage by Angelo. In the midst of the fighting competition, a shot suddenly <b>rings</b> <b>out.</b> Angelo emerges from the apartment with his gun pointed at Lana and Rita. Angelo attacks Luca and they fight, at the pinnacle of the struggle Angelo kisses Luca violently, and then the gun is wrested from Angelo's grip and falls to the ground. Luca subdues Angelo and tries to reach for the gun. Before he can do so, he is shot dead by Lana, descending from the steps leading to the apartment with another gun. Angelo and Rita embrace. The mechanics get shovels to bury Luca and cover up the crime. Once again, we see a large billboard; this time it reads [...] "You are now leaving Harmony. See you again soon!" ...|$|E
