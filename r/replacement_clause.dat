40|$|We {{address the}} problem of proving the total {{correctness}} of transformations of definite logic programs. We consider a general transformation rule, called <b>clause</b> <b>replacement,</b> which consists in transforming a program P into a new program Q by replacing a set Γ 1 of clauses occurring in P by a new set Γ 2 of clauses, provided that Γ 1 and Γ 2 are equivalent in the least Herbrand model M(P) of the program P. We propose a general method for proving that transformations based on <b>clause</b> <b>replacement</b> are totally correct, that is, M(P) = M(Q). Our method consists in showing that the transformation of P into Q can be performed by: (i) adding extra arguments to predicates, thereby deriving from the given program P an annotated program P, (ii) applying a variant of the <b>clause</b> <b>replacement</b> rule and transforming the annotated program P into a terminating annotated program Q, and (iii) erasing the annotations from Q, thereby getting Q. Our method does not require that either P or Q are terminating and it is parametric with respect to the annotations. By providing different annotations we can easily prove the total correctness of program transformations based on various versions of the popular unfolding, folding, and goal replacement rules, which can all be viewed as particular cases of our <b>clause</b> <b>replacement</b> rule...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} much recent {{interest}} in the satisfiability of random Boolean formulas. A random k-SAT formula is the conjunction of m random clauses, {{each of which is}} the disjunction of k literals (a variable or its negation). It is known that when the number of variables n is large, there is a sharp transition from satisfiability to unsatisfiability; in the case of 2 -SAT this happens when m/n [...] > 1, for 3 -SAT the critical ratio is thought to be m/n 4. 2. The sharpness of this transition is characterized by a critical exponent, sometimes called ν=ν_k (the smaller the value of ν the sharper the transition). Experiments have suggested that ν_ 3 = 1. 5 +- 0. 1, ν_ 4 = 1. 25 +- 0. 05, ν_ 5 = 1. 1 +- 0. 05, ν_ 6 = 1. 05 +- 0. 05, and heuristics have suggested that ν_k [...] > 1 as k [...] > infinity. We give here a simple proof that each of these exponents is at least 2 (provided the exponent is well-defined). This result holds {{for each of the three}} standard ensembles of random k-SAT formulas: m clauses selected uniformly at random without <b>replacement,</b> m <b>clauses</b> selected uniformly at random with <b>replacement,</b> and each <b>clause</b> selected with probability p independent of the other clauses. We also obtain similar results for q-colorability and the appearance of a q-core in a random graph. Comment: 11 pages. v 2 has revised introduction and updated reference...|$|R

Purpose {{of this research is}} to know how construct news about retrogression public demand of Head Leader PSSI Nurdin Halid. This research applies research method of qualitative-interpretative based on discourse analytical method Theo Van Leeuwen to script news about backward demand to head leader PSSI NURDIN HALID broadcasted by radio Citra Malang with period broadcasts February-April 2008. This discourse analytical method consisted of process exclusion and inclusion. At process, exclusion there are some strategies that is first of passives that is strategy eliminates actor or subject by the way of changing active sentence become passive. Both nominalizations that are discourse strategy done by changing vb. (verbal) become noun (nominal). Generally is done by giving augmentation pe-an. Third, commutation of clause that {{is at the same time}} do duty off actor. At process inclusion there are some kinds of discourse strategies done that is, firstly, differences-indifferences that is strategy presenting an event or an social actor in text self-supporting, as an unique event and typically, but poison also is made contrast by presenting event or group or other actor in text. Second, objectives-abstracts that is element of discourse, is an event or social actor is present by giving concrete guide or presented is abstraction. Third, nomination-categorization that is strategy that with reference to choice, is the actor presented as it is or so-called is category from the social actor [...] Fourth, nomination-identification that is discourse strategy about how a group, event or certain action is defines. Fifth, determinacy-indeterminacy that is discourse strategy concerning whether actor or event of mentioned in explains or no (anonym). Sixth, assimilation-individualization that is discourse strategy relating to question is social actor reported on fetched out its category or no. Seventh, association-disassociation, that is discourse strategy relating to question, is actor, a party presented self, or it is attribute to other group larger ones. Result from this research indicates that script the news applies process exclusion and inclusion. Process exclusion applied is <b>replacement</b> strategy of <b>clause</b> that is adding clause to disappear actor or subject in news sentence. Other strategy that is passives and nominalization not founded in script. While processing inclusion or strategy to peep out actor or subject in news done by news writer by using some strategies, firstly, strategy is differentiation-indifferentiation that is presenting of actor Geoff Thompson Vice President FIFA to strengthen backward pressure for Head Leader PSSI NURDIN HALID. Second, that is strategy objectivities-abstract by mentioning sentence "outside party" to change word “government of respected state". Third, nomination-categorization strategy peeped out in this script by mentioning name of Nurdin Halid is being stumbling corruption problem. Fourth, strategy nomination-identification is done by adding sentence “now resides in Salemba" to give additional explanation to Nurdin Halid. Fifth, that is strategy determination-indetermination, done by mentioning word “staff its expert" to change actor who is giving information coming from Menpora. Sixth, change name Indonesia League Nugroho Swasto Manager PSIM Yogyakarta to.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{is an attempt to}} examine and {{describe}} the instances of code mixing of a bilingual child in monolingual speech contexts (Spanish / Colombia – English, USA). Code mixing is characterized by being a phenomenon typical of bilingualism in children. In this sense, this study provides a brief description of a bilingual child from three different perspectives: lexical, morphological, and syntactical. On one hand, the lexical perspective helps to determine the types of mixing (intersentential or interutterance, intrasentential or intrautterance) that the participant exhibits. The morphological perspective, on the other, considers the types of morphemes that undergo mixing in the participant‘s lexical repertory. Finally, the syntactic perspective analyzes the well-known constraint called functional head constraint (Belazi et al. 1994). The following research questions are addressed: (1) What type of words (verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc) in the speech of a bilingual child exhibit a greater index of code mixing? (2) Is there a correspondence between the pattern exhibited by the participant and the patterns exhibited by studies in the field in relation with the type of words or, on the contrary, the participant exhibits a totally differing pattern? (3) What types of code mixing does the participant exhibit? Is it at the level of phrases or utterances (intersentential or interutterance) or is it only within a phrase or utterance (intrasentential or intrautterance) ? (4) Does the participant exhibit any type of code mixing at the morpheme level? If so, what kinds of morphemes are involved? (5) Will the participant 2 ̆ 7 s mixed phrases violate or respect the functional head constraint? And (6) Will the participant find it necessary to perform code mixing in monolingual speech contexts? If so, what could be the reasons that trigger this process? Data collection for the present study included direct observation and note taking of speech samples in the Spanish context (Colombia) and audio recordings of the participant 2 ̆ 7 s daily speech in the English context (USA). The collected written notes and orthographic transcripts of both speech samples were analyzed. Results indicate that the participant exhibited no sign of code mixing in the monolingual speech context of English. As for the monolingual speech context in the Spanish language, the participant exhibited code mixing at the lexical level showing similar patterns to those of previous studies in which the predominant category was the nouns. He also exhibited loan blends mostly in the category of verbs. Once the syntactic analyses were carried out, the participant‘s speech showed that his code mixing constituted mostly lexical <b>replacements</b> and coordinated <b>clauses</b> with a coordinator Coordo. The absence of a functional head in one language and its complementizer in another language in the participant 2 ̆ 7 s speech implies that the participant respects the functional head constraint and questions the statement that children do not exhibit such restrictions at all. Finally, among the reasons that explain the code mixing present in the participant‘s speech there are: the input to which the participant was exposed in each language, the absence of a lexical entry in his repertory, the presence of his father (in the Spanish context), the presence of bilingual and monolingual composition strategies, and the individual characteristics of the participant. ^ This study acknowledges as its major caveat the disparity in the two methods of data collection used for each of the monolingual speech contexts. ...|$|R
