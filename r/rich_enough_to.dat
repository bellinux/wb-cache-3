Production of the old Model A cases stopped, but the older model continued to be available as the AB until October 1938.|$|E

25|$|Born {{and raised}} {{in the small town of}} Maldon, Essex and educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh, Brian was a shy and studious youth, living a {{relatively}} quiet life and spending a lot of time with his parents and siblings (older brother Jamie and fraternal twin Elizabeth). The family was an aristocratic one that was no longer <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fraternise with their former academic peers, leaving Brian (too proud to fraternise with lower classes) a lonely child who immersed himself in the study of physics.|$|E
25|$|When {{considering}} psycho-physical parallelism, superpositions appear <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> represent primitive conscious awareness. It {{seems that}} quantum superpositions {{have never been}} considered, for example, in neuronal models, since only classical states of deﬁnite neuronal excitation are usually taken into account. These quasi-classical states are also measured by external neurobiologists. Quantum theory would admit their superpositions, too, thus giving rise to a far greater variety of physical states which may be experienced by the subjective observer. When used for information processing, such superpositions would now be called “quantumbits” or qubits. As demonstrated by M. Tegmark, {{they can not be}} relevant for neuronal and similar processes in the brain.|$|E

BSAC was assured {{that there would}} be much traffic from its lead and zinc mines, but this did not {{materialise}} because technical mining problems. The railway could not meet the costs of the construction loans, and the company faced major financial problems, which were already serious because of the cost of widening the Beira railway. The only area likely to generate sufficient mineral traffic to relieve these debts was Katanga. Initially, the Congo Free State had concluded that Katanga's copper deposits were not <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> justify the capital cost of building a railway to the coast, but expeditions between 1899 and 1901 proved their value. Copper deposits found in Northern Rhodesia before the First World War proved uneconomic to develop.|$|E

25|$|The King's finance minister, Turgot, {{tried to}} reform the {{finances}} of the state, reducing state expenses and freeing the prices of grain from state control. Speculation on grain prices drove the price of bread up, leading to bread riots in Paris on 3 May 1775. After supporting Turgot, in 1776 the King dismissed him and refused to make any further major fiscal reforms. The King also lost much of his support within the army. In 1781, the minister of the Army, Ségur, decided that any candidate to be an army officer had to show four degrees of nobility, blocking any path of advancement for talented but non-noble officers. Even noble officers had to be <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> pay a large sum for their promotion. When the Revolution came, the non-noble and less-wealthy officers abandoned the King and joined the Revolutionaries. By August 1788, the government {{had run out of}} money, and gave soldiers and government workers and contractors notes promising to pay, rather than cash. Riots broke out, and customs posts all over Paris were attacked and burned. The King gave way and appointed the Swiss-born banker and reformist, Jacques Necker, as his new finance minister.|$|E
25|$|Rule 110, {{like the}} Game of Life, {{exhibits}} what Wolfram calls class 4 behavior, which is neither completely random nor completely repetitive. Localized structures appear and interact in various complicated-looking ways. In {{the course of}} the development of A New Kind of Science, as a research assistant to Wolfram in 1994, Matthew Cook proved that some of these structures were <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> support universality. This result is interesting because rule 110 is an extremely simple one-dimensional system, and difficult to engineer to perform specific behavior. This result therefore provides significant support for Wolfram's view that class 4 systems are inherently likely to be universal. Cook presented his proof at a Santa Fe Institute conference on Cellular Automata in 1998, but Wolfram blocked the proof from being included in the conference proceedings, as Wolfram did not want the proof announced before the publication of A New Kind of Science. In 2004, Cook's proof was finally published in Wolfram's journal Complex Systems (Vol. 15, No. 1), over ten years after Cook came up with it. Rule 110 has been the basis for some of the smallest universal Turing machines.|$|E

2500|$|Because Islam {{identified}} with the monotheistic religions of the conquered empires, the practice was adopted as an appropriate expression of Qur'anic ideals regarding modesty and piety. Veiling gradually spread to upper-class Arab women, and eventually it became widespread among Muslim women in cities throughout the Middle East. Veiling of Arab Muslim women became especially pervasive under Ottoman rule as a mark of rank and exclusive lifestyle, and Istanbul of the 17th century witnessed differentiated dress styles that reflected geographical and occupational identities. Women in rural areas were much slower to adopt veiling because the garments interfered with their work in the fields. Since wearing a veil was impractical for working women, [...] "a veiled woman silently announced {{that her husband was}} <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep her idle." ...|$|E
