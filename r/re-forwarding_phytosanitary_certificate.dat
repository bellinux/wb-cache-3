30|$|Logistic and taxonomic {{support for}} this joint study between Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (Kew) and Illinois College was {{facilitated}} by Kew Madagascar Conservation Centre (KMCC) and Parc Botanique et Zoologique de Tsimbazaza (PBZT). During the 5 -year project, more than 40 taxa spanning 24 genera were selected for study involving collection and movement of live material (roots, seeds) from Madagascar to labs in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA). Root samples were shared between the two partners to ensure that live material could be processed {{in a timely manner}} leading to the isolation of Rhizoctonia-like fungi from root pelotons. To facilitate the legal collection and international transport of orchid material from Madagascar to the UK (Kew) and USA (Illinois), a CITES permit was obtained which allowed three tubes, each containing seedlings and mature roots per species, to be collected. The rarity of plants in the wild necessitated further restrictions, namely that collections be limited to three each of juvenile and mature plants. Depending on the species and its availability, 1 – 5 roots per specimen were collected. These were accompanied by a <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificate</b> which was secured prior to departure from Madagascar. The CITES permit and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificate</b> were delivered by the Direction Generale des Forets (DGF Nanisana Antananarivo) and Service de la Quarantaine et de I’Inspection Nanisana, respectively. For import of root samples into the USA, an additional permit (PPQ 526) was obtained from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), as the US Government regards all orchid endophytes in the Rhizoctonia complex to be plant pathogens. Samples entering the UK were accompanied by a <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>Certificate</b> issued in Madagascar, and a UK Letter of Authority.|$|R
40|$|Intensive import/export {{quarantine}} {{operations were}} commenced in 1948 by the Forest Service with costs being {{met by the}} taxpayers. The first Regulations came in 1956 and contained a simple schedule of fees. These were extended in 1966 but still covered only sawn timber, box snooks, and timber in round form. In 1986 the Government decided that, under its "user-pays " policy, net funding for forestry services (including quarantine) would be reduced to zero over 5 years. New fee schedules were introduced in 1987 by the Ministry of Forestry. There was client resistance to paying for regulatory quarantine inspections. Some "national good " content was recognised by the Government. The impact of user-pays may initially have had some detrimental effect on import inspection effectiveness. Some countries do not need <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificates</b> for exports. Inspections ceased for these destinations and exporter costs were consequently reduced. At entry ports in Japan and Korea fumigation or some other form of sterilisation is automatically carried out. On the other hand, forest produce exported to Australia must meet very precise quarantine inspection standards, and some other countries demand a <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificate</b> based on the International Plant Protection Convention format. The introduction of user-pays also had an initial impact on forest health surveys. The Government may reorganise border control services...|$|R

(In the 1970s Wu {{had offered}} the U.S. fifty of his penjing on the {{condition}} that the usual importation procedure of bare-rooting and fumigation be forgone, as this would have been fatal to these very old trees. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture refused to make an exception to its rule, although the Bicentennial trees from Japan had been excepted earlier. The Japanese trees harbored twenty-three identifiable pests.

50|$|Turkey {{is by far}} {{the main}} trading partner of Northern Cyprus, {{supplying}} 55% of imports and absorbing 48% of exports. In a landmark case, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on 5 July 1994 against the British practice of importing produce from Northern Cyprus based on certificates of origin and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificates</b> granted by the de facto authorities. The ECJ decided that only goods bearing certificates of origin from the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus could be imported by EU member states. The decision resulted in a considerable decrease of Turkish Cypriot exports to the EU: from $36.4 million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot exports) in 1993 to $24.7 million in 1996 (or 35% of total exports) in 1996. Even so, the EU continues to be the second-largest trading partner of Northern Cyprus, with a 24.7% share of total imports and 35% share of total exports.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of Thousand Cankers Disease (TCD) {{in the eastern}} region significantly increases the risk to black walnut (Juglans nigra) trees in Illinois. Black walnut is a highly valued tree, both economically and environmentally; it is also highly susceptible to TCD. If found in Illinois, this disease would threaten native black walnut stands as well as negatively impact black walnut timber, nuts, and nursery production. In response to this threat, on February 1, 2012, the Governor of the State of Illinois issued a proclamation which established a regulatory framework to protect the walnut resource of the state. The proclamation restricts the movement of certain regulated articles into or through Illinois and establishes a process by which individuals and businesses can continue to move those articles without endangering the state’s walnut resource. The basis of the regulatory framework is a compliance agreement administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture. Individuals and businesses wishing to move regulated materials into or through Illinois originating in a Thousand Cankers Disease infested area must first enter into a compliance agreement with the Department and the regulated article {{must be accompanied by}} a <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificate</b> from the originating state verifying the material complies with the conditions of the compliance agreement.

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{assessed}} {{the risk to}} plant health of Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), Strawberry latent ringspot virus (SLRSV), Raspberry ringspot virus (RpRSV) and Tomato black ring virus (TBRV) for the European Union (EU) territory, and evaluated the current EU legislation and possible risk reduction options. These viruses are largely restricted to Europe and their vector nematodes and at-risk hosts occur widely in Europe. Plants for planting were identified as the most significant entry pathway and the probability of entry is rated as unlikely to moderately likely for ArMV and as very unlikely to unlikely for RpRSV, SLRSV and TBRV. These ratings have moderate uncertainty. The probability of establishment is rated very likely with low uncertainty. The probability of local spread by natural means is likely, with low to medium uncertainty, whereas that of human-assisted long-distance spread is unlikely to moderately likely, with high uncertainty. Potential impact is rated minimal to minor in all hosts, {{with the exception of}} ArMV in grapevine, for which it is minor to moderate. These ratings have medium or high uncertainty. The current legislation addresses only two of the many host species of these viruses, but other weaknesses were also identified. If the current legislation were removed, no major consequences would be expected unless the industry simultaneously ceased its voluntary certification activity. Prohibition and the use of <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificates,</b> if covering the complete host ranges of the viruses and relying on appropriate tests, are the options with highest effectiveness against the risk of introduction whereas certification schemes and pest-free areas or production sites are those with the highest effectiveness against the spread and impact risks. All options have limitations in feasibility, with uncertainty ratings from moderate to high. The combination of partially effective options may be highly effective in some crop...|$|R

It provides for the establishment of national plant protection services and the issuance of <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificates.</b> IPPC also sets requirements for imports and international cooperation and provides a system for settlement of disputes. Under the IPPC governments agree to cooperate in establishing Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RRPOs), to function as coordinating bodies for the conformation of legislation and its enforcement, inspection and treatment techniques and standards and certification. RPPOs exist in Asia; Africa; North, Central and South America; the Caribbean; Europe and the South Pacific. Some 100 countries are signatories to the IPPC leaving some 60 or more yet to sign the Convention. The IPPC has been given additional technical responsibility for developing recommendations, guidelines and standards for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the members of which recognize that unjustified quarantine restrictions could be used as non-tariff barriers to trade. IPPC's response has been to seek agreement of the principles of quarantine and pest risk analysis, together with other aspects listed above. 'Transparency' ensuring that import restrictions are clearly 'visible' to trading partners and that the mechanism for determining restrictions is Pest Risk Analysis 7 is a major concern.
