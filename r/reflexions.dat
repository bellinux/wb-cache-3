Paul I also {{guaranteed}} Louis's {{safety and}} bestowed upon him a generous pension, however, the tsar later disregarded this allowance. Marie-Thérèse finally joined Louis XVIII at Jelgava in 1799. In the winter of 1798–1799, Louis XVIII wrote a biography of Marie Antoinette titled <b>Réflexions</b> Historiques sur Marie Antoinette. He attempted to recreate the court life of Versailles at Jelgava, where many old courtiers lived, re-establishing all the court ceremonies, including the lever and coucher (ceremonies that accompanied waking and bedding, respectively).|$|E

5000|$|In s-space each <b>reflexion</b> {{is found}} on its Polanyi-sphere. Intrinsically the ideal <b>reflexion</b> {{is a point}} in s-space, but fiber {{symmetry}} turns it into a ring smeared out by rotation about the fiber direction. Two rings represent each <b>reflexion</b> on the Polanyi sphere, because scattering is point symmetric {{with respect to the}} origin of s-space. Mapped onto the detector are only those points of the <b>reflexion</b> in s-space that are both on the Ewald sphere and on the Polanyi sphere. These points form the <b>reflexion</b> circle (blue ring). It does not change as the fiber is tilted. As with a slide projector the <b>reflexion</b> circle is projected (red moving rays) on the detector (detector circle, blue ring). There up to 4 images (red spots) of the monitored <b>reflexion</b> can show up. The position of the <b>reflexion</b> images {{is a function of the}} orientation of the fiber in the primary beam (Polanyi equation). Inverted, from the positions of the <b>reflexion</b> images the orientation of the fiber can be determined, if for the Miller index [...] both [...] and [...] is valid. From the Polanyi representation of fiber diffraction geometry the relations of the fiber mapping are established by elementary and spherical geometry.|$|R

25|$|A further {{step was}} the 1770 paper <b>Réflexions</b> sur la résolution algébrique des équations by the French-Italian {{mathematician}} Joseph Louis Lagrange, in his method of Lagrange resolvents, where he analyzed Cardano and Ferrarri's solution of cubics and quartics by considering {{them in terms}} of permutations of the roots, which yielded an auxiliary polynomial of lower degree, providing a unified understanding of the solutions and laying the groundwork for group theory and Galois theory. Crucially, however, he did not consider composition of permutations. Lagrange's method did not extend to quintic equations or higher, because the resolvent had higher degree.|$|E
25|$|He {{wrote his}} <b>Reflexions</b> upon Exile, and in 1717, {{his letter to}} Sir William Wyndham in {{explanation}} of his position, generally considered one of his finest compositions, but not published till 1753 after his death.

He bought and resided at the estate of La Source near Orléans, studied philosophy, criticized the chronology of the Bible, and was visited amongst others by Voltaire, who expressed unbounded admiration for his learning and politeness.|$|E
25|$|The Pharmacopeé of Lyons, {{published}} in 1786, says that cedar tree oil can induce vomiting, and suggests it helps medicate tumors and ulcers.

Tar water had been used as a folk remedy since the Middle Ages to treat affections like dyspepsia. Bishop Berkeley wrote several works on the medical virtues of tar water, including a philosophical work in 1744 titled Siris: a chain of philosophical <b>reflexions</b> and inquiries concerning the virtues of tar water, and divers other subjects connected together and arising one from another, and a poem where he praised its virtues. Pyroligneous acid was also used at the time in a medicinal water called Aqua Binelli.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginning}} of the proposed radical changes began with the Protests of the Parlement of Paris addressed to Louis XVI in March 1776, in which the Second Estate, the nobility, resisted the {{beginning of}} certain reforms that would remove their privileges, notably their exemption from taxes. The objections made to the Parlement of Paris were {{in reaction to the}} essay, <b>Réflexions</b> sur la formation et la distribution des richesses ("Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth") by Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot. The Second Estate reacted to the essay with anger to convince the king that the nobility still served a very important role and still deserved the same privileges of tax exemption {{as well as for the}} preservation of the guilds and corporations put in place to restrict trade, both of which were eliminated in the reforms proposed by Turgot.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he never}} {{composed}} an opera, Bois’s output includes two extended music-theatre works: the ballet Midas (1970), and Vandaag is het morgen van gisteren: (helaas geen sprookje) (1975), an hour-long extravaganza for soloists, children’s choir, orchestra and brass band. Bois's other larger-scale works include a Chamber Symphony for 13 winds, a Violin Concerto, a Concerto for Two Violins, and two Piano Concertos. The greatest {{part of his}} compositional output, however, consists of chamber music {{for a wide variety}} of ensembles, including four string quartets, two wind quintets, and a concerted work for solo double bass with double wind quintet. The two wind quintets (Chants en contrepoints from 1962 and <b>Réflexions</b> sur le jour où Pérotin le Grand ressuscitera from 1969) were both written for the Danzi Quintet, and Bois also wrote solo pieces for some of the members of this well-known ensemble: flutist Frans Vester (Muziek for solo flute, 1961), oboist Koen van Slogteren (Beams, for oboe and piano, 1979), and clarinetist Piet Honingh (Vertiges, 1987).|$|E
25|$|François Viète's work on new algebra at {{the close}} of the 16th century was an {{important}} step towards modern algebra. In 1637, René Descartes published La Géométrie, inventing analytic geometry and introducing modern algebraic notation. Another key event in the further development of algebra was the general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the mid-16th century. The idea of a determinant was developed by Japanese mathematician Seki Kōwa in the 17th century, followed independently by Gottfried Leibniz ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using matrices. Gabriel Cramer also did some work on matrices and determinants in the 18th century. Permutations were studied by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in his 1770 paper <b>Réflexions</b> sur la résolution algébrique des équations devoted to solutions of algebraic equations, in which he introduced Lagrange resolvents. Paolo Ruffini was the first person to develop the theory of permutation groups, and like his predecessors, also in the context of solving algebraic equations.|$|E

30|$|<b>Reflexion</b> models compare two models, low {{abstraction}} level model (i.e., source code) and {{a higher}} abstract level model (i.e., conceptual and architectural elements) of the system [11]. The models require a mapping task between the two models to compare them. When we compare both models, the <b>reflexion</b> model is created in which three types of relations between the models are revealed: convergence, divergence, and absence. The main disadvantage of <b>reflexion</b> models {{is the lack of}} reusability [19]. By contrast, when we designed DCL 2.0, reuse {{was one of the main}} concerns for the language.|$|R

And if the Ray at the point of <b>Reflexion</b> was in a Fit of easy <b>Reflexion,</b> the progression of the distances of these Fits from that point must begin from 0, and so be of the Numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, &c. And therefore the progression of the distances of the intermediate Fits of easy Transmission, reckon'd from the same point, must be in the progression of the odd Numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. contrary to what happens when the Fits are propagated from points of Refraction.|$|R
