5|$|Researchers {{discovered}} that where the P. rebeli {{lay their eggs}} {{is based on the}} size of the G. cruciata leaves and not upon the location of the closest Myrmica ant colony. Evidence for P. rebeli oviposition depending upon the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> food plant rather than the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ants is supported by the timing of its oviposition. P. rebeli lays their eggs during the warm summer season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground. Researchers also observed females did not base their oviposition on where they found Myrmica nests.|$|E
