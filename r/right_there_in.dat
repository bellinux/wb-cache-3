As {{a way to}} keep down production costs, a bulk of the filming took place around the greater New Orleans area– mostly south of the Red River country in the north of the state, where the historic Northup was enslaved. Among locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Bocage, Destrehan, and Magnolia. Magnolia, a plantation in Schriever, Louisiana, is {{just a few miles from}} one of the historic sites where Northup was held.

500|$|The duo {{met again}} in May 1992 at Oceanway Studios in Los Angeles to {{complete}} the orchestration of the song. Lubbock's arrangement was chosen for adding the final touches and the recording started. However, Madonna and Pettibone {{did not like the}} orchestra parts and wanted to redo the whole composition. The producer recalled, [...] "Madonna and I had to change the whole arrangement, <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the studio, with a full orchestra sitting there getting paid for taking up space—around $15,000 for three hours, $3000 for every half-hour over that. And of course, Lubbock was talking to two people who didn't know a C from a B natural. The pressure was on". So they stood near Pettibone's Mac and sang the notes, with Lubbock correcting them. The total recording was finished off in 2 hours and 58 minutes, thereby saving to pay the orchestra the extra fees. The last recording of the song was on Memorial Day where Madonna re-did the lead vocals and improved them. Together they did some final edits of the track and finished it.|$|E

Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter.

500|$|The {{music video}} was shot on April 10 and April 11, 2010 at Sony Studios in Culver City, California. Over twenty female and twenty male backup dancers were used. The video casts Cyrus as an exotic {{songbird}} {{breaking out of}} its cage, symbolizing Cyrus as a singer breaking out of her good-girl image. Prior to the shoot, Cyrus meticulously recorded her ideas for the video on paper. For example, she chose her back-up dancers make-up pallets and contemplated their outfits; while {{she did not want}} her dancer's bodies [...] "to look like normal bodies", she also did not want for them to wear scales as, according to her, it would make them resemble to be fish and look scary. Hales wanted Cyrus to resemble a bird without [...] "actually having a beak" [...] or otherwise being overly explicit, so Cyrus' stylists invented bird-like accessories. Among these were arm bands with long leather straps, feathered shoulder pads, and a feathered vest worn over a black leotard and thigh-high black leather boots. Cyrus said she had originally worn a [...] "completely different" [...] outfit, but wasn't [...] "feeling it" [...] the morning of the shoot. [...] "So we made this one <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the morning, and we added pieces throughout the day... more leather and more feathers.

Cyrus' make-up artist, Denika Bedrossian, focused on the singer's eyes; he used [...] "rich jewel-toned shades" [...] and eyelashes with feathered tips to give Cyrus a [...] "deep peacock eye". In cut-scenes, Cyrus wears a corset made of 2,400 silver metal pieces and numerous peacock feathers. It was designed by The Blonds, debuted during their fall 2010 fashion show, and cost $25,000.|$|E
