Lady Dedlock is implicated, but Inspector Bucket reveals that her former maid Hortense is the murderess and had tried to frame Lady Dedlock. Richard and Ada are secretly married, but he is obsessed with the lawsuit, encouraged by John's unscrupulous friend Harold Skimpole and the conniving lawyer Vholes. As a result, Richard is penniless and his health is failing. Hawdon's letters — written by a young Lady Dedlock and revealing her secret — find their {{way back into the}} hands of the moneylender Smallweed, who sells them to Sir Leicester. Guilty over her deception and not wanting to bring ruin to her husband, Lady Dedlock flees into a storm before Sir Leicester is able to tell her he does not care about her past. He has a massive heart attack but sends Bucket after her. Bucket eventually realizes where she must be — the graveyard where Hawdon is buried — but Esther arrives to find her mother dead from exposure.

500|$|... "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" [...] is {{a sarcastic}} satire on materialism, fashion and faddism. Done in Chicago-blues style, the song derives its melody {{and part of}} its lyrics from Lightnin' Hopkins's [...] "Automobile (Blues)". Paul Williams writes that its misogynistic {{attitude}} is [...] "moderated slightly when one realizes that jealous pique is the underlying emotion". In the lyrics, the narrator observes his former lover in various situations wearing her [...] "brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat", at one point finding his doctor with her and later spying her making love with a new boyfriend because she [...] "forgot to close the garage door". In the closing lines, the narrator says he knows what her boyfriend <b>really</b> <b>loves</b> her for—her hat.|$|E

500|$|Rick, {{according}} to Rudy Behlmer, is [...] "not a hero... {{not a bad}} guy": he does {{what is necessary to}} get along with the authorities and [...] "sticks his neck out for nobody". The other characters, in Behlmer's words, are [...] "not cut and dried" [...] and come into their goodness {{over the course of the}} film. Renault begins as a collaborator with the Nazis who extorts sexual favors from refugees and has Ugarte killed. Even Ilsa, the least active of the main characters, is [...] "caught in the emotional struggle" [...] over which man she <b>really</b> <b>loves.</b> By the end, however, [...] "everybody is sacrificing." [...] Behlmer also emphasized the variety in the picture: [...] "it's a blend of drama, melodrama, comedy [...] intrigue".|$|E
500|$|Swedish {{columnist}} Lars Lindstrom commented positively about PewDiePie, stating, [...] "that Felix Kjellberg has a comic {{talent is}} indisputable. It is both amazingly awful and amazingly funny when a father bikes {{around with his}} son in the game Happy Wheels and both get crushed and bloody {{again and again and}} PewDiePie improvises absurd comments as the game continues. The secret is that he <b>really</b> <b>loves</b> to play these games and that he has fun doing it." [...] PewDiePie has also been received negatively by the media on some occasions, often being reported as an [...] "inexplicable phenomenon." [...] Andrew Wallenstein of Variety heavily criticised PewDiePie, following his channel becoming the most subscribed channel on YouTube, describing his videos as [...] "aggressive stupidity" [...] and [...] "psycho babble." ...|$|E

[...] Gilsig commented that viewers had been wondering why Will was taking so long to discover Terri was not actually pregnant: [...] "I think people have been asking 'How slow is this guy?!'. But [...] Will finally reflects {{that he is a}} fully evolved human being and puts two and two together."

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Stan herself, Șerban Cazan, LeAnna James, and Naz Tokio; the {{production}} was made by Cazan. It was composed during FonoCamp 2013, the first international songwriting camp in Romania which was organized by both Fonogram and HaHaHa Studios and held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. The track was mixed for HaHaHa Production and recorded at Fonogram Studios and HaHaHa Studios. In an interview in Barcelona, Spain, Stan described the song as [...] "more oriental, {{with a lot of}} spiritual meaning". She continued to explain that [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] was written as a present for her Arabic and Asian fans due to the song's vibe. According to Pop Shock, the track is a Caucasian-flavoured mid-tempo ballad. Lyrically, Stan tells her unidentified boyfriend not to be so hard on her, and if he <b>really</b> <b>loves</b> her, he needs to give her his everything. The chorus of [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] consists solely of the phrase [...] "Don't you be so hard on me / If you love me, come and give me your everything".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the football references, the episode parodies the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Homer tells Moe, who keeps his wallet in his shoe, [...] "I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory," [...] a play on {{a line from the}} film. In a commercial for his new television show, celebrity Troy McClure says that he plays [...] "Jack Handle, a retired cop who shares an apartment with a retired criminal. We're the original Odd Couple!", referencing the television show The Odd Couple. With his gambling winnings Homer buys Marge a bottle of perfume by Meryl Streep. The perfume is called Versatility and the bottle is shaped like an Academy Award. The Globe and Mails Liam Lacey commented on the similarities between the 2009 film Imagine That and this episode in a review of the film. He said the [...] "message in each case is about the dangerous confusion of love and money. Naturally there's a turning point [...] where the child begins to wonder whether her father <b>really</b> <b>loves</b> her or just her profitable talent." ...|$|E

500|$|After Riley {{proposed}} to Mercedes, Crawford commented {{that she does}} not [...] "believe she <b>really</b> <b>loves</b> him. We still think this was all about winning for her". Crawford added that she is [...] "really hoping Mercedes is found out soon before Riley says his vows. Little Bobby needs a stable mother, not mental Mercy". Stephen of the Daily Mail later questioned whether Mercedes will [...] "bag Riley before she gets her bus pass at 60?" [...] She added that Mercedes accusation that Mitzeee has kidnapped Bobby [...] "is relative small fry" [...] in comparison to her other recent misdemeanours. Morgan of All About Soap said that [...] "the end of tonight’s episode was the moment fans had been patiently waited for – evil Mercedes was being carted off down the cop shop". She added that Riley [...] "come perilously close to pushing Mercedes over that rooftop, but that wouldn’t have been a bad thing, right?" [...] Following Mercedes' trial, Crawford opined that she could not [...] "quite believe she managed it, but she was cleared of all charges – will the mixed-up McQueen ever get her comeuppance? We’ll give Mercy her dues: she gave an outstanding performance in court – even we were left wondering if Riley had actually abused her – so a non-the-wiser jury had no chance against the wily woman". She added that [...] "someone needs to stand up to merciless Mercy". Stephen felt that Myra deciding whether to give Mercedes another chance would be difficult as she would have to [...] "manage {{to keep up with the}} many personalities the show has given the girl?

500|$|The next day, {{the family}} convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. [...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him {{she has been}} alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had {{forgotten}} {{what it felt like}} to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it.
