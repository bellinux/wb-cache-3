40|$|Aims {{to compare}} the energy {{embodied}} in office buildings varying in height from a few storeys to over 50 storeys. The energy embodied in substructure, superstructure and finishes elements was investigated for five Melbourne office buildings of the following heights: 3, 7, 15, 42 and 52 storeys. The two high-rise buildings have approximately 60 percent more energy embodied per unit gross floor area (GFA) in their materials than the low-rise buildings. While building height was found to dictate {{the amount of energy}} embodied in the “structure group” elements (upper floors, columns, internal walls, external walls and staircases), other elements such as <b>substructure,</b> <b>roof,</b> windows and finishes seemed uninfluenced. <br /...|$|R

50|$|Between 1913 and 1916, {{the station}} was raised above ground level and {{expanded}} to three platforms with six platform tracks. In addition, there were five freight tracks. An entrance building with articulated pilasters and a decorated entrance with a gable containing a clock was built on its northwest side to the plans of Karl Cornelius in collaboration with Alfred Lücking. It was rebuilt after the Second World War to a simplified design without steep roofs. It connects with a pedestrian tunnel, which is illuminated with skylights. On its south side it has a stately neoclassical portal, which is topped by a tympanum and flanked by two fluted pilasters. On the platforms, there were wooden, inward sloping <b>roofs</b> on steel <b>substructures,</b> which are now only retained on the S-Bahn platform. West of the station a road underpass was built between Königsberger Straße and Oberhofer Weg, along with a compact, four storey-high signal box built of reinforced concrete covered with clinker bricks. The station with it pedestrian underpass and the signal box are heritage-listed as national monuments.|$|R
5000|$|The Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge {{was first}} built by Otto Puls, {{originally}} located over Wacoochee Creek {{on what is}} now Shotwell Road (CR 252) {{just north of the}} community of Salem (Coordinates [...] (32.609747, -85.208425)). This was about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of its current location. At that time, the bridge was 76 feet (23 m) in length...constructed using longleaf heart pine, cedar roof shakes and hand-hewn white oak pegs which joined the latticework, <b>roof</b> trusses and <b>substructure.</b> The bridge shortened the travel time between the communities of Salem and Shotwell. Occasional repairs were made over the years, along with a restoration of the bridge by the Lee County Commission in 1973, but high water and erosion from various storms had once again taken a toll on the bridge supports. Eventually, the Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge was closed to motor traffic in 1994 and left to survive the elements.In {{the early morning hours of}} June 4, 2005, a severe thunderstorm passed through the Lee County area. High winds caused a tree to fall on the Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge, causing major damage. The added weight collapsed the bridge into Wacoochee Creek later that day. Being the only historic covered bridge remaining in southeastern Alabama, the loss was heartbreaking. Most of the pieces were able to be recovered over the next few weeks and were stored at a vacant commercial building in Opelika until plans could be made regarding the future of the bridge.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the current thesis is the {{investigation}} of the seismic behavior of complex structures of soccer stadium in the city of Adana, Turkey. The main structural parts of the building of the stadium are reinforced concrete tribunes, steel façade and cable-stayed roof, resting on the structures of the façade. The behavior of the coupled model in case of seismic excitation is studied. The coupled model is defined as a structural model that contains together all main structural parts: the tribunes, the façade and the roof. In the engineering practice, a large-span <b>roof</b> and supporting <b>substructures</b> (façade, tribunes) are differentiated and analyzed separately. In case when the seismic analysis has to be done, the separated analysis has to be performed with caution and possible amplification effect of the seismic action for the structural model with all main structural blocks introduced has to be taken into account. The amplification effect is defined as the increase of the displacements, total base shear and internal forces in the structural elements. To investigate the extent of the amplification effect, the results obtained from the analysis of coupled and uncoupled models were compared. The results obtained from the modal spectral response analysis and nonlinear dynamic analysis of different structural models show a significant amplification of the displacements of the roof structure and façade bearing columns for a coupled model, with the subsequent increase of the total base shear transferred to the <b>substructures</b> form the <b>roof</b> and internal forces in the elements. Methods of improving the structural behavior for the seismic excitation have been investigated. In particular, the effect of installation of seismic isolators for the roof structures has been studied. For the structural models with the isolated roof, the results of the analysis of both coupled and uncoupled models have been improved and all design requirements have been verified...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} May 2012, a seismic {{sequence}} {{struck the}} Emilia region in northern Italy, with two main events of local magnitude ML 5. 9 and 5. 8. Emilia has been classified as a seismic area only recently. Consequently {{almost all of the}} precast buildings that have been erected in the past decade haven't been designed with provisions for seismic resilience. Surveys after the earthquake allowed the identification of the damage types and their location: column base, column top, on shed beam, on roof element, on cladding/ infill panels. The scenario confirmed structural damages surveyed after the earthquake in L'Aquila (Menegotto, 2009), (Colombo, 2012). Particularly, it has been pointed out that the weakest elements in precast buidings are connections. Indeed, in precast structures, unlike traditional RC buildings, the design and construction of efficient connections is still a open issue. The connections of cast-in-situ structures present a higher degree of continuity between adjacent elements, also due to passing reinforcing bars. In case of seismic events, joints represent a source of energy dissipation and allow for a redistribution of internal forces (if properly designed). These characteristics lack in many precast buildings, especially in those with industrial applications, which are usually characterized by beams/roof elements simply supported by columns. In such structures, seismic improvement can’t be performed through the introduction of rigid connections, which would increase the stiffness of the structure (which is initially flexible) and lead to unpredictable and sometime negative results such as an increase of the base shear. Moreover, it is not simple to design connections strong enough to resist to stresses induced by earthquakes. Passive control techniques use devices that don’t need energy to work, thus they are very reliable because they won’t malfunction if a black-out occurs. They seem a promising solution for seismic improvement of precast existing buildings. A possible intervention is the introduction of dissipative connections, which would lead to an increase of the behavior factor through energy dissipation. Dissipative connections can be located between different structural/non-structural elements: between roof elements and edge beams, between pillars and edge beams, or between infill panels. This work is focused on the introduction of dissipative connections between roof elements and the substructure. In particular, the objective is finding an algorithm to define the yielding force of connections in function of the maximum relative displacement allowed between <b>roof</b> elements and <b>substructure.</b> The complex phenomenon, which involves plasticity and the dynamic response of the system, is described through simple equations {{in order to have a}} powerful but simple instrument for design. The proposed algorithm allows to define the yielding force of roof connections in function of the elastic and inertial features of the examined system, with no need of non-linear dynamic analysis which are difficult to perform and usually lead to ambiguous results...|$|R
