40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of a uniform version of interpolation are hindered by its absence from many expressive logics. This motivates a thorough investigation of appropriate expansions of known entailments so that an easy-to-derive, uniform presentation of the interpolants is supported. This paper presents the skeleton of a general construction and indicates that a potentially large class of entailments can be extended so that a uniform presentation of the interpolants is available. 1 Introduction There is a well established relation between interpolation [8] and modularity properties of refinements [23, 24, 29, 5, 32, 40, 39, 12, 11] and databases [25]. On the other hand, many logics {{that have been used}} in refinement or databases lack the desirable interpolation properties. To compensate for this inadequacy, several groups of <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> proposed techniques to restrict these logics to fragments that have the desirable modularity properties.

40|$|Noncontingent {{reinforcement}} (NCR) de-scribes {{an arrangement}} {{in which a}} reinforcer is delivered on a time-based schedule, typically a fixed-time (FT) or a variable-time (VT) schedule. In recent years, numerous <b>researchers</b> <b>have</b> de-scribed the use of NCR as an intervention {{for the treatment of}} behavior problems (e. g., Hagopian, Fisher, & Legacy, 1994; Vollmer, Iwata, Zarcone, Smith, & Mazaleski, 1993). Typically, the use of NCR in this context involves conducting a func-tional assessment to identify the consequences that reinforce the problem behavior, initially arranging a dense FT or VT schedule of rein-forcement to suppress the behavior, then thinning the FT or VT schedule to make the intervention more practical while, hopefully, maintaining the suppressive effects on the target behavior. Oth-ers have used the term NCR to describe circum-stances in which a preferred stimulus that was unrelated to the hypothesized behavioral function was delivered on a time-based schedule (e. g., Fisher, O’Connor, Kurtz, DeLeon, & Gotjen, 2000; Fischer, Iwata, & Mazaleski, 1997) and have also found this procedure effective in reducing problem behavior.

I begin by reviewing the allocation of public resources to environ-mental protection associated with agriculture.

Asthma and other {{wheezing}} disorders {{are the most}} common chronic health problems in childhood and place a large burden on children, their families and society. 1 Prevalence is highest in infancy or early childhood and the aetiology is complex, with a strong influence of intrauterine and early life exposures. Clinical presentation, response to treatment and prognosis differ by age and the natural history is highly variable. It has been questioned whether asthma, especially in young children, should be regarded as one disease with a single underlying aetiology but a wide range of severity, 2 or as a syndrome comprising several separate conditions. 3, 4 Furthermore, respira-tory illness in early life is associated with adult respiratory disease and diminished lung function. 5, 6 Despite this, most epidemiological studies of asthma before the 1990 s <b>had</b> <b>focuse...</b>|$|R

40|$|Object {{types are}} {{abstract}} specifications of object behaviors; object behaviors are abstractly indicated by object component interdependencies; and program verifications {{are based on}} object behaviors. In conventional object type systems, object component interdependencies are not taken into account. As a result, distinct behaviors of objects are confused in conventional object type systems, {{which can lead to}} fundamental typing/subtyping loopholes and program verification troubles. In this paper, we first identify a program verification problem which is caused by the loose conventional object typing/subtyping which is in turn caused by the overlooking of object component interdependencies. Then, as a new object typing scheme, we introduce object type graphs (OTG) in which object component interdependencies are integrated into object types. Finally, we show how the problem existing in conventional object type systems can be easily resolved under OTG. 1 Introduction and Related Work Although much of the recent year’s work on object-oriented programming (OOP) <b>has</b> <b>focuse...</b>|$|R
40|$|Albinism, oculocutaneous: An {{hereditary}} disorder characterised by {{deficiency of}} the pigment melanin in the eyes, skin and hair.

Yet it falls far short of explaining the physical, psychological and social consequences of living with the condition, failing to express {{the ways in which}} albinism is often misinterpreted and the fact that its ætiology is often ignored. What is best known about the disorder, as the citation from Webster’s confirms, is that oculocutaneous albinism manifests itself in the whiteness of albino skin, making it a condition that is loaded with symbolism and meaning in terms of racial difference. Indeed, the small amount of critical attention to the albino body that exists <b>has</b> <b>focuse...</b>|$|R

The AWACS WD team serves as a vital airborne C 2 node, providing airborne surveillance and command, control, and communications functions for tactical and air defense forces. They detect, identify, track, and intercept airborne threats. Our investigations seek to identify tools and techniques to facilitate performance in this complex and dynamic domain. In this paper, we describe progress toward an agent-based decision support system, the AWACS WD Intelligent Agent Assistant (IAA). The WD-IAA will facilitate decision making for decision events which are both typical and time consuming.

In this paper we assess {{the possibility that the}} bursts may be bremsstrahlung produced by relativistic (> 1 MeV) runaway electron beams accelerated in an avalanche process by quasi-electrostatic thundercloud ¯elds. We consider the height-dependent density pro¯le of the relativistic electrons speci¯ed as a function of time {{in the context of a}} previously reported runaway model [Bell et al., 1995]. The electron beam is modeled as a vertical cylinder with radius 10 km, and numerical estimates are provided of °-ray °uxes which would be observed at the satellite. The predicted °uxes at the satellite altitude and at horizontal distances of up to 500 km from the source are found to be comparable to the experimental data. 2 Introduction Recent e®orts to understand the luminosity pro-duced by lightning in the mesosphere <b>have</b> <b>focuse...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{simplest}} type of dune is the transverse one, which propagates with invariant profile orthogonally to a fixed wind direction. Here we show numerically {{and with}} a linear stability analysis that transverse dunes are unstable with respect to along-axis perturbations in their profile and decay on the bedrock into barchan dunes. Any forcing modulation amplifies exponentially with growth rate determined by the dune turnover time. We estimate the distance covered by a transverse dune before fully decaying into barchans and identify the patterns produced by different types of perturbation. PACS numbers: 45. 70. -n, 45. 70. Qj, 05. 65. +b, 45. 70. Mg Wind directionality and sand availability are the main factors dictating dune morphology. Bimodal and multidirectional wind systems form longitudinal and star dunes, respectively[1]. Underunimodalwinds, twotypes of dune may occur, depending {{on the amount of}} sand: crescent-shaped barchans, evolving on the bedrock, and transverse dunes, which appear when the ground is covered with sand [1 – 3].
