The <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} an {{acoustic}} direction-ofarrival (DOA) tracking system to track multiple maneuvering targets using a state space approach. The system {{consists of three}} blocks: beamformer, <b>random</b> <b>sampling,</b> and particle filter. The beamformer block processes the received acoustic data to output bearing batches as point statistics. The <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> block determines temporal clustering of the bearings in a batch to determine region-of-interests (ROIs). Based on the track-before-detect approach, each ROI indicates {{the presence of a}} possible target. We describe three <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> algorithms called RANSAC, MSAC, and NAPSAC to use in the <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> block. The particle filter then tracks the targets via its interactions with the beamformer and the <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> blocks.

40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>sampling</b> is a {{technique}} for signal acquisition which is gaining popularity in practical signal processing systems. Nowadays, event-driven analog-to-digital converters make <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> feasible in practical applications. A process of <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> is defined by a sampling pattern, which indicates signal sampling points in time. Practical <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> patterns are constrained by ADC characteristics and application requirements. In this paper authors introduce statistical methods which evaluate <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> pattern generators with emphasis on practical applications. Furthermore, the authors propose a new random pattern generator which copes with strict practical limitations imposed on patterns, with possibly minimal loss in randomness of sampling. The proposed generator is compared with existing sampling pattern generators using the introduced statistical methods. It is shown that the proposed algorithm generates <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> patterns dedicated for event-driven-ADCs better than existed sampling pattern generators. Finally, implementation issues of <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> patterns are discussed. Comment: 29 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing journa...|$|R
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the broadcast of Part One, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where callers who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 {{and was one of}} the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did not watch the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E
