5|$|Peanut, or {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea), {{originally from}} South America, {{has grown from}} a <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> crop {{to one of the most}} important commercial nut crops, in part due to the work of George Washington Carver at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|<b>Relatively</b> <b>minor</b> damage {{occurred}} in North Korea, previously impacted by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in September. Rainfall peaked at 147mm (5.79in) in Kaesong. Saomai somewhat exacerbated the unprecedented {{damage caused by}} Prapiroon, and damaged maize crops which were set to be harvested in the coming weeks.|$|E

50|$|Zammit {{was very}} much {{involved}} with commissions of design. Invariably, these were contracted by religious circles. Though some of them entailed <b>relatively</b> small, <b>minor</b> embellishments and adornments, others, such as the architectonic assignments, comprised large tasks.|$|R
5|$|Sponges with photosynthesizing endosymbionts produce up {{to three}} times more oxygen than they consume, {{as well as more}} organic matter than they consume.

5|$|Also, cinematographic {{improvements}} that modern viewers would find <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> were noted in their day. In the attic scenes, for instance, Hepworth's use of arc lights was celebrated {{for being an}} early use of harsh lighting conditions to create ambiance and indicate a dangerous setting. Prints have been saved both in the Library of Congress film archive, and the National Film and Television Archive of the British Film Institute.|$|E
5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} and <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> refinement followed, during which several {{attempts were made}} to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money. Madison in particular wanted to push the Constitution back in the direction of his Virginia plan.|$|E

5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as a <b>relatively</b> unimportant, <b>minor</b> feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|R
50|$|The Praktisix was {{manufactured}} by Kamera Werkstätten (KW). It is a 6×6 SLR modelled on contemporary 35 mm SLRs. It {{was followed by}} the Praktisix II and Praktisix IIA, all with <b>minor,</b> <b>relatively</b> cosmetic changes. They all have rather poor reliability, including poor frame spacing.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to such examples, creationists specify that they are objecting only to macroevolution, not microevolution: most creationist organizations do not dispute the occurrence of short-term, <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> evolutionary changes, such as that observed even in dog breeding. Rather, they dispute the occurrence of major evolutionary changes {{over long periods of}} time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced {{flooding and}} caused one {{death in the}} northwestern Bahamas. In North Carolina and Virginia, Irene produced heavy rainfall of over 10inches (255mm), adding more flooding after previous Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd. The flooding closed many roads, and caused rivers to crest past their banks, though damage in the area was <b>relatively</b> <b>minor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Ivan was a {{powerful}} storm at landfall, its effects were <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> compared to the storms' intensity; however, 14 people were killed during the storm and two others were listed as missing. Agricultural industries sustained the most severe damage, as thousands of animals drowned in the storm. Total damage was estimated at $9.6million (1997 USD; $13.1million 2009 USD). A total of 1,779 homes were destroyed, 13,771 others were damaged and 4,600 hectares of farmland were flooded by the storm.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Thomas {{suffered}} {{his first}} reversal of fortune: before his departure for Abydos, {{he had sent}} an army under his adoptive son Constantius against the Armeniacs. Constantius was ambushed by strategos Olbianos and killed, although the army was able to withdraw with relatively few casualties. Constantius's severed head was sent to Michael, who dispatched it to Thomas at Abydos. Thomas was undaunted by this <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> setback, and crossed over into Europe some time in late October or early November. There, Constantius was soon replaced as co-emperor by another obscure individual, a former monk whom Thomas also adopted and named Anastasius.|$|E
5|$|Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay Archipelago was {{gradually}} {{taken over by}} the European colonial powers, beginning {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese at Malacca in 1509. The early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the Dutch, who came to control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago, particularly in spices, then the region's most important product. Other colonial powers, including the British, were limited to a <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> presence.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1860, Bryan grew up {{in rural}} Illinois and in 1887 moved to Nebraska, where he practiced law and entered politics. He won {{election}} to the House of Representatives in 1890, and was re-elected in 1892, before mounting an unsuccessful US Senate run. He {{set his sights on}} higher office, believing he could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained a <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> figure in the Democratic Party. In anticipation of a presidential campaign, he spent much of 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States; his compelling oratory increased his popularity in his party.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the Time of Troubles Torm was a <b>relatively</b> obscure <b>minor</b> demipower {{who served}} Tyr.

5|$|Estudiantes, {{a modest}} {{neighborhood}} club and a <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> team in Argentina, had an unusual style that prioritized athletic preparation and achieving results at all costs.

The pincharratas won their first title in 1968 by defeating Palmeiras. They successfully defended the title in 1969 and 1970 against Nacional and Peñarol, respectively. Although Peñarol was the first club to win three titles, Estudiantes were the first to win three consecutive titles.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Android 4.2.2 {{was only}} {{available}} as the pre-loaded software on Verizon Wireless' HTC One, since HTC considered 4.2 to be <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> on smartphones. Instead, North American models {{were to be}} upgraded directly to Android 4.3, which was scheduled for a release in late-September 2013. HTC had previously released the Android 4.3 upgrade for the Google Play edition in early August 2013. On 25 September 2013, HTC began rolling out the upgrade, starting with unlocked models. Alongside the internal changes introduced by Android 4.3, the update adds {{the ability to use}} custom soundtracks on Highlights videos, and also corrects the low-light camera issues introduced by the 4.2.2 upgrade.|$|E
5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This {{is perhaps the}} most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E
50|$|In New Zealand, surf lifesaving sport {{encompasses}} {{a number of}} different disciplines, including surf swimming, board paddling, surf ski, beach flags, beach sprint, Ironman with competitors starting from the age of 7. Surf Life saving is a <b>relatively</b> popular <b>minor</b> sport with and estimated 8,000 competitors of which 2,500 attend Ocean Athletes (Junior Nationals 10-14) and Nats (Senior nationals). The New Zealand team also known as the Black Fins have also been highly successful in recent years placing 2nd in the 2010 World Championships and are currently the only country apart from Australia to have won World Champs, (1956,1998) which is respectable considering the comparatively small size of the sport in the country.|$|R
5000|$|The highest tides {{produced}} by the storm lashed Nueces County. Tides were 9.2 ft and 9 ft mean sea level at Port Aransas Beach and the Port Aransas Jetty, respectively. The heaviest rainfall totals observed from the storm also fell in Nueces County, with 7.26 in of precipitation reported in Robstown. Because rainfall was <b>relatively</b> light, <b>minor,</b> if any flood damage occurred. Strong winds were reported, with winds gusts measured as high as 161 mph and 180 mph at the Corpus Christi Weather Bureau Office and Aransas Pass, respectively. Further inland, wind gusts were estimated to have reached 180 mph at Robstown High School, as the oil derricks on the property, built to withstand with of 175 mph, were knocked down.|$|R

5|$|In {{the days}} of the Old West, tales tended to grow with {{repeated}} telling, and a single fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang, but they were <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne spent {{ten weeks}} at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, having her new bow fitted. Following the repairs, Melbourne was {{involved}} in Strategic Reserve deployments and exercises in Southeast Asia from June until September 1964. During this deployment, the carrier visited Subic Bay, where the RAN performed flight deck trials with S-2 Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and A-4 Skyhawk attack fighters. The success of the trials, along with the discovery that Melbourne was able to operate both aircraft with <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> modification, led the Australian Government to approve the purchase of these aircraft.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{method of}} prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a <b>relatively</b> <b>minor</b> problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Childhood obesity {{strongly}} predisposes to some adult diseases. Recently, genome-wide association (GWA) {{studies in}} Caucasians identified multiple {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) associated with BMI and obesity. The associations of those SNPs with BMI and obesity among other ethnicities are not fully described, especially in children. Among those previously identified SNPs, we selected six (rs 7138803, rs 1805081, rs 6499640, rs 17782313, rs 6265, and rs 10938397, in or near obesity-related genes FAIM 2, NPC 1, FTO, MC 4 R, BDNF, and GNPDA 2, respectively) because of the <b>relatively</b> high <b>minor</b> allele frequencies in Chinese individuals and tested the associations of the SNPs with BMI and obesity in Chinese children.
