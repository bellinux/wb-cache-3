50|$|A party popper is {{an object}} {{commonly}} used at parties. It emits a loud popping noise {{by means of}} a small friction-actuated <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> that is emitted by pulling a string. The <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> comes from a very small amount of Armstrong's mixture (a highly sensitive explosive) in the neck of the bottle-like shape. In some party poppers the <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> is replaced by compressed air. In party poppers with an <b>explosive</b> <b>charge,</b> there are less than 0.25 gr g of explosive. The streamers are non flammable for safe use. The charge or compressed air blows out some confetti or streamers and emits a popping sound. The charge is often composed of red phosphorus and strong oxidizer, such as potassium chlorate and potassium perchlorate.|$|R

50|$|The <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> is {{the main}} {{component}} of any bomb, and makes up most of the size and weight of it. It is the damaging element of the bomb (along with any fragments or shrapnel the explosion might produce with its container or neighboring objects). The <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> is detonated by a detonator.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effect of blasting-induced {{vibration}} on ground buildings when tunnel undercrossing a village, a blasting vibration trial {{was carried out in}} Beizhuang tunnel in Henan Province, China. The safety blasting distance and reasonable <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> were pre-estimated according to empirical formula. The attenuation of ground vibration velocity was simulated using a 3 D numerical model. Less <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> and longer distance to blasting source would result in lower ground vibration. When designed <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> was 54 kg, the safe distance was 42. 26 m. While the distance between building and blasting source was about 37 m, the maximum <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> was 36. 24 kg. The numerical results showed that the significantly horizontal affect region of blasting vibration was within 50 m to blasting source. Accordingly, effective vibration control is necessary to avoid disturbing human daily life during tunneling...|$|R

5000|$|Designed by the Commanding Officer of SOE's Inter Services Research Bureau (ISRB), Lt Col. John Dolphin, as {{a method}} of {{delivering}} a large <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> below an enemy ship, the Welman was a submersible craft 20 ft in length (including <b>explosive</b> <b>charge),</b> weighing about 2000 lb. Unlike the [...] "Chariot" [...] human torpedo, the operator was enclosed within the craft, and did not need to wear diving gear. The Welman could transport a 425 lb time-fused <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> of Torpex, which was intended to be magnetically attached to a target's hull. Vision was through armoured glass segments in the small conning tower, and no periscope was fitted.|$|R

5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the <b>explosive</b> <b>charge.</b> As any <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|R
50|$|With the USAF Grasshopper {{after being}} parachuted {{down from a}} long range aircraft, a small <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> {{disconnects}} the parachute upon impact with the ground. After a selected preset time, a second <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> would deploy {{the legs of the}} unit while setting it upright on the ground. Finally, a third <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> would extend the antenna and make the unit ready to begin taking weather measurements, broadcasting them back three times a day at selected timed-intervals (so other aircraft can pick up the short range signal). Reports also stated that the Grasshopper could be used to guide in strike aircraft with the internal clock set for the approximate time the strike aircraft would arrive near the target.|$|R
