5|$|David Winkler and Frederick Sheldon {{believe that}} {{evolutionary}} {{development in the}} mud-building swallows, and individual species follow this order of construction. A retort builder like <b>red-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> starts with an open cup, closes it, and then builds the entrance tunnel. Winkler and Sheldon propose {{that the development of}} closed nests reduced competition between males for copulations with the females. Since mating occurs inside the nest, the difficulty of access means other males are excluded. This reduction in competition permits the dense breeding colonies typical of the Delichon martins.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow's {{breeding}} season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus {{has been recorded}} breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its {{breeding season}}, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests. The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and white wagtail in black kite nests, {{taking advantage of the}} territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing nests in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the <b>red-rumped</b> <b>swallow,</b> and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{resident}} bird species include little green bee-eater, pied bushchat, ashy-crowned sparrow-lark, paddyfield pipit, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, Indian courser, common kingfisher, pied kingfisher, white-breasted kingfisher, little ringed plover, <b>red-rumped</b> <b>swallow,</b> shikra, white-eyed buzzard, red-necked falcon, short-toed snake-eagle, baya weaver, zitting cisticola, plain prinia, ashy prinia and Indian roller.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-rumped</b> <b>swallows</b> build quarter-sphere nests with {{a tunnel}} {{entrance}} lined with mud collected in their beaks, and lay 3 to 6 eggs. They normally nest under cliff overhangs in their mountain homes, but will readily adapt to buildings such as mosques and bridges.|$|R
50|$|Cecropis is a genus {{of large}} {{swallows}} found in Africa and tropical Asia. The <b>red-rumped</b> <b>swallow's</b> range also extends into southern Europe. This genus is frequently subsumed {{into the larger}} genus Hirundo. The genus name Cecropis, given by Friedrich Boie is the Ancient Greek for an Athenian woman.|$|R
40|$|Published data {{describing}} the biometrics, moult and fat loads of migrant <b>Red-rumped</b> <b>Swallows</b> Hirundo daurica are scarce. Here we present data on wing and tarsus length, tail measurements, abdominal fat scores and weight for {{a sample of}} 457 birds captured at a reed-bed roost during autumn migration through the island of Lesvos in the Aegean Sea. Biometrics {{were similar to those}} reported from smaller samples of museum skins but with a greater range of values for several measures. Tail length and tail-fork length in adult birds were not markedly bimodally distributed, suggesting either that females were rare in the sample captured or that use of the sexing criteria proposed by Svensson (1992) should not be applied to the population migrating through this area. The majority of birds carried fat loads, and these were significantly larger in adult than in first-year birds, suggesting that adults might have been in better condition prior to long-distance migration. Moult of the inner primaries was found in 16. 4 %, and of tertials in 8. 2 % of adult birds. Its frequency varied significantly between years, but did not vary with size, mass or fat score...|$|R
500|$|The natural {{breeding}} habitat is hilly or mountainous country with cliffs, gorges and caves up to 3,700m (12,000ft) above sea level, but this martin also breeds in lowlands, especially if rocks or buildings are available, {{and may be}} found far from water. This species readily uses man-made structures {{as a substitute for}} natural precipices, and has bred on houses in southern Israel since the 1970s. In Egypt it may breed near monuments like Abu Simbel or in desert towns such as Aswan. It uses towns, bridges and cliffs in Ethiopia, and tower blocks [...] in Arabia. In the breeding season, the martin needs mud or wet soil to construct its nests, and this is normally readily found near human habitations. This species appears to be scarce in some forested and coastal areas with high humidity, in which the <b>red-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> tends to be the common hirundine.|$|E
500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, <b>red-rumped</b> <b>swallow,</b> red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
50|$|The West African swallow was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Hirundo. Some authorities consider {{it to be a}} subspecies of the <b>red-rumped</b> <b>swallow.</b> Alternate names for the West African swallow include the lowland swallow, Senegal <b>red-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> and West African striated swallow.|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built by}} both adults over several weeks, {{is made from}} several hundred mud pellets and lined with {{feathers}} and soft, dry grass, hair, sheep’s wool or plant down. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale crag martins, <b>red-rumped</b> <b>swallows,</b> and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests. In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion similar to that of rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen. Artificial nests are readily used, and halved coconut shells have been successfully occupied in Abu Dhabi.|$|R
50|$|The red-breasted swallow {{builds a}} closed mud nest with a tubular {{entrance}} in a cavity or under bridges and similar structures. It will use deserted buildings, tree holes or caves, and {{has benefited from}} the construction of railway bridges and similar structures. It is generally a solitary species and pairs rarely breed in groups. Three eggs is a typical clutch. These birds feed on insects which are almost all caught {{in the air and}} the species rarely lands on the ground rather perching on wires and twigs. The typical flight is slow and buoyant. Like the closely related <b>red-rumped</b> and mosque <b>swallows</b> the nests of the red-breasted swallow are often usurped by the white-rumped swift.|$|R
40|$|This bird {{report for}} the Camargue, Crau and Alpilles (Rhône delta, S. France), covers the years 1980 and 1981. It has been {{compiled}} partly from observations communicated by visiting n aturalists but particularly from resident ornithologists, attached to the « Fondation Tour du Valat », the « Centre d'Écologie de Camargue » (C. N. R. S.), the « Réserve Nationale de Camargue » (S. N. P. N.) and the « Centre de Recherches Ornithologiques de Provence » (C. R. O. P.). As with the previous reports only the results of censuses and unusual observations are given. As a baseline, readers are advised to consult the recently published guide to the birds of the Camargue by Blondel and Isenmann (1981) in which are mentioned all 337 species recorded {{in the area to}} date. The climatological report shows a cold spell in December 1980, with subzero temperatures recorded on 18 days. Total rainfall in autumn and winter was below, but in spring and summer higher, than normal. 1981 was even more unusual, with 25 nights of frost in January, low rainfall, long hours of sunlight and much northerly wind. In contrast, the winter ended (March) mild and wet. April was mild and dry, May cold and wet. The variable summer and autumn weather was characterised by a dry spell (excepting September) with no rain in October/November. December was mild and wet. A first complete census of wintering cormorants revealed 4000 in 1980 and 6000 in 1981 against a formerly estimated maximum of about 2000. This increase has meant that the delta {{has become one of the}} most important wintering are as for the species in western Europe. The Grey Heron population continues to increase with 438 nests in 1980 and 515 in 1981 (table I). In contrast, Purple Herons have decreased in number in the delta over the last decade, probably as a result of a reduction in the available breeding habitat. Large colonies still exist just outside the delta, and the region continues to be the most important breeding area for Purple Herons in France. The population of Cattle Egrets, after being stable from 1977 to 1979 (table II), increased by 48 % in 1980 before decreasing in 1981. This drop was undoubtedly attributable to the cold winter. A nest of Little Bittern was found in 1981 and there is a summer record of a Reef Heron in 1980. A pair of White Storks again bred, raising 3 young in both years. The adult pair are sedentary whilst the young migrate in autumn. Flamingos again bred in large numbers, with 7500 prs. in 1980 and 9500 prs. in 1981, although this latter figure was reduced to 8170 prs. by heavy rains. These raised 3730 and 4000 chicks respectively. The colour-ringing programme continued and a further 1358 chicks were marked during the two years, bringing the total of individu ally recognisable birds to 3316. Of these, 1724 (52 %) have since been identified throughout the West Mediterranean, whilst the total number of sightings exceeds 11000. Both Greylag Goose and Gannet have been attracted to the Flamingo colony, the latter bird staying for three months, displaying and occupying a nest cone and accompanying the flamingos up to 14 kms inland. Bewick's Swans continue to be winter visitors with 52 in 1979 - 1980 and 82 in 1980 - 1981, with a record high of 23 juveniles. The breeding population of Shelduck, a species extending its range in the south of France, was censused in 1980, with 350 chicks (42 families) in the Salins-de-Giraud and 700 (86 families) in the Salins-d'Aigues-Mortes. A further 111 were colour-ringed as part of a study on the movements of the West Mediterranean population which has now been shown to moult in the same area as the North West European population, in North West Germany, a distance of 1200 kms north of the Camargue. Winter counts have revealed peaks of 1354 birds in 1980 and 1035 in 1981, in each case representing over 80 % of the total number recorded in the south of France. For other species of ducks the peak 1980 - 1981 winter count was of 143000 in November. Instead of increasing in December, as is usually the case, the cold spell of early December resulted in a decrease of 25 % mostly caused by a high hunting mortality within the delta. Amongst the major changes in numbers compared to former winters has been a decrease of Pintail and Tufted Ducks and an increase of Shoveler and Gadwall. Diving ducks (Tufted and Pochard) are gradually decreasing in the Camargue because there are more attractive areas further north, whilst some of the surface-feeders tend to increase, Mallard and Teal together regularly forming 50 - 60 % of the total Anatidae. Amongst the seaducks, a concentration of 1000 Scoters, mostly or solely Velvets, was quite exceptional. The area is one of the most remarkable in Europe for raptors at all seasons. Booted Eagles were again regularly recorded in 1980 and a Sea Eagle appeared in both years. Wintering Marsh Harriers are at a remarkably high density with 280 counted at 3 roosts, probably only about half of the total in the area. There were two observations of Eleonora's Falcon in 1981. The average number of wintering coots bas recently decreased from about 25000 (1964 - 1968) to 20000 in 1980 - 1981. Sample censuses of the breeding population indicate a relatively law density of 3. 7 nests per 10 ha. ln the Crau, the wintering Little Bustards have been estimated at 1000 - 1100, which corresponds with the breeding population of about 500 prs. The third record of a Pectoral Sandpiper was a bird shot in September 1979. There is a second winter record of a Great Skua in 1981 and a remarkable observation of 22 Long-tailed Skuas together in the Gulf of Beauduc in May 1980. A pair of Mediterranean Gulls successfully bred in both 1980 and 1981 whilst the Slender-billed Gull was not found breeding either year. The former of these two species occurs in large numbers outside the breeding season with maximum counts of 250 in March 1980 and 700 in September 1981. Two pairs of Black Terns nested in 1980, the first breeding record since 1931. Whiskered Terns bred in 1981 (120 prs.). This species was formerly abundant in the area but bad not been recorded breeding since 1974. The Long-eared Owl, which forms winter roosts of up to 20 birds, was found breeding in 1980 for only the fifth time. There are several spring records of <b>Red-rumped</b> <b>Swallows</b> whilst those of the common Swallow in December may indicate a possible attempt at wintering. Richard's Pipit was recorded for the first time in October 1981 with a second record one month later, whilst the May 1980 record of a Red-throated Pipit was only the sixth in the past 30 years. The Stonechat seems now to be well re-established as a breeding species and there is a possible return of the Penduline Tit with one nest found in each of the two years...|$|R
