50|$|Tree climbers can {{physically}} {{measure the}} height and circumference {{of a tree}} using a tape. The distance from the highest climb point {{and the top of}} the tree is measured using a pole that extends from the tree top to the anchor point of the tape. This height is noted and the diameter of the tree is measured at that point. The climber then rappels down the tree measuring the trunk circumference by tape wrap at different heights with the height of each measurement referenced to the fixed tape running down the trunk. Direct trunk measurements are obtained by a tree climber. The climber will ascend into the tree until he reaches the highest safe climbing point. Once this point is reached, the climber drops a weighted throw line straight to the ground. A measuring (<b>reference)</b> <b>tape</b> is then attached via a small carabineer to the dropped throw line and pulled up to the top, following the vertical path of the weight’s descent. The tape is affixed to the trunk at this point via several thumbtacks at this point and allowed to hang freely down the trunk. The exact position of the tack relative {{to the top of the}} tree is noted. If the top of the tree was not safely reachable a pole or stick is used to assist in measuring the remaining distance to the high point of the tree.|$|E
50|$|The climber {{pulls up}} an {{extendable}} pole and {{uses it to}} reach {{to the top of}} the tree from the point at the upper end of the tape. If not vertical, the slope of the leaning pole is measured and the length of the pole is measured. The vertical distance added by the pole to the tape length is (sin Θ x pole length). The lower end of the tape is terminated at the base of the tree. If on sloping ground this is the mid-slope point between the lowest and highest sides of the tree. The total height of the tree is equal to the measured distance from the base at mid-slope to the upper end of the tape where affixed to the tree plus the vertical height measured to the actual top of the tree. Girth measurements are made by wrapping the tape around the tree perpendicular to the bole at successive intervals as the climber rappels down the tree. All points of measurement are referenced for height above ground as measured on the fixed <b>reference</b> <b>tape.</b> Measurement intervals are subjectively chosen based on changes in trunk taper. An area where a change in profile is observed (in or out) is measured with a tape. Clear sections of trunk are selected so as to not include branch collars, burls, etc. For greatest accuracy, measurements are taken on single-trunked trees at no more than 10 foot (3 m) intervals. Additional measurements are generally required where the trunk branches or bifurcates or where there are trunk reiterations.|$|E

Materials and Instruments 1. An electric tape, double-wired and graduated in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet. Electric tapes commonly are mounted on a hand-cranked and powered supply reel that contains space for the batteries and some device (“indicator”) for signaling when the circuit is closed (fig. 1). 2. An older model electric tape, also known as an “M-scope, ” marked at 5 -foot intervals with clamped-on metal bands (fig. 2) {{has been replaced by}} newer, more accurate models. Technical procedures for this device are available from the procedures document archives. 3. A steel <b>reference</b> <b>tape</b> for calibration, graduated in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet 4.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The CARESS (Clopidogrel and Aspirin for Reduction of Emboli in Symptomatic carotid Stenosis) trial {{proved the}} {{effectiveness}} of the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin alone in reducing presence and number of microembolic signals (MES) in patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis. The present study aimed at installing primary and secondary quality control measures in CARESS because MES evaluation relies on subjective judgment by human experts. Methods: As primary quality control, centers participating in CARESS evaluated a reference digital audio tape (DAT) before the study containing both MES and artifacts. Interobserver agreement of classifying signals as MES was expressed as proportions of specific agreement of positive ratings (ps±values). For all DATs included in CARESS (n= 300), online number of MES and off-line number of MES read by the central reader were compared using correlation coefficients. As secondary control, a sample of 16 of 300 DATs was cross-validated by another independent reader (post-trial validator). Results: For the <b>reference</b> <b>tape,</b> the cumulative ps±value was 0. 894 based on 12 of 14 observers. Two observers with very different results improved after a training procedure. Agreement between post-trial validator and central reader was ps+= 0. 805, indicating very good agreement. Correlation between online evaluation and off-line evaluation of DATs was very good overall (cumulative ρ= 0. 84; P&# 60; 0. 001). Conclusion: Multicenter studies using MES as outcome parameter are feasible. However, primary and secondary quality control procedures are important. </p...|$|E
40|$|The current-voltage {{characteristics}} of superconductors are commonly determined {{by means of}} a standard 4 -probe DC measurement technique. In coated conductors, however, one often encounters problems due to weak or no stabilization and in such case, when the risk of burning the tape is high, the 4 -probe approach can fail. In other cases such as in HTS cable structures, besides vulnerability and high risk of damage, it may also be difficult to achieve a high critical current level with a power supply that is normally used to characterize single strands. We therefore investigated an alternative method to determine the DC I-V curve, based on measuring the AC transport loss as a function of frequency in overcritical current range. In the AC regime, both the hysteretic loss component and the joule dissipation are present for applied transport currents exceeding the critical current Ic. In this work, AC loss measurements at different frequencies are related to different electric fields in DC and a curve similar to the DC I-V is obtained. From this curve, the power index N and Ic values are estimated. AC regime operation can be more beneficial for two reasons: firstly, because very high currents can be achieved easily by using a transformer; secondly, because the effective joule heat dissipation with overcritical AC currents is much lower than that with DC of the same amplitudes. In the experiment, we used a 4 mm wide YBCO <b>reference</b> <b>tape</b> with 20 μm of Cu-stabilization. For the comparison with AC transport loss, the sample was measured with the standard 4 -probe technique and remained stable even in overload condition. To support our study, numerical simulations, reproducing both transient and stationary operation conditions, were performed. A similar relation between the AC current transport loss and the I-V curves was also observed in the simulations. Comment: EUCAS 201...|$|E

Six pilots participated in this study, with each subject performing 18 runs along a single, known flight profile. Subjective results indicated that the moving-tape formats were generally better than that of the conventional instruments. They also indicated that an actual-centered fixed pointer was preferred to a reference-centered pointer. Performance data for a visual secondary task showed that formats not containing trend information produced better performance; however, no difference was noted in airspeed tracking or altitude tracking performance.

40|$|LecturePg. 45 - 52 The paper {{summarizes}} {{experience of}} the results of check valve operation (and maloperation) over a number of years, concentrating on data gathered during the last three years in an olefine plant. Continuous tape recording is employed, and variables such as speed, pressures, valve position and vibration can be made available for study after a machine trip. Much concern was caused by the discovery of very rapid decelerations in the ethylene and HP process gas compressors. Careful analysis proves that reverse rotation can occur after rapid deceleration, and speeds over 4000 rpm in reverse have been detected. Observed deceleration rates are compared for typical frictional rundowns and process pressure driven rundown, with and without reverse rotation occurring. The physical details are explained by <b>reference</b> to the <b>tape</b> records. Calculation of the process energy levels and machine internals are used to show the magnitude of the driving forces and to establish limits to the processes. The concept of limiting runaway speed in reverse is introduced. Finally, recommendations are made for check valve characteristics and location to minimize the risk of problems due to inefficiency or maloperation...|$|R
