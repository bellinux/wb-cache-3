40|$|The {{effects of}} low dosage sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) {{pretreatment}} (0, 0. 6 and 1. 2 % on bone dry wood, pH 9) at two different refining temperatures (4. 6 and 6. 4 bar(g) refiner housing pressure) were evaluated for production of thermomechanical pulp {{with a double}} disc refiner in mill scale using Norway spruce wood at Braviken paper mill (Holmen Paper AB, Sweden). The sulfonate content of the pulps was not affected by the different refining temperatures and was 0. 29 % (as Na 2 SO 3 equivalents) for the highest sulfite addition. Tensile index at constant SEC was increased by 3. 2 Nm/g when the <b>refining</b> <b>temperature</b> was increased, and by 8. 6 Nm/g when 1. 2 % sodium sulfite was added. The effects were additive and led {{to an increase in}} tensile index of similar to 12 Nm/g at constant SEC when combined and would enable a reduction in SEC of 380 kWh/bdt (similar to 20 %) to similar tensile index. The degree of delamination and internal fibrillation of the fibers was increased by both increased <b>refining</b> <b>temperature</b> and sulfite addition. Pulp brightness was slightly reduced (<= 0. 4 % ISO) by increased <b>refining</b> <b>temperature</b> and increased (2 - 3 % ISO), when sodium sulfite was added.

However, new ilmenite ores from &# 147;Grande C&# 244;te Mineral Sands Project&# 148; mine contain {{high level of}} phosphorus, which will contaminate the final iron product produced at the smelter in the future. As a result, a solution to remove the phosphorus from iron was needed. This work focused on studying the dephosphorization process using slags by compiling the existing information available in the literature and finding the best system for the Tyssedal process. For this purpose, an experimental protocol was developed which consisted of smelting pure iron-phosphorus alloy and carrying out refining experiments on it using binary Fe 2 O 3 -CaO and ternary slags Fe 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 slags. The best performing slag was chosen and another set of experiments was carried out on iron smelted at TiZir, Tyssedal. In these experiments, the effects of <b>refining</b> <b>temperature</b> and time were also investigated. However, when the same slag was tested on the iron from TiZir, results were very different since the metal and slag were strongly mixed. Analysis on the iron, as well as XRD and EPMA on the slag were carried. Dephosphorization was successful on the pure Fe-P alloy and up to 99 % of the phosphorus was removed using a (50 wt% FeO, 45 wt% CaO, 5 wt% SiO 2) slag. On the other hand, accurate conclusions concerning dephosphorization on the iron from TiZir were not made due to the strong mixing between the slag and metal, which lead to limitations in the analysis. The main explanation behind this observation is the different amount of impurities in {{the two types of}} iron, especially carbon and silicon. Hence, more work is need to study the effect of these impurities on the dephosphorization process as well as <b>refining</b> <b>temperature</b> and time. </p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{electric}} energy efficiency of single stage double disc refining for production of printing grade mechanical pulp from Norway spruce wood chips. The thesis {{is based on the}} hypothesis, that more energy efficiency refining can be attained by balanced increases of wood softening and refining intensity. Five mill scale trials were performed where wood softening and refining intensity was varied by applying or changing the following process parameters and variables: Chip pretreatment/impregnation with water Low dosages of sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) added to impregnation Temperature and retention time in the atmospheric preheater bin <b>Refining</b> <b>temperature</b> (housing pressure) Feeding segment design combined with increased production rate By combining suitable increases in wood softening and refining intensity, it was possible to reduce the specific electric energy consumption in refining by 15 % (~ 290 kWh per bone dry ton (bdt)) while preserving important pulp properties within ± 5 %, compared to the standard double disc refining process. This was done by combining chip impregnation, using an addition of 0. 36 % (on bone dry basis) sodium sulfite, with a new feeding segment design which enabled 25 % higher production rate. When using the new feeding segment design at an increased production rate at unchanged wood softening, it led to reduced fiber length and increased sheet light scattering coefficient at certain tensile index, compared with the standard segment design at normal production rate. This is consistent with the effects normally seen when the refining intensity is increasing. The specific electric energy consumption was 8 % lower at a tensile index of 43. 5 Nm/g (on Rapid Köthen laboratory sheets) compared to refining at lower intensity using the standard segment design at normal production rate. Mechanical chip pretreatment with subsequent water impregnation showed a reduction in specific electric energy consumption of 6 % (~ 120 kWh/bdt). When chip impregnation was applied in a later trial with a milder chip compression, it led to increased wood softening seen as better preserved fiber length and reduced light scattering coefficient. This resulted in a reduction in tensile index at certain specific electric energy consumption when applied with the standard refining condition but to an increase in tensile index when applied with refining at higher intensity using the feeding segment design at higher production rate. An addition of 1. 2 % sodium sulfite during impregnation led to a sulfonate content of pulps of ~ 0. 28 % (as Na 2 SO 3 equivalents, including post sulfonation) and an average increase in tensile index of about 8. 3 Nm/g, when compared to unsulfonated pulps at certain specific electric energy consumption. The increase in tensile index correlated with increased delamination and internal fibrillation of fibers (measured by Simon’s staining), which indicate that the increase in tensile index for sulfonated pulps was a result of improved fiber flexibility and collapsibility. The reduction in disc gap at certain specific electric energy consumption in refining due to an increased wood softening after sulfonation may explain the increase in delamination and internal fibrillation for sulfonated pulps. The smaller disc gap probably led to a more intense refining, i. e. loading at higher deformation rates due to a higher degree of deformation in bar crossings. Different temperatures (80 vs. 97 °C) and retention times (6 vs. 9 min.) in the atmospheric preheater bin were studied. This showed that the lower temperature and shorter retention time was beneficial for the tensile strength and light scattering of pulp when applying low dosage sodium sulfite pretreatment. This was most likely a result of too high degree of wood softening prior to defibration in the breaker bar zone when combining low dosage sodium sulfite pretreatment with the higher preheating bin temperature at longer retention time. Different refining temperatures (4. 6 and 6. 4 bar(g) refiner housing pressure) were evaluated both without and with low additions (0. 6 % and 1. 2 %) of sodium sulfite. Raising the <b>refining</b> <b>temperature</b> increased tensile index by 3. 2 Nm/g and the addition of 1. 2 % sodium sulfite by 8. 6 Nm/g. The combined increase (~ 12 Nm/g) was similar to the effect of increasing the specific electric energy consumption by 380 kWh/bdt, when comparing pulps at equal tensile index. However, the pulps produced with increased <b>refining</b> <b>temperature</b> and sodium sulfite addition had lower light scattering coefficient at certain tensile index. The combination of increased <b>refining</b> <b>temperature</b> and addition of 0. 6 % sodium sulfite was interesting and resulted in pulp with higher tensile index, light scattering coefficient and brightness together with lower shives content at certain specific electric energy consumption, compared with pulp produced at the lower <b>refining</b> <b>temperature</b> without addition of sodium sulfite. Finally, an implementation of the technology presented here is discussed in relation to the Braviken mill (Holmen Paper AB, Norrköping, Sweden) concerning reduction in electric energy consumption and steam recovery. The technology has potential to reduce the electrical energy use by ~ 100 GWh/year at the Braviken paper mill, where this study was performed.

40|$|In control {{strategies}} for thermomechanical pulp refiners, {{the relation between}} energy consumption and production rate, often called specific energy, {{has been used as}} a key variable for decades. The importance of controlling the specific energy and thereby indirectly the pulp quality, has been an indisputable axiom for most engineers engaged in the pulp and paper industry. Recently, another competing concept based on <b>refining</b> zone <b>temperature</b> measurements has been presented as an alternative for improved pulp quality control, but so far no comparison between these two concepts has been made. In this study, the two concepts are compared based on a system identification procedure using “Auto Regressive Moving Average eXogenous” (ARMAX) models. The identification procedure adopted creates dynamic models that can provide predictions of the commonly used pulp quality variables Canadian Standard Freeness (CSF) and Mean Fiber Length (MFL). These predictions are all based on the traditional process variables, i. e. production rate, dilution water flow, and hydraulic pressure, in combination with information of either the specific energy and or the temperature profile. The results show that it is not motivated to use the specific energy for predictions of CSF and MFL, as it gives limited dynamic information of the refining process besides what already is given by the three traditional process variables.

The fibre reinforced metal laminates GLARE including 67 wt. % 2024 Al alloy was used as upper fuselage in Airbus A 380, but the solution for GLARE recycling is not available. Thermal recycling which uses high temperature to decompose the resin and separate the reinforcement fibres and fillers, has been used in the thermal delamination of Lacomet (one member of fibre metal laminates family). Similar to the thermal recycling of Lacomet, a practical solution for GLARE recycling in laboratory-scale was developed in this research. The recycling of GLARE consists of two steps. The first step is the separation of S 2 -glass fibre and 2024 Al sheets after the decomposition of resins in GLARE under thermal condition, the decomposition behaviour as well as the decomposition kinetics of resins in GLARE were studied. The second step is the re-melting and refining of the separated 2024 Al sheets, the critical influence factors such as the salt flux composition, <b>refining</b> <b>temperature,</b> the size of 2024 Al scrap and the ratio of salt flux to scarp were discussed in this research.

In the energy demanding production of mechanical pulps many efforts have focused on design development, but regarding control of refiners, {{there is still a}} potential for improvements. The possibilities of improved control performance are enhanced by reliable process measurements and here, <b>refining</b> zone <b>temperature</b> measurements are considered. This thesis includes two parallel paths. One path considers first-principles modeling of TMP refining processes. An entropy approach is applied when deriving estimates of the irreversible work associated with refining. Results show that this irreversible work, as well as the reversible thermodynamic work related to steam generation, are distributed over the refining plates forming characteristic profiles. Moreover, the entropy model can estimate material flows and pulp concentration as functions of the refining zone radius and this is made possible by measuring of temperature profiles. The entropy model provides an extensive description of important process phenomena that can be useful in relation to process design as well as process control. The other path considers refiner control. Firstly, it shows how unfortunate process design can restrict operational performance in a TMP production process. It is shown how the presence of internal interconnections could complicate control tasks and produce intricate disturbance patterns. Secondly, traditional control strategies are challenged by classifying specific energy as an integrated measure unable to reflect local phenomena inside the refining zone. Models for pulp quality variables, derived using a system identification approach, shown that no significant dynamic contribution is given by the specific energy, besides what is already given by the inputs production rate, dilution water flow and hydraulic pressure. It is, however, concluded that the models were significantly improved by the introduction of <b>refining</b> zone <b>temperature</b> measurements.

In the research of thermocline judgment, we study the three-dimensional boundary of thermocline so as to judge the three-dimensional “temperature jump body” more accurately and plan to propose the concept of three-dimensional “temperature jump body.” The study of three-dimensional “temperature jump body” will provide a more precise thermocline location for marine fishing ground distribution and acoustic communication research. In terms of the thermocline prediction, we will further consider the external environmental factors, climate change, anthropogenic effects, and other conditions simultaneously, to obtain more accurate prediction results for thermocline.|$|R

The methods for obtaining low-level aerodynamic accelerations, principally in the rarefied flow regime, are applied to 10 Orbiter flights. The extraction process is presented using data obtained from Space Transportation System Flight 32 (Mission 61 -C) as a typical example. This process involves correcting the HiRAP measurements {{for the effects of}} temperature bias and instrument offset from the Orbiter center of gravity, and removing acceleration data during times they are affected by thruster firings. The corrected data are then made continuous and smooth and are further enhanced by <b>refining</b> the <b>temperature</b> bias correction and removing effects of the auxiliary power unit actuation. The resulting data are the current best estimate of the Orbiter aerodynamic accelerations during reentry and will be used for further analyses of the Orbiter aerodynamics and the upper atmosphere characteristics...|$|R
