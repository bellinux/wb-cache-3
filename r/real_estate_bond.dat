40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} applying the KMV-Merton model on Swedish <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> companies listed at the NASDAQ OMX Nordic <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> Index. Comparing the KMV-Merton model credit rating to frequently applied credit metrics, {{we find that the}} model adequately captures relevant information contained in these metrics. Additionally, the model proves robust when using long time series. Applying data from the time interval 2007 - 2014, we estimate econometric models to decompose significant predictor variables for credit spread variation at issuance. We obtain data directly from financial statements to assure statistically useful estimates. A univariate econometric model including the KMV-Merton default probability explains pooled cross-sectional regularities in credit spreads rather well. Combining firm financials, macroeconomic predictors and bond characteristics with the pure structural model, we conclude that a comprehensive hybrid model has improved fit. This result suggests that the KMV-Merton model is unable to capture all information contained in financial- and macroeconomic data. In particular, a model including the default probability, loan-to-value, the 3 -month annualized interbank rate, coupon structure and credit rating is able to explain 80. 19 % of credit spread variation. Including a time variable enables us to exclude the existence of spurious time correlations and construct a model that is unconstrained in the parameters. Overall, the explanatory power achieved aligns with empirical research. In summary, we conclude that the KMV-Merton model yields significant statistics for credit risk assessment of Swedish <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>bonds</b> at issuance. However, the statistic does not prove sufficient, as the comprehensive hybrid outperforms the univariate model. nhhma...|$|R

Firstly, market specific monetary conditions can differ considerably among asset markets. Secondly, market specific monetary conditions are positively related to asset prices. Thirdly, US asset markets have experienced a loosening in market specific monetary conditions in the last decades. Fourthly, the loosening of market specific monetary conditions explains long-term increases in US asset prices. Fifthly, the recent convergence of market specific monetary conditions of real asset markets towards those of financial asset markets implies a rise in upside risk to future US asset price inflation. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} topic of {{diversification}} opportunities in international <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> with focus on private <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> markets in developed countries. In examining the characteristics of returns and interrelatedness between international <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> stocks and <b>bonds</b> markets from the time period spanning 2000 to 2009, we find that 2008 was the only year within the past decade in which several countries saw synchronized negative returns on a calendar year basis in the stocks and <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> markets, and even so the synchronized negative returns was only experienced by half of the countries within the 10 -country opportunity set. The amplitude of the peak to trough drop in the cumulative value of the assets was small in <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> on average relative to that of stocks. These findings suggest that investors' should benefit from holding international <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> within their portfolios, even in an extreme down market. Modern portfolio theory is used to analyze and compare ex-ante diversification opportunities in international <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> stocks and <b>bonds</b> and domestic diversification opportunities for the three asset classes {{from the perspectives of}} U. S. and European investors. We project expected returns for each of the markets and used historical risks (volatility) from the 2000 - 2009 period as estimates for volatility. When returns are calculated in local currencies, international diversification in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> portfolio (diversified within a 10 -country opportunity set) should help U. S. investors substantially improve their portfolio risk-return efficiency relative to domestic diversification (within a 6 -metropolitan area opportunity set), as the markets within the U. S. domestic opportunity set provide unattractive risk-return efficiency and their movements are highly correlated. By contrast, European investors will benefit less from the same international diversification strategy relative to domestic diversification (within 5 Eurozone countries) as several Eurozone markets are able to provide considerable risk-return efficiency and low correlations can be found in some pairs of markets. Applying home bias and limits on exposure to any single country i. e. country caps to the portfolio allocation helps to balance the allocation weights for the investor's portfolio but also significantly limits the investor's ability to take advantage of diversification opportunities provided by the international markets. When returns are calculated in the investors' domestic currencies, additional currency risk increases the portfolio volatility without providing additional expected return, reducing diversification benefits of international <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> Even so, international diversification potential to U. S. investors should still be considerable, while that to European investors' should be minimal. by Onousa Boontanorm. Thesis (S.

In these circumstances investment assets {{play an important role in}} supporting the pension system.

However, there has not yet been conducted a study that examines the allocations to <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> by Finnish pension funds, which especially remarkable in light of the dominance of Finnish pension institutions in both the Finnish <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and general investment markets. The study aims to analyze the optimal allocations to <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> by Finnish pension institutions. It estimates the optimal allocations to <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> evaluates the contribution of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> to portfolio return and risk diversification, and examines the ability of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> to protect against changes in funds’ liabilities. The analysis is conducted in two frameworks: the Markowitz optimization as the asset-only framework and optimization of surplus return as the asset-liability framework. The data analyzed in the thesis included return indices for direct <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> private equity <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> funds, listed <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> general stocks, <b>bonds</b> and money markets for the period from 2001 to 2013.

40|$|We {{employ a}} unique data set of public {{commercial}} <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> (CRE) <b>bonds</b> issued during the Great Depression era (1920 - 32) {{to determine their}} frequency of default and total loss given default. Default rates on these bonds far exceeded those originated in subsequent periods, driven {{in part by the}} greater economic stress of the Depression as well as the lower level of financial sophistication of investors and structures that prevailed in 1920 - 32. Our results confirm that making loans with higher loan-to-value ratios results in higher rates of default and loss. They also support the business cycle's significance to the performance of CRE assets. Despite the large number of defaults in the early 1930 s, the losses, which typically occurred after 1940, are comparable to those for contemporary loans, largely due to the rapid recovery of the economy from the Depression. This finding has relevance today, as numerous entities have a large amount of sub-performing CRE assets to work out. While the data point to better loss performance the quicker a problem loan is worked out, this may not hold true when there is a rapid recovery around the corner...|$|R
5000|$|The ways {{in which}} options and {{attributes}} are grouped influence the choices that are made. Examples of such partitioning of options include the division of a household budget into categories (e.g. rent, food, utilities, transportation etc.), or categories of investments within a portfolio (e.g. <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> stocks, <b>bonds,</b> etc.), while examples of partitioning attributes include {{the manner in which}} attributes are grouped together for example a label may group several related attributes together (e.g. convenient) or list them individually (e.g. short running time, little cleanup, low maintenance). The number and type of these categories is important because individuals have a tendency to allocate scarce resources equally across them. People tend to divide investments over the options listed in 401K plans they favor equal allocation of resources and costs across individuals (all else being equal), and are biased to assign equal probabilities to all events that could occur. As a result, aggregate consumption can be changed by the number and types of categorizations. For instance, car buyers can be nudged toward more responsible purchases by itemizing practical attributes (gas mileage, safety, warranty etc.) and aggregating less practical attributes (i.e. speed, radio, and design are grouped together as [...] "stylishness").|$|R
