After this regional dispatch, the exchange between the regions is carried out and is restricted by the grid capacity. This latter problem is solved with a heuristic procedure rather than calculated deterministically. The input is the merit order, the marginal power plant, the excess energy (renewable energy that could be curtailed), and the excess demand (the demand that cannot be supplied) for each region. The exchange algorithm seeks the least cost for all regions, thus the target function is to minimize the total costs of all regions, given the existing grid infrastructure, storage, and generating capacities.

Since electricity demand varies as does the supply by RES, the remaining <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> must be covered by flexible technologies that are required to balance {{the different types of}} fluctuations. In this study, these flexibility options are divided into three categories: increasing the <b>residual</b> <b>load,</b> decreasing the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> and shifting the electricity demand / supply temporally or spatially. Furthermore, typical technological options are discussed for each category, and four flexibility criteria are used to compare their technical and economic characteristics.

However, within the flexibility categories, it can be shown that some appliances have advantages in three of the four categories compared to the other options.

40|$|Traditionally, {{modeling}} {{investment and}} dispatch problems in electricity economics {{has been limited}} by computation power. Due to this limitation, simplifications are applied. One common practice, for example, {{is to reduce the}} temporal resolution of the dispatch by clustering similar load levels. The increase of intermittent electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) changes the validity of this assumption. RES-E already cover a certain amount of the total demand. This leaves an increasingly volatile residual demand to be matched by the conventional power market.

It is computed for all possible pairs of calibration <b>load</b> <b>residuals</b> and applied calibration loads that can be constructed for the given balance calibration data set. An unexpected high correlation between a <b>load</b> <b>residual</b> and a <b>load</b> is detected if three conditions are met: (i) the absolute value of the correlation coefficient of a residual/load pair exceeds 0. 95; (ii) the maximum of the absolute values of the <b>residuals</b> of a <b>load</b> series exceeds 0. 25 % of the load capacity; (iii) the load component of the load series is intentionally applied.

The high <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> obtained from the series reinforced with 5 DH {{may be the result}} of a unique combination of a lengthy hook, a high ductility wire and high tensile strength. Regarding the series reinforced with 5 DH fibres, there is also a noteworthy observation; the CMOD value corresponds to the maximum load is equal to 2  mm, while relatively small CMOD values (less than 0.7  mm) were registered for the other types of the hook ended fibres. In the case of the series reinforced with 3 DH- 35, the decrease of the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> up to 53  % of its peak load was observed, mainly due to the fibre pulled out and fully deformed at small crack widths. On the other hand, the series reinforced with 5 DH fibres showed high resistance to fibre pullout and resulted in somewhat lower regression of residual peak load at larger crack widths. Thus it could be attributed to the fact that the fibre mechanical anchorage is much higher for 5 DH fibres than those offered by other hooked-end fibre types.|$|E

Some of these studies have also speculated that flexible capture systems may be valuable in future electricity systems with high shares of renewable energy as they could allow fossil fuel plants with capture to rapidly respond to changes in <b>residual</b> <b>load.</b> However, few studies have actually examined the role that plants with flexible capture could play in future power systems. Thus, this study examines the role that power generation with flexible capture systems could play in a future European power system where 80 % of generation (by energy) is supplied by renewables. The results show that conventional base- and mid-load capacity decreases while the peak-load capacity (i. e., open cycle gas turbines) increases. In European regions with high shares of renewables, the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> duration curve become steeper, and hourly changes in <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> increase significantly and happen more frequently at low load levels.

These were: (1) self-supported steel lattice tower with different leg extensions, (2) guyed-V steel lattice tower, (3) tubular steel pole structure and (4) H-frame wood pole structure. The effect of the structures' flexibility on peak dynamic and static residual conductor tensions was studied, after a conductor rupture [...] A sensitivity analysis study was conducted to study the effects of various line design parameters such as initial conductor tension, conductor loading (bare conductor, versus loads due to half an inch and one inch radial ice thicknesses), insulator length and terrain types (e. g. level, hilly and valley terrains). The results from this study are presented in terms of their effect on impact factors. [...] The results obtained from the numerical simulation study indicate that the structural flexibility and the span/insulator and the span /sag ratios have considerable effects on the residual conductor tension (hence on the insulator force). However, the peak dynamic tensions are affected not only by the structural flexibility but also by the cross arm mass and the shape of the structures used for line modeling. For stiff structures, cross arm mass has very little effect on the peak conductor tension. For transmission line modeled with rigid structures, the impact factors are not sensitive to the stiffness values, where as for line modeled with flexible structures, the residual ratio depends on both the stiffness values and span/insulator and span/sag ratios.

This contribution presents {{the final results}} of a large research project, which attempted to address and provide answers {{to some of these}} questions for Baden-Württemberg (south west Germany). Three energy scenarios out to 2040 were defined, one oriented towards the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Concept of the Federal State Government and two alternatives. Timely-resolved load profiles for gas and electricity for 2015, 2020, 2030 and 2040 have been generated at the level of individual municipalities. The profiles include residential and industrial electrical load, gas required for heating (conventional and current-controlled CHP), as well as gas and electricity demand for mobility. The installation of rooftop PV-plants and wind power plants is projected based on bottom up cost-potential analyses which account for some social acceptance barriers. Residential load profiles are derived for each municipality. In times with negative <b>residual</b> <b>load,</b> the PtG technology could be used to convert electricity into hydrogen or methane.

To investigate the contribution of PEVs, the availability of mobile battery storage and the control mechanism for load management are crucial. This study therefore combined the following: a stochastic model to determine mobility behavior, an optimization model to minimize vehicle charging costs and an agent-based electricity market equilibrium model to estimate variable electricity prices. The variable electricity prices are calculated based on marginal generation costs. Hence, because of the merit order effect, the electricity prices provide incentives to consume electricity when the supply of renewable generation is high. Depending on the price signals and mobility behavior, PEVs calculate a cost minimizing charging schedule and therefore balance the fluctuation of RES.
