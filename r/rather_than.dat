5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> downwards, and leaflets having 9 <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> 7 lateral veins.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E
