40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{efficient}} resource allocation with user discrimination framework for 5 G Wireless Systems to allocate multiple carriers resources among users with elastic and inelastic traffic. Each application {{running on the}} user equipment (UE) is assigned an application utility function. In the proposed model, different classes of user groups are considered and users are partitioned into different groups based on the carriers coverage area. Each user has a minimum <b>required</b> <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> based on its class {{and the type of}} its application. Our objective is to allocate multiple carriers resources optimally among users, that belong to different classes, located within the carriers' coverage area. We use a utility proportional fairness approach in the utility percentage of the application running on the UE. Each user is guaranteed a minimum quality of service (QoS) with a priority criterion that is based on user's class and the type of application running on the UE. In addition, we prove the existence of optimal solutions for the proposed resource allocation optimization problem and present a multi-carrier resource allocation with user discrimination algorithm. Finally, we present simulation results for the performance of the proposed algorithm. Comment: Under Submissio...|$|E
40|$|Methyl bromide is a {{critical}} soil fumigant used {{in the production of}} several fresh fruit and vegetables grown in the U. S. The U. S. Clean Air Act of 1992, as amended in 1998, requires that methyl bromide be phased out of use by 2005. A mathematical programming model of the North American vegetable market indicates that the elimination of methyl bromide will have significant impacts on U. S. growers of fruit and vegetables that rely on methyl bromide for soil fumigation purposes. The schedule for eliminating methyl bromide has resulted in a 50 % decline in methyl bromide availability and has resulted in significant increases in the price of methyl bromide. The vegetable industry has not felt the impact that the reduction in methyl bromide may have, however, as increases in price have partially offset the decline in overall availability. Increases in price have reduced the use of methyl bromide for lower valued uses, and new application technologies have reduced the <b>required</b> <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of methyl bromide for effective control of pests and diseases.

The direct applications of fluridone and NMF to aquatic water bodies, including drinking water reservoirs, were modeled assuming uniform application over the entire reservoir at the maximum label rate. Based on the result of the direct application scenario, the estimated maximum surface water derived drinking water concentrations for the use of fluridone and NMF, respectively are: 20 ug/L, and 2. 64 ug/L for the peak concentration (acute), and 0. 18 ug/L, and 1. 45 ug/L for the annual mean concentration (chronic) The Screening Concentration in Groundwater (SCI-GROW) model was not used to estimate groundwater concentrations for fluridone or NMF because this model <b>requires</b> <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> given in lb ai/A.

A series of four tables has been developed to assist the Technicians, and aims to simplify the SASRI Herbicide Guide and calibration calculations. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explain the contents and step-wise use of the tables. An example is given in Table 1, which provides calculations according to nozzle output and cane row spacing, and specifies the height of water to be added to either a standard 210 L plastic or 220 L metal drum used for mixing herbicides for application to 0. 5 ha. Herbicide selection is simplified by arranging treatments into six categories, and suitability is presented according to cane age (plant crop or ratoon), weed category (broadleaf, tufted grass or cynodon), weed growth stage (pre-early post emergence, post-emergence and escaped weeds), soil moisture, availability of small packs and the required waiting periods between last application and planting vegetables. The required amount of each herbicide for addition to the mixing drum is adjusted for different soil clay contents. Finally, calculations are provided for the addition of suitable adjuvants according to the height of water initially added to the mixing drum. Validation of this method is currently in the testing phase.

40|$|The {{application}} of nutrients affect {{the quality of}} the environment which justifies the consideration of regulations regarding their use in agriculture. In the early 1990 s The Netherlands decided to use the indicator `nutrient surplus at farm level¿ as the basis for a regulation which was called the mineral accounting system (MINAS). Exceedance of specified nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) surpluses (`N and P loss standards¿), resulted in a financial levy per kg exceedance. This NP surplus approach is a `goal-oriented regulation¿ rather than a `means-oriented regulation¿, giving farmers maximum freedom to stop nutrient leaks where they considered measures to be most effective in their specific situation. In 2003, however, the European Court of Justice ruled that The Netherlands Action Programme, of which MINAS was part, was in conflict with the EU Nitrates Directive. Important consideration here was that the legislation in The Netherlands contained as yet no specified <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> for N. The Netherlands was also reproached for implicitly allowing <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> of more than 170 kg N in the form of animal manure per ha per year without possessing formal permission by the European Commission to deviate from this threshold, a so-called `derogation¿.

The threat of loose aggregate being ingested into an aircraft engine drives the design and construction of sprayed seals for airports.

50|$|Most {{animal manure}} {{consists}} of feces. Common forms of animal manure include farmyard manure (FYM) or farm slurry (liquid manure). FYM also contains plant material (often straw), {{which has been}} used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the feces and urine. Agricultural manure in liquid form, known as slurry, is produced by more intensive livestock rearing systems where concrete or slats are used, instead of straw bedding. Manure from different animals has different qualities and <b>requires</b> different <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> when used as fertilizer. For example horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, and guano from seabirds and bats all have different properties. For instance, sheep manure is high in nitrogen and potash, while pig manure is relatively low in both. Horses mainly eat grass and a few weeds so horse manure can contain grass and weed seeds, as horses do not digest seeds the way that cattle do. Chicken litter, coming from a bird, is very concentrated in nitrogen and phosphate and is prized for both properties.|$|R

This study involved the use of Dioscorea rotundata Poir, fertilized with NPK (15 : 15 : 15) at rates of 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 kg/ha using a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The crop was planted early (April) 2004 and 2005 in each of the ecological zones (Derived Savanna (Ubiaja), Forest-Savanna transition (Sabongidda-Ora) and Forest (Evboneka)). Based on the objective function of profit maximization, the optimum returns were recorded at a fertilizer <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of 300 kg/ha in the Derived Savanna zone with a gross margin of $ 18, 577. 38, net returns of $ 18, 225. 21 and a benefit-cost ratio of 5. 10. In the Forest-Savanna transition zone, optimum <b>rate</b> of fertilizer <b>application</b> was also at 300 kg/ha with a gross margin of $ 13, 794. 78 and benefitcost ratio of 3. 76.

Our study was carried out with 7 -year-old trees of Coffea arabica L., under a center pivot sprinkler irrigation and fertigation system, with five N rates (0, 200, 400, 600, and 800 kg ha&# 8722; 1) applied to the coffee field. The results of the present study suggest that both N metabolism enzymes, and the content of nitrate and ammonium in coffee were directly related to the phenological cycle. The N fertigation rates are correlated with the N and amino acid contente. Nitrate reductase and urease showed higher activities before anthesis and during grain filling. Glutamine synthetase showed highest activities during rapid grain expansion.

40|$|A {{residential}} lawn care {{survey was}} conducted {{as part of the}} Baltimore Ecosystem Study, a Long-term Ecological Research project funded by the National Science Foundation and collaborating agencies, to estimate the nitrogen input to urban watersheds from lawn care practices. The variability in the fertilizer N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> and the factors affecting the <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> were examined. Results indicated that the annual input of nitrogen from fertilizer is a major component of the urban watershed nitrogen budget and it is both spatially and temporally variable. There is a wide range in the <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of fertilizer N to residential lawns applied by homeowners and by professional lawn care companies. Survey data estimated a mean fertilizer <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of 97. 6 kg N/ha/yr {{with a standard deviation of}} 88. 3 kg N/ha/yr. Analyses suggested that the fertilizer <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> is affected by social economic factors and soil characteristics to include the market value of the house, age of development, soil bulk density and soil nitrogen content. ...|$|R
40|$|Water {{scarcity}} {{and soil}} nitrogen (N) loss are important limitations for agricultural production in semi-arid region especially for rice production. Zeolite (Z) as a soil conditioner {{can be used}} to retrain water and nitrogen in near-surface soil layer in lowland rice production system. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of different <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> of natural zeolite (clinoptilolite) and nitrogen on rice yield, yield components, soil nitrogen, water use, water productivity in a silty clay soil in 2004 and 2005. Zeolite was only applied in the first year. In order to study the long-term and continuous effect of zeolite on the objectives of the study, no zeolite was applied in the second year and the study was conducted on the same land as the first year. Zeolite and N were applied at rates of 0, 2, 4, and 8 Â tÂ ha- 1 and 0, 20, 40, and 80 Â kgÂ ha- 1, respectively in 2004. In 2005, each plot received the same amount of N as received in 2004. It is concluded that by decreasing N <b>application</b> <b>rates,</b> higher Z <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> is needed to improve grain yield. Highest grain yield was obtained at N <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of 80 Â kgÂ ha- 1 and Z <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of 4 Â tÂ ha- 1. Higher grain yield was mostly attributed to lower unfilled grain percentage and higher 1000 -grain weight that were a result of higher N <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> and N retention in soil due to Z application. Nitrogen and Z applications resulted in higher grain protein contents and nitrogen recovery efficiency (NRE). Based on these results and due to higher N retention in soil under Z application, improved grain yield quality, nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), and nitrogen recovery efficiency (NRE) could be obtained at Z <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of 8 Â tÂ ha- 1 and N <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of 80 Â kgÂ ha- 1 or more. However, this was not satisfied for NUE. Moreover, it is found that at higher N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> lower Z <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> are needed to effectively retain soil residual mineral nitrogen. Furthermore, at N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> of 80 Â kgÂ ha- 1 or more, Z application increased soil water retention and resulted in lower seasonal water use and higher water productivity. In general, it was concluded that the effect of Z application in retaining soil N was also effective in the second year.

40|$|Cryoturbated Upper Chalk is a dichotomous porous medium {{wherein the}} intra-fragment {{porosity}} provides water storage and the inter-fragment porosity provides potential pathways for relatively rapid flow near saturation. Chloride tracer movement through 43 cm long and 45 cm diameter undisturbed chalk columns was studied at water <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 3, 1. 0, and 1. 5 cm h(- 1). Microscale heterogeneity in effluent was recorded using a grid collection system consisting of 98 funnel-shaped cells each 3. 5 cm in diameter. The total porosity of the columns was 0. 47 +/- 0. 02 m(3) m(- 3), approximately 13 % of pores were > 15 mu m diameter, and the {{saturated hydraulic conductivity}} was 12. 66 +/- 1. 31 m day(- 1). Although the column remained unsaturated during the leaching even at all <b>application</b> <b>rates,</b> proportionate flow through macropores increased as the <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> decreased. The number of dry cells (with 0 ml of effluent) increased as <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> decreased. Half of the leachate was collected from 15, 19 and 22 cells at 0. 3, 1. 0, 1. 5 cm h(- 1) <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> respectively. Similar breakthrough curves (BTCs) were obtained at all three <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> when plotted {{as a function of}} cumulative drainage, but they were distinctly different when plotted as a function of time. The BTCs indicate that the columns have similar drainage requirement irrespective of <b>application</b> <b>rates,</b> as the rise to the maxima (C/C-o) is almost similar. However, the time required to achieve that leaching requirement varies with <b>application</b> <b>rates,</b> and residence time was less {{in the case of a}} higher <b>application</b> <b>rate.</b> A two-region convection-dispersion model was used to describe the BTCs and fitted well (r(2) = 0. 97 - 0 - 99). There was a linear relationship between dispersion coefficient and pore water velocity (correlation coefficient r = 0. 95). The results demonstrate the microscale heterogeneity of hydrodynamic properties in the Upper Chalk. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

We compared the dynamics of soil microbial biomass C with high (225. 0 kg N hm- 2) and low (150 kg N hm- 2) <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of chemical fertilizer N exposed to the elevated CO 2, O 3, CO 2 plus O 3 and CK after the spring wheat growing season in 2010. The results showed that under elevated CO 2 concentration at the jointing stage, high <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of chemical fertilizer N significantly declined the amount of soil microbial biomass C by 64. 97 %, compared with the low N <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of chemical fertilizer N (p< 0. 01). In treatment with low <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of chemical fertilizer N, elevated O 3 concentration significantly declined the amount of soil microbial biomass C by 52. 49 % (p< 0. 05), compared with CK. In treatment with high <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> of chemical fertilizer N, the interaction of CO 2 and O 3 increased significantly the amount of soil microbial biomass C by 50. 03 % (p< 0. 05), compared with CK.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present research were to studying the NO 3 leaching from soil columns at different NO 3 concentrations and water flux densities and to comparing the computer simulation results using numerical and analytical models with column-experiment data. Three water flux densities (0. 0442, 0. 0265 and 0. 0189 cm min - 1) and NO 3 concentration rates (150, 00 and 600 mg L - 1) were used. The used soil has a loamy sand texture. The {{results indicate that the}} first water <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> (0. 0442 cm min - 1) be able to leach the nitrate from soil columns. The nitrate concentration was differed according the nitrate <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> (71, 1 and 53 mg L - 1, respectively), in which increasing nitrate <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> increased the nitrate concentration in the leachate. The other water <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> did not show a significant leaching of nitrate. Nitrate ion was moved through soil profile {{to the bottom of the}} soil column at the end of experiment for the first water <b>application</b> <b>rate.</b> The maximum nitrate concentration was detected at 29, 7 and 15 cm below soil surface for the three water <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> 0. 0442, 0. 0265 and 0. 0189 cm min - 1, respectively. This indicates that increasing the water <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> resulted in more movement of nitrate ion in soil profile. The numerical model (HYDRUS- 2 D) and analytical model (CXTFIT), successfully predicted NO 3 leaching in the present experiment (r-values between observed and predicted data ranged from 0. 992 to 0. 999). The results are much closed and there is an agreement between the two models. The present column experiment is useful for assessing relative behavior of NO 3 in soil at different water <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> and nitrate concentrations resulted in increasing the movement of nitrate ion out of soil profile into groundwater...|$|R
