2500|$|The first genomic {{sequence}} for {{a representative of}} symbiotic fungi, the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete [...] Laccaria bicolor, has been published. An expansion of several multigene families occurred in this fungus, suggesting that adaptation to symbiosis proceeded by gene duplication. Within lineage-specific genes those coding for symbiosis-regulated secreted proteins showed an up-regulated expression in ectomycorrhizal root tips suggesting {{a role in the}} partner communication. [...] Laccaria bicolor is lacking enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and pectates), preventing the symbiont from degrading host cells during the <b>root</b> <b>colonisation.</b> By contrast, [...] Laccaria bicolor possesses expanded multigene families associated with hydrolysis of bacterial and microfauna polysaccharides and proteins. This genome analysis revealed the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots.|$|E

The bacteria can use plants as an alternative host, where they associate with both the leaves and the <b>roots.</b> <b>Colonisation</b> in the rhizosphere of plants {{is thought to be}} the main habitat for colonisation. Four different plant species, commonly associated with EHEC outbreaks, were infected with EHEC O 157 :H 7 isolates Sakai and TUV 93 - 0 over ten days to assess the colonisation potential of the bacteria in both the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of plants. The rhizosphere was found to sustain a higher population level of bacteria over time in comparison to the phyllosphere, yet both strains were unable to utilize root exudates for growth. Global gene expression changes of EHEC O 157 :H 7 strain Sakai were measured in response to plant extracts such as leaf lysates, root exudates and leaf cell wall polysaccharides from spinach cultivar Amazon and lettuce cultivar Salinas. Microarrays analysis showed a significant change in expression of 17 % of genes on exposure to leaf lysates of spinach. A more specific response was seen to spinach leaf cell wall polysaccharides with only a 1. 5 % change. In contrast, when exposed to lettuce leaf cell wall polysaccharides a higher change of 4. 8 % was seen. Genes that were differentially expressed belonged to multiple functional groups, including metabolism, indicating the utilization of plant-specific polysaccharides. Several areas of further investigation have been determined from this project, including the importance of culturing bacterial strains at a relevant temperature, the proposed lack of the type III secretion system in plant colonization by EHEC O 157 :H 7 and the utilization of plant components for growth and persistence in the plant environment...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} assess whether mycorrhizal propagules that survived fire episodes could serve as in situ inoculum sources, and to analyse the spatial distribution of soil nutrients and mycorrhizal parameters. In a laboratory bioassay, P. pinaster and Q. ilex seedlings were grown on soils from the target sites and <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi was determined.

The low levels of ECM and AM colonisation obtained on the roots of plants grown in soil from Site 1 indicated that the existing mycorrhizal propagules might be insufficient for effective <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> of Q. ilex. Different ECM morphotypes were found in plants grown in soil from the two sites. At Site 2 mycorrhizal parameters were found to be spatially structured, with significant differences in ECM colonisation and soil P concentrations between regions of either side of an existing watercourse.

Like most tropical forest timbers, okoume forms arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Mycorrhizal <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> of okoume in artificial regeneration was investigated on trees planted between 1950 and 1989 in the Kienke Reserve of south Cameroon.

However, {{the factors that}} determine the composition of AM fungal communities in individual plant roots remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that AM fungal communities are simultaneously influenced by environmental conditions, such as light availability, and the photosynthetic capacity of host plant species. Methods We sampled individuals of shade-tolerant and shade-avoidant plant species, growing in the presence and absence of forest canopy, representing conditions of low and high light availability. We recorded photosynthetic parameters, shoot biomass and <b>root</b> AM fungal <b>colonisation</b> of these plant individuals and used 454 -sequencing to characterise AM fungal communities in the roots of these plants.

The composition of AM fungal communities associating with shade-tolerant plants was significantly influenced by canopy status, while a less pronounced difference was observed among shade-avoidant plants. Conclusions We suggest that both environmental conditions and the ability of plant species to exploit available resources determine the dynamics of mutualistic associations between host plant species and AM fungal taxa...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{evidence}} {{suggested that}} nursery inoculation with Trichoderma harzianum and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could reduce deleterious effects of biotic and abiotic stresses and improve seedling quality, fruit yield {{and quality of}} tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). However, studies of their combined inoculation on seedling growth, fruit yield and quality of tomato plants are not well-documented. Experiments were carried out to investigate the combined effect of T. harzianum and AMF on tomato crop performance under various conditions. When combined with a T. harzianum and AMF mixture, seaweed extract from Ecklonia maxiama inhibited AMF <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> of tomato seedlings. Treating seedlings {{with a mixture of}} T. harzianum and AMF reduced the incidence of Verticillium wilt in tomato grown in a nethouse at early season, with negligible effect on fruit yield. Further investigations were initiated to find out whether T. harzianum and AMF were efficient when applied as a mixture or alone, at different inoculation times. Co-inoculation with T. harzianum and AMF (Glomus mosseae) improved seedling growth and development, except when both fungi were simultaneously applied two weeks after sowing. When the seedlings were allowed to grow up until full harvest in a greenhouse, both fungal inoculants increased total yield and marketable yield, but these increases were not significant. Furthermore, inoculation with AMF increased the percentage of extra-large fruit. Field experiments conducted under commercial tomato production confirmed greenhouse studies. Inoculation of tomato with T. harzianum and AMF, either alone or in combination increased early fruit yield (four first harvesting weeks). Throughout the studies, percentage AMF <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> in seedlings and plants remained low, despite nursery inoculation. Field experiments investigated the effects of AMF-inoculated transplants combined with biochar-amended soils on AMF <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> and their resultant effects on overall crop performance and microbial community structure. Biochar had no effect on AMF <b>root</b> <b>colonisation,</b> and also when combined with AMF, it had no influence on tomato productivity. Interestingly, biochar altered the fungal community while AMF might have influenced the bacterial community such as plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria, which are associated with improved plant growth, nutrient uptake and disease control in the rhizosphere. These benefits could contribute to improved yield and fruit quality. In conclusion, although the results were variable, there was a clear indication that T. harzianum and AMF can {{play an important role in}} tomato production.

This perspective, which supports the use of schooling as a development tool has, of course, been challenged.

At the proteome level, changes in protein amounts due to AMF colonisation resulted in 39 differentially accumulated two-dimensional electrophoresis spots in AMF roots relative to control. Out of them, 25 were co-identified in SO 4 <b>roots</b> upon <b>colonisation</b> by Glomus irregulare and Glomus mosseae supporting the existence of conserved plant responses to AM symbiosis in a woody perennial species.

Based on CRD, the effect of temperature on the progress of <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> by AMF was independent of the host plant species. The apparent influence of the host plant species was only due to the species -specific effect of soil temperature on root growth and therefore on AC.

Using CLSM, we observed that ZR 2 - 12 cells form large micro-colonies along the apoplastic spaces of the root. Xylem vessels were colonised by smaller aggregates and single cells, whereas in root tips mainly single cells were present. The colonisation patterns differed strongly between older and younger parts of the roots. PHB production of ZR 2 - 12 (up to 70 % (w/w) of cell dry mass) provided a competitive advantage for rhizosphere colonisation. B. terricola ZR 2 - 12 belongs to the plant-associated Burkholderia cluster with biotechnological potential due to its excellent <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> and plant growth promotion...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes AVO 110 was {{selected}} as an efficient avocado root tip colonizer, displaying antagonism towards Rosellinia necatrix, the causal agent of avocado white root rot. The most likely biocontrol mechanisms used by this strain is competition for niches and nutrients. In fact, AVO 110 is able to colonise competitively the surface of fungal hyphae, using fungal exudates. In a previous study, we used signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) to screen a library of AVO 110 transposon mutants {{for their ability to}} grow in Rosellinia exudates (BM-RE medium). A pool of 26 growth-attenuated mutants (GAM) was identified. In this work, we used the recently obtained draft genome sequence of AVO 110 to analyse the genetic context of the genes affected by the transposon in seven GAM mutants. Among the traits affected, we have identified homologs of an exodeoxyribonuclease, a GGDEF/EAL/PAS protein, a transcriptional regulator, a histidine kinase, a putative enterotoxin, a peptidase and a putative small RNA. Phenotypic characteristics such as biofilm formation, persistence and <b>colonisation</b> of avocado <b>roots</b> and <b>colonisation</b> of fungal hyphae were studied. Mutants affected in the transcriptional regulator and the GGDEF/EAL/PAS proteins were altered in all features analysed when compared to the wild type strain. The remaining mutants presented variations in persistence and colonisation of fungal and root surfaces, except for that affected in a putative enterotoxin, which was only altered in fungal colonisation. Finally, quantitative RT-PCR experiments were performed in BM-RE to evaluate the expression dynamics of these genes {{in the presence of the}} fungal metabolites along the time. Results showed no evident correlation between gene expression and phenotypic behaviour. Comunicación en póster. Universidad de Málaga, Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech.

40|$|ABSTRACT Legumes form mutualistic {{associations}} with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi which increases nutrient availability to the plant. Nodulation is generally restricted to legumes and has co-opted genes {{required for the}} AM symbiosis. As a result, both associations share common genes and have analogous infection strategies, including the early lipochitooligosaccharide (LCO) signals that plants perceive from the symbionts. In order to discover novel genes required for both these symbioses, I used both forward and reverse genetic approaches. A forward genetic screen in Medicago truncatula revealed an H+-ATPase mutant Mtha 1 with a defective arbuscule phenotype. The reverse screen investigated several candidates previously identified as having enhanced expression in the nodule inception mutant during nodulation that were also expressed in AM-colonized roots. Four of these genes were chosen for further study. The first, a novel AM-specific gene, BiFunctional Protein (BFP) has a predicted a role in lipid modification. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BFP was restricted to AM host plants including {{a member of the}} liverworts, Marchantia paleacea. BFP expression during AM interactions in M. truncatula was found to be dependent on the common symbiotic gene DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS 3. AM colonization assays using mutants for BFP in M. truncatula and Oryza sativa were inconclusive. Three CCAAT-Binding Factor transcription factors were also studied (CBF 1, CBF 2 and CBF 3). Promoter-reporter studies revealed that these genes are also expressed during rhizobial infection of wild type plants. While the M. truncatula cbf 1 mutant did not exhibit a consistent nodulation phenotype, mutant analysis for CBF 3, showed it is required for normal infection during <b>root</b> hair <b>colonisation</b> of rhizobia in M. truncatula. Based on these results and a further analysis of expression data and published work, I propose a model in which CBF 3 forms a complex with NF-YA 1 and NF-YC 2 during early responses to LCOs during nodulation...|$|R

In all five soils, the antagonists reached highest population densities in the hypocotyl and the upper 2 cm root section (P. fluorescens B 5 : 5. 2 - 6. 8 log(10) CFU/g plant fresh weight, Bacillus subtilis MBI 600 : 5. 2 - 6. 1 log(10) CFU/g plant fresh weight) and declined to 0 - 3 log(10) CFU below 4 cm <b>root</b> depth. <b>Colonisation</b> by P. fluorescens B 5 down the root was slightly increased in the soils from Craibstone, Magdeburg, and Uelzen compared to the sandy clay loam from Tymbaki.

However, P. fluorescens B 5 reduced Pythium damping-off (measurement after 14 days plant growth) only in three of the five soils (Craibstone, Cruden Bay and Magdeburg). Co-inoculation of B. subtilis MBI 600 increased downward <b>colonisation</b> of the <b>root</b> by P. fluorescens B 5, but not the total population of P. fluorescens B 5 per plant. Bacillus subtilis MBI 600 did not reduce Pythium damping-off in any of the soils nor did it influence the efficiency of co-inoculated P. fluorescens B 5; its population consisted mainly of physiologically inactive spores. In Craibstone soil, pH did not affect population density, distribution along the root or biocontrol activity against P. ultimum of P. fluorescens B 5 or B. subtilis MBI 600...|$|R
40|$|Colonisation by root endophytes can be {{beneficial}} to plants growing on acid, nutrient-poor soils. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can supply herbs with nutrients and may give protection against aluminium toxicity. Two other root colonising fungi, fine endophytes (FE) and dark septate fungi (DSE), are less well known but are potentially of benefit to their host plant. AM fungi are the most prevalent symbionts in herbs at neutral to acidic soil pH. At extremely low pH, fungal growth can be limited and AM colonisation is usually rare. Fine. and dark septate endophytes, on the other hand, have been observed more often under these conditions. In order to relate endophyte colonisation to a gradient in soil pH, we investigated <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> by AM, FE and DSE in Maianthemum bifolium, Galium odoratum, Mercurialis perennis and Stellaria nemorum, {{from a range of}} acidic beech forests. With decreasing pH, colonisation by AM decreased, whereas the other two endophytes increased. AM and FE colonisation were inversely correlated in Maianthemum bifolium. We compared changes in <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> with those in chemical composition of soil and leaf samples and found a positive correlation between leaf magnesium concentrations and the presence of DSE in Galium odoratum. Aluminium concentration in Maianthemum bifolium tended to be lower when FE colonisation was high, suggesting a possible role for the fungi in plant protection against Al. We suggest that FE and DSE may replace AM fungi in herbaceous vegetation at extremely low pH, counteracting some of the negative effects of high soil acidity on plants...|$|E

Funneliformis mosseae (F.m)was cultured under maize with 90 % of <b>root</b> <b>colonisation,</b> and Rhizophagus intraradices(R.i)was cultured under maize with 84 % of root colonization. They are two kinds of AMF with wide {{application}} and strong ability to adapt to the coal mine environment. The tested plant is Amygdalus pedunculata Pall. under field conditions. They were planted in April 2012.

40|$|Plants {{can develop}} an {{enhanced}} defensive capacity {{in response to}} infection by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). This ‘mycorrhiza-induced resistance’ (MIR) provides systemic protection against {{a wide range of}} attackers and shares characteristics with systemic acquired resistance (SAR) after pathogen infection and induced systemic resistance (ISR) following <b>root</b> <b>colonisation</b> by non-pathogenic rhizobacteria. It is commonly assumed that fungal stimulation of the plant immune system is solely responsible for MIR. In this opinion article, we present a novel model of MIR that integrates different aspects of the induced resistance phenomenon. We propose that MIR is a cumulative effect of direct plant responses to mycorrhizal infection and indirect immune responses to ISR-eliciting rhizobacteria in the mycorrhizosphere...|$|E
40|$|Relative {{quantitative}} RT-PCR {{and western}} blotting {{were used to}} investigate the expression of three genes with potentially regulatory functions from the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices in symbiosis with tomato and barley. Standardisation of total RNA per sample and determination of different ratios of plant and fungal RNA in <b>roots</b> as <b>colonisation</b> proceeded were achieved by relative quantitative RT-PCR using universal (NS 1 /NS 21) and organism-specific rRNA primers. In addition, generic primers were designed for amplification of plant or fungal β-tubulin genes and for plant glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes as these have been suggested as useful controls in symbiotic systems. The fungal genes Ginmyc 1 and Ginhb 1 were expressed only in the external mycelium and not in colonised roots at both mRNA and protein levels, with the proteins detected almost exclusively in the insoluble fractions. In contrast, mRNA of Ginmyc 2 was identified in both external and intraradical mycelium. In mycorrhizal roots, Ginmyc 2 and fungal β-tubulin mRNAs increased in proportion to fungal rRNA as colonisation proceeded, suggesting that accumulation reflected intraradical fungal growth. Fungal α-tubulin protein and β-tubulin mRNA both appeared to be more abundantly accumulated in AM hyphae within heavily colonised roots than in external hyphae, relative to fungal rRNA. Tomato GAPDH mRNA accumulation was proportional to tomato rRNA, but accumulation of tomato β-tubulin mRNA was reduced in colonised roots compared to non-mycorrhizal roots. These results provide novel evidence of differential spatial and temporal regulation of AM fungal genes, indicate that the expression of tubulin genes of both plant and fungus may be regulated during colonisation and validate {{the use of multiple}} ‘control’ genes in analysis of mycorrhizal gene expression.

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{an examination}} and {{articulation of the}} colonial dynamics of Settler people, collectives, societies, and nations in the settler colonial northern bloc. It is geographically situated, demonstrating that settler colonialism transforms spaces and claims places in powerful, consistent ways, leaving observable patterns across five centuries and a vast continent. Canadian and American citizens today are revealed to be much like their trans-Atlantic forbears, while even radically-transformative Settler social movements are shown to often leave colonial structures and legacies intact. This project constitutes a preliminary search for libratory, decolonising potentiality within Settler understandings of place, currently situated {{in the framework of}} settler colonialism and other forms of colonising, expansive powers, each possessed of distinct geographical imaginations. The goal of this project is to render visible long-standing dynamics at the <b>root</b> of on-going <b>colonisation,</b> situating collective Settler relationships as the primary location of settler colonisation in the northern bloc. This is not intended as an accusation, but as a creative deconstruction: revealing the intimate workings of settler colonialism and identifying the inherent weaknesses and contradictions in colonial spaces is the necessary first step in fundamental decolonisation of the people and places of the northern bloc...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: An {{increase}} {{in a form}} of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, termed fine endophyte or fine root endophyte (Glomus tenue (Greenall) I. R. Hall), is often observed under extreme environmental conditions. We investigated the influence of host plant species, waterlogging and landscape zone (soil type) on <b>colonisation</b> by fine <b>root</b> endophyte. Methods: <b>Colonisation</b> by AM fungi and fine root endophyte was measured in Lolium rigidum Gaudin (ryegrass) and Lotus subbiflorus Lag. (lotus) sampled from the upper, middle and lower/riparian zones of a sloping pasture. Ryegrass and lotus were then grown in a glasshouse in soil from these three zones: waterlogging was initiated for half the pots from day 43 and colonisation determined 35 days later. Results: In the field, AM fungal colonisation was lowest in the lower zone for ryegrass only. In the glasshouse, waterlogging greatly decreased AM fungal colonisation, {{with the exception of}} lotus in lower zone soil where <b>colonisation</b> by fine <b>root</b> endophyte was prolific. Waterlogging impacts on plant growth were small. Conclusions: Fine root endophyte better withstands the stressful conditions induced by waterlogging than other forms of AM fungi, but this response differs with host plant. Further study of the environmental niche of fine root endophyte is necessary to understand its function under extreme conditions...|$|R
