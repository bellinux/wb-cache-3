40|$|With the {{prohibition}} {{of the use of}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>conductor</b> in Brazil, this material passed to be collected and stored as radioactive waste in the waste deposits of The Brazilian National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN). The majority of these lightning conductor used as radioactive source 241 Am with activity varying of 1 the 5 mCi. In this work are presented preliminary studies by recovering of 241 Am through the electroplating technique, in order to posterior use as sources to portable X-rays fluorescence spectrometer. The 241 Am sources have been removed from lightning conductor and dissolved in acid solution. The solution presented an activity of 0, 6 Ci L- 1. Small amounts of this solution were added to some electrolytes and tested in order to evaluate optimum electrolyte for deposition of 241 Am. It was studied as electrolytes: HNO 3 (0, 2 mol L- 1), NH 4 Cl (5, 0 mol L- 1) and a mixture of KCN and K 2 CO 3 (in the rate of 2, 0 g of each per liter). Yields of up to 90...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulations}} for construction {{in many countries}} impose the connection of <b>lightning</b> <b>conductors</b> to concrete rebars. In the present work {{the effect of this}} connection on the corrosion of rebars was studied in order to avoid connections that accelerate corrosion. In some cases artificial <b>lightning</b> and <b>radioactive</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>conductors</b> were used. It was found that these connections influence the corrosion rate. It depends on the electrical characteristics of the atmosphere that is, on the season and the weather. In most cases the corrosion is accelerated. In some cases the electron flow is inversed, and protection is found. The overall phenomenon for the whole year is an acceleration of the corrosion from 35 to 70 %. The artificial lightning and the use of <b>radioactive</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>conductors</b> also accelerate the corrosion. It follows that the grounding of <b>lightning</b> <b>conductors</b> must be separately made with a network to divide the charge of lightning and should not be connected to the rebars...|$|R
