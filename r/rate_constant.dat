In this contribution we investigate the influence of pectin properties (degree and pattern of methoxylation) and processing conditions (pH 2. 0, 3. 0, 5. 0 and 7. 0; temperatures of 80 up to 110 degrees C) on pectin degradation <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> Pectins with different degrees and patterns of methoxylation were prepared and heated. the extent of acid hydrolysis, P-elimination and demethoxylation was assayed as a function of treatment time. As the degree of methoxylation and pH decreased, beta-elimination <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> decreased while acid hydrolysis <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> increased. Demethoxylation <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> were minimal at pH 3. 0 and increased both at lower and higher pH. Reaction <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> were not considerably influenced by the pattern of methoxylation. All reaction <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> increased with increasing temperature. As P-elimination rates are reduced by competing demethoxylation, both <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> were compared. The ratio of these reaction <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> showed no trend with pH. However, an increase in degree of methoxylation or temperature resulted in a more pronounced increase in P-elimination <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> than in demethoxylation <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a theory of}} the kinetic analysis of patch-clamp data. We assume that channel gating is a Markov process that can be described by a model consisting of n kinetic states and n(n - 1) <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> at each voltage, and that patch-clamp data describe the occupancy of x different conductance levels over time. In general, all the kinetic information {{in a set of}} patch-clamp data is found in either two-dimensional dwell time histograms describing the frequency of observation of sequential dwell times of durations tau 1 and tau 2 (Fredkin, D. R., M. Montal, and J. A. Rice, 1985, Proceedings of the Berkeley Conference in Honor of Jerzy Neyman and Jack Kiefer, vol. 1, 269 - 289) or in three-point joint probability functions describing the probability that a channel is in a given conductance at time t, and at time t + tau 1, and at time t + tau 1 + tau 2. For the special case of channels with a single open state plus multiple closed states, one-dimensional analyses provide all of the kinetic information. Stationary patch-clamp data have information {{that can be used to}} determine H <b>rate</b> <b>constants,</b> where H = n(n - 1) - G and G is the number of intraconductance <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> Thus, to calculate H <b>rate</b> <b>constants,</b> G <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> must be fixed. In general there are multiple sets of G <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> that can be fixed to allow the calculation of H <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> although not every set of G <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> will work. Arbitrary assignment of the G intraconductance <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> equal to zero always provides a solution and the calculation of H <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> Nonstationary patch-clamp data have information for the determination of H <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> at a reference voltage plus n(n - 1) <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> at all test voltages.

40|$|Quantitative {{ion channel}} model {{evaluation}} requires {{the estimation of}} voltage dependent <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> We have tested whether {{a unique set of}} <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> can be reliably extracted from nonstationary macroscopic voltage clamp potassium current data. For many models, the <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> derived independently at different membrane potentials are not unique. Therefore, our approach has been to use the exponential voltage dependence predicted from reaction rate theory (Stevens, C. F. 1978. Biophys. J. 22 : 295 - 306; Eyring, H., S. H. Lin, and S. M. Lin. 1980. Basic Chemical Kinetics. Wiley and Sons, New York) to couple the <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> derived at different membrane potentials. This constrained the solution set of <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> to only those that also obeyed this additional set of equations, which was sufficient to obtain a unique solution. We have tested this approach with data obtained from macroscopic delayed rectifier potassium channel currents in voltage-clamped guinea pig ventricular myocyte membranes. This potassium channel has relatively simple kinetics without an inactivation process and provided a convenient system to determine a globally optimized set of voltage-dependent <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> for a Markov kinetic model. The ability of the fitting algorithm to extract <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> from the macroscopic current data was tested using "data" synthesized from known <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> The simulated data sets were analyzed with the global fitting procedure and the fitted <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> were compared with the <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> used to generate the data. Monte Carlo methods were used to examine the accuracy of the estimated kinetic parameters.

This means that one PSII complex is damaged for every 10-100 million photons that are intercepted.
