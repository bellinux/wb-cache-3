25|$|It {{is caused}} by the {{breathing}} in and retention of asbestos fibers. It usually occurs after high intensity and/or long-term exposure to asbestos (particularly in those individuals working on the production or end-use of products containing asbestos) and is therefore regarded as an occupational lung disease.

25|$|The August 2008 fatal {{incident}} {{was preceded by}} two other deaths involving demolition of the main gantry crane at the shipyard on 26 January 2005. The earlier incident resulted in an OSHA ruling against Testa Corporation of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, including a proposed $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) fine. Following the 2005 collapse, violations involving improper cleanup and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> found in debris left by the accident resulted in a $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) penalty imposed against Testa by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, the T Building {{continued}} to deteriorate, leading Queens Hospital to relocate many services {{out of the}} site. $2 million a year was spent on maintenance and utilities for the building. Renovations to bring the building up to proper conditions were estimated to cost $50 million. This would include the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> in the building. At this time, QHC sought to lease the building to Comunilife, Inc. {{in order to create}} a 251-unit affordable supportive housing complex, which would serve military veterans, people with physical or developmental disabilities, and people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. Patients from QHC and Elmhurst Hospital Center would receive preference in applying for housing in the complex. The plan was opposed by the local community due to fears of increasing crime and disturbances. In January 2014, Queens Community Board 8 (representing Hillcrest) voted to demolish the former Triboro Hospital, in part due to its condition and maintenance costs, but also to prevent the housing plan from moving forward. The decision received opposition from historical preservationists, including 11 architectural conservation groups.|$|E

Following this, she underwent further repair work in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria after she developed engine problems in October 2009. A major overhaul was done on both main engines {{and at the same}} time there were repairs to a corroded deck, renovation of crew cabin areas and also the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> some <b>asbestos.</b> The work was due to be completed by December 2009, but ultimately resulted in the cancellation of much of the first Antarctic season.|$|R
25|$|On August 31, 1991, {{the beach}} was closed again due to the {{presence}} of medical waste, with over 500 items found including needles and medicine vials of the painkiller Nubain. The beach was closed for a single day. Due in part to the reoccurrence of waste on the beach, the park saw declining patronage that year. During that year, a $20 million rehabilitation of the bathhouse began, which included the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>asbestos.</b> The project, however, was not completed, and the bathhouse remained closed and decaying. In 1999, $450,000 from the federal government was earmarked for the rehabilitation of Riis Park, projected to be complete by 2004. By 2001, $4.1 million in additional funds were secured by then-Senators Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer and then Congressman Anthony Weiner, particularly targeted at the bathhouse. One of the early plans for the project was to construct a pool with the $4 million, as hinted in a press release from Senator Schumer, possibly located in the bathhouse. The National Park Service planned to use the money for general renovations. After a preliminary study, the pool plan was cancelled as the pool would lead to a financial deficit. Through 2005, numerous improvements were performed on the bathhouse, with plans to repave the central courtyard. By July 2006, however, the repairs had not been finished.|$|E

50|$|The Finance Tower was {{involved}} in a large-scale renovation between January 1, 2005 and 2008. The plan comes about it back to the office of architects of Maurice Mottle, It involved replacing the old facade with a light blue and white curtain wall, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> all <b>asbestos,</b> the dismantling <b>of</b> the external elevator core and the building of new elevators inside the building. The office space lost by this move is compensated for by a new 11-storey building constructed to the east of the tower. The renovated building provides office space for 4,600 workers, an increase from the 3,200 prior to renovation.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the ban, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used {{in the construction industry}} in thousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> and the material's friable nature. Sprayed coatings, pipe insulation and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> and friable nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by ASTM Standard E 2356–04. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> contaminated buildings is subject to EPA NESHAP and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA's innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the <b>removal</b> and disposal <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> and <b>of</b> substances containing it are covered by the Control <b>of</b> <b>Asbestos</b> Regulations 2006.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of this, St James's {{terminating}} facilities were no longer regularly used. The signal box remained in use until 1990 with the occasional train continuing to terminate at St James to keep the siding tracks usable for emergencies and railway staff familiar with the procedures. In 1985-86, the signal box {{was taken out of}} service for an asbestos abatement project. During this period, train cars allocated for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>asbestos</b> would occupy {{one or the other of}} the dead end sidings, which meant that regular use of those lines by passenger trains was not possible. After the asbestos abatement project was completed, the signal box was returned to service until 1990, when asbestos was discovered in the signal box and the sidings. From that time the signal box was not used, and the signals and siding tracks were eventually removed. The sidings were formally closed on 27 July 1991.|$|R

40|$|Asbestos {{is still}} used in Mongolia {{in the energy}} and {{construction}} sectors, among others. However, limited data is available on asbestos consumption and asbestos-related disease in Mongolia. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present the available information on the importation <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> into Mongolia. We used data on annual asbestos imports between 1996 and 2014 from Mongolian Customs Statistics and the National Council on Toxic and Hazardous Substances Affairs. The uses of this material are also presented with respect to chrysotile alone. Most asbestos is used for construction. Mongolia started using asbestos in the energy and construction industries as thermal insulation in 1961. Asbestos is still allowed for use in Mongolia under the Law on Toxic and Hazards Substances. There are no asbestos mines in Mongolia, and the manufacture of asbestos-containing materials does not take place there. Thus, asbestos is mainly imported from China and Russia. Mongolia used 44, 422 metric tons of asbestos-containing materials between 1996 and 2014. In Mongolia, with the current use <b>of</b> <b>asbestos,</b> there will be a continuing risk of developing asbestos-related diseases from past use, and proper oversight of asbestos-involving activities and the safe <b>removal</b> and disposal <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> must be considered...|$|R
50|$|In 1964, the GDR {{built a new}} Staatsrat or Council of State {{building}} on part of the site, incorporating Liebknecht's balcony in its facade. From 1973 to 1976, {{during the reign of}} Erich Honecker, a large modernist building was built, the Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic), which occupied most of the site of the former Stadtschloss. Shortly before German reunification in October 1990, the Palast der Republik was found to be contaminated with asbestos and was closed to the public. After reunification, the Berlin city government ordered the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>asbestos,</b> a process which was completed by 2003. In November 2003, the German federal government decided to demolish the building and leave the area as parkland pending a decision as to its ultimate future. Demolition started in February 2006 and was completed in 2009. Some former east Germans resented the demolition, especially those for whom the Palace of the Republic had been a place of fond memories, or who felt a sense a dislocation in a post-communist world.|$|R

5000|$|... 759 {{was one of}} the two American built steam {{locomotives}} {{considered by}} Steamtown to be restored to operating condition, the other being Boston & Maine 3713 which was ultimately chosen over 759, most likely due to clearance issues on the turntable (in order for 759 to fit, all of the safety railings that surround the turntable pit in the areas open to visitors have to be removed). In 2010, 759 was among the several steam locomotives in Steamtown's collection to undergo <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> her <b>asbestos</b> insulation. Asbestos was used by railroads and locomotive manufacturers as boiler insulation. In addition to having the asbestos removed, 759 had all new jacketing (cladding in UK terminology) applied as well as having her bell, which had been in storage re-installed. While it is possible for Steamtown restore 759 to operational condition, Steamtown has stated that they have little interest in restoring 759, citing that it is too large for their use and that another Nickel Plate Road 2-8-4, Nickel Plate 765 is already operational. For now 759 sits safely on display out of the elements in Steamtown's roundhouse.|$|R
