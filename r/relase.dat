40|$|This report {{describes}} the immune {{release of a}} new mediator from human peripheral leukocytes, a basophil kallikrein-like activity (BK-A). The release process is initiated by the interaction of antigen on anti-IgE with cell-bound IgE, {{and appears to be}} similar in mechanism to the <b>relase</b> of histamine and other mediators of the immediate hypersensitivity reaction. The dose-response relationships and kinetics of histamine and BK-A release from antigen-challenged peripheral leukocytes are similar. The <b>relase</b> of the BK-A is calcium and temperature dependent, requires metabolic energy, and is controlled by hormone-receptor interactions that influence the cellular level of cyclic AMP, as has been described for other mediators of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. The data indicate that the interaction of BK-A with human plasma kininogen, generates immunoreactive kinin. We conclude that the antigen-IgE interation leads to the release from human basophils of a new mediator, a basophil kallikrein-like activity which may well be a link between reactions of immediate hypersenstivitity and the plasma and/or tissue kinin-generating systems...|$|E

This motivates us to consider an asymptotic de Sitter mode function for reconstruction of initial mode and primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method together with applying recent observational constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data for our parametrized asymptotic initial mode shows some deviation from pure de Sitter or Bunch-Davies mode. Based on Planck 2015 data release the amplitude of scalar perturbations in 68 % confidence level is 10 ^ 9 A_s = 2. 77 ^+ 0. 32 _- 0. 35 and deviation from Bunch-Davies mode is ∼ 0. 03 - 0. 04.

Twenty-five thumbs of 21 patients were <b>relased</b> percutaneously in the polyclinic under local anaesthesia. Steroid injection was performed following the release procedure using the same needle. The thumb function was evaluated by a patient questionnaire, and functional thumb scores (VAS) were calculated in the preoperative and postoperative periods. At the 1  week follow-up, four patients had signs of discomfort and triggering because of incomplete release. These patients underwent open A 1 pulley release. Three superficial tendon lacerations were seen during these open procedures. There were no wound complications or signs of digital nerve or artery injury in any of the patients. The preoperative mean VAS was 26. 62 (18 – 36). This decreased to 2. 57 (0 – 5) at the first postoperative month (P< 0. 001) and to 2. 19 (0 – 3; P< 0. 001) at the sixth month.

For up to 3 h, the NGF levels in the iris did not change significantly. After that, they increased to a maximal level of 350 __+ 30 pg NGF/ iris at 19 h, which is 200 times higher than the in vivo content. Between 20 and 72 h in culture, the NGF level decreased to 130 _+ 10 pg NGF/iris, whereas general protein synthesis did not change during that time period. Maximal rate of NGF production (203 pg NGF/h/iris) was seen between 9 and 12 h in culture. In the medium, NGF levels were first detectable after 6 h. Levels then increased with a time course similar to that seen within the iris, reaching a maximal level of 1, 180 _ 180 pg after 19 h in vitro, and then did not significantly change for up to 48 h. The NGF production of the densely sympathetically innervated dilator was three times higher than that of the predominantly cholinergically innervated sphincter. The NGF production was blocked by inhibitors of messenger RNA synthesis (actinomycin D) and of polyadenylation (9 -~-D-arabinofuranosyladenine) as well as by inhibitors of translation (cycloheximide).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to research {{at the molecular level}} the mechanisms involved in the initiation of mammalian DNA replication. Human WI- 38 cells were synchronized to the G 1 /S border by serum starvation and aphidicolin block. Cells were <b>relased</b> from arrest and followed as they progressed into S phase by microfluorometric analysis. Early replicating DNA was extruded from replication bubbles, purified from the high molecular weight parental DNA and cloned into the NruI site of pBR 322. The recombinant plasmids were surveyed for properties previously associated with origins of replication. In a random sample of 10 human origin enriched sequences (hors) that were analyzed, 5 were capable of autonomous replication in a transient BrdU substitution assay. Two clones contained DNA fragments that migrate anomalously on acrylamide gels suggestive of bent DNA. One clone contained a weak DNA unwinding element as judged by sensitivity to the single strand specific enzyme mung bean nuclease. Primary sequence analyses of five of the hors clones (hors 98, 106, 112, 129 and 133) revealed that they were enriched for the AP 2 -A, NF- 1 related and iron response consensus sequences. The replicating clones also contained potential cruciform structures within 50 bp of an A/T rich region. A DNA binding activity was identified in HeLa nuclear extracts that binds to a sub-fragment of one of the replicating clones (hors 106) by bandshift assays and it was partially purified by DEAE and PC- 11 column chromatography...|$|R

A research has been conducted to observe the parasitism level of various egg parasitoids associated with N. viridula on different stages of soybean plantation. The plant stages used were 4 - 5, 6 - 7, 8 - 9, and 10 - 12 weeks after planting (WAP), with 6 experimental plot for each stage, and 5 plants for each experimental unit. Three pairs of N. viridula adult then were <b>relased</b> onto each plant which was covered by the gauze cage earlier. When egg were laid, the cage was taken out leaving 2 eggs rafts per plant. These N. viridula eggs then were exposed to parasitoid for three days, before taking them all to the laboratory. The observations were done on the parasitized eggs. The result showed that different stages of soybean plants significantly affected the parasitism level of various egg parasitoids, with 26 to 46 % parasitism level. Up to 71. 8 % of parasitize egg successfully became adult parasitoids. There were four different Hymenoptera egg parasitoids found associated with N. viridula, namely Telenomus sp.

Larvae released on the first, second or third hatching nights, on exposure to starvation stress, survive for 3. 8, 2. 3 or 1. 5 days. The swimming speed of larvae released on the first or second night is 1. 0 or 0. 6 cm/sec. Larvae released on the subsequent hatching nights committed nearly 2 times greater number of mistakes per cm distance in the horizontal plane. Since hatching of all developing eggs simultaneously on the first hatching night is possible by means of artificial technique(s), it is possible to “improve” survival rate of decapod larvae...|$|R
40|$|Safety related {{studies on}} the {{accident}} behaviour of the HTR- 500 comprised a total of 8 subsections on HTR safety and served the purpose of making an initial statement about the risk to be expected from this plant concept. The major emphasis of these studies was on accidents with failure of the forced core cooling, so-called core heat-up accidents,because they determine the risk of an HTR of this power size. A mean frequency of approx. 10 $^{- 4 }$ /a was determined for core heat-up accidents; however, in more than 90 % of these cases the reactor pressure vessel only opens momentarily. Only in 1 $^{ 0 }$/ 00 of the cases {{the integrity of the}} pressure vessel liner is lost by additional failure of the liner cooling system and radioactivity is <b>relased</b> into the environment without passing the filters. By failure of the forced cooling system the maximum core temperatures rise to 1700 °C in the pressurized reactor and up to 2550 °C in a depressurized reactor. In either case, however, only a few percent of the core volume are affected. Only in the second case the mean core temperature slightly exceeds the value of 1600 °C, the beginning of increased failure of the fuel particle coating. Core cooling can be restored within 10 h without thermally overloading the cooling systems. Failure of the liner cooling system as a consequence of a core heat-up can be ruled out. Consequently the integrity of the reactor pressure vessel liner is maintained with a functioning liner cooling system. Moreover, the liner cooling system prevents damage within the reactor pressure vessel which could aggravate the accident. Long-term failure of the liner cooling leads to serious core damage after about 4 days and to destruction of the liner and decomposition of the adjoining concrete after more than one week.
