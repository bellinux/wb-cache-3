25|$|After the {{discovery}} of SSRIs the interest for newer antidepressant drugs with broader mechanism of action increased. Venlafaxine (Effexor) was introduced in 1993 as the first drug in the SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) class of antidepressants. SNRIs differ from SSRIs in that they block the re-uptake of both 5-HT and NE. Today SNRIs along with SSRIs are {{the most widely used}} antidepressants. In some studies, SNRIs demonstrated slightly higher antidepressant efficacy than the SSRIs (<b>response</b> <b>rates</b> 63.6% versus 59.3%). There is still controversy whether SNRIs are more efficacious than SSRIs.|$|E
25|$|There is no agreed {{treatment}} protocol. In most {{reported cases}} of ORS the attempted treatment was antidepressants, followed by antipsychotics and various psychotherapies. Little data are available regarding the efficacy of these treatments in ORS, but some suggest that psychotherapy yields {{the highest rate of}} response to treatment, and that antidepressants are more efficacious than antipsychotics (<b>response</b> <b>rates</b> 78%, 55% and 33% respectively). According to one review, 43% of cases which showed overall improvement required more than one treatment approach, and in only 31% did the first administered treatment lead to some improvement.|$|E

25|$|A study {{published}} in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) demonstrated that the magnitude of the placebo effect in clinical trials of depression have been growing over time, while the effect size of tested drugs has remained relatively constant. The authors suggest that one possible explanation for the growing placebo effect in clinical trials is the inclusion of larger number of participants with shorter term, mild, or spontaneously remitting depression as a result of decreasing stigma associated with antidepressant use. Placebo <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> in clinical trials of complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies are significantly lower than those in clinical trials of traditional antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{discussion}} {{as to whether}} achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in The Island of the Colorblind by Oliver Sacks, some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, {{it may be that}} some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low <b>response</b> <b>rates,</b> it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color. One common trait is hemeralopia or blindness in full sun. In patients with achromatopsia, the cone system and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of HPV within the tumour has been realised {{to be an}} important factor for predicting survival since the 1990s. Tumor HPV status is strongly associated with positive therapeutic response and survival compared with HPV-negative cancer, independent of the treatment modality chosen and even after adjustment for stage. While HPV+OPC patients have a number of favourable demographic features compared to HPV-OPC patients, such differences account for only about ten per cent of the survival difference seen between the two groups. <b>Response</b> <b>rates</b> of over 80% are reported in HPV+ cancer and three-year progression free survival has been reported as 75–82% and 45–57%, respectively, for HPV+ and HPV- cancer, and improving over increasing time. It is likely that HPV+OPC is inherently less maligant than HPV-OPC, since patients treated by surgery alone have a better survival after adjustment for stage. In one study, less than 50% of patients with HPV-OPC were still alive after five years, compared to more than 70% with HPV+OPC and an equivalent stage and disease burden.|$|E

These efforts {{resulted}} in a new Customer Survey instrument aligned to the Goals and Objectives of the Strategic Plan. In addition, the instrument {{can be used as}} a diagnostic tool, identifying areas of concern for further investigation or celebrating successes that can be shared among schools sites. Overall, the new survey was designed to provide data to be used in decision-making to improve the chances that all students will achieve at their highest potential. As shown in the Figure 1 in the main paper, of the 186, 951 students surveyed across the district, surveys were received from 158, 816 students, thus the student <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> was 85 %. Of the 13, 680 teachers surveyed across the district, surveys were received from 13, 418 teachers, thus the teacher <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> was 98. 1 %. Last year’s administration of the Customer Survey generated a student <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> of 83. 8 % and a teacher <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> of 85. 4 %, providing evidence of a slight increase in the student <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> and a larger increase in the teacher <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> (Schatten, 2001).

40|$|An {{assumption}} {{inherent in}} the {{theory and practice of}} operant psychology is that <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> is relatively invariant during steady-state procedures. Recent research has refuted this assumption, demonstrating instead that <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> changes in a large and systematic fashion during many steady-state operant procedures. This finding mandates that operant researchers take into account these within-session changes in <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> when designing and conducting research. Because behavioral pharmacologists use operant techniques and principles, these within-session changes in <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> {{must be taken into account}} when conducting behavioral pharmacological research as well. This paper briefly reviews what is known about within-session response patterns and poses the question: Might similar factors contribute to within-session changes in <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> when both drug and nondrug reinforcers are used? Finally, the paper explores some implications of with-in-session changes in <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> for behavioral pharmacology. Behavioral pharmacology is an eclectic field in which practitioners make use of techniques from several traditional areas of psychology. One area to which behavioral pharmacology owes a particularly strong allegiance is the experimental analysis of behavior (i. e., operant psychology...|$|R

2500|$|It was {{previously}} assumed that placebo <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> {{in patients with}} chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are unusually high, [...] "at least 30% to 50%", because of the subjective reporting of symptoms and the fluctuating nature of the condition. According to a meta-analysis and contrary to conventional wisdom, the pooled response rate {{in the placebo group}} was 19.6%, even lower than in some other medical conditions. The authors offer possible explanations for this result: CFS is widely understood to be difficult to treat, which could reduce expectations of improvement. In context of evidence showing placebos do not have powerful clinical effects when compared to no treatment, a low rate of spontaneous remission in CFS could contribute to reduced improvement rates in the placebo group. Intervention type also contributed to the heterogeneity of the response. Low patient and provider expectations regarding psychological treatment may explain particularly low placebo responses to psychiatric treatments.|$|E

2500|$|To {{implement}} his empirical approach, Skinner {{invented the}} operant conditioning chamber, or [...] "Skinner Box", in which {{subjects such as}} pigeons and rats were isolated and could be exposed to carefully controlled stimuli.

[...] Another invention, the cumulative recorder, produced a graphical record from which these <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> could be estimated. These records were the primary data that Skinner and his colleagues used to explore the effects on response rate of various reinforcement schedules. A reinforcement schedule may be defined as [...] "any procedure that delivers reinforcement to an organism according to some well-defined rule". The effects of schedules became, in turn, the basic findings from which Skinner developed his account of operant conditioning. He also drew on many less formal observations of human and animal behavior.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cumulative}} recorder makes a pen-and-ink {{record of}} simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it {{for use with}} the Operant chamber as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck. [...] In this device, {{a sheet of paper}} gradually unrolls over a cylinder. [...] Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting ink line graphically displays the rate of the response; for example, rapid responses yield a steeply sloping line on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use {{with the advent of the}} laboratory computer. [...] Skinner's major experimental exploration of <b>response</b> <b>rates,</b> presented in his book with C. B.
