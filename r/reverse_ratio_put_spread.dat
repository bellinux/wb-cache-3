40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} focused on trading stocks and {{improvement}} of long and short positions in case of negative stock's price development. For this purpose, we use Vertical Ratio Call <b>Spread</b> and Vertical <b>Ratio</b> <b>Put</b> <b>Spread</b> option strategies. We also show in theory and in practice as well the ways of creating these option strategies and their usage for spreading the profit interval for long and short positions open, and without any additional costs...|$|R
50|$|If {{the bull}} <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> is done so {{that both the}} sold and bought put expire on the same day, it is a {{vertical}} credit <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many options {{strategies}} are built around spreads and combinations of spreads. For example, a bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> {{is basically a}} bull spread that is also a credit spread while the iron butterfly {{can be broken down}} into a combination of a bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> and a bear call spread.|$|R
50|$|A bearish {{debit spread}} can be {{constructed}} using puts. See bear <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R
30|$|Next we {{are going}} to deduce another form of <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> Young’s {{inequality}} by virtue of inequality (1.13).|$|R
50|$|Bear call <b>spread</b> {{and bear}} <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are bearish {{vertical}} spreads constructed using calls and puts respectively.|$|R
50|$|Bull call <b>spread</b> and bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are bullish {{vertical}} spreads constructed using {{calls and}} puts respectively.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{gain and}} loss {{potential}} {{are the same}} for call and <b>put</b> <b>spreads.</b> Note that net credit = difference in premiums.|$|R
5000|$|A bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> {{is simply}} the lower side of a short iron condor and has {{virtually}} identical initial and maintenance margin requirements.|$|R
50|$|Any {{spread that}} is {{constructed}} using calls can {{be referred to}} as a call <b>spread,</b> while a <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> is constructed using put options.|$|R
5000|$|Iron condor - the {{simultaneous}} buying of a <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> and a call spread {{with the same}} expiration and four different strikes. An iron condor {{can be thought of}} as selling a strangle instead of buying and also limiting your risk on both the call side and put side by building a bull <b>put</b> vertical <b>spread</b> and a bear call vertical spread; ...|$|R
5000|$|A bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> is {{a limited}} profit, limited risk options trading {{strategy}} {{that can be used}} when the options trader is moderately bearish on the underlying security. It is entered by: ...|$|R
5000|$|A long box-spread can {{be viewed}} as a long bull call spread at one pair of strike prices, [...] and , plus a long bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> at the same pair of strike prices.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the risks}} involved, put writing without holding {{covering}} cash is rarely used alone. Investors often sell puts {{in combination with}} other options contracts such as for <b>put</b> <b>spreads</b> to limit downside risk.|$|R
50|$|To {{find the}} credit spread {{breakeven}} points for call spreads, the net premium {{is added to}} the lower strike price. For <b>put</b> <b>spreads,</b> the net premium is subtracted from the higher strike price to breakeven.|$|R
50|$|Because of put-call parity, a {{bear spread}} can be {{constructed}} using either put options or call options. If constructed using calls, it is a bear call spread. If constructed using puts, it is a bear <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{box spread}} {{consists}} of a bull call spread and a bear <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b> The calls and puts have the same expiration date. The resulting portfolio is delta neutral. For example, a 40-50 January 2010 box consists of: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{backspread}} is {{the converse}} strategy to the ratio spread {{and is also}} known as <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> spread. Using calls, a bullish strategy known as the call backspread can be constructed and with puts, a strategy known as the put backspread can be constructed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{position}} is {{so named because}} of {{the shape of the}} profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the [...] "body" [...] and the outer options as the [...] "wings". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this {{position is}} constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> with a bear call spread. The combination of these two credit spreads makes the long iron condor (and the long iron butterfly) a credit spread, {{despite the fact that it}} is [...] "long." [...] This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a bull call spread with a bear call spread or a bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> with a bear <b>put</b> <b>spread.</b> Because the long, plain Condor (and Butterfly) combine a debit spread with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).|$|R
50|$|In dentistry, Ante's law {{refers to}} a group of {{proposals}} related to crown-to-root <b>ratio</b> <b>put</b> forth by Irwin H. Ante in a thesis paper he wrote in 1926.|$|R
30|$|These inequalities proved in Theorem  3.1 - 3.3 are all {{the reverse}} forms of the {{inequality}} (1.4). It {{is easy to see}} that the right-hand side of these inequalities can not be compared with each other, but they are indeed new versions of <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> arithmetic-harmonic mean inequality.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we employ {{iteration}} on operator {{version of}} the famous Young inequality and obtain more arithmetic-geometric mean inequalities and the reverse versions for positive operators. Concretely, we obtain refined Young inequalities with the Kantorovich constant, the <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> type and difference type inequalities for arithmetic-geometric operator mean under different conditions.|$|R
50|$|In practice, the {{epicyclic}} gear may {{be set to}} the lowest possible ratio of the CVT, if reversing is not needed or is handled through other means. Reversing can be incorporated by setting the {{epicyclic gear}} ratio somewhat higher than the lowest ratio of the CVT, providing a range of <b>reverse</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Friday's first {{qualifying}} session {{saw only}} a handful of drivers venture out onto a wet race track. When Austrian Otto Stuppacher went out first, there were still streams of water running across in places. McLaren manager Teddy Mayer said [...] "The drivers finished in <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> to the proportion of their IQs." ...|$|R
50|$|Moderately bearish' options traders usually set {{a target}} {{price for the}} {{expected}} decline and utilize bear spreads to reduce cost. While maximum profit is capped for these strategies, they usually cost less to employ. The bear call spread and the bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are common examples of moderately bearish strategies.|$|R
50|$|The {{potential}} {{loss of a}} long iron condor {{is the difference between}} the strikes on either the call <b>spread</b> or the <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> (whichever is greater if it is not balanced) multiplied by the contract size (typically 100 or 1000 shares of the underlying instrument), less the net credit received.|$|R
50|$|Traders often scan price {{charts and}} use {{technical}} analysis to find stocks that are oversold (have fallen sharply in price and perhaps {{due for a}} rebound) as candidates for bullish <b>put</b> <b>spreads.</b> Additionally, writing (selling) credit spreads with higher current IV (implied volatility) 50% and higher, will increase {{the prospects for a}} profitable trade.|$|R
50|$|ABC Bull <b>Put</b> Credit <b>Spread</b> Return = (1 - 0.5)/100-90-(1-0.5) = 5.26%.|$|R
50|$|Stock {{can make}} steep {{downward}} moves. Moderately bearish options traders usually set a target {{price for the}} expected decline and utilize bear spreads to reduce cost. This strategy can have unlimited amount of profit and limited risk when done correctly. The bear call spread and the bear <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are common examples of moderately bearish strategies.|$|R
50|$|A bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> is {{constructed}} by selling higher striking in-the-money put options and buying {{the same number}} of lower striking out-of-the-money put options on the same underlying security with the same expiration date. The options trader employing this strategy hopes that the price of the underlying security goes up far enough such that the written put options expire worthless.|$|R
40|$|A {{conspicuous}} {{amount of}} aggregate tail risk {{is missing from}} the price of financial sector crash insurance during the 2007 - 2009 crisis. The difference in costs of out-of-the-money put options for individual banks, and puts on the financial sector index, increases fourfold from its pre-crisis level. At the same time, correlations among bank stocks surge, suggesting the high <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> cannot {{be attributed to a}} relative increase in idiosyncratic risk. We show that this phenomenon is unique to the financial sector, that it cannot be explained by observed risk dynamics (volatilities and correlations), and that illiquidity and no-arbitrage violations are unlikely culprits. Instead, we provide evidence that a collective government guarantee for the financial sector lowers index put prices far more than those of individual banks, explaining the divergence in the basket-index spread. By embedding a bailout in the standard one-factor option pricing model, we can closely replicate observed <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> dynamics. During the crisis, the spread responds acutely to government intervention announcements. ...|$|R
40|$|Chemoselective {{addition}} of (trifluoromethyl) trimethylsilane to the C=N group of N-(tert-butyl) -alpha-iminoketones {{in the presence}} of a fluoride ion as a catalyst was achieved under acidic conditions. Subsequent diastereoselective reductions of the obtained alpha-amino-alpha-(trifluoromethyl) ketones led to beta-amino-beta-(trifluoromethyl) alcohols in very good yields and high diastereoselectivities. Different reducing agents were tested; the reduction performed with LiAlH 4 and Raney-Ni, respectively, afforded the desired diastereoisomers in a <b>reversed</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|R
40|$|Contrary to the {{moderate}} ballistic advantage of Al 2 O 3 ceramics over MgAl 2 O 4 polycrystals, {{the present study}} shows a <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> of the ballistic strength of alumina and spinel single crystals: Spinel single crystals outperform sapphire and exhibit a similarly high stability as submicrometer Al 2 O 3 ceramics. The results correlate with different cleavage of single crystalline spinel and sapphire, changing the fragmentation on ballistic impact...|$|R

50|$|Moderately bullish options traders usually set {{a target}} {{price for the}} bull run and utilize bull spreads to reduce cost. (It does not reduce risk because the options can still expire worthless.) While maximum profit is capped for these strategies, they usually cost less to employ for a given nominal amount of exposure. The bull call spread and the bull <b>put</b> <b>spread</b> are common {{examples}} of moderately bullish strategies.|$|R
30|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a method to obtain more arithmetic-geometric mean inequalities and the reverse version for {{positive}} operators. In Section  2, we introduce the main lemmas. In Section  3, utilizing the refined Young inequality and iteration method, we establish some weighted arithmetic-geometric mean inequality for two positive operators. We also obtain <b>reverse</b> <b>ratio</b> type and difference type inequalities for positive operators by means of iteration under different conditions in Section  4 and Section  5, respectively.|$|R
