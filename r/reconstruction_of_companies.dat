Eventually Captain Borlase, who had retired in 1919, {{proposed}} a new investment by the old shareholders and negotiated new terms with the landowners. Shareholders agreed to a <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>company</b> which involved allotting four new £1 ordinary shares {{for each of the}} 7,680 old shares, and issuing 4,280 preference shares to raise money needed for development of the mine. The new 1923 Greenside Mining Company Ltd. came into being, and the landowners agreed a dead rent of £225 per year for five years, with a reduced scale of royalties payable on top of the rent after that time.|$|R

Loaded ore trucks ran from the mine down to the mill, while horses hauled the empty trucks back up. Coolgarra's output of tin rose in the years 1901 to 1903, the Alhambra alone producing 20,000 pounds worth of tin in that period. The community had grown from 93 in 1893 to close to 250 in 1903. In that year 8,650 tons of ore were raised and treated but by October 1903, work was suspended pending financial <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>company</b> known as Coolgarra Tin Mines Amalgamated. At this stage also, mines were beginning to produce a lower grade ore, which created an overall slow-down.|$|R

In 1887 it went into voluntary liquidation but this was reversed in 1890 after arrangements had been made with the creditors.

A winding-up order was made in June 1892 but in September the company resolved to go into voluntary liquidation. The company continued to trade while arrangements were made for the disposal of its assets.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a strategic plan}} for a private manufacturing firm in China. The study uses the strategy management process of Barney (2011) as a framework to practice a strategy <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> URANUS, a Chinese hydraulic manufacturer that has twenty years of operation. The process includes a <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>company’s</b> mission and objective statements, external analysis of the firm’s competing environment, internal analysis of the firm’s strengths and weaknesses, discussion of organizational change, and a discussion of strategy implementation. The external and internal analyses use several well-known strategic tools, including five force, VRIO framework, Value Chain, and McKinsey 7 S. The discussion of strategy implementation {{is based on the}} balanced scorecard method. Evidence used in this paper is drawn from reports on the Chinese hydraulic and metallurgy industry, data from competitors’ websites, annual reports of competitors, and an employee survey of URANUS. This paper is intended to create a template for the strategy management process for URANUS. More in-depth analysis {{can be applied to the}} template to better understand the competing environment of the industry, and the sustainable competencies <b>of</b> the <b>company.</b> Discussions <b>of</b> strategic choices and strategy implementation are based on opinions from senior members <b>of</b> the <b>company.</b> Everyone from the management team could be involved in the strategy management process to create a better understanding of the new strategy among the entire company...|$|R

This was done without the permission of the WHLR (1964) Ltd Board and led to another stormy Board meeting, held in Denton, Manchester on 17 September.

500|$|The Hansard Union case, {{far from}} {{damaging}} Bottomley's reputation, {{had left a}} general impression {{that he was a}} financial genius. He avoided the stigma of bankruptcy by arranging a scheme of repayment with his creditors, and swiftly embarked on a new career promoting Western Australian gold mining shares. The discovery of gold in Kalgoorlie and adjoining areas in the early 1890s had created an easily exploitable investment boom; as Bottomley's biographer Alan Hyman observes, [...] "A hole in the ground... could be boosted into a very promising gold-mine, and investors only found that they had backed a loser after the mine had been floated as a public company and they had paid hard cash for their shares". By 1897, through skilful exploitation of demand and by frequent <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> failing <b>companies,</b> Bottomley had accumulated a considerable personal fortune. It was, the historian A.J.A. Morris asserts, [...] "a truly amazing success story, the product of reckless audacity, astonishing energy, and extreme good fortune". Bottomley won plaudits when he announced that he would pay £250,000 to the creditors of the Hansard Union; the bulk of this payment was offered in shares in one or other of his mining promotions.|$|R

An initial creditors meeting was held on 23 July 1984, but was adjourned, when the Department of Transport announced it would sell its debentures (some 42% of the total) to the highest bidder. These were purchased in January 1985 by the West Consortium (WestCo) - a separate small group of WHLR (1964) Ltd members, with similar views to TCL.|$|R

40|$|The Showa Iron & Steel Works (the Anshan Iron & Steel Co. {{after the}} war) lost over 60 % of its steel-smelting {{facility}} when the Red Army (The Soviet Army) confiscated the equipment <b>of</b> the <b>company.</b> One <b>of</b> its two steel-smelting factories was completely destroyed. The production capacity fell down from 1, 330, 000 tons / year to 500, 000 tons / year. The AISC, however, recovered its maximum pre-war level in 1952 - 53. The output of steel ingot was 843, 000 in 1943, 770, 000 in 1952, and 976, 000 in 1953. This paper {{aims to examine}} {{the reason why the}} operation <b>of</b> the <b>company</b> recovered so quickly in spite of its serious war damage. The factors which enabled the company to rebuild its production were as follows: (1) the remaining equipment of the first steel-smelting factory; (2) highly educated and well trained Japanese engineers; (3) documents of SISW concerning the operation of its equipment; (4) flexible leadership of the AISC; (5) strong motivation of Chinese engineers and Chinese workers. Technical knowledge and experience were quite important for the AISC, especially when it started its operation. Some parts ofthe first steel-smelting factory was much improved by the Chinese engineers, using the then existing documents of SISW. A conversion of preliminary smelting furnaces to open hearth furnaces was the most successful example. Chinese engineers bravely tried an un-experienced method in the face of Japanese engineers' warning, considering the new circumstances for steel production. Unbelievable hard work of Chinese engineers and workers sustained those process. All of these factors were necessary to accomplish the rapid <b>reconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>company...</b>|$|R
