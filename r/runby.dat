It was a major event featuring all of their steam locomotive, some historic diesel locomotives as well as rolling stock and many more rail-related activities. 6325 was the star of the show; first it was parked for display then it was coupled to the passenger train for several one-hour train rides throughout the day. Then at 5 pm, it pulled a special 3-hour excursion to the OHCR Morgan Run steam shops for tours. It was operated on this schedule for all three days of the event. For the rest of the year, it pulled regular tourist trains. It hasn't been fired since then due to Ohio Central's cease in steam train operations until 2006 when 1293 was fired up for some special events away from OHCR. As of 2008, 6325 is undergoing roller bearing repairs due to recent inspections.|$|R

40|$|Aims: The overall aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{increase}} knowledge about how patients with asthma rate {{their health and}} investigate if we can improve asthma management, with focus on asthma as a chronic inflammatory disease, by use of measurement of the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) in monitoring of asthma in primary health care. Methods: Study I included data from a public health questionnaire, which was sent to 8, 200 persons (age > 18 years) randomly selected from the population register in Stockholm County. After two reminders, 5, 355 persons had responded (67. 5 %). Study II was a longitudinal, non-controlled study. Twenty patients with physician-diagnosed atopic asthma and perennial asthma symptoms (age 18 - 50 years) were consecutively recruited from <b>Runby</b> primary health care centre and examined four times during eight weeks (baseline, 2, 4 and 8 weeks). Data for study III and IV were collected in a randomised, controlled study, conducted at 17 primary health care centres {{in the middle and}} south of Sweden. A total of 187 non-smoking participants with physician-diagnosed asthma, verified perennial allergy and ongoing inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment (age 18 – 64 years) were randomised to FENO-guided treatment or usual care and were followed up for five visits during one year. Results: Respondents with asthma in study I had approximately three times higher odds of fair/poor self-rated health (SRH) than those in the corresponding sex and age groups who did not have asthma, excepting younger women (18 – 44 years). SRH was associated at least as strong as quality of life to asthma. Study II showed a significant correlation between FENO and IgE-antibody levels against perennial allergens at baseline (r = 0. 47, p = 0. 04), which disappeared after a step-up in ICS treatment. Nine patients had persistently elevated FENO at last visit (mean 35 ppb vs. 16 ppb). This group was more frequently exposed to relevant allergens or colds (89 % vs. 27 %, p 18 years and women > 45 years with asthma score SRH worse compared with people in corresponding sex and age groups without asthma, which indicates {{that there is a need}} to improve asthma management. Exposure to relevant allergens, and type and degree of sensitisa-tion, are important factors to consider when assessing the FENO value. Optimised anti-inflammatory treatment with ICS and LTRA in asthma patients with ongoing treatment at baseline resulted in reduced total and specific IgE levels which were unrelated to the degree of allergen exposure. Using FENO to guide anti-inflammatory treatment within primary care significantly improved asthma symptom control and reduced exacerbation rate in adults with atopic asthma without increasing overall ICS use. FENO-guided anti-inflammatory treatment appears useful to improve the management of patients with atopic asthma...|$|E

Rapporten redovisar mätresultat från de båda nationella övervakningsnäten EMEP och Luft- och nederbördskemiska nätet. I rapporten redovisas även de spridningsoch depositionsberäkningar som gjorts med Sverigemodellen för 1997 och 1998. Samtliga mätningar drivs av IVL medan modellberäkningarna med Sverigemodellen utförs av SMHI. Verksamheten finansieras av Miljöövervakningsenheten vid Naturvårdsverket. Measurements of the {{composition}} of air and precipitation in background areas inSweden during 1997, 1998 and 1999 are presented in the report. Results from twonational networks, EMEP and the Swedish Precipitation Chemistry Network, both <b>runby</b> IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, are compiled and evaluated. Included in the presentation are also model calculations of dispersion and depositionof sulphur- and nitrogen compounds over Sweden. The modelling is based onmonitoring results from 1997 and the calculations have been made using theMATCH-Sweden modelling system developed by SMHI, Swedish Meteorologicaland Hydrological Institute. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency financesthe activities. The monitoring programmes during the three years have included daily sampling ofsulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particle bound sulphate in air at six stations 1997 and five stations 1998 and 1999. Daily measurements of soot, total-nitrate andtotal-ammonium have been performed at four stations. Monthly sampling of sulphurdioxide and nitrogen dioxide has been made at 12 stations 1997 and 1998 and at 13 stations 1999. Ozone concentrations in ground-level air have been monitored at sixstations. Measurements of mercury in air have been performed at two stationsregarding total gaseous mercury (TGM) and particle bound mercury. The measurements of sulphur and nitrogen compounds in air displayed a decreasinggradient from south to north. Generally, the higher concentrations of sulphur dioxide, sulphate, soot and nitrogen dioxide are found during winter, while high levels ofozone are registered during spring or early summer. The remaining compounds showa more uniform concentration during the seasons. The annual averages werecomparable to, or lower, than previous years. The highest annual average air concentration of ground-level ozone was, as previousyears, registered in Esrange. Ozone levels above 180 μg/m 3 were not registeredduring the period. AOT 40 values were on a comparable level with previous years,except for southern Sweden 1998 where AOT 40 values were unusually low. Daily sampling of precipitation using a wet-only sampler has been made at onestation and weekly sampling at three stations. At nearly 30 stations, monthly samplingusing bulk-samplers was carried out. The precipitation samples were analysed withrespect to pH, sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, sodiumand potassium. At four stations sampling of precipitation for analysis of heavy metals,total-mercury and methyl-mercury was made. The components in precipitation generally showed a decreasing gradient from southto north. The concentration of sulphate has decreased somewhat compared to previousyears. The annual averages of pH showed higher values in northern Sweden than inthe south. The pH values were slightly higher throughout the country than in earlieryears. The concentrations in precipitation and the deposition of heavy metals and mercury generally showed lower values in northern and higher values in southern Sweden. The MATCH-Sweden model is a three-dimensional Eulerian atmospheric dispersionmodel, which is used for calculation of dispersion and deposition of air pollutantsover Sweden. This model system also includes a method for data assimilation ofmeasured concentrations in air and precipitation. In this report only some fewexamples of calculated annual mean concentrations and annual deposition maps for 1997 and 1998 are presented for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen. The MATCH-Sweden model has also been used to estimate air pollution budgets forSweden for the years 1997 and 1998. The Swedish net import of air pollutants issubstantial for sulphur and NHx-nitrogen. The Swedish contribution to depositionover Sweden is about 7 % for sulphur, 11 % for NOx-nitrogen and 20 % for NHxnitrogen. MATCH-Sweden results show somewhat larger deposition values than theEMEP model over Sweden for sulphur and NOx-nitrogen. For NHx-nitrogen thevalues are much larger, especially in Northern Sweden where the MATCH-Swedenvalues are 2 - 3 {{times larger than the}} EMEP model...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: River {{discharge}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} important hydrology factors has a vital role in physical, ecological, social and economic processes. So, accurate and reliable prediction and estimation of river discharge have been widely considered by many researchers in different fields such as surface water management, design of hydraulic structures, flood control and ecological studies in spetialand temporal scale. Therefore, in last decades different techniques for short-term and long-term estimation of hourly, daily, monthly and annual discharge have been developed for many years. However, short-term estimation models are less sophisticated and more accurate. Various global and local algorithms have been widely used to estimate hydrologic variables. The current study effort to use Lazy Learning approach to evaluate the adequacy of input data in order to follow the variation of discharge and also simulate next-day discharge in Talar River in KasilianBasinwhere is located in north of Iran with an area of 66. 75 km 2. Lazy learning is a local linear modelling approach in which generalization beyond the training data is delayed until a query is made to the system, as opposed to in eager learning, where the system tries to generalize the training data before receiving queries Materials and Methods: The current study was conducted in Kasilian Basin, where is located in north of Iran with an area of 66. 75 km 2. The main river of this basin joins to Talar River near Valicbon village and then exit from the watershed. Hydrometric station located near Valicbon village is equipped with Parshall flume and Limnogragh which can record river discharge of about 20 cubic meters per second. In this study, daily data of discharge recorded in Valicbon station related to 2002 to 2012 was used to estimate the discharge of 19 September 2012. The mean annual discharge of considered river was also calculated by using available data about 0. 441 cubic meters per second. To estimate the discharge of considered day, three methods of constant, linear and quadratic functionscontrollers based on the local linearization provided by the lazy learning algorithm were considered. Lazy learning is a memory-based linear technique for local modeling approach which is reported as a high-efficient algorithm for simulating variables with low input data. The series of input data was categorized into previous 6, 8, 10, 15 and 20 days, 1 and 2 months, 1, 2 and 3 seasons and also 1 and 2 years to evaluate which series is appropriately enough to predict next-day discharge inthe river. Then, mean absolute error and root-mean square error were calculated for all series and modelsin order to find the best estimator model and the most appropriate series of input data. Results: Results showed that constant and linear model had the minimum root-mean square error of 0. 001 and 0. 057 respectivelywith previous 60 days’ data series. Whilethe quadratic model had its best estimation with previous 2 season data series with the minimum root-mean square error of 0. 059. The result indicated that the more input data increase, the best quadratic model estimate until 60 days. But after 60 days, estimation error gradually increased. Consequently, not more data but adequate areneeded for accurate estimation. Also, RMSE in linear model had less fluctuation and therefore less sensitivity compared with other models. And quadratic model had less fluctuation and sensitivity to neighborhoods. Also, according to results, the more variation in each period increase, the better estimation is accrued by lazy learning algorithm. Hence, it was expected that next-day discharge prediction in low-water period needs longer data series than high-water period. Conclusion: Regarding to thousands of prepared training models, constant model with previous 60 days’ data and minimum error of 0. 0001 was selected as the most accurate estimatefor next-day river discharge in Talar River. Results showed that despite of some limitation and demerits, the local Lazy Learning algorithm has significant efficiency in time series simulating. Although the accuracy of simulation increase with more input data, but this algorithm can <b>runby</b> at least 5 training data. However we find lazy learning to be the best performing approach on average goodness indicators (such as mean absolute error and Root-mean square error). On the other hand, the lazy learning predictor can be quickly developed and easily kept up-to-date by adding new data to its database. Also, it does not face with overfitting problems which are common in global modeling approaches. According to some noteworthy features of lazy learning noticed in this regards, this approach will have good performance for time-series studies...|$|E
