50|$|The {{isentropic}} {{efficiency of}} scroll compressors is {{slightly higher than}} that of a typical <b>reciprocating</b> <b>compressor</b> when the compressor is designed to operate near one selected rating point.

However, the efficiency of a scroll compressor that does not have a discharge valve begins to decrease as compared to the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>compressor</b> at higher pressure ratio operation. This is a result of under-compression losses that occur at high pressure ratio operation of the positive displacement compressors that do not have a dynamic discharge valve.|$|E

Despite the traditional approach for defining noise requirements focused on steady-state sound power levels, the transient noise is becoming {{a key factor in}} defining sound quality specification. Variable speed compressor technologies lead to a significant advantage on this aspect since in standard operation conditions the compressor runs at relatively low speeds for most of the time.
