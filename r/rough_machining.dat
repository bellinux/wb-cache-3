Plunge milling is very good method for <b>rough</b> <b>machining</b> process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling. The cutting force and machine stability both are influenced by machining parameters. Frequency domain model can be used to estimate the machining stability.|$|E

When uncontrolled, chatter leaves a <b>rough</b> <b>machined</b> surface, accelerates wear of the cutter and creates unacceptably loud noise levels. A conventional approach to suppress chatter is to slow the waste removal rate. Such an action is usually successful to avoid chatter, but causes increased production time and cost.

30|$|Wire Electrical {{discharge}} machining (WEDM) has higher capability for cutting complex shapes with high precision for very hard materials without using {{high cost of}} cutting tools. During the WEDM process, the wire behaves like a metal string, straightened by two axial pulling forces and deformed laterally by a sum of forces from the discharge process. Major forces acting on the wire can be classified into three categories. The first is a tensile force, pulling the wire from both sides in axial direction and keeping it straight. The second is the dielectric flushing force that comes from circulation of the dielectric fluid in the machining area. The third category consists of forces of different kinds resulting from sparking and discharging. Large amplitude of wire vibration leads to large kerf widths, low shape accuracies, <b>rough</b> <b>machined</b> surfaces, low cutting speeds and high risk of wire breakage. Such tendencies for poor machining performance due to wire instability behavior appear with thinner wires.|$|R

However, S. epidermidis adhesion to modified PEEK was less than to unmodified PEEK in the post-operative model.
