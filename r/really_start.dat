25|$|The storyline between Hijo de Pirata and Factor did not <b>really</b> <b>start</b> {{until the}} fall of 2012, when Factor lost the Rey del Ring {{championship}} to Hijo de Pirata. He later regained the Rey del Ring title as well as won the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship from Hijo de Pirata. The two also had several heated exchanges in the 2012 El Castillo del Terror Steel cage match, but neither gained a definitive advantage over the other in that match. The three storylines were tied together through a match in mid-November where Factor successfully defended the Rey del Ring title against Hijo de Máscara Año 2000. Factor was forced by the wrestling commission to have Oficial 911 in his corner while Hijo de Máscara had Cien Caras, Jr. in his corner. Following the title match all the involved participants as well as Hijo de Pirata fought, leading to the various participants challenging the others to put their mask {{on the line in}} a Luchas de Apuestas or bet match.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the AWA, Jannetty and Michaels were {{contacted}} by WWF owner Vince McMahon informing them {{that he was willing}} to bring them back if they were able to be more professional this time round. By the end of May the team was working for the WWF under the shortened name The Rockers. They officially made their television debut on the June 18, 1988 edition of WWF Superstars of Wrestling in a squash match. The Rockers made their pay-per-view (PPV) debut at the 1988 Survivor Series as part of the 10 team tag match. They eliminated The Bolsheviks from the match before being eliminated by a double-disqualification in a brawl with the Brain Busters. The brawl between The Rockers and The Brain Busters led to a match taped for WWF Superstars of Wrestling where both teams were disqualified once again, this time before the match could <b>really</b> <b>start.</b> This led to a series of house show matches between the two teams, a series of matches that drew rave reviews from the fans. One match in particular on January 23, 1989 was rated as one of the 50 greatest matches in the PWI 10th year anniversary issue. The Brain Busters narrowly defeated The Rockers, as Anderson held down Marty Jannetty's leg as Blanchard pinned him. The feud continued to rage on as they clashed at Saturday's Night Main Event in a match that saw both teams counted out for brawling on the floor.|$|E

500|$|MGM's {{special edition}} of the 1981 film was not {{released}} until 2003 because the original negative had disappeared. [...] The workprint containing deleted scenes finally {{turned up in the}} Hutchinson, Kansas salt mine film depository. [...] The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: [...] "After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't <b>really</b> <b>start</b> until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there." [...] The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.|$|E

I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E
500|$|Her family made a {{down payment}} on their own home in Humboldt Park, a {{predominantly}} Puerto Rican neighborhood on Chicago's West Side when she was eleven years old. This neighborhood and its characters would later become the inspiration for Cisneros's novel The House on Mango Street. For high school, Cisneros attended Josephinum Academy, a small Catholic all-girls school. Here she found an ally in a high-school teacher who helped her to write poems about the Vietnam War. Although Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten, with her teacher's encouragement she became known for her writing throughout her high-school years. In high school she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor, but, according to herself, she did not <b>really</b> <b>start</b> writing until her first creative writing class in college in 1974. After that it took a while to find her own voice. She explains, [...] "I rejected what was at hand and emulated the voices of the poets I admired in books: big male voices like James Wright and Richard Hugo and Theodore Roethke, all wrong for me." ...|$|E

500|$|Metroid Prime: Trilogy {{has also}} been subject to criticism. GamePros Ashley Schoeller said that graphically, [...] "the games do look a bit dated" [...] and complained that the HUD was [...] "out of aspect" [...] to fit the widescreen. Official Nintendo Magazines Fred Dutton said that some aspects of Prime and Echoes had aged, saying the {{backtracking}} [...] "feels like more of a chore than it did seven years ago," [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "not until [...] enters its final third that things <b>really</b> <b>start</b> to pick up". GamesRadar considered the achievements too expensive, and that the similarity between the three games gives [...] "an inescapable sense of déjà vu". Edge noted that the control scheme was not very innovative, and that Echoes and Corruption [...] "favoured graphical flourishes over design innovation". While Ben Reeves of Game Informer praised the game, the [...] "second opinion" [...] reviewer, Adam Biessener, considered the collection [...] "subpar", saying it lacked innovation, and that the Wii control scheme, particularly aiming and panning, [...] "is inferior in every way to the traditional scheme from the GameCube titles".|$|E
500|$|Quatermass and the Pit premiered on 9 November 1967 {{and went}} on general release in a double bill with Circus of Fear on 19 November 1967. It was {{released}} under the title Five Million Years to Earth in the US in March 1968. The critical reception was generally positive. Writing in The Times, John Russell Taylor found that, “After a slowish beginning, which shows up the deficiencies of acting and direction, things <b>really</b> <b>start</b> hopping when a mysterious missile-like object discovered in a London excavation proves to be a relic of a prehistoric Martian attempt (successful, it would seem) to colonize Earth [...] The development of this situation is scrupulously worked out and the film is genuinely gripping even when (a real test this) the Power of Evil is finally shown personified in hazy glowing outline, a spectacle as a rule more likely to provoke titters than gasps of horror.” Paul Errol of the Evening Standard described the film as a “well-made, but wordy, blob of hokum”, a view echoed by William Hall of the Evening News who described the film as [...] "entertaining hokum" [...] with an [...] "imaginative ending". A slightly more critical view was espoused by Penelope Mortimer in The Observer who said, “This nonsense makes quite a good film, well put together, competently photographed, on the whole sturdily performed. What it totally lacks is imagination.” ...|$|E

Rebecca Bowden, of Yahoo! commented that during the episodes Callum is [...] "acting like an absolute idiot, and it's making me <b>really</b> <b>start</b> to hate his character", citing Callum's reaction to Holly's ordeal and his lack of care for others as her reason for this. Bowden felt that Callum's death was a shock, explaining that the graphic nature would not have suited the pre-watershed main show. She added that {{she was glad to}} see Callum die, although she commented that during the series he [...] "lost his personality for a little while".|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Da Capo II {{release was}} positively reviewed at visual-novels.net, commenting: [...] "I {{know a lot}} of gamers may not enjoy Da Capo, but whilst I think the story on some arcs was weaker than on others they were still amazing paths to play. On the stronger paths you <b>really</b> <b>start</b> to feel a lot of emotion for these girls, and because they're so closely tied together, someone always gets hurt. That for me bought some realism to the game." [...] In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, poll results for the fifty best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, Da Capo II ranked seventh with forty-seven votes. Da Capo II was the most widely sold game of 2006 on Getchu.com.

English singer-songwriter Pixie Lott was selected as the opening act for the UK shows, along with last minute additions of Tinchy Stryder and Tinie Tempah.

Fox revealed that she researched premature births, reading up on the subject and attending a meeting at the Liverpool Women's Hospital along with a writer for the serial. There, Fox spoke to a midwife who deals specifically with premature babies, which she found [...] "really helpful". The actress added that although the serial tried to stay true to life there is [...] "a bit of artistic licence that goes into the scripts, to make things more dramatic or to let the story flow better". On how Nancy would behave as a mother, Fox said: [...] "I imagine that she'll {{be a bit of a}} neurotic mother, particularly as the baby has arrived so early. I think she'd want to wrap him up in cotton wool and not let him out of her sight".|$|E
