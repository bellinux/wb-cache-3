5000|$|The {{supposed}} [...] "black barbthroats", {{described as}} T. grzimeki, are actually juvenile males of the <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit</b> (Glaucis hirsuta).|$|E
50|$|The bronzy hermit (Glaucis aeneus) is {{a species}} of hummingbird in the Trochilidae family. It is found in forests and {{thickets}} from eastern Honduras south to western Panama, and in the Chocó of western Colombia and north-western Ecuador. It closely resembles the larger <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The [...] <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit</b> or hairy hermit (Glaucis hirsutus) is a hummingbird that breeds from Panama {{south to}} Bolivia, and on Trinidad, Tobago and Grenada. It is a {{widespread}} and generally common species, though local populations may change in numbers and disappear altogether in marginal habitat ...|$|E
50|$|This hermit inhabits forest undergrowth, often near running water. The <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit's</b> food is nectar, {{taken from}} a variety of {{understory}} flowers, and some small invertebrates.|$|R
5000|$|Heliconias are an {{important}} food source for forest hummingbirds, especially the hermits (Phathornithinae), some of which [...] - [...] such as the <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit</b> (Glaucis hirsuta) [...] - [...] also use the plant for nesting. The Honduran white bat (Ectophylla alba) also lives in tents it makes from heliconia leaves.|$|E
50|$|Heliconia chartacea is {{a common}} upland species of {{disturbed}} sites, young secondary forest, and abandoned cultivation, and is often found near human habitation. It is pollinated by hermit hummingbirds, whose curved beaks are well adapted to probe the curved flowers for nectar, their main food source. Some species such as the <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit</b> also use the plant for nesting.|$|E
50|$|The {{hook-billed hermit}} (Glaucis dohrnii) is an {{endangered}} species of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae. It is found in humid forests in eastern Brazil, with recent records from the states of Espírito Santo and Bahia only. It resembles the far commoner <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit,</b> but has a straighter bill and lacks rufous in the tail. It is threatened by habitat loss and changing migration patterns.|$|E
50|$|Most hermits are {{associated}} with heliconias, but will utilize other nectar sources (flowers of Centropogon, Passiflora, Costus, etc.). To a lesser degree, they will capture small arthropods. The long, decurved bills typical of this group of hummingbirds are an adaptation to certain flowers. This is taken to an extreme in the two sicklebills (Eutoxeres spp.) with their very decurved bills. Many species, including the <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit,</b> also use the heliconias for nesting, attaching their conical nest to the underside {{of one of the}} plant's broad leaves.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit</b> lays two {{eggs in a}} small cup nest with a tail, made of {{rootlets}} {{and attached}} to the underside of a palm, fern or Heliconia leaf one or two meters (3-6 ft) above ground or so. The nests are often near a stream, waterfall or roadside, and are surprisingly easy to find. Incubation is 17 days with 23 more to fledging, and this species may nest up to four times in a season. The male of this aggressive and inquisitive hummingbird helps to build and defend the nest, but does not incubate the eggs. At least regionally (e.g. in Colombia), the species breeds all year.|$|E
5000|$|It is 10.7 cm {{long and}} weighs 7 g on average. The bill {{measures}} around 3.3 cm and is strongly decurved, long and thin [...] - [...] though {{compared to the}} bills of other hummingbirds, it is rather robust. The <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit</b> has a brownish head, bronze-green upperparts and rufous underparts. The tail has green central feathers and rufous outer feathers, all tipped white. The bill has a yellow lower mandible and a black upper mandible. Sexes are similar, but the male has yellow streaking on the upper mandible, and the female may be slightly duller in plumage. The bill of females is also proportionally a bit shorter (though this is hardly recognizable) and more decurved (which is quite conspicuous in direct comparison).|$|E
40|$|Vocal {{behavior}} in tropical hummingbirds {{is a new}} area of study. Here, we present findings on the vocalizations and associated behaviors of two species: Sombre Hummingbird (Aphantochroa cirrhochloris) and <b>Rufous-breasted</b> <b>Hermit</b> (Glaucis hirsutus). These are the only hummingbirds in which the brain areas activated by singing have been demonstrated. They are also among the basal species of their respective subfamilies, Trochilinae and Phaethornithinae and, thus, represent early stages {{in the evolution of}} hummingbird vocal communication. We found that the two species exhibit distinctive vocalizations and behaviors. Sombre Hummingbird calls had more modulation and were often used during agonistic interactions, whereas <b>Rufous-breasted</b> <b>Hermit</b> calls had higher pitch and purer tones and were produced in less aggressive interactions. Sombre Hummingbird song was highly stereotyped in syllable structure and syntax, whereas <b>Rufous-breasted</b> <b>Hermit</b> song was highly variable. Comparative analysis points to consistent similarities in use of vocalizations by the Sombre Hummingbird and other trochilines, and by the <b>Rufous-breasted</b> <b>Hermit</b> and other phaethornithines. We hypothesize that differences in vocal behavior between hummingbird lineages arise as adaptations to their foraging strategies...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} examples of plant-pollinator co-adaptation is between the heliconias Heliconia bihai and H. caribaea, and the Lesser Antillean hummingbird - the purple-throated carib Eulampis jugularis. To date, the purple-throated carib is the only reported pollinator of these heliconias on the islands of St. Lucia and Dominica. Here, we show that the pollination of H. bihai and H. caribaea in the Lesser Antilles is more complex than previously hypothesized, locally involving several hummingbird species, specifically the green-throated carib Eulampis holosericeus, <b>rufous-breasted</b> <b>hermit</b> Glands hirsuta, blue-headed hummingbird Cyanophaia bicolor, and the antillean crested hummingbird Orthorhyncus cristatus. Hopefully, our observations will stimulate research into whether H. bihai and H. caribaea show local co-adaptation toward hummingbird pollinators other than the purple-throated carib. This would further verify the co-adaptation hypothesis between heliconias and Lesser Antillean hummingbirds, although, depending on locality, more hummingbird species have to be added as mutualistic partners...|$|E
