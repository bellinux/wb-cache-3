5|$|With victory, the {{initiative}} firmly {{passed to the}} Red Army. For {{the remainder of the}} war the Germans were limited to <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> Soviet advances, and were never able to regain {{the initiative}} or launch a major offensive on the Eastern Front. The Western Allied landings in Italy opened up a new front, further diverting German resources and attention.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. <b>Reacting</b> <b>to</b> these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of the mystery cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E

5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are {{three times more likely to}} be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The Winnebago War, {{also known}} as the Winnebago Uprising, was a brief {{conflict}} that took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States, primarily in what is now the state of Wisconsin. Not quite a war, the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago (or Ho-Chunk) Native American tribe. The Ho-Chunks were <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> a wave of lead miners trespassing on their lands, and to false rumors that the United States had sent two Ho-Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution.|$|E
5|$|The operation's codename, Ring, {{referred}} to the encirclement of the towns of Getashen and Martunashen by the Soviet MVD and armed forces. A date in late April was chosen for the commencement of the operation, which called for Soviet troops to surround the towns and search the villages for both illegally procured weapons and Armenian guerrilla fighters. <b>Reacting</b> <b>to</b> the growing violence, Gorbachev had also assigned units of the Soviet 4th Army's predominantly Azerbaijani 23rd Motorized Rifle Division, stationed along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, {{to serve as a}} buffer force. The 23rd Division and other elements of the Fourth Army were selected along with the Azerbaijani OMON to take part in Ring.|$|E
40|$|Sixteen {{chronic myeloid leukaemia}} (CML) {{patients}} in remission were tested with solubilized membrane antigens from CML leukaemic cells, CML blasts, AML blasts and ALL blasts for cellular immunity in vitro by lymphocyte transformation (LT) and leucocyte migration inhibition (LMI) assays. Twelve CML {{patients in}} remission were tested with allogeneic PHA-transformed normal lymphoblasts. As controls, peripheral-blood leucocytes from 9 healthy persons were tested with the same antigen preparations. It was seen that 8 / 16 (50 %) CML patients responded to CML antigens by both LT and LMI assays, while 5 / 16 (31 %) patients <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> CML blasts and 44 % (7 / 16) patients <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> AML blast antigens. It was {{interesting to note that}} 5 / 11 (45 %) CML patients <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> ALL blast antigens by both assays. One out of 12 patients <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> PHA-transformed lymphoblasts. None of the healthy controls <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> leukaemia-associated antigens. The results suggest the sharing of antigens between myeloid leukaemic cells, myeloid blasts and lymphoid blasts...|$|R

Additional scenes include Dwight complaining about Jim's pranks while Michael was on vacation, Roy helping Ryan with inventory, Andy challenging Dwight to a box-stacking race, and Meredith climbing on a shelf, which falls and traps her.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
5|$|In Georgian literature, Tamar {{was also}} romanticized, but very {{differently}} from the Russian and Western European view. The Georgian romanticists followed a medieval tradition in Tamar's portrayal as a gentle, saintly woman who ruled a country permanently at war. This sentiment was further inspired by the rediscovery of a contemporary, 13th-century wall painting of Tamar in the then-ruined Betania monastery, which was uncovered and restored by Prince Grigory Gagarin in the 1840s. The fresco became a source of numerous engravings circulating in Georgia {{at that time and}} inspired the poet Grigol Orbeliani to dedicate a romantic poem to it. Furthermore, the Georgian literati, <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> Russian rule in Georgia and the suppression of national institutions, contrasted Tamar's era to their contemporary situation, lamenting the irretrievably lost past in their writings. Hence, Tamar became a personification of the heyday of Georgia, a perception that has persisted down to the present time.|$|E

Windle broke the Olympic record in the heats {{with a time of}} 17min 15.9s to qualify fastest for the final by more than six seconds. In the final, Windle repeated the strategy of sprinting from the start, leading throughout to lower his own Olympic record to 17min 1.7s and holding off American John Nelson by 1.3s. Windle's tactics disrupted the raceplan of the Americans; Nelson and world record holder Roy Saari had planned to pace each other throughout the race, but ended up <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> Windle instead of swimming their own race. As a result, Saari finished in seventh place, far outside his global standard.|$|E
5|$|Sutil {{was given}} a 20-second time penalty by the {{stewards}} as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth, and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting. This ruling meant Hülkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam Michael said that his team had accepted the stewards' judgement. The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi. Kobayashi admitted {{that he was at}} fault for his retirement and Senna believed the marshals were late <b>reacting</b> <b>to</b> Kobayashi's accident and felt his own accident was unavoidable.|$|E
5|$|The 25,400-strong Allied {{left flank}} corps under William Beresford began its advance on 16 February, {{aiming for the}} village of Bidache. Beresford's corps {{was made up of}} the 4th, 6th, 7th and Light Division as well as Somerset's and Vivian's cavalry. Altogether, Wellington had 42,000 foot {{soldiers}} and 3,000 horsemen marching to the east. <b>Reacting</b> <b>to</b> the Allied pressure, Soult joined two of the three divisions north of the Adour to the four divisions farther east. This action created a field army of 32,000 infantry and 3,800 cavalry. The French divisions were directed to form a new line behind the Gave d'Oloron River, along a line from Peyrehorade to Sauveterre-de-Béarn to Navarrenx. On 17 February, Hill's corps forded the Saison River, breaching yet another French defensive line. The French marshal sent Abbé's division to help defend Bayonne, a questionable move which left his army with fewer troops to fight Wellington. By 18 February, Soult had his troops in position on the Gave d'Oloron. That day the weather broke again, causing another pause in operations.|$|E
