40|$|Calcined coke is a {{high quality}} carbon {{material}} produced by calcining green petroleum coke. Calcining {{is the process of}} heating green petroleum coke in a kiln to remove excess moisture, extract all remaining hydrocarbons, and modify the crystalline structure of the coke into a denser, electrically conductive product. The final product, calcined coke, is primarily used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum industry and <b>recarburizing</b> agent for industries such as the steel industry. If not appropriately controlled, the calcining process could lead to excess production of particulate emissions from either handling or storing of raw coke, or from the stack emissions during the production of calcined coke. Though calcined coke has shown low hazard potential in human populations due to low volatile content, there remains some public health concern regarding the emissions from these facilities. This study is designed to evaluate the emissions of petroleum coke calcining facility and assess the public health concern from the processes engaged in the handling and storage of green coke {{as well as from the}} calcining process. The ambient air levels were measured from a calcining facility and compared with the standards promulgated by USEPA. The results showed that pollutant contribution from the facility, measured by monitoring carbon fraction of the emissions, was de-minimis. The current research also studied whether the exposure levels and health risks specified in various epidemiological studies correlate with the standards promulgated by USEPA to protect public health from petrochemical emissions...|$|E
5000|$|When the {{required}} steel had been formed, it was poured into ladles and then transferred into moulds while the lighter slag was left behind. The conversion process, called the [...] "blow", {{was completed in}} approximately 20 minutes. During this period {{the progress of the}} oxidation of the impurities was judged by the appearance of the flame issuing {{from the mouth of the}} converter. The modern use of photoelectric methods of recording the characteristics of the flame greatly aided the blower in controlling final product quality. After the blow, the liquid metal was <b>recarburized</b> to the desired point and other alloying materials were added, depending on the desired product.|$|R
40|$|The {{reactions}} of both thiophene and H 2 S onMo(2) C/Al 2 O 3 catalyst {{have been studied}} by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy. CO adsorption was used to probe the surface sites of Mo 2 C/Al 2 O 3 catalyst under the interaction and reaction of thiophene and H 2 S. When the fresh Mo 2 C/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is treated with a thiophene/H- 2 mixture above 473 K, hydrogenated species exhibiting IR bands in the regions 2800 - 3000 cm(- 1) are produced on the surface, indicating that thiophene reacts with the fresh carbide catalyst at relatively low temperatures. IR spectra of adsorbed CO on fresh Mo 2 C/Al 2 O 3 pretreated by thiophene/H- 2 at different temperatures clearly reveal the gradual sulfidation of the carbide catalyst at temperatures higher than 473 K, while H 2 S/H- 2 can sulfide the Mo 2 C/Al 2 O 3 catalyst surface readily at room temperature (RT). The sulfidation of the carbide surface by the reaction with thiophene or H 2 S maybe the major cause of the deactivation of carbide catalysts in hydrotreating reactions. The surface of the sulfided carbide catalyst can be only partially regenerated by a recarburization using CH 4 /H- 2 at 1033 K. When the catalyst is first oxidized and then <b>recarburized,</b> the carbide surface can be completely reproduced...|$|R
