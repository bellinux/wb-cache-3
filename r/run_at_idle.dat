50|$|A turbo timer is {{a device}} {{designed}} to keep an automotive engine running for a pre-specified period in order to automatically execute the cool-down period required to prevent premature turbo wear and failure. After a period of driving when a turbocharger has been working hard, {{it is important to}} let the engine <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> speed for a period, allowing the compressor assembly to cool from the lower gas temperatures in both the exhaust and intake tracts. At the same time the lubricating oil from the engine is able to circulate properly so the turbine won't burn the lubricating oil that would otherwise be trapped within the charger with the turbine rotating at high speed. With regard to modern automotive turbochargers, the need for a turbo timer can be eliminated by simply ensuring the car does not produce any 'boost' (during driving) for several minutes prior to the ignition being shut off.Most turbo timers are based on digital electronics.|$|E
5000|$|To start, a {{jet engine}} {{requires}} pneumatic {{rotation of the}} turbine, AC-electrical fuel pumps, and an AC-electrical [...] "flash" [...] that ignites the fuel. As the turbine (behind the combustion chamber) is already rotating, the front inlet fans are also rotating. After the ignition, both fans and turbine speed up their rotation. As combustion stabilizes, the engine thereafter only needs the fuel to <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> The started engine can now replace the APU when starting up further engines. During flight the APU and its generator are not needed.APUs are also used to run accessories while the engines are shut down. This allows the cabin to be comfortable while the passengers are boarding before the aircraft's engines are started. Electrical power is used to run systems for preflight checks. Some APUs are also connected to a hydraulic pump, allowing crews to operate hydraulic equipment (such as flight controls or flaps) prior to engine start. This function can also be used, on some aircraft, as a backup in flight in case of engine or hydraulic failure.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This report {{presents}} {{results of}} aerodynamic and-thermo-dynamic tests {{conducted on the}} first standard Navy air-cooled T- 10 test cell. Objectives of the tests were to: (1) Determine if aerodynamic and thermodynamic design objectives for the standard T- 10 test cells were met; (2) Obtain data for comparing analytical predictions and validating analytical modeling techniques, and (3) Obtain baseline data of cell performance for use in case of future changes in design or, uperations. Data were obtained during runs with the following engines: a J 52 -P- 8 B, a J 52 -P- 408, a TF 41 -A- 2 C, a F 404 -GE- 400, and a TF 30 -P- 414. All engines were <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>idle,</b> 85 %, and military power, and the engines equipped with afterburner (the TF 30 and F 404) were run at zone 5. Measurements included: Intake flow velocities and flow rates, cell pressure, flow velocities approaching and around the engilne, ex-haust section surface temperatures, and exhaust jet temperatures and velocities.

50|$|Moreover, {{the fine}} {{particles}} (fine particulate matter) in diesel exhaust (e.g., soot, sometimes visible as opaque dark-colored smoke) {{has traditionally been}} of greater concern, as it presents different health concerns and is rarely produced in significant quantities by spark-ignition engines. These especially harmful particulate contaminants are at their peak when such engines are run without sufficient oxygen to fully combust the fuel; when a diesel engine <b>runs</b> <b>at</b> <b>idle,</b> enough oxygen is usually present to burn the fuel completely. (The oxygen requirement in non-idling engines is usually mitigated using turbocharging.). From the particle emission standpoint, exhaust from diesel vehicles {{has been reported to}} be significantly more harmful than those from petrol vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Partially {{premixed}} combustion (PPC) has {{the potential}} of high efficiency and simultaneous low soot and NOx emissions. Running the engine in PPC mode with high octane number fuels has the advantage of a longer premix period of fuel and air which reduces soot emissions, even at higher loads. The problem is the ignitability at low load and idle operating conditions. The objective of this study is investigation of the low load limitations with gasoline fuels with octane numbers RON 69 and 87. Measurements with diesel fuel were also taken as reference. The experimental engine is a light duty diesel engine equipped with a fully flexible valve train system. Trapped hot residual gases using negative valve overlap (NVO) is the main parameter of interest to potentially increase the attainable operating region of high octane number gasoline fuels. Much lower soot is emitted with 69 and 87 RON gasoline compared to diesel at engine loads 1 bar IMEPgross to 3 bar IMEPgross but the combustion efficiency is significantly lower with gasoline at low load compared to diesel. Combustion efficiency increases with NVO for both diesel and gasoline. The 69 RON gasoline fuel can be <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> (1 bar IMEPgross) operating conditions without a significant fraction of trapped hot residual gases. The 87 RON gasoline fuel could be run at 2 bar IMEPgross but with a high setting of NVO. There is a clear decrease of net indicated efficiency with NVO because of the decrease in gas-exchange efficiency. To achieve highest possible efficiency for a given fuel, at low load, as low as possible NVO should be used...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the public}} sector, idling is common.

40|$|This report {{describes}} tests {{conducted at}} the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory on an "air-inducting" exhaust manifold for aircraft engines. The exhaust gases from each cylinder port are discharged into the throat of an exhaust pipe which has a frontal bellmouth. Cooling air is drawn into the pipe, where it surrounds and mixes with the exhaust gases. Temperatures of the manifold shell and of the exhaust gases were obtained in flight for both a conventional manifold and the air-inducting manifold. The air-inducting manifold was installed on an engine which was placed on a test stand. Different fuels were sprayed on and into the manifold {{to determine whether the}} use of this manifold reduced the fire hazard. The flight tests showed reductions in manifold temperatures of several hundred degrees, to values below the ignition point of aviation gasoline. On the test stand when the engine was <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>idling</b> speeds fuels sprayed into the manifold ignited. It is believed that at low engine speeds the fuel remained in the manifold long enough to become thoroughly heated, and was then ignited by the exhaust gas which had not mixed with cooling air. The use of the air-inducting exhaust manifold must reduce the fire hazard by virtue of its lower operating temperature, {{but it is not a}} completely satisfactory solution of the problem...|$|R

And he made a mathematical model of the propu 1 sion shafting system including the gear backlash combined with the bearing oi 1 fi 1 m of the pinion gear in order to clarify the phenomenon. By computer simulation using this mathematical model, it is concluded that the self-exciting vibration occurs at a certain shaft RPM due to the bearing oil film which gives an effect to such a peculiar torsional vibration as has a certain frequency unrelated to the number of propeller blades and it can be explained well by this model...|$|R

50|$|While {{a higher}} {{compression}} ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines {{are much more}} efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and <b>at</b> engine <b>idle.</b> Unlike the petrol engine, diesels lack a butterfly valve (throttle) in the inlet system, which closes <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> This creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol engines <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> In many applications, such as marine, agriculture, and railways, diesels are left idling and unattended for many hours, sometimes even days. These advantages are especially attractive in locomotives (see dieselisation).|$|R

Variable valve timing can give both maximum power at high rpm and smooth <b>idling</b> <b>at</b> low rpm by making small changes to the relative angular position of the camshafts and thereby varying the valve overlap.|$|R

50|$|Poorly {{engineered}} underdrive pulleys {{can cause}} unwanted side effects; {{this is due}} to not spinning the alternator, power steering, and/or air conditioning fast enough. This leads to low alternator voltage, weak/no power steering assist, and weak/no air conditioning effectiveness, especially at idle/low RPM. The most commonly seen result is lighting may dim, or the stereo may cut out. Too much underdrive for a race car is not much of a concern due to the high RPMs they <b>run</b> <b>at,</b> but for daily driven vehicles it can lead to a dead battery if too much time is spend <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> or low RPM. Additionally, an underdrive pulley will not reduce the power consumed by the alternator, as the alternator's load is automatically adjusted by its control circuit to match the electrical load regardless of input speed.|$|R
