5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to <b>raise</b> <b>children</b> and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of Hygiene and Preventative Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of Hygiene at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, <b>raise</b> <b>children</b> and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers. They also realized that though they were middle-class, working women, economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability to support themselves and their need to remain in the good graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E

40|$|Although every {{model of}} marital {{satisfaction}} includes individual personality traits as a pertinent {{factor in determining}} levels of satisfaction, few studies have directly examined how perfectionistic traits {{affect the quality of}} intimate relationships. Additionally, decades of research has found that marital quality decreases while couples are <b>raising</b> <b>children.</b> This study examined the relationships between three different dimensions of perfectionism (self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism) and marital satisfaction, and whether these relationships are moderated by whether one is <b>raising</b> <b>children.</b> The study deemed individuals to be <b>raising</b> <b>children</b> when they had one or more children living with them {{and those who did not}} have children or had children who were no longer living with them were considered to not be <b>raising</b> <b>children.</b> I hypothesized that there would be a negative relationship between socially prescribed perfectionism and marital satisfaction, and that self-oriented perfectionism and other-oriented perfectionism would not have significant relationships with marital satisfaction. I also hypothesized that those <b>raising</b> <b>children</b> would report significantly lower levels of marital satisfaction than those not <b>raising</b> <b>children.</b> Further, I hypothesized that the negative association between socially prescribed perfectionism and martial satisfaction would be stronger for those <b>raising</b> <b>children</b> compared to those not <b>raising</b> <b>children,</b> and that the relationship between self-oriented perfectionism and marital satisfaction would be significant and negative among people <b>raising</b> <b>children,</b> but nonsignificant among those not <b>raising</b> <b>children.</b> <b>Raising</b> <b>children</b> was not expected to moderate the relationship between other-oriented perfectionism and marital satisfaction. Participants were 383 married or cohabitating individuals over the age of 18. They were given questionnaires to assess their levels of self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism and marital satisfaction. Findings indicated that all three dimensions of perfectionism were relevant to the quality of intimate relationships. The interpersonal dimensions of perfectionism, whether characterized by expecting one 2 ̆ 7 s partner to be perfect or believing one 2 ̆ 7 s significant other is expecting perfection (other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism respectively), predicted higher levels of marital dissatisfaction. Expecting perfection of oneself (self-oriented perfectionism) was associated with higher levels of satisfaction in one 2 ̆ 7 s relationship. Consistent with previous studies, <b>raising</b> <b>children</b> was negatively correlated with marital satisfaction. Furthermore, <b>raising</b> <b>children</b> was found to moderate the relationship between socially prescribed perfectionism and marital satisfaction, such that the negative association between socially prescribed perfectionism and marital satisfaction was stronger for those <b>raising</b> <b>children</b> compared to those not <b>raising</b> <b>children,</b> although significant for both groups. <b>Raising</b> <b>children</b> did not moderate the relationship between self- or other-oriented perfectionism and marital satisfaction. Overall, this study highlights the importance of addressing perfectionism in the domain of intimate relationships. Findings indicate that expecting one 2 ̆ 7 s partner to be perfect or believing one 2 ̆ 7 s partner is expecting one to be perfect will negatively affect one 2 ̆ 7 s satisfaction in his/her relationship. This study supports the need for treatment interventions for those whose perfectionistic tendencies are interpersonal in nature and for couples during and throughout the transition to parenthood. Future studies can expand on the current study by including dyads and parent-child relationships to ascertain how one 2 ̆ 7 s perfectionistic tendencies affects his/her loved ones. ...|$|R

25|$|Among {{the most}} {{striking}} differences between the Jewish movements {{in the 21st century}} is their response to pressures of assimilation, such as intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis have been most accepting of intermarried couples, with some rabbis willing to officiate in mixed religious ceremonies, although most insist that children in such families be raised strictly Jewish. Conservative rabbis are not permitted to officiate in such marriages, but are supportive of couples when the non-Jewish partner wishes to convert to Judaism and <b>raise</b> <b>children</b> as Jewish.|$|E

Few women who had been widowed, deserted or divorced could afford to <b>raise</b> <b>children.</b> Work opportunities were fewer for women than men, and women were paid less than the male wage for the same work.

25|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of female {{circular}} migrants has increased rapidly. In {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century, South Africa's internal policies only permitted men to legally migrate to the city. This influx control was lifted in 1986, thus paving the way for women to begin migrating to urban areas. However, the change first affected permanent migration patterns, as female circular migration did not begin to increase substantially until over a decade later, mostly due to changing economic conditions. Overall, mobility in South Africa is high and continues to grow, as circular migration is carried out to look for work and <b>raise</b> <b>children</b> in areas with better schools.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} 50 years {{there have been}} great changes toward gender {{equality}} in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the feminist movement of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women had also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right {{back out of the}} labor force when the men returned home from war to <b>raise</b> <b>children</b> born in the generation of the baby boomers. In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.|$|E
