No clinical signs were observed in either group. Five of the 7 dogs shed the same serotypes as those recovered from food samples used for feeding. Results showed the same serotypes and antimicrobial resistance pattern in 2 of the 7 shedders.

25|$|The {{recommended}} iron intake for vegetarians is 1.8 {{times that}} of nonvegetarians, because plants, dairy, and eggs contain only non-heme iron, and this is absorbed less efficiently than heme iron. Although a lower percentage of non-heme iron is absorbed, greater amounts of non-heme iron are concentrated in many non-meat sources of iron (than the amount of iron per serving in meats), and therefore, cereals, eggs, nuts, seeds, and legumes (including soy foods, peas, beans, chickpeas, and lentils) are significant sources of iron, and a well-planned vegetarian diet should not lead to iron deficiency, but fruitarianism and <b>raw</b> <b>foods</b> diets should not be pursued for infants or children. Meat, fish, and poultry (not dairy or eggs) are the only sources of heme iron; intake of heme iron {{may be associated with}} colon cancer. Non-heme iron is more sensitive to both inhibitors and enhancers of iron absorption. Vitamin C is an iron absorption enhancer. The main inhibitors for most people are phytates (e.g. legumes and grains), but other inhibitors include tannins (tea, wine), calcium and polyphenols.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge about {{nutrition}} in Ghana {{is obtained}} through formal education, community health services, friends and families, cultural practices, traditions, {{and beliefs of}} the community. The majority of foods consumed by Ghanaian women during pregnancy were foods indigenous to Ghanaian diets in general such as green leafy vegetables, meats, fish, fruits, and legumes. They also consume foreign foods such as dairy products, biscuits, and beverages such as tea and powdered mixes. Recommended <b>raw</b> <b>foods</b> during pregnancy include: bananas, oranges, papaya, pineapples, carrots, cabbage, lettuce, honey, and kwawu nsua/nsaman troba. Recommended cooked foods include bean stew with palm oil and boiled white rice, bread, fried anchovies, smoked mackerel, snails in soup, stews with eggs and vegetables, palm nut soup with fufu and rice, and Nkontomire stew which is made with palm oil and boiled sweet cassava, or plantain, or yam. The beliefs about beneficial foods during pregnancy are based on their understanding of how certain foods can prevent anemia, enhance physical strength, support {{the development of the}} fetus, and minimize physiological disruption.|$|E
25|$|The Snows' {{marriage}} was strained and the Japanese occupation {{of much of}} China made life difficult. In December 1940, the Snows decided {{to move back to}} the United States in fear that the Japanese would make them prisoners of war. The attack on Pearl Harbor would take place exactly one year later. Prior to their departure, Ed was offered a position as a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune and Helen encouraged him to take it. She returned to the United States without him. But not much time had passed until Ed realized he didn't want to be without his wife and the living conditions were too difficult for him to withstand much longer. The Snows had been in China for a decade and they were both lacking proper nutrition and vitamins. Nearly the entire time they were in Asia, they did not eat <b>raw</b> <b>foods</b> in order to avoid dysentery and their health was depleted. Upon their initial return to the United States, the couple lived in California for a short time and then moved into a small mid-1700's house in Madison, Connecticut.|$|E
40|$|Dietary {{carotenoids}} {{are associated}} with a reduced risk of chronic diseases. <b>Raw</b> <b>food</b> diets are predominantly plant-based diets that are practised with the intention of preventing chronic diseases by virtue of their high content of beneficial nutritive substances such as carotenoids.

50|$|At his {{sanatorium}} in Zürich, {{a balanced}} diet of raw vegetables and fruit {{was used as a}} means to heal patients, contrary to the beliefs commonly held {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Bircher-Benner believed <b>raw</b> <b>foods</b> were more nutritious because they contain direct energy from the sun. He was among the first scientists in Europe to believe food could be used to keep the body healthy rather than simply satisfy hunger. He encouraged people of good health to eat approximately 50% <b>raw</b> <b>foods</b> on a daily basis, and for those with poor health to eat 100% <b>raw</b> <b>foods.</b> Bircher-Benner's sisters, Alice Bircher and Berta Brupbacher-Bircher, created many recipes using <b>raw</b> <b>foods</b> to help a diet of <b>raw</b> <b>foods</b> seem more appealing. Because of this help from his sisters, his sanatorium gained enormous popularity and he expanded the size of his clinic.|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite {{the first}} {{documented}} case of food allergy to cooked food in 1921 by Prausnitz and Kustner, all commercial food antigens are prepared from <b>raw</b> <b>food.</b> Furthermore, all IgE and IgG antibodies against dietary proteins offered by many clinical laboratories are measured against <b>raw</b> <b>food</b> antigens. Methods: We developed an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} for the measurement of IgE, IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against <b>raw</b> and processed <b>food</b> antigens. Sera with low or high reactivity to modified food antigens were subjected to myelin basic protein, oxidized low density lipoprotein, and advanced glycation end products (AGE) such as AGE-human serum albumin and AGE-hemoglobin. Results: Compared to <b>raw</b> <b>food</b> antigens, IgE antibodies showed a 3 – 8 -fold increase against processed food antigens in 31 % of the patients. Similarly, IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against modified food antigens overall were found at much higher levels than antibody reactions against <b>raw</b> <b>food</b> antigens.

40|$|Studies {{show that}} eating a diet high in <b>raw</b> <b>food</b> can be {{beneficial}} for health, yet from a traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) perspective such diets are thought to damage the Spleen qi. This article documents a small pilot study thatput this notion to the test. Forty one people were recruited - 20 of whom ate a diet high in <b>raw</b> <b>food</b> (over 50 percent of their food intake) and 20 of whom ate their normal diet - and were assessed over six months. TCM tongue and pulse diagnosis were used together with a questionnaire to assess participants, by a practitioner who was blind to their dietary status. These results were then analysed by another blinded practitioner, who assessed the degree of Spleen qi deficiency in each case. Thirty-five per cent of the <b>raw</b> <b>food</b> group were found to exhibit a pattern of Spleen qi deficiency, compared to 52 per cent of the control group. Those eating the most <b>raw</b> <b>food</b> (91 to 100 per cent of their diet) for the longest period of time (more than five years) had the least evidence of Spleen qi deficiency (11 per cent), which was statistically significant {{when compared to the}} control group (P< 0. 05). It is concluded that a diet high in <b>raw</b> <b>food</b> does not necessarily cause Spleen qi deficiency. However, two distinct physiological patterns were common within the <b>raw</b> <b>food</b> group that warrant further investigation. Also, this was a pilot study with a small number of participants, and thus {{further research is needed to}} substantiate such claims...|$|R
