40|$|The use of {{medicines}} {{can lead to}} a wide variety of different problems. Taken together, drug-related problems are commonly encountered in medical practice and often therapeutic interventions of some sort are needed. Many such interventions may have a pragmatic or experimental side; established protocols are often not available. Prominent drug-related problems are adverse reactions, drug interactions and therapeutic failure [1]. In addition to drug discontinuation, a characteristic intervention associ-ated with—often suspected—adverse drug reactions, is a re-exposure test: an intentional rechallenge. Such a re-exposure can, even in small amounts, be dangerous, however, and acute and fulminant reactions may occur.

40|$|An {{automated}} microassay {{was adapted}} {{to the study of}} specific in vitro lymphocyte transformation to dinitrochlorohenzene (DNCB) erythrocyte complexes (DNCB-antigen). Studies of culture conditions indicated that in flat-bottomed microtiter culture plates, 0. 2 -ml cultures containing 4 × 105 leukocytes and a total culture time of 4 or 5 days yield satisfactory results for the relatively low responses seen with specific antigens such as DNCB-antigen. Cultures were incubated for 3 hr with tritiated thymidine and harvested with the Multiple Automated Sample Harvester (MASH II). The effect of DNCB rechallenge on in vitro lymphocyte transformation was studied using this automated microassay. DNCB rechallenge boosted the in vitro response to DNCB-antigen, and in leukocyte cultures from some subjects the blastogenic response tended to remain elevated longer than has been reported following primary sensitization with DNCB. During a primary sensitization with DNCB, in vitro lymphocyte transformation to DNCB-antigen converted {{at about the same time}} skin reactivity was first observed, usually after about 2 weeks. However, following patch <b>test</b> <b>rechallenge,</b> skin reactivity was maximal at 2 to 3 days, whereas in vitro lymphocyte transformation to DNCB-antigen was nearly undetectable at 2 to 3 days and increased rapidly during the second week. The induction of lymphokine production following patch <b>test</b> <b>rechallenge</b> manifested a time course similar to that observed for specific lymphocyte transformation to DNCB-antigen. While the reasons for the observed temporal relationships between skin reactivity, blastogenesis, and lymphokine production are still unknown, knowledge of these relationships may provide insight on mechanisms of cellular immunity in man. In addition, awareness of these temporal relationships may allow a more rational approach to the in vitro study of naturally occurring contact sensitizers...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} first case of cefepime-induced “red-man syndrome, ” which {{appeared}} 30 min following drug infusion and was con-firmed with a <b>rechallenge</b> <b>test.</b> This syndrome is classically associated with vancomycin infusion and {{is the result of}} non-IgEme-diated mast cell degranulation. While this adverse effect can be easily managed with drug withdrawal and antihistamine admin-istration, it is unknown whether it can be prevented with slower cefepime infusion and preinfusion antihistamines, {{as is the case with}} vancomycin. Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activityagainst Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens (e. g., Pseu-domonas aeruginosa) (5) and often against Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species (8).

40|$|A drug {{provocation}} test (DPT) is the controlled administration {{of a drug}} in order to diagnose drug hypersensitivity reactions. DPTs are performed under medical surveillance, whether this drug is an alternative compound, or structurally/pharmacologically related, or the suspected drug itself. DPT is sometimes termed controlled challenge or reexposure, drug challenge, graded or incremental challenge, <b>test</b> dosing, <b>rechallenge,</b> or <b>testing</b> for tolerance. DPT is recommended by some specialized centers, allergy societies, and text books, whereas other societies advise against performing DPTs, and some review articles and textbooks do not even mention the method. The topic DPT is controversial {{in general and the}} test procedures not validated in most instances. Therefore it is considered important to develop general guidelines for performing DPT. Specific protocols for every single drug or at least group of drugs would be helpful, where indication, contraindication, substance, dosing, grading of the reaction and test as well as scoring criteria are defined. However, the development of individual DPT protocols is impractical because of the countless drugs that may cause numerous kinds of hypersensitivity reactions, allergic and non-allergic, with different time courses, severity and outcome, the individual situation of every person, and other factors that might possibly influence the test reaction. This paper sets out general guidelines for DPT that can be adapted for the specific problem under investigation...|$|R
40|$|Background. Patch tests help {{to confirm}} the {{aetiology}} of the cutaneous adverse drug reactions involving delayed hypersensitivity mechanisms, but the results vary with the pattern of skin reaction and the culprit drug. Objectives. To analyse the results of patch tests in patients with cutaneous adverse drug reactions imputable to clindamycin and assess their contribution to the diagnosis. Patients and methods. Between 2005 and 2009, we studied patients with delayed cutaneous adverse drug reactions following administration of clindamycin, usually associated with other drugs. After resolution of the cutaneous adverse drug reaction, patch tests were performed {{with a series of}} antibiotics, including pure clindamycin 10 % in petrolatum. Results. We studied 30 patients (23 females and 7 males) aged 33 - 86 years (mean 59. 97 years) with generalized maculopapular exanthema where clindamycin was among the highly suspected drugs. Two patients had a previous positive involuntary <b>rechallenge.</b> Patch <b>tests</b> with clindamycin were positive in 9 of 30 patients (30 %). More than 50 control patients patch tested with clindamycin were negative. Discussion. We considered the positive patch tests results with clindamycin, in the 9 patients with maculopapular exantema, to be specific, versus the negative results observed in the control group. Although the sensitivity is low (30 %), they confirmed the responsibility of this antibiotic in cutaneous adverse drug reactions in which, with only chronological criteria, {{it was not possible to}} conclude on the culprit drug...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims. Mesalazine {{is a key}} drug in the {{treatment}} of ulcerative colitis (UC). Intolerance to mesalazine has been described, including fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Several case reports reported successful desensitization of patients with mesalazine intolerance. The aim was to assess the number of UC patients who are persistently intolerant to mesalazine after single-blinded <b>rechallenge</b> and to <b>test</b> the effectiveness of a rapid desensitization protocol in UC patients demonstrated mesalazine intolerance. Methods. This is a prospective, singlie-blind randomized study in UC patients who discontinued mesalazine because of intolerance. Patients with severe reactions were excluded. Eligible patients underwent a skin patch test with mesalazine followed by a single-blinded randomized crossover rechallenge with 500 mg mesalazine or placebo. Patients with symptoms upon rechallenge were admitted to the hospital for 3 days oral desensitization. Results. Nine of the 37 identified UC patients who discontinued mesalazine because of intolerance were included. All nine patients had negative patch tests, seven patients had symptoms (fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) within 2 h upon rechallenge. Four of these seven patients participated in the desensitization protocol and in none a successful desensitization could be performed. All four had an inflammatory intolerance reaction with rise in C-reactive protein. There were no elevations in serum tryptase or urinary-methylhistamine levels observed and no signs of immediate type allergic reactions, like urticaria, bronchial obstruction or anaphylaxis. Conclusion. We recommend not to rechallenge UC patients with an inflammatory response upon mesalazine and these patients will not benefit from a rapid desensitization protocol...|$|R

40|$|Underdiagnosis of drug-induced fever {{leads to}} {{extensive}} investigation and prolongation of hospitalization, and {{may lead to}} multiple unnecessary invasive procedures and a wrong diagnosis. Azathioprine is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. We report {{a case of a}} 53 -year-old female patient diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis treated with azathioprine, who presented to the emergency room with a 6 -wk history of fever and chills without other associated symptoms. Since the patient&#x 2019;s fever was of unknown origin, she was hospitalized. All treatment was stopped and an extensive workup to explore the source of fever and chills was performed. Results of chest X-ray, viral, urine, and blood cultures, autoimmune serology, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, and abdominal ultrasound revealed no source of infection. A <b>rechallenge</b> <b>test</b> of azathioprine was performed and the fever and chills returned within a few hours. Azathioprine was established as the definite cause following rechallenge. Fever as an adverse drug reaction is often unrecognized. Azathioprine has been reported to cause drug-induced fever in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and sarcoidosis. To {{the best of our knowledge}} there have been no previous reports documenting azathioprine-induced fever in patients with autoimmune hepatitis. The occurrence of fever following the readministration of azathioprine suggests the diagnosis of drug-induced fever, particularly after the exclusion of other causes.

40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains {{represent}} {{the most frequent}} etiological agent of travelers diarrhea. Challenge studies with several of these strains were undertaken in volunteers to evaluate the mechanisms of disease-induced immunity. Seventeen students and other community volunteers were given 106 or 108 organisms of E. coli B 7 A (O 148 :H 28), which produces heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins. Ten individuals developed diarrheal illness closely resembling natural travelers diarrhea; of these ten, rises in titer of serum antitoxin and anti-O antibody occurred in eight (80 %). Eight of the volunteers who developed diarrhea in the first test agreed to undergo rechallenge 9 weeks later with 108 B 7 A organisms. Only one of these eight “veterans” developed diarrhea versus seven of twelve controls given the same challenge (P = 0. 05). Despite clinical protection, all “veterans” excreted B 7 A after rechallenge. Four controls who developed diarrhea during the homologous B 7 A <b>rechallenge</b> <b>test</b> were rechallenged 9 weeks later with 109 organisms of E. coli strain E 2528 -C 1 (O 25 :H-), which produces only heat-labile enterotoxin and possesses a different O, H, and pili antigen composition than B 7 A. Three of four “veterans” and two of six controls developed comparable diarrhea. These studies demonstrate that prior disease due to enterotoxigenic E. coli confers homologous immunity against subsequent challenge, and the operative mechanism apparently is not bactericidal and is not mediated by serum anti-O antibodies. Heterologous protection was not conferred where the only common antigen was heat-labile enterotoxin, indicating that serum infection-derived antitoxin to heat-labile enterotoxin also is not protective...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Freshwater {{cyanobacteria}} {{are common}} inhabitants of recreational waterbodies throughout the world; some cyanobacteria can dominate the phytoplankton and form blooms, {{many of which}} are toxic. Numerous reports in the literature describe pruritic skin rashes after recreational or occupational exposure to cyanobacteria, but there has been little research conducted on the cutaneous effects of cyanobacteria. Using the mouse ear swelling test (MEST), we sought to determine whether three toxin-producing cyanobacteria isolates and the purified cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin produced delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions. Methods Between 8 and 10 female Balb/c mice in each experiment had test material applied to depilated abdominal skin during the induction phase and 10 or 11 control mice had vehicle only applied to abdominal skin. For challenge (day 10) and <b>rechallenge</b> (day 17), <b>test</b> material was applied to a randomly-allocated test ear; vehicle was applied to the other ear as a control. Ear thickness in anaesthetised mice was measured with a micrometer gauge at 24 and 48 hours after challenge and rechallenge. Ear swelling greater than 20 % in one or more test mice is considered a positive response. Histopathology examination of ear tissues was conducted by independent examiners. Results Purified cylindrospermopsin (2 of 9 test mice vs. 0 of 5 control mice; p = 0. 51) and the cylindrospermopsin-producing cyanobacterium C. raciborskii (8 of 10 test mice vs. 0 of 10 control mice; p = 0. 001) were both shown to produce hypersensitivity reactions. Irritant reactions were seen on abdominal skin at induction. Two other toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena circinalis) did not generate any responses using this model. Histopathology examinations to determine positive and negative reactions in ear tissues showed excellent agreement beyond chance between both examiners (κ = 0. 83). Conclusion The irritant properties and cutaneous sensitising potential of cylindrospermopsin indicate that these toxicological endpoints should be considered by public health advisors and reservoir managers when setting guidelines for recreational exposure to cyanobacteria. </p...|$|R
40|$|A common dilemma {{faced by}} the {{clinician}} in the outpatient clinic is in distinguishing a drug eruption from a viral exanthem in a child. This is further confounded by multiple drugs frequently prescribed for common childhood ailment. Therefore many children are wrongly labelled as having drug allergy or mistakenly sent for allergy testing. This retrospective study seeks to address this common problem. Method: The case records of children aged 12 and below clinically diagnosed as having drug eruptions, seen from January 1995 to December 1997 in the National Skin Centre, were reviewed. Results: One hundred and eleven children were seen. The indications for drug prescribed were upper respiratory tract infection (47 %), fever (18 %) and chest infection (10 %). The common discriminating drugs prescribed were amoxycillin/ ampicill in in 59 %, paracetamol in 36 % and cotrimoxazole in 19 % of patients. In general, the drug eruption took place within 1 day in 39 %, by the 2 nd day in 10 % and by the 3 rd to the 7 th day in 13 % of patients. Drug eruption patterns seen were urticaria/angioedema (45 %), maculopapular rash (32 %) and fixed drug eruption (12 %). Drug allergy was confirmed in 8 patients (7 %), while it was deemed probable in 22 %, possible in 31 % and unlikely in 41 % of patients. Conclusion: A detailed drug history, knowledge of the various drug eruption patterns and drug specific reaction rates, and appropriate oral <b>rechallenge</b> <b>test,</b> are essential factors to the successful management {{of a child with}} drug eruption. Radio-allergosorbent test (RAST) and patch test may be useful in some cases...|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the efficacy and safety of 0. 025 % levocabastine hydro-chloride in Japanese subjects with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and its duration of action using the conjuncti-val allergen challenge (CAC) test. Methods: Twenty-four asymptomatic subjects were randomized to instill 0. 025 % levocabastine ophthalmic suspension in one eye and vehicle in the other eye 10 minutes before the CAC test. Signs and symptoms of al-lergic conjunctivitis were scored 10, 15, and 25 minutes after the CAC test. The duration of drug effects was also evaluated by allergen rechallenge 4 hours after levocabastine administration. The itching score for each eye as the primary efficacy endpoint was assessed 15 minutes after the CAC test using a 5 -point scale. Results: The mean itching score in the levocabastine-treated group was 0. 08 ± 0. 06, which was significantly lower than the mean score of 1. 98 ± 0. 16 in the vehicle group (P< 0. 0001). The redness and chemosis of the conjunctiva were also improved significantly compared with the vehicle group. Levocabastine showed pro-longed efficacy in inhibiting itching (0. 42 ± 0. 12 vs 0. 94 ± 0. 17, P< 0. 0002) and redness (1. 04 ± 0. 18 vs 1. 42 ± 0. 22, P < 0. 01) of the conjunctiva upon the <b>rechallenge</b> <b>test.</b> No significant topical or systemic adverse safety findings were observed in the levocabastine group.
