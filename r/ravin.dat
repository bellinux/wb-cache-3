5|$|In 2005, De <b>Ravin</b> {{was cast}} to portray Emily Kostich, the heroin-addicted ex-girlfriend of Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), in the neo-noir film Brick. In an {{interview}} about the film, <b>Ravin</b> {{told that she}} was attracted by the script because it was original and the teens in the film are very deep and emotional for their age.|$|E
5|$|A year later, De <b>Ravin</b> had a {{lead role}} and was cast as Brenda Carter in the remake of The Hills Have Eyes. The film {{performed}} {{well at the}} box office. In 2007, Variety reported {{that she would be}} starring in the film Ball Don't Lie, which premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, which arrived in cinemas early 2009. De <b>Ravin</b> appeared in William Dear's The Perfect Game, and appeared in the 2009 film Public Enemies as a bank teller named Barbara Patzke.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 she guest-starred as Belle on the ABC fantasy drama, Once Upon a Time. After {{sporadic}} {{appearances in}} the first season, she was promoted to a series regular in the second. In May 2017, {{it was announced that}} De <b>Ravin</b> would be departing the series after the six seasons along with her co-stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Jared S. Gilmore and Rebecca Mader. Two months later, it was announced that De <b>Ravin</b> would be guest-starring in at least one episode of the series' seventh season.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "Volsunga Saga" [...] {{has this}} unique and unparalleled interest, {{that it gives}} the {{spectacle}} of the highest epic genius, struggling out of savagery into complete and free and conscious humanity. It is a mark of the savage intellect not to discriminate abruptly between man and the lower animals. In the tales of the lower peoples, the characters are just as often beasts as men and women. Now, in the earlier and wilder parts of the [...] "Volsunga Saga," [...] otters and dragons play human parts. Signy and his son, {{and the mother of}} their enemy, put on the skins of wolves, become wolves, and pass through hideous adventures. The story reeks with blood, and <b>ravins</b> with lust of blood. But when Sigurd arrives at full years of manhood, the barbarism yields place, the Saga becomes human and conscious.|$|R
5000|$|In {{those years}} he also issued humorous {{collections}} and leaflets for Jewish holidays (yontev bleter), in the artistic name [...] "Haggai". Beginning {{in the end}} of the 1910s, he illustrated a series of Yiddish and Hebrew childrens books published in Warsaw, including the Hebrew illustrated childrens library Shibolim (ears) - a series of 70 illustrated, dotted booklets, most of which were adapted folktale (E. Gitlin, beginning of the 1920s); Agadot Yavan (Legends of Greece, i.e., Greek mythology; 3 vols., E. Gitlin, 1922) - in Hebrew, adapted by Eliezer Mitropolitnsky, and a simultaneous Yiddish edition translated by H.Z.: grikhishe mitn; the [...] "Tarbut"s Hebrew toddlers library Tsil Tslil, which he also designed and printed; and the Hebrew reader Tsafririm by Itzhak Katzenelson and Itzhak Berkman (Ahisefer, mid-1920s). He also painted many title pages, like the title page of Yosef <b>Ravins</b> childrens series Maysehlekh fun der gantser velt (tales from around the world; E. Gitlin, mid-1920s) and that of the 2nd Haynts jubilee book (1938).|$|R
40|$|To {{show the}} {{response}} of fluvial and torrential morphodynamics to climatic variations and neotectonics in the semi-arid mountains, the authors present a preliminary geomorphological study of the main geosystem of the Alyhnayn area. This level {{is located in the}} upstream part of the intramountainous valley of N'fis river belonging to the northern side of High-Atlas. Its geomorphological analysis, based on the distribution of alluvial deposits and their characterization, reveals an alluvial-fans/terrace system. The latter is formed by a surface modeled on glacis and lacerated by more or less deep ravines. It is arbitrarily attributed to the middle Quatemary age. The geometric and the morpholithostratigraphic analysis of its deposits show a local control of a sedimentation of fluvialtorrential and gravitational types. A complex slop deposit is embedded within the fluvial sequences. It can be explained by a drop of the base level related to neotectonics. The sedimentation process is caused by the reactivation of a preexisting fault in relation with the High-Atlas elevation. The evolution of the Quatemary morphogenesis of the Alhnayn area has been influenced by uplift and climatic changes. Neotectonics controls fluvial and torrential dynamics by the local morphostructural framework. The fluvial and afluvial fans environments responded differently to recorder impacts. Nous présentons la réponse des paléoenvironnements ayant régi le géosysteme principal d 7 Alhanayn correspondant 2 un cycle morphoclimatique élémentaire, inscrit dans un domaine intramontagneux en cours de surrection, aux rythmes de l'érosion et de la sédimentation en caractérisant la part aux controles climatique et tectonique.

5|$|Harold Perrineau, {{who plays}} Michael Dawson, left the cast at the {{conclusion}} of the fourth season. Emilie de <b>Ravin,</b> who plays Claire Littleton, was placed on a holding contract, but she returned in the sixth and final season of Lost as a main cast member.|$|E
5|$|On 3 October 2015, de <b>Ravin</b> {{announced}} via Twitter {{that she}} was expecting her first child with her boyfriend Eric Bilitch. On March 12, 2016, {{she gave birth to}} a daughter, named Vera Audrey de Ravin-Bilitch. The couple announced their engagement on July 6, 2016.|$|E
5|$|On the island, Claire Littleton (Emilie de <b>Ravin)</b> watches Eko whittling scripture {{into the}} head of his club, and {{mentions}} that Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) carries a Virgin Mary statue. Eko immediately demands to see the statue, which he breaks open and shows Claire the heroin inside. Eko then goes to Charlie, demanding him {{to take him to the}} plane.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{interested}} by finding {{on the highest}} peak of one range (about 700 feet above the sea) a great arched fragment, lying on its convex side, or back downwards. Must {{we believe that it}} was fairly pitched up in the air, and thus turned? Or, with more probability, that there existed formerly a part of the same range more elevated than the point on which this monument of a great convulsion of nature now lies. As the fragments in the valleys are neither rounded nor the crevices filled up with sand, we must infer that the period of violence was subsequent to the land having been raised above the waters of the sea. In a transverse section within these valleys the bottom is nearly level, or rises but very little towards either side. Hence the fragments appear to have travelled from the head of the valley; but in reality it seems more probable that they have been hurled down from the nearest slopes; and that since, by a vibratory movement of overwhelming force, the fragments have been levelled into one continuous sheet. (9/9. [...] "Nous n'avons pas été moins saisis d'étonnement à la vûe de l'innombrable quantité de pierres de toutes grandeurs, bouleversées les unes sur les autres, et cependant rangées, comme si elles avoient été amoncelées négligemment pour remplir des <b>ravins.</b> On ne se lassoit pas d'admirer les effets prodigieux de la nature." [...] "Pernety" [...] page 526.) If during the earthquake which in 1835 overthrew Concepcion, in Chile, it was thought wonderful that small bodies should have been pitched a few inches from the ground, what must we say to a movement which has caused fragments many tons in weight to move onwards like so much sand on a vibrating board, and find their level? (9/10. An inhabitant of Mendoza, and hence well capable of judging, assured me that, during the several years he had resided on these islands, he had never felt the slightest shock of an earthquake.) I have seen, in the Cordillera of the Andes, the evident marks where stupendous mountains have been broken into pieces like so much thin crust, and the strata thrown on their vertical edges; but never did any scene, like these [...] "streams of stones," [...] so forcibly convey to my mind the idea of a convulsion, of which in historical records we might in vain seek for any counterpart: yet the progress of knowledge will probably some day give a simple explanation of this phenomenon, as it already has of the so long thought inexplicable transportal of the erratic boulders which are strewed over the plains of Europe.|$|R
6000|$|... 12. Now, {{the precise}} {{counterpart}} {{of such a}} household would {{be seen in a}} nation in which political economy was rightly understood. You complain of the difficulty of finding work for your men. Depend upon it, the real difficulty rather is to find men for your work. The serious question for you is not how many you have to feed, but how much you have to do; it is our inactivity, not our hunger, that ruins us: let us never fear that our servants should have a good appetite--our wealth is in their strength, not in their starvation. Look around this island of yours, and see {{what you have to do}} in it. The sea roars against your harbourless cliffs--you have to build the breakwater, and dig the port of refuge; the unclean pestilence <b>ravins</b> in your streets--you have to bring the full stream from the hills, and to send the free winds through the thoroughfare; the famine blanches your lips and eats away your flesh--you have to dig the moor and dry the marsh, to bid the morass give forth instead of engulfing, and to wring the honey and oil out of the rock. These things, and thousands such, we have to do, and shall have to do constantly, on this great farm of ours; for do not suppose that it is anything else than that. Precisely the same laws of economy which apply to the cultivation of a farm or an estate, apply to the cultivation of a province or of an island. Whatever rebuke you would address to the improvident master of an ill-managed patrimony, precisely that rebuke we should address to ourselves, so far as we leave our population in idleness and our country in disorder. What would you say to the lord of an estate who complained to you of his poverty and disabilities, and when you pointed out to him that his land was half of it overrun with weeds, and that his fences were all in ruin, and that his cattle-sheds were roofless, and his labourers lying under the hedges faint for want of food, he answered to you that it would ruin him to weed his land or to roof his sheds--that those were too costly operations for him to undertake, and that he knew not how to feed his labourers nor pay them? Would you not instantly answer, that instead of ruining him to weed his fields, it would save him; that his inactivity was his destruction, and that to set his labourers to work was to feed them? Now, you may add acre to acre, and estate to estate, as far as you like, but you will never reach a compass of ground which shall escape from the authority of these simple laws. The principles which are right in the administration of a few fields, are right also in the administration of a great country from horizon to horizon: idleness does not cease to be ruinous because it is extensive, nor labour to be productive because it is universal.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Locke {{enters the}} cabin alone and meets the figure of the {{deceased}} Christian Shephard (John Terry), who claims he is speaking on Jacob's behalf and is accompanied by his daughter Claire Littleton (Emilie de <b>Ravin).</b> Christian warns Locke that Keamy's mercenaries from the Kahana are already en route to the Island, and that the Island must be moved.|$|E
5|$|De Ravin's film {{credits include}} Santa's Slay (2005), The Hills Have Eyes (2006) and Ball Don't Lie (2008).

5|$|Jeremy Davies, Rebecca Mader, and Elizabeth Mitchell, {{who played}} Daniel Faraday, Charlotte Lewis, and Juliet Burke, respectively, left the show after the fifth season, but all three reprised their {{characters}} for the sixth. Former recurring cast members Nestor Carbonell, Jeff Fahey, and Zuleikha Robinson, {{who played the}} roles Richard Alpert, Frank Lapidus, and Ilana Verdansky, were promoted to the starring cast, and Emilie de <b>Ravin</b> returned as main character Claire Littleton after a year-long absence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ravin</b> v. State was a 1975 {{decision}} by the Alaska Supreme Court that held the Alaska Constitution's right to privacy protects an adult's ability to use and possess {{a small amount of}} marijuana in the home for personal use.

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson and directed by Milan Cheylov. It featured the first appearance of de <b>Ravin,</b> who was cast as Belle in November 2011 after being approached by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Espenson created a love-themed episode; initially its main theme was to focus on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love, but {{during the writing process}} Espenson decided to make him instead believe that he was not worthy of love at all.|$|E
5|$|Despite pleas from Kate, Sayid {{sets off}} {{to explore the}} island's {{shoreline}} in self-imposed isolation, needing time {{to come to terms}} with his actions in torturing Sawyer, while Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) helps Shannon by making a eucalyptus salve to clear her bronchial passages. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) convinces Claire Littleton (Emilie de <b>Ravin)</b> to move to the caves, because they made a deal that if Charlie found peanut butter, she would move; Charlie shares an imaginary jar of peanut butter with her. Sawyer attempts to burn the letter he wrote, but he finds himself unable to go through with it.|$|E
5|$|Hurley {{is later}} {{left with the}} van and {{continues}} driving. Jin gives Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) a flower, Charlie talks with Claire Littleton (Emilie de <b>Ravin)</b> and Sawyer brings some beer for Kate but finds that she isn't around. Meanwhile, Kate meets up with John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and Sayid {{on her way to}} find Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), who she hopes to get help from. Locke reveals he has compass readings from Mr. Eko's stick. Kate's recruiting of Rousseau seems to fail until she mentions her suspicions about Alex, who helped Kate escape, being Rousseau's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Kate {{return to}} camp, {{and when she}} goes to tell Jack about Locke, Jack sees {{a man in a}} suit walk into the jungle. Jack chases after him and Kate follows, but instead of the mysterious figure, they find Locke, who brings with him a dead boar. That night, the {{fuselage}} is burned while Claire Littleton (Emilie de <b>Ravin)</b> holds a memorial service for the dead passengers using information she found in their passports, wallets, and luggage. Michael thanks Locke for hunting the boar and then asks Locke about the Monster, but Locke says that he did not see anything. Looking towards the fire, Locke sees his wheelchair against the flame and smiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Dr. Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) is {{featured in the}} episode's flashbacks, which reveal how Juliet got on the Island and why {{she went to the}} island in the first place. While on the island, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Juliet trek back to the beach camp, and Claire Littleton (Emilie de <b>Ravin)</b> is struck by a mysterious illness. Andrew Divoff, William Mapother and Nestor Carbonell again reprise their recurring roles as Others; Mikhail Bakunin, Ethan Rom and Richard Alpert. The Island events in this episode take place between December 13 and December 15, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Upon impact, Rose lies {{unconscious}} on {{the beach}} with the fuselage survivors, but is eventually revived by Jack (Matthew Fox). During {{the first few days}} on the Island, Rose is in shock, and keeps herself away from the other survivors, attracting the attention of Jack. While Jack believes that Bernard is dead, Rose is adamant that he is still alive. After Claire (Emilie de <b>Ravin)</b> is kidnapped by the Island's inhabitants (known to the survivors as the Others), Rose comforts Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), who believes it is not his fault and encourages him not to lose hope and prays for him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns the key in the system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de <b>Ravin),</b> and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2004, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) awakens disoriented in {{the jungle}} and notices a yellow Labrador {{retriever}} (Madison) darting through the bamboo forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by the carnage of the airplane crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de <b>Ravin),</b> enlisting Hurley (Jorge Garcia) to watch her, and administering CPR to Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell), saving her life. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond the beach to tend to his own injuries, when he notices Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping suture a wound on his back. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's galley and distributes them to the survivors. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) refuses chocolate offered by her brother Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), believing that rescue is imminent. A Korean man, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), tells his wife, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), in Korean that she should remain close to him at all times.|$|E
5|$|Anna {{appears in}} the fourth season of Once Upon a Time, with actress Elizabeth Lail portraying the character. Following {{the events of the}} film Frozen, Anna is {{preparing}} to wed Kristoff when Elsa finds a diary from their mother stating their real reason for their parents' fatal trip. Determined to seek answers, Anna postpones her wedding and travels to the Enchanted Forest (known as Misthaven in Arendelle). Anna meets David, a friend of Kristoff's, and trains him in swordsmanship so he can defend his farm from the evil warlord Bo Peep. Following Bo Peep's defeat, David gives Anna his horse and David's mother gives Anna the name of Rumplestiltskin, a powerful wizard who she believes can give her the answers she is looking for. Anna visits Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) who tells her that the King and Queen of Arendelle came to him, and he will tell her what they said if she administers a potion to an old man. Anna is afraid the potion is poison and pours it into the old man's fire. She returns to Rumplestiltskin's lair and lies, saying she has given the man the potion, and quickly learns it was an antidote, not a poison. In not giving him the drink, Anna has broken her deal with Rumplestiltskin and subjected the man to turn into a mouse. The deal, when broken, meant that Anna had to be Rumplestiltskin's slave—but, alas, Anna gets control of the dagger that controls him, and orders him to never harm her or her sister, and to send her back home with Rumplestiltskin's weapon, a magic-stealing hat. Back in Arendelle, Anna admits to Kristoff that Rumplestiltskin told her that her parents were afraid of Elsa. She does not tell this to Elsa, but is shocked to see that Elsa is learning to control her power—due to a new woman by the name of Ingrid (Elizabeth Mitchell), who claims she is their mother's sister and also has magic snow powers like her sister Elsa. Anna never knew their mother had a sister, so she is immediately skeptical. She goes to meet Grand Pabbie and the rock trolls to find out if this is the truth. While purchasing supplies at Oaken's shop, Anna runs into Belle (Emilie de <b>Ravin)</b> and they become friends. Together, they journey to the rock trolls, where Anna learns that her mother had two sisters named Ingrid and Helga, but Grand Pabbie changed everyone's memory in all of Arendelle. On the return journey back to the castle, Anna and Belle run into Ingrid. Ingrid sees that Anna has Rumplestiltskin's magic-stealing hat and believes she will betray her, so she grabs hold of Anna and imprisons her. Ingrid tells Anna that she has nothing in common with either her or Elsa as she has no magic as they, and now Ingrid must replace her. Eventually, Anna reunites with her sister, helps Ingrid see the errors of her ways, and marries Kristoff.|$|E
