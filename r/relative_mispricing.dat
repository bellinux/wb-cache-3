40|$|Riskless {{arbitrage}} {{is rarely}} encountered in practice, {{yet it is}} common in both academic studies and industry to use the riskless arbitrage strategy (holding a balanced long-short position in {{the same number of}} shares) even when arbitrage opportunities are risky. This is almost never optimal as the objective of the riskless arbitrage strategy (to offset future liabilities) differs from the objective under risky arbitrage of optimally trading off risk and returns. We analyze risky arbitrage {{in the context of a}} model with cointegrated asset prices where temporary mispricing is captured by an error correction term. Absolute mispricing (under- or overpriced assets) is determined by the conditional alpha associated with the error correction term while <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> is determined by mean reversion in the error correction term. Under riskless arbitrage, only <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> matters, whereas both absolute and <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> matter for the optimal strategy under risky arbitrage. This can give rise to some surprising insights. For example, it can be optimal under risky arbitrage to take a long position in an asset that would be held short under riskless arbitrage. Key words: risky arbitrage, absolute mispricing, <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing.</b> ∗We thank Jun Pan and seminar participants at the CREATES workshop on Dynamic Asset Allocation and at Blackrock for helpful discussions and comments.

40|$|Pairs {{trading is}} an {{speculative}} investment strategy based on <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> between {{a pair of}} stocks. Essentially, the strategy involves choosing a pair of stocks that historically move together. By taking a long-short position on this pair when they diverge, a profit will be made when they next converge to the mean by unwind-ing the position. Literature on this topic is rare due to its proprietary nature. Where it does exist, the strategies are either adhoc or applicable to special cases only, with little theoretical verification. This paper analyzes these existing methods in detail and proposes a general approach to modeling <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> for pairs trading purposes, {{with reference to the}} mainstream asset pricing theory. Several estimation techniques are discussed and tested for state space formulation, with Expectation Maximization producing stable results.

Given transaction costs, the authors establish arbitrage-based bounds on prime and score prices. They then develop a new nonparametric statistical technique to test whether prime and score prices violate these bounds. They find that prime and score prices do exceed stock prices, and often by a considerable amount. They demonstrate that this increased value is most likely due to the score's ability to save on the costs of dynamic hedging. They also show how short sale and trust size constraints impede the ability to arbitrage price disparities. Copyright 1989 by American Finance Association. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} {{reported}} here, we investigated the efficiency of markets as to the relative pricing of similar risk by using implied volatilities of options on highly correlated indexes and a statistical arbitrage strategy to profit from potential mispricings. We first analyzed the interrelationships over time of the three most highly correlated and liquid pairs of U. S. stock indexes. Based on this analysis, we derived a relative relationship between implied volatilities for each pair. If this relationship was violated (i. e., if we detected a relative implied-volatility deviation), we suspected a <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing.</b> We used a simple no-arbitrage barrier to identify significant deviations and implemented a statistical arbitrage trade each time such a deviation was recorded.

40|$|This paper {{analytically}} {{solves the}} portfolio optimization problem of an investor {{faced with a}} risky arbitrage opportunity (e. g. <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> in equity pairs). Unlike the extant literature, which typically models mispricings through the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we introduce a nonlinear generalization of OU which jointly captures several important risk factors inherent in arbitrage trading. While these factors are absent from the standard OU, we show that considering them yields several {{new insights into the}} behavior of rational arbitrageurs: Firstly, arbitrageurs recognizing these risk factors exhibit a diminishing propensity to exploit large mispricings. Secondly, optimal investment behavior in light of these risk factors precipitates the gradual unwinding of losing trades far sooner than is entailed in existing approaches including OU. Finally, an empirical application to daily FTSE 100 pairs data shows that incorporating these risks renders our model’s risk-management capabilities superior to both OU and a simple threshold strategy popular in the literature. These observations are useful in understanding the role of arbitrageurs in enforcing price efficiency. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Pairs {{trading is}} an {{arbitrage}} strategy that involves identifying {{a pair of}} stocks known to move together historically and trading on them when <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> occurs. The strategy involves shorting the overvalued stock and simultaneously going long on the undervalued stock and closing the positions once the prices have returned to fair values. The cointegration method and the distance method {{are the most common}} techniques used in pairs trading strategy. However under these methods, the measure of divergence between the stocks or the spread is assumed to be symmetrically distributed about the mean zero. In addition, the spread is assumed to be a stationary time series (cointegration method) or mean-reverting (distance method). These assumptions are the main drawbacks of these methods and may lead to missed and/or inaccurate trading signals. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore an alternative approach to pairs trading by use of copulas. This dissertation aims to investigate if copulas can improve the profitability of pairs trading. To achieve this aim, results of pairs trading by use of copulas are compared against those of cointegration and distance methods...|$|E
40|$|Asset prices {{depend on}} two elements: the {{dynamics}} of the state variables and the pricing kernel. Traditional term structure models differ in the factor dynamics. However, most of them imply a log-linear pricing kernel. We investigate empirically the role of factor dynamics and pricing kernel in pricing interest rate derivatives using a nonparametric approach. We find that the prices of interest rate caps are very sensitive to the specification of the factor dynamics, especially when they are close to expiration. In addition, nonlinear log-pricing kernels improve the pricing of long-maturity caps. Recent research document models that fit libor and swap rates but do not price derivatives well, leading to the so called “unspanned stochastic volatility puzzle”. Additional factors seem to be needed to explain cap prices. However, the <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> between interest rate caps and underlying libor and swap rates could also potentially be due to mis-specification of the parametric models used. Our paper provides evidence, from a nonparametric perspective, for the inability of diffusion-only type of models to price interest rate caps.

40|$|Financial researchers, {{analysts and}} {{decision-makers}} frequently {{grapple with the}} issue of identifying ho-mogeneous groups of stocks. Researchers and analysts, for example, often wish to analyze the consequences of events such as corporate re-organizations or changes in financial and investment policies. A common pro-cedure is to pair stocks in the sample with others that have not experienced the event, but are similar in all other respects. The behavior of the sample in question is then assessed against the reference group. Man-agers, when they present their financial statements to the public, frequently assess how their firms fare in terms of peer group comparisons. Many investors follow strategies based on identifying stocks that are matched along economically relevant dimensions but which trade at different valuations, perhaps indicating <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing.</b> Academic researchers and investment practitioners follow a variety of approaches to construct homoge-nous stock groupings.

40|$|We show that, when {{stock prices}} {{are subject to}} {{stochastic}} mispricing errors, expected rates of return may depend {{not only on the}} fundamental risk that is captured by a standard asset pricing model, but also on the type and degree of asset mispricing, even when the mispricing is zero on average.

40|$|While prior {{research}} suggests that firms have primarily switched from accrual to real earnings management strategies since {{the passage of the}} Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) (Cohen, Dey, and Lys 2008), there has been limited research on the effects that this switch might have on future performance and firm value. Accrual earnings management shifts income recognition without directly affecting cash flows, whereas real earnings management implies suboptimal decisions that directly affect the underlying cash flows. Thus, this shift in earnings management techniques could have important consequences for investors. Consistent with increased real earnings management post-SOX, we find that abnormal operating decisions are less informative about future return on assets (ROA) and have a more negative effect on firm value relative to the pre-SOX period. Alternatively, consistent with less accrual earnings management post-SOX, we find that discretionary accruals are more informative about future ROA and there is less evidence of market <b>mispricing</b> <b>relative</b> to the pre-SOX period.

40|$|Statistical arbitrage, or {{sometimes}} called pairs trading, {{is an investment}} strategy which exploits the historical price relationships between two or several assets and profits from <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing.</b> It {{has a long history}} in hedge fund industry and variates of this kind of strategies are still profitable nowadays. The idea is simple and the source of the profit has support from fundamentals in economics and pricing theories. However, there are still many difficulties in implementing and testing such strategies in real life, which include how to select pairs, how to estimate hedge ratio, when to enter, when to exit and etc. Due to its proprietary nature, there is very few literature on this subject. This thesis is an attempt to demystify statistical arbitrage in high-frequency settings, using freely available data of Chinese commodity futures. This thesis introduces and discusses the existing research done on this subject. Also, with the help of advanced statistical inference approaches for treating time series, this thesis proposed a new model which generalizes the entire process of creating a profitable statistical arbitrage trading strategy for a given market.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is proposed to identify trading {{opportunities in the}} equity market by using {{the information contained in}} the bivariate dependence structure of two equities. The relationships between the equity pairs are modelled with bivariate copulas and the fitted copula structures are utilised to identify the trading opportunities. Two trading strategies are considered that take advantage of the <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> between a pair of correlated stocks and involve taking a position on the stocks when they diverge from their historical relationship. The position is then reversed when the two stocks revert to their historical relationship. Only stock-pairs with relatively high correlations are considered. The dependence structures of the chosen stock-pairs very often exhibited both upper- and lower-tail dependence, which implies that copulas with the correct characteristics should be more effective than the more traditional approaches typically applied. To identify trading opportunities, the conditional copula functions are used to derive confidence intervals for the two stocks. It is shown that the number of trading opportunities is highly dependent on the confidence level and it is argued that the chosen confidence level should take the strength of the dependence between the two stocks into account. The back-test results of the pairs-trading strategy are disappointing in that even though the strategy leads to profits in most cases, the profits are largely consumed by the trading costs. The second trading strategy entails using single stock futures and it is shown to have more potential as a statistical arbitrage approach to construct a portfolio...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to identify and measure explanatory factors of observed credit spreads in the Nordic corporate high yield bond market in the period 2000 – 2012. From literature on credit pricing, we found three sources of risk compensation worth investigating; default risk, liquidity risk, and market risk. Our high yield sample consists of 323 bond issues, whereas 49 defaulted during the period. Our spread analysis is twofold. First, we utilize an extended structural credit risk model based on the classic model of Merton (1974) to estimate fair bond spreads {{based solely on the}} expected loss from defaults. Loss given default was attempted to be modeled separately, but no systematic relationship was identified, and a static estimate was used instead. Second, we attempted to explain the part of the observed credit spreads not explained by credit risk using a multivariate OLS-regression. This was done by instrumenting liquidity and market risk. Our main findings are that default risk can explain as much as 65 percent of the observed credit spreads on average. Furthermore, the credit model has significantly lower <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> for bonds involved in a credit event, implying that structural characteristics are good predictors of credit risk. The part of the credit spread not explained by default risk was 178 basis points (bps) on average in absolute terms. Our attempt at explaining the variation in mispricing with liquidity and market risk was less conclusive, but liquidity proved to be significant with a premium of 110 bps for illiquid issuers. nhhma...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} a New-Keynesian macro-finance {{model of}} the yield curve incorporating learning by private agents {{with respect to the}} long-run expectation of inflation and the equilibrium real interest rate. A preliminary analysis shows that some liquidity premia, expressed as some degree of <b>mispricing</b> <b>relative</b> to no-arbitrage restrictions, and time variation in the prices of risk are important features of the data. These features are, therefore, included in our learning model. The model is estimated on U. S. data using Bayesian techniques. The learning model succeeds in explaining the yield curve movements in terms of macroeconomic shocks. The results also show that the introduction of a learning dynamics is not sufficient to explain the rejection of the extended expectations hypothesis. The learning mechanism, however, reveals some interesting points. We observe an important difference between the estimated inflation target of the central bank and the perceived long-run inflation expectation of private agents, implying the latter were weakly anchored. This is especially the case for the period from mid- 1970 s to mid- 1990 s. The learning model also allows a new interpretation of the standard level, slope, and curvature factors based on macroeconomic variables. In line with standard macro-finance models, the slope and curvature factors are mainly driven by exogenous monetary policy shocks. Most of the variation in the level factor, however, is due to shocks to the output-neutral real rate, in contrast to the mentioned literature which attributes most of its variation to long-run inflation expectations. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{investigating}} the dynamic properties of Law of One Price (LOP) violations around periods of market distress. It studies {{the extent to which}} these violations are state-dependent and how they are related to different market conditions. The role of monetary policies and hedge funds in contributing to LOP equilibrium are also analysed. First part focuses on the construction of an LOP deviation proxy called Basis(bond), derived from the foreign-currency sovereign bond markets (in USD and Euro) of three main emerging economies (i. e. Brazil, Mexico and Turkey). It is observed that Basis(bond) moves close to zero (supporting LOP condition) during good states of economy (Pre-Crisis), whereas it becomes markedly large, persistent and volatile during bad states of economy (Credit Crisis). Second part delves deeper into why Basis(bond) deviated so markedly from zero during 2008 - 2009 Credit Crisis. We find strong evidence that rising funding costs, falling bond supply, intensified risk aversion and deteriorated default risk coupled with macroeconomic shocks are responsible in deterring arbitrageurs from exploiting the trading strategy, and inducing relative price divergence. Depending on the geography of bond issuance, there exist cross-sectional idiosyncrasies regarding the sign of deviation. While Turkey tends to pay smaller credit risk premium in Euro compared to USD, the opposite is true for Brazil and Mexico. When investors face discordant default risks across two equivalent securities, the underlying trading strategy is left unexploited. Moreover, there is strong evidence that different sets of monetary policies have different implications in resolving LOP disequilibrium. Third part investigates the impact of arbitrageurs (particularly hedge funds) in supplying liquidity to markets, and thus contributing to correct <b>relative</b> valuation of <b>mispriced</b> securities. It is confirmed that hedge fund withdrawal, due to severe capital reduction, contributes adversely to the growth of LOP deviations in credit and swap markets. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of the "limits of arbitrage" on securities mispricing. Specifically, I investigate the effect of the availability of substitutes and financial constraints on stock mispricing. In addition, this study investigates the difference in the limits of arbitrage, in the sense that it will lead to lower mispricing for these stocks, relative to non-S&P 500 stocks. I also examine if the lower mispricing can be attributed to their lower limits of arbitrage. Modern finance theory and efficient market hypothesis suggest that security prices, at equilibrium, should reflect their fundamental value. If the market price deviates from the intrinsic value, then a risk-free profit opportunity has emerged and arbitrageurs will eliminate mispricing and equilibrium is restored. This arbitrage process is characterized by large number of arbitrageurs which have infinite access to capital. However, a better description of reality is that there are few numbers of arbitrageurs to the extent that they are highly specialized; and they have limited access to capital. Under these condition arbitrage is no more a risk-free activity and can be limited by several factors such as arbitrage risk and transaction costs. Other factors that are discussed in the literature are availability of substitutes and financial constraints. The former arises as a result of the specialization of arbitrageurs in the market in which they operate, while the latter arises as a result of the separation between arbitrageurs and capital. In this dissertation, I develop a measure of the availability of substitutes that is based on the propensity scores obtained from propensity score matching technique. In addition, I use the absolute value of skewness of returns as a proxy of financial constraints. Previous studies used the limits of arbitrage framework to explain pricing puzzles such as the closed-end fund discounts. However, closed-end fund discounts are highly affected by uncertainty of managerial ability and agency problems. This study overcomes this problem by studying the effect of limits of arbitrage on publicly traded securities. The results show that there is a significant relationship between proxies of limits of arbitrage and firm specific mispricing. More importantly, empirical results indicate that stocks that have no close substitutes have higher mispricing. In addition, stocks that have high skewness show higher mispricing. Subsequent studies show that the S&P 500 stocks have different levels of liquidity, analysts’ coverage and volatility. These characteristics affect the ability of arbitrageurs to eliminate mispricing. Preliminary univariate tests show that S&P 500 stocks have, on average, lower mispricing and limits of arbitrage relative to non-S&P 500 stocks. In addition, the multivariate test shows that S&P 500 members have, on average, lower <b>mispricing</b> <b>relative</b> to non-S&P 500 stocks...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} a major challenge to neoclassical asset pricing theory - the existence of persistent arbitrage mispricing in financial markets. Many scholars, e. g. Liu and Longstaff (2004) and Shleifer and Vishny (2007), have challenged the neoclassical no-arbitrage paradigm. However, the nature of arbitrage mispricing is not yet fully understood and requires further study. The first chapter 'The TIPS [...] Treasury Bond Puzzle', jointly written with Francis A. Longstaff and Hanno Lustig, analyzes the relative pricing between U. S. Treasury Bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). We document that Treasury bonds are consistently overpriced relative to TIPS. The price of a Treasury bond can exceed that of an inflation swapped TIPS issue exactly matching the cash flows of the Treasury bond by more than $ 20 per $ 100 notional amount. The <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> of TIPS and Treasury bonds {{represents one of the}} largest examples of arbitrage ever documented and poses a major puzzle to classical asset pricing theory. We find direct evidence that the mispricing narrows as additional capital flows into the markets. This provides strong support for the slow-moving-capital explanation of arbitrage persistence. In the second chapter, I extend the analysis in the first chapter to the G 7 government bond markets and document new stylized facts about the dynamics and determinants of arbitrage mispricing in and across financial markets. The new insight for the slow-moving capital theory is that capital available to specific types of arbitrageurs is significantly related to the inflation-linked-nominal bond mispricing (ILB mispricing). Specifically, returns of hedge funds following fixed income strategies strongly predict subsequent changes in ILB mispricing, whereas other hedge fund categories lack statistically significant forecasting power. Furthermore, I analyze the effects of monetary policy on arbitrage mispricing and find that central banks have exacerbated mispricing through large-scale asset purchase programs. The third chapter extends the analysis of inflation-linked securities markets. The magnitude of deflation risk and the economic and financial factors that contribute to deflation risk are not well studied. This chapter, jointly written with Francis A. Longstaff and Hanno Lustig, presents a new market-based approach for measuring deflation risk. This approach allows us to solve directly for the market's assessment of the probability of deflation for horizons of up to 30 years using the prices of inflation swaps and options. We find that the market prices the economic tail risk of deflation very similarly to other types of tail risks such as catastrophic insurance losses. In contrast, inflation tail risk has only a relatively small premium...|$|E
