30|$|In {{contrast}} to wage <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> for other groups (such as the unemployed), a particular feature of <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> targeting the disabled {{is that both}} current and new employees can be granted a subsidy. Furthermore, especially relevant for such schemes is that the productivity of unemployed or out-of-the-labor force disabled individuals is to a larger extent unknown to employers relative to the productivity of their own disabled workforce. Thus, a wage <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> for raising the employability of the unemployed or out-of-work disabled may be used instead to subsidize the wages of disabled workers within the firm. This {{is one of the}} reasons why public <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> targeting the disabled might not in fact reduce welfare loss.|$|R
40|$|To reduce waiting {{times of}} public health services, many {{countries}} subsidize citizens to seek private care. This paper studies the efficiency of two typical subsidy schemes: unconditional and conditional. The former partially subsidizes customers seeking private care without pre-requirement whereas the latter fully subsidize those customers who have waited in the public system up to a pre-determined level. For each scheme, we consider three information scenarios, i. e., no, partial and full to represent situations where customers observe no real-time delay information, system occupancy and workload, respectively. In total we consider six combinations of <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> and information scenarios. We adopt a queueing model to study the congestion of the public system and utilize the game theory to derive customers’ equilibrium choice between {{the private and public}} systems. We then investigate the optimal design of each <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme.</b> Our results show that under the no-and partial-information scenarios, the preference over the above two <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> depends {{on the size of the}} total available budget. If such a budget is very limited, unconditional <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> generates a larger social welfare than the conditional one: otherwise, the conditional <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> prevails. Under the full-information scenario, the unconditional scheme always outperforms the conditional one. We also show that providing delay information to customers improves social welfare. Finally, we demonstrate that social welfare can be significantly improved by changing the current waiting-time-based <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> into a virtual-waiting-time-based <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an expert {{evaluation of the}} <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> for private forest plantations in Kami City, Kochi Prefecture, Japan, {{to determine whether the}} twelve currently available subsidies are designed to realize national biodiversity goals. Subsidies for forestry practices are often criticized for rarely achieving planned outcomes and for environmental threats. Threats to natural balance of private forest have been observed in Kochi Prefecture, suggesting that current forestry subsidies may not be achieving national objectives. The utilization objectives, type of management, requirements, area, intensity, and subsidy rates were contrasted to the three forest multifunctionality objectives of the National Biodiversity Strategy of Japan (NBSJ) 2012 – 2020, to identify subsidy weaknesses. Focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted in the study site, as well as Bavaria, Germany and Steiermark, Austria, to get a big picture of how experts in these comparable management areas evaluate the Kochi <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme.</b> Analyses were performed based on a combination of framework analysis and constant comparison analysis. It was found that realization of vertical multifunctionality is hindered due to lack of site-specific management. A six-point proposal for restructuring the <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme,</b> leaned on results, and the Bavarian <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> was made. To improve vertical multi-functionality, <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> should focus on forest owner integration and site-specific, long-term oriented forest works...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT By {{enabling}} {{low-income families}} {{to move from}} high- to low-poverty neigh-bourhoods, tenant-based <b>rental</b> <b>subsidies</b> for poor families {{have the potential to}} reduce the degree of economic segregation in the US. This paper provides a framework for identifying the benets and costs of such housing mobility programmes, and reviews the available empirical evidence on the net effects of quasi- or formal randomised housing mobility experiments. The best available evidence suggests that families in public housing who receive <b>rental</b> <b>subsidies</b> to move from high- to lower-poverty areas may experience reductions in welfare receipt and improvements in health status. Such moves may also improve schooling outcomes for children and reduce their problem behaviours. The benets to society from these changes are substantial when measured in dollar terms.

40|$|Extract]In this {{dissertation}} we {{have studied}} the origins of deadweight loss in employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes.</b> The disagreement between micro and macroeconometric studies of the added value of such schemes in guiding long-term unemployed back to the labour market has been {{the reason for this}} research. Microeconometric studies find positive treatment effects for participating long-term unemployed. That is, their re-employment probability improves as compared to similar non-participating long-term unemployed. Consequently, micro studies are positive about employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes.</b> Macroeconometric studies – unlike micro studies – take the overall employment effect of employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> into account and find that employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> hardly lead to additional employment. As a consequence, such studies are more conservative with respect to the role employment <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> should play in reducing long-term unemployment. Deadweight loss – the share of long-term unemployed the firm would have hired {{in the absence of the}} subsidy – is one of the main and most harmful impediments to extending employment as a consequence of introducing the subsidy. In case of deadweight loss, the microeconomic effect (i. e. productivity gain) cannot be attributed to the subsidy, as the employee in question would also have found the job without that subsidy. The same holds for the macro effect (i. e. extending the effective labour supply). In case of deadweight loss, firms would have considered subsidized employees even without the subsidy, which implies they are already part of the effective labour supply. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a multidisciplinary study of a negotiation process between farmers and wildlife authorities which led to an agricultural <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> to alleviate conflicts between agriculture and geese in Norway. The Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus has increased considerably over the last decades and conflicts with farmers have escalated, especially at stopover sites in spring when geese feed on newly sprouted pasture grass. In Vesterålen, an important stopover site for geese in North Norway, farmers deployed scaring of geese at varying intensity dependent {{on the level of}} conflict during 1988 – 2012. We assessed the efficiency of a <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> established in 2006, in terms of its conflict mitigation, reflected in a near discontinuation of scaring activities. The presence of pink-footed geese was analysed in relation to scaring intensity, the total goose population size and the increasing occurrence of another goose species, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis. Scaring significantly affected the number of geese staging in Vesterålen, both in absolute and relative terms (controlling for total population size). The geese responded immediately to an increased, and reduced, level of scaring. Despite the establishment of the <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme,</b> the number of pink-footed geese has recently declined which is probably caused by the increasing number of barnacle geese. For the farmers, the <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> provides funding that reduces the economic costs caused by the geese. Sustaining a low level of conflict will require close monitoring, dialogue and adaptation of the <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> to cater for changes in goose populatio...|$|R

This paper takes advantage of the rationing of housing subsidies by identifying labor supply effects using analytic methods that could not be validly applied to unrationed programs.

Federal <b>rental</b> <b>subsidies</b> delivered through the public housing and Section 8 voucher and certificate programs impose effective marginal tax rates as high as 30 % on households as their earnings rise. In addition, the subsidy programs provide a substantial source of unearned income to recipients and require nonrecipients on waiting lists to maintain low incomes {{in order to remain}} eligible. These characteristics would be expected to reduce labor supply among those households that are potentially eligible for housing assistance.

Moreover, {{we are able to}} estimate the causal effect of the <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> on the merger decisions using a regression discontinuity design. We find that the local political environment is relevant for the merger decision making. The results are consistent with politicians? strategic behavior concerning private incentives on municipal employment possibilities and re-election. Furthermore, more concentrated political power at the local level seems to promote merging and different political parties hold different views concerning merging. The central government merger <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme</b> has an effect on the type of mergers that took place. Overall, the results imply that local politics may hinder optimal coalition formation and that the central government may act as a corrective force by using an appropriate <b>subsidy</b> <b>scheme.</b> Coalition formation, Local politics, Merger subsidy, Choice based sampling, Regression discontinuity design...|$|R

In addition, introducing a conditional payment improves {{the efficiency of the}} mechanism and in some cases improves its effectiveness, despite identical game-theoretic predictions. By drawing an analogy between agri-environmental contracts and <b>subsidy</b> <b>schemes</b> in threshold public goods, these results suggest that the performance of environmental contracts (such as agri-environmental schemes) could be improved in the case of threshold effects of pollution on the environment by introducing a collective conditionality on contract payments...|$|R
