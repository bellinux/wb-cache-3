5|$|In 1968, the Stones, {{following}} a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> van {{and created a}} mobile recording studio {{so that they would}} not be limited to the standard 9–5 hours most recording studios operated by. The band lent the mobile studio out to other artists, including Led Zeppelin, which used it to record Led Zeppelin III(1970) andLed Zeppelin IV(1971).|$|E
5|$|Before Indiana {{became a}} state, the Indiana Territory had two governors. William Henry Harrison, the first governor, built a plantation-style home in Vincennes, and named it Grouseland for its many birds. Built in 1804, {{it was one}} of the first brick {{buildings}} in the territory. The home is still preserved and is a National Historic Landmark. Thomas Posey, the territory's second governor, had a home built in Corydon, but lived there only briefly before moving to Jeffersonville where he rented a <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> boarding house. The Posey House is preserved as part of a National Historic District.|$|E

5|$|Demos {{of the new}} {{material}} were sent to British producer Ken Nelson (Coldplay, Gomez). The band members considered him to be an unattainable candidate as a producer, but he responded favourably. Upon learning that {{he was interested in}} working with them, they moved to London. At the time, Nelson was occupied working with Coldplay. For eight to ten months, the band lived in adverse conditions in one <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> house in London. During this period, the members took up menial employment opportunities. Picchio sold double-glazing over the telephone. Moule worked in a pub and in a car workshop, and Joel worked on a farm.|$|E
5|$|Green was {{released}} from the police station in the early morning of October 24 after questioning. With the family home burned down, she had nowhere to stay. Farrar refused to let her stay in his apartment, but gave her some cash, and she rented a <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> local hotel. Ellen Ryan, Green's divorce lawyer, found her there later in the day in a distraught state. She repeatedly asked Ryan whether her children had died, chanted rhythmically about their deaths, and seemed unable to care for herself. Green was transported to a local hospital for treatment but remained emotionally unstable, suffering from insomnia and appearing to Ryan to be unable to take care of day-to-day life, even after her release from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the established church, a variety of Reformed denominations have been practised in Royton. The Religious Society of Friends were recorded as holding conventicles in Heyside in {{as early as the}} 1650s. A Baptist meeting place was erected in 1775. Congregational preachers regularly visited Royton, {{but it was not until}} 1854 that a workshop was established in the town. Primitive Methodism was established in Royton in a <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Royley building, with its first purpose-built church being erected in 1867.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Robert Mulligan, and starred Gary Grimes as Hermie, Jerry Houser as his best friend Oscy, Oliver Conant as their nerdy young friend Benjie, Jennifer O'Neill as Hermie's mysterious love interest, and Katherine Allentuck and Christopher Norris {{as a pair of}} girls whom Hermie and Oscy attempt to seduce. Mulligan also has an uncredited role as the voice of the adult Hermie. Maureen Stapleton (Allentuck's real-life mother) also appears in a small, uncredited voice role (calling after Hermie as he leaves the house in an early scene, and after he enters his <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> later scene).|$|E

However, the Emperor reappears in the throne <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new demonic form, {{revealing}} he has returned from Hell {{with the intention}} of destroying the entire world. The party and Leon escape Palamecia Castle with the wyvern, as the castle is replaced with the palace of Hell, Pandaemonium. Leon agrees to help the group seal the Emperor away. The party travels to the Jade Passage, an underground passage to the underworld, and finds the portal to Pandaemonium, where they finally defeat the Emperor. Afterwards, Leon chooses to leave in response to the trouble he caused, though Firion assures him that he'll be welcomed back if and when he returns.|$|E

5|$|The sixth mission {{began in}} 2010 as an {{extension}} of the fifth Mission theme of autonomous indoor flight behavior, however the sixth mission demanded more advanced behaviors than were currently possible by any aerial robot extant in 2010. This espionage mission involved covertly stealing a flash drive from a particular <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> building, for which there was no a priori knowledge of the floor plan, and depositing an identical drive to avoid detection of the theft. The 2010 Symposium on Indoor Flight Issues was held concurrently at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayagüez during the 20th anniversary competition. The Official Rules for the 6th Mission are available at the Competition web site.|$|E

When Lennon married Cynthia Powell, on 23 August 1962, Epstein served as best man and paid for the couple's celebration lunch afterwards. During Cynthia's pregnancy Epstein paid for a private <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hospital and offered the Lennons the sole use of his flat on Falkner Street, Liverpool, when they needed a home. He also agreed to be godfather to Lennon's son Julian.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Macdonald {{maintained}} ties to {{his alma}} mater, St. Francis Xavier University. He received an honorary {{doctor of laws}} degree from St. FX in 1946. He served as honorary chair and fundraiser for the university's centennial celebrations in 1953 and raised money to support student research into {{the early history of}} the Scots in Nova Scotia. Macdonald suggested that the reading <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new university library be called the Hall of the Clans. St. FX adopted the idea and decided to name the library in his honour. Thus, when the Angus L. Macdonald Library officially opened on July 17, 1965, 50 coats of arms representing both Scottish and Irish clans adorned the walls of its reading room.|$|E

5|$|To {{help keep}} the {{building}} cool, Belluschi added bronze-colored translucent corrugated panel sunscreens to the facade. Supported by a bronze anodized aluminum lattice, the sunscreens are made of Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas. The use of sunscreens and dark colors gave the facade a textured pattern and overall effect of avoiding making the building appear oversized. Besides the sunscreens, Plexiglas {{was used in the}} board <b>room,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few of the artistic commissions and light fixtures by designer György Kepes.|$|E
5|$|While Gascoigne was {{successful}} {{on the football}} field, his childhood was marked by instability and tragedy. Initially his family lived in a single upstairs <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> council house with a shared bathroom, and moved several times during Gascoigne's early life. When he was ten, Gascoigne witnessed the death of Steven Spraggon, the younger brother of a friend, {{who was killed in}} a traffic collision. Around this time, his father began to suffer from seizures. Gascoigne began developing obsessions and twitches, and was taken into therapy at age ten, but soon quit the therapy sessions after his father expressed doubts over the treatment methods.|$|E
5|$|Mary Phagan {{was born}} on June 1, 1899, into an {{established}} Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took {{a job with the}} National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a knurling machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked {{on the second floor of}} the factory in the metal <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.|$|E

5|$|Rise of Mana is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where the player takes control of two protagonists inhabiting a single body: the characters' genders and names can be customized prior to beginning the game. During gameplay, the character can switch between angelic and demonic forms: this enables the player to see thoughts in different non-player characters (NPCs), with each form showing {{different types of}} thought or prompting a different reaction from NPCs. The game uses a free-to-play gaming model: while the game can be downloaded and played for free, players {{have the option of}} spending money on in-game items. The characters' base is a <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small village: in the room, players can check messages, and set their current equipment and weapons. A message board in the town provides access to social features. In the town, NPC-run shops enable the crafting of new weapons and equipment in exchange for in-game currency, along with the buying and selling of various in-game items.|$|E
5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E

Next, Elliott is shown on roller skates in a white and black outfit rollerskating throughout the mansion. Shots are shown of Elliott {{in bed with a}} man and Beyoncé at a party with a guy and singing to the people there. As the song moves to Beyoncé singing the chorus, she is shown sitting on a bed and dancing in a <b>room</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> golden top and black shorts, while back at the party, she is singing for her lover and blowing him kisses. The song then moves to a verse by Mc Lyte and we see her dancing {{in the middle of a}} semi-circle of men wearing orange prison jumpsuits. Scenes of the movie and of Mc Lyte in front of an ever-changing background are intercut throughout this.|$|E
