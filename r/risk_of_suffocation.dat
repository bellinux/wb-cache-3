500|$|The Museum of Modern Art in New York City {{recognised}} the Bic Cristal's {{industrial design}} by introducing {{it into the}} museum's permanent collection. Its hexagonal shape resembles the typical wooden pencil and grants strength and three grip points giving high writing stability. The pen's transparent polystyrene barrel and polypropylene tube show the ink-level. A tiny hole in the barrel's body maintains the same air pressure {{inside and outside the}} pen. The thick ink flows down due to capillary action from the tube inside the barrel, to feed the ball bearing, which spins freely within a brass tip. In 1961 the stainless steel ball was replaced with much harder tungsten carbide. This ballpoint is first vitrified by heat, then ground down and milled to an accuracy of [...] between spinning plates coated with industrial diamond abrasives. Since 1991 the pen's streamlined polypropylene cap has had a small hole to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>suffocation</b> if the cap is inhaled. Polypropylene is used instead of polystyrene because it absorbs impact better, reducing the chance of the pen cracking or splitting if it is dropped onto the cap.|$|E
60|$|The sudden {{glare of}} light {{suggested}} to the stupified and astonished object of popular hatred {{the possibility of}} concealment or escape. To rush to the chimney, to ascend it at the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>suffocation,</b> were the only means which seemed to have occurred to him; but his progress was speedily stopped by one of those iron gratings, which are, {{for the sake of}} security, usually placed across the vents of buildings designed for imprisonment. The bars, however, which impeded his farther progress, served to support him in the situation which he had gained, and he seized them with the tenacious grasp of one who esteemed himself clinging to his last hope of existence. The lurid light which had filled the apartment, lowered and died away; the sound of shouts was heard within the walls, and on the narrow and winding stair, which, eased within one of the turrets, gave access to the upper apartments of the prison. The huzza of the rioters was answered by a shout wild and desperate as their own, the cry, namely, of the imprisoned felons, who, expecting to be liberated in the general confusion, welcomed the mob as their deliverers. By some of these the apartment of Porteous was pointed out to his enemies. The obstacle of the lock and bolts was soon overcome, and from his hiding place the unfortunate man heard his enemies search every corner of the apartment, with oaths and maledictions, which would but shock the reader if we recorded them, but which served to prove, could it have admitted of doubt, the settled purpose of soul with which they sought his destruction.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{cushioning}} {{design of}} the orbs prevent many serious injuries, light injuries such as bruises and grazes can often be sustained by colliding with objects or tripping whilst the orb is rolling down an incline. Even though severe injury is rare, there have been cases of children passing out {{due to lack of}} air, and even some deaths.

50|$|Co-sleeping also {{increases}} the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>suffocation</b> and strangulation. The soft {{quality of the}} mattresses, comforters, and pillows may suffocate the infants. Some experts, then, recommend that the bed should be firm, {{and should not be}} a waterbed or couch; and that heavy quilts, comforters, and pillows should not be used. Another common advice given to prevent suffocation is to keep a baby on its back, not its stomach. Parents who roll over during their sleep could inadvertently crush and/or suffocate their child, especially if they are heavy sleepers, over-tired or over-exhausted and/or obese. There is also the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the baby falling to a hard floor, or getting wedged between the bed and the wall or headboard. A proposed solution to these problems is the bedside bassinet, in which, rather than bed-sharing, the baby's bed is placed next to the parent's bed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo examine {{trends in}} {{reporting}} injury {{as a cause}} of death among people with epilepsy in the U. S. during the past three decades. MethodWe analyzed the U. S. multiple causes of death data from death certificates in 1981 – 2010 to compare rate and odds ratios (OR) of reporting injury as cause of death among cases with vs. without mention of epilepsy across years. ResultsThe trends in reporting epilepsy with and without injury were similar in most age groups but were inconsistent in most external causes of injury. The OR of reporting injury was 1. 02 (95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0. 97 – 1. 07) in 1981 – 1985 and decreased to 0. 52 (95 % CI 0. 48 – 0. 55) in 2006 – 2010. The decline in OR was prominent among people aged 15 – 24 followed by people aged 25 – 44. For the five external causes of injury, the OR <b>of</b> <b>suffocation</b> and drowning were 6. 32 (95 % CI 5. 91 – 6. 75) and 5. 64 (95 % CI 5. 16 – 6. 16) in 1981 – 1985 and decreased to 3. 03 (95 % CI 2. 74 – 3. 35) and 2. 56 (95 % CI 2. 18 – 3. 00) in 2006 – 2010. The OR for poisoning and traffic crashes were 0. 70 (95 % CI 0. 57 – 0. 85) and 0. 08 (95 % CI 0. 07 – 0. 09) in 1981 – 1985 and 0. 21 (95 % CI 0. 18 – 0. 25) and 0. 06 (95 % CI 0. 05 – 0. 08) in 2006 – 2010. ConclusionThe <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> fatal injury among people with epilepsy decreased drastically during the past three decades in most age groups and for most external causes of injury except falls. People with epilepsy had lower <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> dying from injury due to poisoning or traffic crashes, had higher <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> dying from <b>suffocation</b> and drowning...|$|R
50|$|Bumpers (cushioning) are {{marketed to}} keep {{children}} from bumping against the hard sides and hurting themselves or becoming entrapped between the crib slats; breathable bumpers {{are intended to}} reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>suffocation.</b> According to 2011 guidelines on safe sleep and SIDS prevention for babies released by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), traditional crib bumper pads should not be used. Their review shows no evidence that traditional crib bumpers protect against injury, but they do carry a potential <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>suffocation,</b> strangulation, or entrapment because infants lack the motor skills or strength to turn their heads if they roll into something that obstructs their breathing. In fact, the sale of traditional crib bumpers has been banned in Chicago and Maryland, with the exemption of mesh alternatives or ones that wrap along the crib rails. Children's product safety non-profit, Kids In Danger is actively working to ban the sale of traditional crib bumpers in Illinois and throughout the country.. The ASTM F15.19 Infant Bedding SubCommittee is actively working to create additional testing standards and revised standards language.|$|E

50|$|Here, Pedrick {{suggests}} that fire curtains could be secured at the roof {{level of a}} high-rise building. When released, they would envelope substantially the entire building. The curtains could be provided with apertures which when the curtain is released are located opposite rooms in the building, these rooms being designated as ones in which the occupants should congregate {{in the event of}} fire. The concern however was that such large curtains would have prevented escape from the building as well as increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>suffocation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Humans {{and other}} animals have an exquisitely {{sensitive}} sense of smell toward the odor of low-valent organosulfur compounds such as thiols, thioethers, and disulfides. Malodorous volatile thiols are protein-degradation products found in putrid food, so sensitive identification of these compounds is crucial to avoiding intoxication. Low-valent volatile sulfur compounds are also found in areas where oxygen levels in the air are low, posing a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>suffocation.</b> It {{has been found that}} copper is required for the highly sensitive detection of certain volatile thiols and related organosulfur compounds by olfactory receptors in mice.

When installed according to fire codes the systems have an excellent safety record. To prevent such occurrences, additional life safety systems are typically installed with a warning alarm that precedes the agent release. The warning, usually an audible and visible alert, advises the immediate evacuation of the enclosed space. After a preset time, the agent starts to discharge. Accidents have also occurred during maintenance of these systems, so proper safety precautions must be taken beforehand.|$|E

In cases of acute asphyxia the histological appearance is restricted to congestion of the capillaries and veins, dispersed scattered foci of bleeding into the alveoli and, occasionally, foci of oedema. In cases <b>of</b> protracted <b>suffocation,</b> because <b>of</b> the longer time-interval between the beginning <b>of</b> <b>suffocation</b> and death, the congestion of capillaries and veins is greater, more haemorrhages in the alveoli are found and more oedema is produced. Moreover, in the alveolar spaces, free alveolar cells and multinucleated giant cells, typical <b>of</b> protracted <b>suffocation,</b> can be observed. A sufficient stimulus to produce the appearance of alveolar cells is neither the want of oxygen itself nor the changes of pH which develop during protracted suffocation...|$|R
