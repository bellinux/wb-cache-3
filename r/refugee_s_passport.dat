In March 2009, GAO reported on weaknesses in State's passport issuance process that could allow a terrorist or criminal to fraudulently acquire a genuine U. <b>S.</b> <b>passport.</b> Specifically, GAO easily obtained four genuine passports from State using counterfeit documents. In April 2009, GAO suggested that State take 5 corrective actions based on these undercover tests and State acknowledged those corrective actions. GAO was asked to perform additional proactive testing of State's passport issuance process to determine if it continues to be vulnerable to fraud. To do this work, GAO applied for seven U. <b>S.</b> <b>passports</b> using counterfeit or fraudulently obtained documents, such as driver's licenses and birth certificates, to simulate scenarios based on identity theft. GAO created documents for seven fictitious or deceased individuals using off-the-shelf, commercially available hardware, software, and materials.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony highlights {{the results of our}} March 2009 report on undercover investigative tests, which confirmed the continued existence of significant fraud vulnerabilities in this process. We also provided a letter to you in April 2009, describing our recent work on passport fraud and summarizing actions the Department of State (State) has taken to address the prior weaknesses related to fraud vulnerabilities we identified. We have found that these vulnerabilities stem from people, process, and technology. For example, the lack of training and resources provided to people contributes to vulnerabilities in the detection of fraudulent applications and counterfeit documents. The limitations in the access to inter-agency information contribute to vulnerabilities related to processes. Finally, the lack of databases and information-sharing technologies contribute to vulnerabilities in the verification of passport applicants' records. A U. <b>S.</b> <b>passport</b> not only allows an individual to travel freely {{in and out of the}} United States, but also can be used to obtain further identification documents, prove U. S. citizenship, and set up bank accounts, among other things. Because passports issued under a false identity help enable individuals to conceal their movements and activities, there is great concern that passport fraud could facilitate acts of terrorism. Further, passport fraud facilitates other crimes such as illegal immigration, money laundering, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and alien smuggling. Malicious individuals may seek to exploit vulnerabilities in State's current passport issuance process, such as a lack of due diligence on the part of examiners who screen applications, by using counterfeit or fraudulently obtained documents as proof of identity and U.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a universal digitalized biometric ID system risks normalizing and integrating mass cybersurveillance into {{the daily lives of}} ordinary citizens. ID documents such as driver’s licenses in some states and all U. <b>S.</b> <b>passports</b> are now implanted with radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. In recent proposals, Congress has considered implementing a digitalized biometric identification card—such as a biometric-based, “high-tech” Social Security Card—which may eventually lead {{to the development of a}} universal multimodal biometric database (e. g., the collection of the digital photos, fingerprints, iris scans, and/or DNA of all citizens and noncitizens). Such “hightech” IDs, once merged with GPS-RFID tracking technology, would facilitate exponentially a convergence of cybersurveillance-body tracking and data surveillance, or dataveillance-biographical tracking. Yet, the existing Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is tethered to a “reasonable expectation of privacy” test that does not appear to restrain the comprehensive, suspicionless amassing of databases that concern the biometric data, movements, activities, and other personally identifiable information of individuals. In this Article, I initiate a project to explore the constitutional and other legal consequences of big data cybersurveillance generally and mass biometric dataveillance in particular.

40|$|Abstract — New {{applications}} for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology include embedding transponders in everyday things used by individuals, such as books, payment cards, and personal identification. While RFID technology {{has existed for}} decades, these new applications carry with them substantial new privacy and security risks for individuals. These risks arise due {{to a combination of}} aspects involved in these applications: 1) The transponders are permanently embedded in objects individuals commonly carry with them 2) Static data linkable to an individual is stored on these transponders 3) The objects these transponders are embedded in are used in public places where individuals have limited control over who can access data on the transponder. In 2002, the U. S. Department of State proposed the adoption of an “electronic passport,” which embedded RFID transponders into U. <b>S.</b> <b>passports</b> for identification and document security purposes. In this paper, we use the U. S. Government’s adoption process for the electronic passport as a case study for identifying the privacy and security risks that arise by embedding RFID technology in “everyday things. ” We discuss the reasons why the Department of State did not adequately identify and address these privacy and security risks, even after the government’s process mandated a privacy impact assessment. We conclude with recommendations to assist government as well as industry in early identification and resolution of relevant risks posed by RFID technology embedded in everyday things. I...|$|R

This study combined the theoretical concepts of Cameron 2 ̆ 7 s internal security management model with the external trust models of the Liberty Alliance and Microsoft 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Passport</b> software. The research question revolved around the identity and access management framework used by 13 community colleges in Texas to track guest users and the college 2 ̆ 7 s ability to protect the college from illegal acts. Using a grounded theory approach, data were collected by interviewing 13 information technology management professionals at the community colleges regarding their security policies and procedures as well as by campus observations of security practices.

Reasons for not tracking guest access included lack of financial and technology resources and process knowledge. Based on these findings, the identity management infrastructure theory was recommended for network access control, self-registration, and identity authentication at these colleges and many other colleges. The implications for social change include raising awareness of the risks most community colleges face from network security breaches, regulatory noncompliance, and lawsuit damages that could result from the lack of an identity management process...|$|R
