2500|$|Since the 1980s, the big-bang {{theory has}} been the {{prevailing}} cosmological model for the universe. It was envisioned by a Roman Catholic priest, Monsignor Georges Lemaître in the 1930s. Lemaître suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that at some finite {{time in the past}} all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a [...] "primeval atom" [...] where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence. However, in the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist subscribed to a view that the universe is in an eternal steady state. After Lemaître proposed his theory, some scientists complained that its assumption that time had a beginning amounted to a <b>reimportation</b> of religious concepts into physics. When the expression [...] "Big Bang" [...] was coined by Fred Hoyle in 1949, he meant it to be slightly pejorative, but the term stuck and gained currency. Lemaître himself concluded that an initial [...] "creation-like" [...] event must have occurred. The Big-Bang is contrary to young-Earth creationism, sensu stricto. But it has been welcomed by other Christian creeds, and it is in line with the Roman Catholic concept of creation. Under the Anthropic principle, by which the properties of the universe is seemingly fine-tuned for our own existence, some Christians see evidence that a divine creator has purposefully designed the universe.|$|E

50|$|It {{should be}} noted however that behaviorism was {{to a large extent}} {{restricted}} to North America and the cognitive reactions were in large part a <b>reimportation</b> of European psychologies. George Mandler has described that evolutionary history.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} stage, the ideas are {{exported}} back to India {{by the former}} disciple and/or his followers for consumption. Malhotra cites numerous examples to support this theory, dating from the erasure of Upanishadic and Vijnanavada Buddhist influences on Plotinus to the modern day <b>reimportation</b> of Christian yoga into India.|$|E
50|$|Very high {{excise taxes}} on {{alcohol in the}} Nordic {{countries}} has resulted in considerable <b>reimportation</b> of alcohol and conflicts with European Union legislation. For example, Åland, an autonomous province of Finland, declined membership in EU. The consequence {{is that it is}} not a part of the EU VAT area and ships stopping at Mariehamn, Åland can sell tax-free alcohol, much of which is often Finnish-produced.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to {{the issue}} of <b>reimportation</b> of {{pharmaceuticals}} into the U.S. market, the GAO report also highlights a similar phenomenon in textbook distribution. Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in <b>reimportation</b> on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels. While the 1998 Supreme Court decision Quality King v. L'anza protects the <b>reimportation</b> of copyrighted materials under the first-sale doctrine, textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors. Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States. [...] For example, some U.S. booksellers arrange for drop-shipments in foreign countries which are then re-shipped to America where the books can be sold online at used prices (for a [...] "new" [...] unopened book). The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.|$|E
50|$|To this end, Kucinich {{prefers a}} {{national}} health insurance program {{for health care reform}} in the United States. He is a cosponsor of HR 676, a bill to do this by extending the national insurance program for the elderly, Medicare, to all American citizens. He also supports the lifting of the prohibitions on the <b>reimportation</b> of prescription drugs from Canada and on Medicare negotiating prescription drug prices with drug companies.|$|E
50|$|Re-{{importation}} or <b>reimportation</b> is {{the importation}} of goods into a country which had previously been exported from that country. A number of legal issues arise with the re-importation of goods, particularly where the goods were not designed {{for sale in the}} country from which they were initially exported. Because prices differ from one country to another, a re-importer may purchase goods in another country where they are sold at a low price and re-import them in order to undercut the price at which the goods are being sold in the country to which they are imported. Such re-imported goods may constitute grey market goods.|$|E
50|$|In {{previous}} negotiations, the United States {{had pushed}} for a single comprehensive agreement to reduce trade barriers for goods, while increasing intellectual property protection. Specific intellectual property protections could include Digital Millennium Copyright Act-style copyright protections similar to the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Another protection would likely restrict the <b>reimportation</b> or cross-importation of pharmaceuticals, similar to the proposed agreement between the United States and Canada. Brazil proposed a three-track approach that calls {{for a series of}} bilateral agreements to reduce specific tariffs on goods, a hemispheric pact on rules of origin, and a dispute resolution process; Brazil proposed to omit the more controversial issues from the FTAA, leaving them to the WTO.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2004 Rost {{testified at}} a Congressional hearing over the <b>reimportation</b> of drugs, {{in which he}} stated that [...] "Holding up a vote on importation, {{stopping}} good importation bills has a high, high cost not just in money, but in American lives. Every day we delay, Americans die because they cannot afford life-saving drugs." [...] Pfizer responded by sending a letter to Congress that said, [...] "Dr. Rost has no qualifications to speak on importation, no responsibilities in this area at Pfizer, {{no knowledge of the}} information and analysis Pfizer has provided to the government on this issue, and no substantive grasp of how importation may impact the safety of this nation's drug supply." [...] Rost followed up that testimony with an opinion piece published by the New York Times. In mid-2005 Rost appeared on a 60 Minutes segment about drug pricing.|$|E

40|$|Background: Drug <b>reimportation</b> is {{perceived}} as a costs-cutting strategy by Americans. Nonetheless, issues such as drug safety and efficacy prevent legalization of the practice. With the contradictory views from supporters and opponents, debate on drug <b>reimportation</b> continues to snowball. The objective of this commentary is to discuss issues regarding drug <b>reimportation</b> practices in the United States (US). It also examines policy implications and potential solutions of the controversy. Findings: Comparatively inexpensive drugs available across the border help Americans relieve the burden of medication costs. Consequently, the volume of reimported drugs entering the US has considerably increased. However, these practices are illegal and legalization of drug <b>reimportation</b> is a political debate. While safety is the most important barrier for legalization, this concern does not seem to affect growing number of Americans who are getting their prescriptions filled from across the border. Canadians oppose legalization of <b>reimportation</b> in the US as it could exacerbate the problem of medication shortage in Canada. Summary: Currently, legalization of dug <b>reimportation</b> has wedged between the arguments by different groups. Until the US government finds a solution to reduce medication costs, it seems to be impossible to stop Americans from buying the comparatively inexpensive medications available across the border...|$|E
40|$|The author explores why {{our country}} has failed to devote the {{necessary}} resources to health care, and in particular prescription drug importation and <b>reimportation,</b> in an economic and legal context. He analyzes the unique market characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry, the framework of pharmaceutical drug regulation including prescription drug importation, and the regulatory structure of importation in general. Part II provides background {{on the health care}} industry and prescription drug markets in the U. S. and abroad. Part III examines legislative proposals for drug importation and <b>reimportation</b> and the controversial congressional reaction to rising prescription drug prices in the U. S. Part IV addresses counterarguments primarily put forth by pharmaceutical companies and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), against drug importation and <b>reimportation.</b> Part V discusses a variety of laws and regulations pertaining to the cross border flow of goods, services, and people into the U. S. Part VI suggests methods of reform. Part VII concludes that, regardless of whether legalized importation is the answer, safety inadequacies in the regulation of imported drugs must be improved...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceutical {{drugs are}} one of the most {{socially}} important heath care products. They are part of many individuals 2 ̆ 7 everyday lives, from the eradicating of diseases at birth to treating patients at the end of life. However, for many patients access is prevented due to expensive cost. This study explored cost-related non-adherence (CRN) and researched if <b>reimportation</b> of pharmaceutical drugs from other countries could increase patient drug adherence. The perceptions of 10 patients and 10 providers in Maine were assessed. Maine is the only state that allowed its citizens to purchase prescription drugs from abroad. The research questions addressed (a) how <b>reimportation</b> drugs could contribute to drug adherence, (b) the perceptions of patients, and (c) the perceptions of key providers of <b>reimportation.</b> This study was guided by a theoretical framework utilizing Kurt Lewin 2 ̆ 7 s theory of organizational change. Participants answered 15 open-ended questions. The study utilized a qualitative grounded theory approach; data were analyzed inductively. The research demonstrated that patients and healthcare providers had positive perceptions for a <b>reimportation</b> policy. Future research of other regions for this topic should prevail. Member checking was used to validate the emerging theories of increased long term drug adherence incentivized by affordable drug cost, which contributes to perception of competence, better management of current disease, and decreased safety concerns. Positive social change implications can be achieved through savings to the health-care industry by creating a pathway to affordable drugs that will bring more drugs to market and create a competitive structure that can drive down pricing...|$|E
40|$|We {{found that}} the {{presentation}} of a H- 2 Kd-restricted determinant from influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) to T cells is strictly dependent on expression of the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP), regardless of whether NP is expressed as a cytosolic or secreted NP (SNP). Introducing an N-linked glycosylation site into the determinant selectively reduced presentation of SNP. This indicates that glycosylation does not interfere with TAP-transported peptides, and therefore that cytosolic peptides derived from SNP must {{have been exposed to}} the glycosylation machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before their existence in the cytosol. Based on these findings, we propose that TAP-dependent processing of at least some ER-targeted proteins entails the <b>reimportation</b> of protein from the secretory pathway to the cytosol, where the protein is processed via the classical pathway...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how pharmaceutical R&D was impacted by two threats of price controls: Clinton's Health Security Act of 1993 and Clinton's signing of drug <b>reimportation</b> legislation in 2000. Firms with higher fraction of U. S. sales decreased their research intensity relative to firms with mainly foreign sales following the 1993 threat, {{but not the}} 2000 threat. Additionally, brand-name pharmaceutical firms, characterized by large R&D expenditures decreased their R&D efforts post 1993 threat relative to firms that did not engage in as much innovative R&D. Acknowledgements: I {{would like to thank}} Professor Petra Moser for introducing me to economics research and guiding me throughout the research process. I am also grateful to Professor Mark Tendall for his assistance during Summer Research Program and Professor Marcelo Clerici-Arias for awakening my passion for economics in Econ 1 A...|$|E
40|$|Political {{pressure}} in the United States is again building to constrain pharmaceutical prices either directly or through legalized <b>reimportation</b> of lower-priced pharmaceuticals from foreign countries. This study uses the Clinton Administration's Health Security Act (HSA) of 1993 as a natural experiment to show how threats of price constraints affect firm-level R&D spending. We link events surrounding the HSA to pharmaceutical company stock price changes and then examine the cross-sectional relation between the stock price changes and subsequent unexpected R&D spending changes. Results show that the HSA had significant negative effects on firm stock prices and R&D spending. Conservatively, the HSA reduced R&D spending by $ 1. 6 billion, even though it never became law. If the HSA had passed, and had many small firms not raised capital {{just prior to the}} HSA, the R&D effects could have been much larger. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, public {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the need for affordable prescription drugs. Although Congress has recently enacted a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, many private citizens and state and local governments continue to reimport prescription drugs from Canada {{to take advantage of the}} lower drug prices available in Canada. Many pharmaceutical companies have responded to this phenomenon by cutting off supplies of their drugs to Canadian pharmacies engaging in reituportation. As a result, some state and local governments have initiated litigation alleging state antitrust violations. This Note addresses one of the first questions raised in U. S. antitrust litigation under the Rule of Reason—the definition of the geographic market. First, this Note surveys the current caselaw standard and the academic approaches to geographic market definition. This Note then applies these approaches, concluding that Canada may be included in any geographic market when addressing the legality of <b>reimportation</b> in an antitrust context...|$|E
40|$|The {{amendment}} to a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reauthorization bill, previously introduced as Senate Bill 334 (S. 334) Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2005 {{allows for the}} <b>reimportation</b> of prescription drugs into the United States from approximately 25 countries, including Canada via Internet pharmacies. There are no guarantees that the internet websites advertising as Canadian pharmacies are legitimate. The shipping of pharmaceutical drugs occurs through importation, which refers to drugs produced abroad then later shipped to the U. S., or re-importation, a term applied when drugs are produced in the U. S. and exported for sale to foreign countries and later imported back into the U. S. The amendment attempts to open the border doors even further by allowing increased importation of medicine and requires pharmacies and drug wholesalers to register with the FDA. The potential importers {{will be subject to}} frequent, random inspection; however, these inspections are inadequate and more must be done. Some real solutions include electronic pedigrees and authentication technologies. Also, technology must be rotated so that illegitimate manufacturers can not adapt and overcome anti-counterfeiting measures...|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} a genetic context encoding a transcriptional regulator of the Rgg {{family and a}} small hydrophobic peptide (SHP) in nearly all streptococci and suggested {{that it may be}} involved in a new quorumsensing mechanism, with SHP playing the role of a pheromone. Here, we provide further support for this hypothesis by constructing a phylogenetic tree of the Rgg and Rgg-like proteins from Gram-positive bacteria and by studying the shp/rgg 1358 locus of Streptococcus thermophilus LMD- 9. We identified the shp 1358 gene as a target of Rgg 1358, and used it to confirm the existence of the steps of a quorumsensing mechanism including secretion, maturation and <b>reimportation</b> of the pheromone into the cell. We used surface plasmon resonance to demonstrate interaction between the pheromone and the regulatory protein and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to assess binding of the transcriptional regulator to the promoter regions of its target genes. The active form of the pheromone was identified by mass spectrometry. Our findings demonstrate that the shp/rgg 1358 locus encodes two components of a novel quorum-sensing mechanism involving a transcriptional regulator of the Rgg family and a SHP pheromone that is detected and reimported into the cell by the Ami oligopeptide transporter...|$|E
40|$|Presidential {{power has}} {{provoked}} increasingly vigorous debate {{since the turn}} of this century. In recent years, scholars and lawyers have been grappling with how Congress 2 ̆ 7 s dictates may limit the President 2 ̆ 7 s Commander-in-Chief power to detain enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, to fight wars abroad, and to conduct intelligence activities at home. But policymakers have not yet explored the many possibilities for invoking the President 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Take Care 2 ̆ 2 power to change health care policy. This paper explores the scope and limits of President Barack Obama 2 ̆ 7 s ability to invoke his executive authority to reform health care. Specifically, it identifies ways the Obama Administration can use directives to: (1) expand Medicaid and SCHIP coverage through section 1115 waivers; (2) test quality initiatives through Medicare demonstration authority; (3) expand health information technology; (4) allow drug <b>reimportation</b> and experiment with contracting power under Medicare; (5) enhance patient protections and private coverage requirements; (6) lift coverage restrictions on Medicaid and SCHIP; and (7) build on the health insurance program for federal employees. Consistent with the mission of the Legal Solutions in Health Reform project, this paper does not endorse a particular policy. Instead of recommending 2 ̆ 2 what, 2 ̆ 2 it explains 2 ̆ 2 how. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|Context: Achieving {{successful}} {{eradication of}} a disease requires global cooperation to obtain a shared goal. Coordination of the endgame may seem an obvious requirement for success, {{but that does not}} ensure that cooperation will occur. Objective: To analytically explore the need for cooperation to maintain global polio eradication specifically related to creation of a global polio vaccine stockpile and coordination of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation. Design: Using risk and decision analysis and game theoretical concepts, we modeled the importance of global cooperation in managing the risks associated with polioviruses for a time horizon of 20 years after successful global disruption of circulation of wild polioviruses. Results: Countries may wish to avoid the financial costs of vaccination and risks for vaccine-associated paralytic polio following eradication of wild polioviruses, which may lead them to reduce their use of OPV. However, reducing or stopping vaccination too soon and without coordination poses serious risks, including the possibility of <b>reimportation</b> of wild polioviruses and the possibility of vaccine-derived polioviruses. Analysis of the risks for potential outbreaks suggests the need for creation and maintenance of a global stockpile of vaccine for outbreak response. Game theoretical considerations show that coordination of OPV cessation optimizes expected costs and risks globally, despite the potential perceived incentives for countries to stop OPV earlier or later than other countries, or to continue OPV use indefinitely...|$|E
