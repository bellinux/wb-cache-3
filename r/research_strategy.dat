25|$|Sahagún {{was among}} the first to develop methods and {{strategies}} for gathering and validating knowledge of indigenous New World cultures. Much later, the scientific discipline of anthropology would formalize the methods of ethnography as a scientific <b>research</b> <b>strategy</b> for documenting the beliefs, behavior, social roles and relationships, and worldview of another culture, and for explaining these factors with reference to the logic of that culture. His research methods and strategies for validating information provided by his informants are precursors of the methods and strategies of modern ethnography.|$|E
25|$|Experts, {{including}} {{director of}} the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies David Rejeski, have testified that successful commercialization depends on adequate oversight, risk <b>research</b> <b>strategy,</b> and public engagement. Berkeley, California is currently the only city in the United States to regulate nanotechnology; Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2008 considered enacting a similar law, but ultimately rejected it. Relevant for both research on and application of nanotechnologies, the insurability of nanotechnology is contested. Without state regulation of nanotechnology, the availability of private insurance for potential damages is seen as necessary to ensure that burdens are not socialised implicitly.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to discuss how}} qualitative (intensive) and quantitative (extensive) <b>research</b> <b>strategies</b> differ by contrasting epistemological and ontological aspects and how these beliefs and views fit with their different intellectual goals. Firstly, this paper discusses the importance of understanding philosophy in social science research {{and its relation to}} qualitative (intensive) and quantitative (extensive) <b>research</b> <b>strategies.</b> Then it develops by contrasting these two types of <b>research</b> <b>strategies</b> in relation to the principle orientation to the role of theory, epistemological and ontological assumptions. Epistemological assumptions consist of interpretivism for qualitative (intensive) <b>research</b> <b>strategies</b> and positivism for quantitative (extensive) <b>research</b> <b>strategies.</b> Whereas ontological assumptions constitute subjectivism/constructivism for qualitative (intensive) research and objectivism for quantitative (extensive) <b>research</b> <b>strategies.</b> Further it will explain how these two types of <b>research</b> <b>strategies</b> fit the different intellectual goals and finally concludes by discussing an alternative research strategi namely mixed method that may be employed in social science research...|$|R

500|$|Another <b>research</b> <b>strategy</b> is to {{evaluate}} the combined effectiveness {{of two or more}} drugs. The main rationale for polytherapy in MS is that the involved treatments target different mechanisms of the disease and therefore their use is not necessarily exclusive. Moreover, [...] synergies, in which a drug potentiates the effect of another are also possible. Nevertheless, there can also appear important drawbacks such as antagonizing mechanisms of action or potentiation of deleterious secondary effects. While there have been several clinical trials of combined therapy none has shown positive enough effects to merit the consideration as a viable treatment for MS.|$|E
2500|$|Cultural materialism is a {{research}} orientation introduced by Marvin Harris in 1968 (The Rise of Anthropological Theory), as a theoretical paradigm and <b>research</b> <b>strategy.</b> Indeed, {{it is said to}} be the most enduring achievement of that work. Harris subsequently developed a defense of the paradigm in his 1979 book Cultural Materialism. To Harris, cultural materialism [...] "is based on the simple premise that human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence".|$|E
