5|$|Although Nepenthes <b>rajah</b> is {{most famous}} for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host {{to a large}} number of other organisms, which are thought to form a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. <b>rajah</b> has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex <b>rajah</b> and Toxorhynchites <b>rajah.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes <b>rajah</b> is a {{slow growing}} Nepenthes. Under optimal conditions, N. <b>rajah</b> can reach {{flowering}} size within 10years of seed germination.|$|E
5|$|Another {{key feature}} of N. <b>rajah</b> is the {{relative}} {{ease with which}} {{it is able to}} hybridise in the wild. Hybrids between it and all other Nepenthes species on Mount Kinabalu have been recorded. However, due to the slow-growing nature of N. <b>rajah,</b> few hybrids involving the species have been artificially produced yet.|$|E

50|$|Neeleswaram, or Nileswaram, is the {{abbreviated}} form of Neelakanta Ishwaran. It was historically {{the seat}} of the Neeleswaram <b>Rajahs,</b> who belonged to the clans of the Kolathiri and Zamorins. The Nileshwar <b>Rajahs</b> and the Bednore Nayaks battled in this area.|$|R
50|$|The Thori {{trace their}} descent from the Suryavanshi Rajputs. They {{claim that they}} held the role of commanders in {{the army of the}} various Rajput <b>Rajahs</b> of Rajputana. As their power grew, the <b>Rajahs</b> tried to defame them. This led to a split with the wider Rajput community.|$|R
5|$|Nepenthes <b>rajah</b> is a {{carnivorous}} plant of the pitfall trap variety. It {{is famous for}} occasionally trapping vertebrates, even small mammals. There exist at least two records of drowned rats found in N. <b>rajah</b> pitchers. The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by Spenser St. John, who accompanied Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu. In 1988, Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb confirmed the plausibility of this record when they managed to observe drowned rats in a large pitcher of N. <b>rajah.</b> In 2011, {{the discovery of a}} drowned mountain treeshrew (Tupaia montana) in a N.rajah pitcher was reported.|$|E
5|$|Although N. <b>rajah</b> has a {{restricted}} distribution {{and is often}} quoted as a plant in peril, it is not rare in the areas where it does grow and most populations are now off-limits to visitors and lie in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park. Furthermore, N. <b>rajah</b> has a distinctive leaf shape {{making it difficult to}} illegally ship abroad even if the pitchers are removed, as an informed customs official should be able to identify it.|$|E

"There is {{no fear of}} the <b>rajah's</b> {{horsemen}} {{keeping up}} the pursuit, beyond halfway between Sekerah and the city; for they must know that all the zemindars and people round it are in our favour, and {{that they might be}} attacked, when beyond the limits of the <b>rajah's</b> jagheer." ...|$|R
60|$|News {{had arrived}} that the <b>rajah's</b> brother had raised {{a force of}} three {{thousand}} men; and that, with seven thousand Mahrattas, {{he was about to}} march. This force, Charlie felt certain that he could meet and defeat, in the open. But more disquieting news was that Bussy, hearing that the <b>rajah's</b> troops had been trained by an Englishman, had advised the nizam to declare for his rival, and to send a considerable force to his assistance, if necessary. Fresh messengers were sent off, with new assurances of the <b>rajah's</b> loyalty to the nizam.|$|R
60|$|Presently the {{horsemen}} opened, and {{a compact}} body of three thousand Mahratta infantry, {{accompanied by an}} equal number of the irregulars of the <b>rajah's</b> brother, advanced to the attack; while the cavalry at their sides swept down upon the flanks of the <b>rajah's</b> position, and thirty pieces of artillery opened fire.|$|R

5|$|Islam {{then started}} {{to spread out}} of Mindanao {{in the south and}} went into Luzon in the north. Manila in Luzon was Islamized during the reign of Sultan Bolkiah in 1485 to 1521. This was {{accomplished}} because the Sultanate of Brunei subjugated Tondo by defeating <b>Rajah</b> Gambang in battle and thereafter installing the Muslim <b>rajah,</b> <b>Rajah</b> Salalila to the throne and by establishing the Bruneian puppet-state of the Rajahnate of Maynila. Sultan Bolkiah also married Laila Mecana, the daughter of Sulu Sultan Amir Ul-Ombra to expand Brunei's influence in both Luzon and Mindanao. The Muslims then proceeded to wage wars and conduct slave-raids against the Visayans. Participating in the Muslim raids, the Sultanate of Ternate consequently destroyed the Kedatuan of Dapitan in Bohol. The Rajahnates of Butuan and Cebu also endured slave raids from, and waged wars against the Sultanate of Maguindanao.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes <b>rajah</b> is {{also known}} to {{occasionally}} trap other small vertebrates, including frogs, lizards and even birds, although these cases probably involve sick animals, or those seeking shelter or water in the pitcher, and certainly do not represent the norm. Insects, and particularly ants, comprise the majority of prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers. Other arthropods, such as centipedes, also fall prey to N. <b>rajah.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nepenthes <b>rajah</b> is {{most famous}} for the giant urn-shaped traps it produces, which can grow up to 41cm high and 20cm wide. These are capable of holding 3.5litres of water and in excess of 2.5 litres of {{digestive}} fluid, making them probably {{the largest in the}} genus by volume. Another morphological feature of N. <b>rajah</b> is the peltate leaf attachment of the lamina and tendril, which is present in only a few other species.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes <b>rajah</b> usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. <b>rajah</b> can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|The 1300s saw {{the arrival}} and {{eventual}} spread of Islam in the Philippine archipelago. In 1380, Karim ul' Makdum and Shari'ful Hashem Syed Abu Bakr, an Arab trader born in Johore, arrived in Sulu from Malacca and established the Sultanate of Sulu by converting Sulu's <b>rajah,</b> <b>Rajah</b> Baguinda Ali and marrying his daughter. At {{the end of}} the 15th century, Shariff Mohammed Kabungsuwan of Johor introduced Islam in the island of Mindanao and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao. The sultanate form of government extended further into Lanao.|$|E

5|$|Charles Anthoni Brooke succeeded {{his uncle}} in 1868 {{as the next}} White <b>Rajah.</b> Under his rule, Sarawak gained Limbang and the Baram and Trusan valleys from the Sultan of Brunei, later {{becoming}} a protectorate in 1888 with Britain handling foreign affairs but the Brooke government retaining administrative powers. Domestically, Brooke established the Sarawak Museum – the oldest museum in Borneo – in 1891, and brokered a peace in Marudi by ending intertribal wars there. Economic development continued, with oil wells drilling from 1910 and the Brooke Dockyard opening two years later. Anthony Brooke, who would become <b>Rajah</b> Muda (heir apparent) in 1939, was born in 1912.|$|E
50|$|According to {{yet other}} Bruneian oral traditions, the Sultanate of Brunei under Sultan Bolkiah {{attacked}} {{the kingdom of}} Tondo, and established Selurong on the opposite bank of Pasig River. The traditional <b>Rajahs</b> of Tondo, like Lakandula, retained their titles and property but the real political power came to reside in the House of Soliman, the <b>Rajahs</b> of Maynila.|$|R

5|$|Nepenthes <b>rajah</b> {{has always}} been {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the more difficult Nepenthes species to cultivate. However, in recent years, it has become apparent that the plant may not be deserving of its reputation.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes <b>rajah,</b> like {{virtually}} all {{species in the}} genus, is a scrambling vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (≤30mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. <b>rajah</b> does not produce runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue culture, where numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E
5|$|Other known localities of wild N. <b>rajah</b> populations {{include the}} Marai Parai plateau, Mesilau East River near Mesilau Cave, the Upper Kolopis River, {{and the eastern}} slope of Mount Tambuyukon. On Pig Hill, N.rajah grows at 1950–2320m and is {{sympatric}} with N.burbidgeae, N.tentaculata, and the natural hybrid N.×alisaputrana.|$|E
