5000|$|Semiconductor {{implementations}} of crossbar switches typically {{consist of}} a set of input amplifiers or <b>retimers</b> connected to a series of metalizations or [...] "bars" [...] within a semiconductor device. A similar set of metalizations or [...] "bars" [...] are connected to output amplifiers or <b>retimers.</b> At each cross-point where the [...] "bars" [...] cross, a pass transistor is implemented which connects the bars. When the pass transistor is enabled, the input is connected to the output.|$|R
40|$|Compiling perfect, uniform {{dependence}} loops to fpga based co-processors normally yields processor (pe) arrays where a pe executes {{one instance}} of the loop body per clock cycle. We develop a transformation framework in which the derived pe can be systematically and automatically pipelined through retiming. We use well known transformations— skewing and serialization, by which an arbitrary number of registers may be placed at the pe outputs. They are then moved into the pe data-path using standard commerecial circuit <b>retimers.</b> Our experiments (based on performance estimates after place-and-route) have been very encouraging. For a number of examples we have seen dramatic performance improvements: speed increases of {{an order of magnitude}} with relatively little (always less than 100 %) area overhead...|$|R
40|$|Network algebra (NA) is {{proposed}} as a uniform algebraic {{framework for the}} description (and analysis) of data ow networks. The core of this algebraic setting is provided by an equational theory called Basic Network Algebra (BNA). It constitutes a selection of primitives and identities from the algebra of flownomials due to [Ste 86] and [CaS 88 & 89]. Both synchronous and asynchronous data ow networks are then investigated {{from the viewpoint of}} network algebra. To this end the NA primitives are defined such that the identities of BNA hold. These axioms are particularly strict {{about the role of the}} connections, which will be called flows of data. We describe three interpretations of the connections that satisfy the BNA identities: minimal stream delayers, stream delayers and stream <b>retimers.</b> Each of the above possibilities leads to a class of data ow networks: synchronous data ow networks, asynchronous data ow networks and fully asynchronous data ow networks, respectively. For each case stream transformer and process algebra models are introduced and compared...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new block-based motion {{estimation}} strategy, which aims at correctly finding {{the velocity of}} picture blocks, even for background blocks in occlusion areas. This tritemporal ME calculates the motion between two pictures, switching the ME reference plane dependent on an occlu. sion detector. also introduce a <b>retimer,</b> which can transform, locally in the picture, motion vectors valid for one time instant to another time instant. The <b>retimer</b> uses a foreground/background detector, of which we describe three varieties. Occlusion {{is a problem that}} plagues all block based motion estimation methods, and hence we see a utility of our method for applications like e. g. picture rate conversion, video compression, 3 D matching or image sequence object extraction. An evaluation of the tritemporal estimator is included. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there is}} a great {{interest}} in pushing communication technologies to 100 Gb/s. However, there are still many challenges to perform high speed (> 40 Gb/s) clock and data recovery, and data time-division-multiplexing (TDM). Here, we propose and numerically analyze an asynchronous optical packet <b>retimer</b> using parabolic or sinusoidal phase modulation and linear dispersion. This scheme is named pulse position locking (PPL). Numerical simulation shows that this scheme can effectively resynchronize input signals with arbitrary delays to the local clock, and reduce input jitter. The scheme can also be applied to TDM 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s signals to over 100 Gb/...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{interpolated}} images in picture rate upconversion is predominantly dependent on {{the accuracy of the}} motion vector fields. Block based MEs typically yield incorrect vectors in occlusion areas, which leads to an annoying halo in the upconverted video sequences. In the past we have developed a cost-effective block based motion estimator, the 3 D Recursive Search ME, and an improved accuracy version for tackling occlusion, the tritemporal ME. In this article we describe how the vector field from this tritemporal ME is further improved by a <b>retimer,</b> using information from a foreground/background detector. More accurate motion vector fields are of importance to other applications also (e. g. video compression, 3 D, scene analysis [...] .) ...|$|E
40|$|Optimisation is a {{requirement}} of many commercial as well as theoretical problems; the optimal use of available resources, maximising savings, minimising costs, extending useful lives, increasing time available for other tasks, using fewer resources. In many of these problems, there are reasons, geographic, political or arbitrary, for splitting the problem into smaller parts and solving them separately, but the need to optimise the combination is still present. In this report I chart the progress in two problem arenas that offer {{the potential for the}} use of a distributed method of optimisation. The first, Teaching Space Utilisation, seeks a union between local and global optima of similar problem solvers operating in a centralisable domain. The second, British Airways' Aircraft <b>Retimer,</b> shares this in part of its problem, but has additional aspects that means it cannot be centralisable, there are non-friendly, potentially hostile peers, as well as the need to integrate heterogeneous pro [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} low-voltage circuit topologies for 40 -Gb/s {{communications in}} 90 -nm and 65 -nm CMOS. A retiming flip-flop implemented {{in two different}} 90 -nm CMOS technologies employs a MOS-CML Master–Slave latch topology with only two vertically stacked transistors. Operation at 40 Gb/s is achieved {{by a combination of}} low and high- MOSFETs in the latch. Fullrate retiming with jitter reduction is demonstrated up to 40 Gb/s. Low-power broadband amplifiers based on resistor–inductor transimpedance feedback are realized in 90 -nm and 65 -nm CMOS to investigate the portability of high-speed building blocks between technology nodes. Experiments show that the transimpedance amplifier based on the CMOS inverter can reach 40 -Gb/s operation with a record power consumption of 0. 15 mW/Gb/s. A comparison between CMOS technologies underlines the importance of General Purpose rather than Low Power processes for high-speed digital design.
