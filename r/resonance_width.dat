2500|$|The {{timekeeping}} {{elements in}} all clocks, which include pendulums, balance wheels, the quartz crystals used in quartz watches, {{and even the}} vibrating atoms in atomic clocks, are in physics called harmonic oscillators. The reason harmonic oscillators are used in clocks is that they vibrate or oscillate at a specific resonant frequency or period and resist oscillating at other rates. However, the resonant frequency is not infinitely 'sharp'. [...] Around the resonant frequency there is a narrow natural band of frequencies (or periods), called the <b>resonance</b> <b>width</b> or bandwidth, where the harmonic oscillator will oscillate.

40|$|We {{employ the}} random matrix theory (RMT) {{framework}} {{to revisit the}} distribution of <b>resonance</b> <b>widths</b> in quantum chaotic systems weakly coupled to the continuum via a finite number M of open channels. In contrast to the standard first-order perturbation theory treatment we do not a priory assume the <b>resonance</b> <b>widths</b> being small compared to the mean level spacing.
