5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> of the ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest of the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 8 August, {{supported}} by the 7th Battalion of the Gloucesters and by extensive artillery and naval fire, the Wellington Battalion succeeded in capturing Chunuk Bair with relatively little resistance. Malone set about securing the crest of Chunuk Bair, but it proved difficult to deepen the relatively shallow Turkish trenches that had been captured by his men, and the work was made even more difficult as the sun rose, allowing the Turks on neighbouring Hill Q to focus their gunfire on the positions occupied by the Wellingtons. The Gloucesters, also on the crest, were forced to retreat to the <b>reverse</b> <b>slope.</b> The Turkish gunfire caused heavy casualties amongst the infantry holding Chunuk Bair, but crucially also prevented substantive reinforcements from reaching the crest in daylight. Instead, those soldiers that made it up Chunuk Bair tended to be positioned on its rearward slopes and thus had difficulty observing any approaches made by the Turks. Malone continued to co-ordinate the defences but a portion of the crest was lost. He remained in constant action, and led bayonet charges to counter numerous Turkish attacks. The trenches on the crest became filled with the bodies of dead, further reducing what little cover was available.|$|E
25|$|In the center, Clerfayt {{deployed}} five grenadier battalions in {{the villages}} of Dourlers, Mont-Dourlers, Floursies and along the Monceau Road. This east–west sunken road was located on a <b>reverse</b> <b>slope,</b> just south of Dourlers. The French Royalists and some Croatians guarded the forest to the east, while the Croatian battalion fought to the west at Saint-Aubin. The remaining battalions of Austrian regular foot and all the horse occupied a ridge behind the line of villages.|$|E
25|$|Both {{outflanking}} moves {{having failed}} {{because of the}} terrain and the weather, the British 2nd Division concentrated on attacking the Japanese positions along Kohima Ridge from 4 May onwards. Fire from Japanese posts on the <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> of GPT Ridge repeatedly caught British troops attacking Jail Hill in the flank, inflicting heavy casualties and preventing them from capturing the hill for a week. However, the various positions were slowly taken. Jail Hill, together with Kuki Picquet, FSD and DIS, was finally captured by 33rd Indian Infantry Brigade on 11 May, after a barrage of smoke shells blinded the Japanese machine-gunners and allowed the troops to secure the hill and dig in.|$|E

For {{an hour or so}} until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting some casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The Martini–Henry rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the Royal Artillery forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.|$|E

Many walkers will combine Red Pike, High Stile and High Crag in a single outing from Buttermere or Gatesgarth.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to the 3rd Marine Regiment advance was strong, {{with all}} three battalions engaged with the Japanese. The 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment—having crossed the Piva River without trouble—advanced toward a slight rise and as the lead scouts came {{over the top of}} this ridge, the Japanese opened fire from <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> {{positions}}. The scouts—having been pinned down—held their positions {{while the rest of the}} battalion moved forward with a strong charge over the ridge and cleared the area of Japanese. 90mm mortar fire then rained down on the Americans, who sheltered in the foxholes that the Japanese had dug throughout the area. Suffering a number of casualties, the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment established itself in a defensive night position.|$|E

Firing from hull down positions on the <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes</b> of hillsides, they caused the panzer forces their first combat losses. Reinforced in the afternoon by tanks from 20th Panzer Division's 21st panzer regiment, General von Funck could fend off probing attacks from the Red Army tanks and pressure the east bank, but decided to delay further advance until his supplies caught up with him.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of the landing at Nassau Bay, the Allied forces gained a vital supply point for the attack against Salamaua. Throughout early and mid-July, two more battalions of the 162nd Infantry Regiment were landed at Nassau Bay, and several Australian and US {{artillery}} batteries were also brought ashore. The larger of these pieces were used to shell Japanese positions on the <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes</b> of the ridges in the surrounding areas, as well as Salamaua itself. Meanwhile, the Allied forces began a flanking drive on Salamaua, in conjunction with further actions to the west.|$|R
25|$|The 8th Division {{advanced}} towards Westhoek {{and took}} the Blue and Black lines relatively easily. The southern flank then became exposed to the concentrated fire of German machine-guns from Nonne Boschen and Glencorse Wood {{in the area to}} be taken by the 30th Division. The difficulties of the 30th Division further south were unknown to the 8th Division until just before the 25th Brigade was due to advance over Westhoek Ridge. Brigadier-General Coffin decided that {{it was too late to}} stop the attack and sent a company of the reserve battalion to fill the gap to the south, which was not enough to stop German enfilade fire, so the Brigade consolidated on the <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> and held the crest with Lewis-gun posts. Pockets of ground lost to German counter-attacks were regained by British counter-attacks. British artillery barrages made it impossible for German infantry advance further in this area.|$|E
25|$|Fairfax {{had drawn}} up his army {{on the ridge}} a mile north of Naseby, {{although}} {{some of it was}} behind the crest on the <b>reverse</b> <b>slope.</b> Ireton's wing of five and a half regiments of cavalry was on the left. The infantry under Sergeant-Major General Sir Philip Skippon was in the centre with five regiments in the front line and three in support. A forlorn hope of 300 musketeers was deployed to the front, and two companies of Colonel Edward Harley's regiment were in reserve. A Parliamentarian engraving of the battle shows 11 pieces of artillery, in the intervals between the infantry regiments. They played little part in the battle; their first salvoes went high, and the Royalist and Parliamentarian infantry were subsequently too closely engaged for the guns to be used. Cromwell's wing, with six and a half regiments of cavalry, was on the right.|$|E
25|$|The first intimation {{that the}} British {{received}} that a withdrawal had begun was when British patrols probing German outposts towards Serre, found them unoccupied. They then began a slow follow-up but unreadiness, the decrepitude {{of the local}} roads and the German advantage of falling back on prepared lines behind rearguards of machine-gunners, meant that the Germans completed an orderly withdrawal. The new defences were built on a <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> (Hinterhanstellung) where there were positions behind the defences, from which artillery observers could see them, experience having showed that infantry equipped with machine-guns needed a field of fire {{only a few hundred}} yards/meters deep. Unfortunately, General Ludwig von Lauter and Colonel Kramer from OHL ignored the new thinking and in much of the new line, artillery observation posts in the front line or in front of it and the front position was on forward slopes, near crests or at the rear of long reverse slopes.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{the modern}} [...] "empty battlefield" [...] was evolving, with troops {{learning}} to avoid open spaces, and the light field gun was becoming obsolete, with an increasing use of light machine-guns, light mortars and field howitzers which, with their high trajectory, were able to drop shells onto even deeply sheltered enemy troops on <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes</b> that field guns could not reach. The 18-pounder Mk IV, with its box trail which allowed it to fire in a high trajectory, had begun its evolution into the more versatile 25 pounder gun-howitzer.|$|R
50|$|The US 45th Division's {{objectives}} {{were to be}} the village of Lagon {{and several of the}} peaks that dominated the village and the road to St Elia. Key to these was peak 769, and several days of combat around peak 769 followed, between elements of the 179th US Infantry Regiment and 2 Kompanie 131 Regiment, with the summit changing hands. Finally the Americans secured the summit for good and the 2/131 withdrew from its last positions on the <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes</b> with only 12 men and one officer remaining in the company. On 9 December the US Division attacked the Germans in Lagon, capturing the village two weeks later.|$|R

25|$|The 5th Indian Division (joined by the 89th Indian Infantry Brigade {{which was}} flown in {{to replace the}} brigade sent to Kohima) and 23rd Indian Division (later {{replaced}} by the 20th Division) tried capturing the steep ridges, such as the Mapao Spur, held by the Japanese, but found these to be almost impregnable. Allied artillery was usually unable to hit Japanese positions on the reverse slopes, and the troops often stormed the summits of the ridges, only to be driven off by mortar fire and grenades from the <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> positions. IV Corps regrouped. The 23rd Indian Division took over the defence of the Shenam Saddle, while {{from the end of}} the May, 5th Division concentrated on driving north from Sengmai up the main road through Kanglatongi, while the 20th Indian Division advanced along the tracks and the Iril River toward Litan and Ukhrul, threatening the Japanese 15th Division's lines of communication.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Maginot, Metaxas and Siegfried-type lines, {{the overall}} barrier and trench system of {{flexible}} defense lines {{were hard to}} detect. Ideally, defensive positions are in enfilade or <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> defence positions to avoid enemy’s direct fire. It was a complex net of small objects, all of them entirely adapted to the natural topography (e.g.: natural steep slopes as anti-tank wall, trenches curving as isolines). All buildings, dugouts and obstacles are adapted to the landscape and objects (fallen trees, rocks, mounds and bushes), {{and there are no}} easily targeted large objects, while Maginot-like bunkers were impossible to be camouflaged enough. Concrete MG and Gun pillboxes in the Mannerheim and Árpád lines were particularly well camouflaged, and almost all of them have enfilading field of fire (mostly enfilade-defilade combination) in order to defend anti-tank obstacles against sappers, thus none of them fires direct toward enemy's lines. Because these buildings were not exposed to the enemy's line-of-sight artillery they could have been made much thinner than the Maginot-type ones therefore vastly less installation of concrete is required per kilometer compared to other lines.|$|E
25|$|Edmonds {{wrote that}} the German attack showed that with plenty of {{artillery}} and observation over British positions, the Germans could capture {{a small part of}} the British defences. A British counter-attack would need a similar mass of artillery and if the guns had to be transferred from elsewhere, a counter-attack would have to wait, allowing the Germans more time to consolidate. The large amount of German artillery near the ridge and sapping forward from their new positions, led Allenby to suspect that the Vimy Ridge attack was a preliminary for an attack on Arras. With the German involved in offensive operations in Russia and at Verdun, Haig thought that a bigger attack was unlikely. The 6th Army had a plan for a more ambitious attack but this needed another 12 divisions and 40 batteries of heavy artillery, which were not available. Wilson thought that the British could leave things as they were, on the assumption that the Germans would be content to consolidate their gains. If the Germans intended to attack again, he wanted to conduct a similar operation against the Germans, to re-capture the top of the ridge and the German positions down the <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> as far as their mine entrances.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{day in the}} morning, Bhakti Thapa, {{at the age of}} 74, led a daring counterattack against the British force entrenched at Deothal. Historians have presented the description of this battle at great length. It was 3.15 a.m. when a force of just about 400 under Bhakti Thapa marched out of the Malaun fort, to a slow but steady beat of a drum. The British column under Thompson had taken position at Deothal on <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes.</b> The cannons of 6 pounders were properly concealed. There were two Indian battalions, the Grenadiers companies of the Light Battalions and some 1,000 irregulars. The British strength was up to about 3,500 troops and weapons.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} November 1943, 44th HuD units {{began to}} arrive and the most {{advanced}} battalions were sent forward to relieve units of the 26th Panzer Division, which were to be redeployed. The division took over its new positions including numerous protected shelters, pill boxes, and mortar positions built on <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes,</b> {{on a series of}} high mountain peaks dominating the road to St Elia and the Rapido Valley. Also in its sector was the village of Lagon, whose houses had been fortified. These positions were soon under attack by the US VI Corps, which pushed its units into the mountains, attempting to draw German reserves away from the main effort that would occur further to the south, in the Mignano Gap.|$|R
50|$|Towed {{anti-tank}} {{guns were}} thought to be the primary means of defeating tanks. At the battle of Kursk for example, the Red Army deployed more artillery regiments than infantry regiments and towed gun densities reached over 20 guns per kilometer of defended tactical zone. A towed gun was much cheaper than a tank and could be concealed in a shallow position. When time allowed, dugouts with strong overhead cover could be constructed. Guns deployed on <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes</b> and in flanking positions could take a toll of attacking tanks. However, gun crews were vulnerable to artillery, mortar HE fire and enemy infantry. Their positions had to be carefully selected and once engaged, they generally could not redeploy. Experience strongly suggested that towed AT guns were less effective than self-propelled AT weapons and took heavier casualties.|$|R
25|$|To {{extend the}} attack {{front of the}} Fourth Army, a {{subsidiary}} attack was planned at Gommecourt, forgoing a counter-attack at Vimy Ridge to recapture the ground lost in Unternehmen Schleswig-Holstein, a local German attack on 21 May, lacking the troops to conduct both attacks. In {{the first week of}} May, the 56th (1st London) Division (Major-General Charles Hull) and the 46th (North Midland) Division (Major-General Edward James Montagu-Stuart-Wortley) moved into the VII Corps (Lieutenant-General Thomas Snow) area for the attack. By 10 May, both divisions had taken over the front on the right flank of the 37th Division (Major-General A. Edward W. Count Gleichen). The 46th (North Midland) Division had to dig many long and deep communications trenches to counter the German observation over the area but in the 56th (1st London) Division area opposite the south-western face of the salient as far as Nameless Farm the trenches of both sides were level, with a dip in between, with a hedge along the bottom. Further on, both lines were {{on the west side of}} a wide valley between Rossignol Wood and Hébuterne, the British line on a forward and the German line on a <b>reverse</b> <b>slope,</b> with German artillery observation posts on the east side of the valley. The rear area of the 56th (1st London) Division was invisible to ground observers up to Hébuterne but German balloon observers kept watch. The main British posts were along the eastern fringe of Hébuterne and the ridge running south; the valley slope drained water from the area but on the 46th (North Midland) Division front the flat ground was boggy.|$|E
25|$|Technical Sergeant Ted T. Tanouye {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} extraordinary heroism in action on 7 July 1944, near Molino A Ventoabbto, Italy. Technical Sergeant Tanouye led his platoon {{in an attack}} to capture {{the crest of a}} strategically important hill that afforded little cover. Observing an enemy machine gun crew placing its gun in position to his left front, Technical Sergeant Tanouye crept forward a few yards and opened fire on the position, killing or wounding three and causing two others to disperse. Immediately, an enemy machine pistol opened fire on him. He returned the fire and killed or wounded three more enemy soldiers. While advancing forward, Technical Sergeant Tanouye was subjected to grenade bursts, which severely wounded his left arm. Sighting an enemy-held trench, he raked the position with fire from his submachine gun and wounded several of the enemy. Running out of ammunition, he crawled 20 yards to obtain several clips from a comrade on his left flank. Next, sighting an enemy machine pistol that had pinned down his men, Technical Sergeant Tanouye crawled forward a few yards and threw a hand grenade into the position, silencing the pistol. He then located another enemy machine gun firing down the slope of the hill, opened fire on it, and silenced that position. Drawing fire from a machine pistol nest located above him, he opened fire on it and wounded three of its occupants. Finally taking his objective, Technical Sergeant Tanouye organized a defensive position on the <b>reverse</b> <b>slope</b> of the hill before accepting first aid treatment and evacuation. Technical Sergeant Tanouye's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.|$|E

The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at [...] This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of Braine-l'Alleud, in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.|$|E
2500|$|The advance {{was planned}} to cover [...] and stop on <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes</b> which were easier to defend, {{enclosing}} ground which gave observation of German reinforcement routes and counter-attack assembly areas. Preparations were then made swiftly to defeat German counter-attacks, by mopping-up and consolidating the captured ground with defences in depth. The attack inflicted a severe blow on the German 4th Army, causing many losses, capturing {{a significant portion}} of the , which threatened the German hold on Broodseinde ridge. The better weather continued to benefit the British attackers by drying the ground, raising mist which obscured British infantry attacks made around dawn, then clearing to reveal German [...] formations to air and ground observation, well in advance of their arrival on the battlefield. German defensive arrangements were changed hastily after the battle to try to counter British offensive superiority.|$|R
2500|$|The French {{tactic of}} assault [...] suited the German {{defensive}} dispositions, since {{much of the}} new construction had taken place on <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes.</b> The speed of attack and the depth of the French objectives meant that {{there was no time to}} establish artillery observation posts overlooking the Ailette valley, in the areas where French infantry had reached the ridge. The tunnels and caves under the ridge nullified the destructive effect of the French artillery, which was also reduced by poor weather and by German air superiority, which made French artillery-observation aircraft even less effective. The rear edge of the German battle zone along the ridge had been reinforced with machine-gun posts and the German divisional commanders decided to hold the front line, rather than giving ground elastically; few of the Eingreif Divisions were needed to intervene in the battle.|$|R
50|$|De Négrier {{prepared}} {{the attack on}} the Western Forts with a lengthy artillery bombardment of the Chinese positions. De Saxcé and Jourdy's batteries first engaged the Chinese guns in their emplacements on the limestone massif, and by 1 p.m. had completely silenced them. The French batteries then turned their attention to the Chinese positions on the hills to the east of the Mandarin Road that ran back to the Chinese frontier. So far the French infantry on the right of de Négrier's line had shown no signs of advancing, and the Chinese defenders saw no reason to hold their ground under artillery fire. Unable to reply to the French guns, they evacuated their trenches on the forward slopes and fell back to more sheltered positions on the <b>reverse</b> <b>slopes.</b> Finally, the French guns swept the Chinese positions around the Western Forts.|$|R
