40|$|Abstract—Spectral <b>regression</b> {{discriminant}} <b>analysis</b> (SRDA) is {{an efficient}} subspace learning method proposed recently. One important unsolved issue of SRDA {{is how to}} automatically determine an appropriate regularization parameter. In this letter, we present a method to estimate the optimal regularization parameter for SRDA. We test our method in different applica-tions including head pose estimation, face recognition, and text categorization. Our extensive experiments evidently illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
