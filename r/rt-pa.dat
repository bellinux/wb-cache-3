50|$|The {{controversy}} {{over whether the}} more expensive <b>rt-PA</b> was clinically superior over streptokinase as a thrombolytic agent climaxed in the scientific press between 1988 and 1992. To end this controversy, the GUSTO trial (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries) was set up, a head-to-head comparison between <b>rt-PA</b> and streptokinase. In the GUSTO-trial 41,021 heart attack patients were treated in 1,081 hospitals in 15 countries. Cardiologist Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic (USA), statistician Robert Califf of Johns Hopkins (USA) and David Stump https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=206572&privcapId=29617 of Genentech coordinated the trial. In absolute figures the 30-day mortality rate in the <b>rt-PA</b> group was 1% lower (or in relative figures 14%) compared to the mortality in the streptokinase group. After the GUSTO studies, <b>rt-PA</b> became the thrombolytic drug of choice {{for most of the}} cardiologists in the Western world and would save the lives of many tens of thousands of heart attack patients.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of desmoteplase {{is similar to}} <b>rt-PA</b> (alteplase), {{but it does not}} contain the plasmin-sensitive cleavage site and the lysine-binding Kringle 2 domain. As a result, desmoteplase, in comparison to <b>rt-PA,</b> has high fibrin selectivity (100,000- v. 550-fold increase in catalytic activity), an absence of neurotoxicity, and no apparent negative effect on the blood-brain barrier. Desmoteplase also has a half-life of about four hours; rtPA has a terminal plasma half-life of about 5 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>rt-PA</b> (Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator), {{a protein}} enzyme that helps break up blood clots, {{is a common}} {{treatment}} for stroke.

50|$|On 12 June 1980, one {{day after}} the {{submission}} of the patent application, Collen presented the results at the Fifth Congress on Fibrinolysis in Malmö (Sweden) in the presence of Diane Pennica https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-pennica-b276284/, a young scientist from biotech company Genentech Inc, based in South San Francisco. Collen, KU Leuven and Genentech agreed to collaborate on the production of a recombinant version of t-PA (<b>rt-PA),</b> embarking on a new model for drug development: academic and biotech collaboration, today routine, but at that time a new modus operandi. Within 18 months, Pennica and her team had cloned the cDNA (complementary DNA) of human t-PA messenger RNA and was producing <b>rt-PA</b> in cultures of Chinese hamster ovary cells.|$|E
50|$|Women {{who suffer}} an acute stroke {{are more likely}} to present with {{non-traditional}} and non-neurological stroke symptoms, for example chest pain and/or shortness of breath.

50|$|On many {{occasions}} Désiré Collen expressed his frustration that {{the lives of}} many more people could have been saved, had <b>rt-PA</b> been more readily available, also to people who were not living in the affluent western world.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{together}} with Roger Lijnen https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00004959 (KU Leuven) and Osamu Matsuo (Kindai University, Osaka, Japan), Collen started {{to evaluate whether}} staphylokinase (STAR), a bacterial profibrinolytic agent with high fibrin specificity, could be a valid alternative for <b>rt-PA</b> in less wealthy territories. By setting up spin off company Thromb-X, Collen had the clear objective to further develop staphylokinase through the preclinical and clinical research phases up to the market introduction. Although wild type staphylokinase and variants with reduced immunogenicity and preserved lytic potency have been tested with success in humans, its further development came to an unfortunate standstill because of the prohibitive expense of a GUSTO-like clinical trial with a mortality end-point that had become the standard in the West. Not even licensing out the further clinical development, production and commercialization of staphylokinase to companies in developing countries (where for most people <b>rt-PA</b> is hardly available) could save this project.|$|E

40|$|The initial {{studies in}} Europe with tissue-type {{plasminogen}} activator (<b>rt-PA)</b> have been coordinated by a European Cooperative Study Group. By February 1987, 258 patients had been entered into comparative coronary patency trials of <b>rt-PA</b> versus streptokinase and <b>rt-PA</b> versus placebo (trials completed and published); 123 patients had entered a coronary patency trial of prolonged <b>rt-PA</b> infusion versus short-term <b>rt-PA</b> infusion (trial completed but results not yet published); and ? 500 patients had been recruited for left ventricular function and infarct size trials comparing <b>rt-PA</b> with placebo and <b>rt-PA</b> alone with <b>rt-PA</b> plus immediate coronary angioplasty (studies still in progress).

40|$|We used a canine {{model of}} embolic {{pulmonary}} hypertension, induced by injection of autologous radioactive blood clots, to investigate effects of recombinant {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (<b>rt-PA)</b> on dynamics of thrombolysis and on pulmonary pressure-flow (PQ) characteristics. Over 5 (<b>rt-PA</b> 5) or 15 (<b>rt-PA</b> 15) minutes, 1 mg/kg <b>rt-PA</b> was infused. Rate and extent of thrombolysis were assessed by counting over both lung fields with a gamma camera. Emboli increased mean pulmonary artery pressure from 14 to 36 mm Hg (p < 0. 005). This change was predominantly due {{to an increase in}} the effective outflow pressure (PI) (from 9 to 29 mm Hg, p<O 0. 001), obtained by extrapolation from the linear PQ relation. While pulmonary hemody-namics improved with <b>rt-PA</b> 5 and <b>rt-PA</b> 15, the change was greatest with rt-PAIs. For example, the increase in P, that occurred with embolization was abolished with <b>rt-PA</b> 15. Also, the decrease in pulmonary artery pressure was greatest with rt-PAI 5. While not significantly different, extent of total clot lysis tended to be greatest with <b>rt-PA</b> 15 (p < 0. 07).

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{limitations}} of recombinant {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (<b>rt-PA)</b> therapy for acute myocardial infarction include failure to achieve recanalization in 25 % of patients, reocclusion and reperfusion injury. IIoprost, a stable analogue of prostacyclin (PGIZ), has been demonstrated to facilitate thrombolysis and reduce myocardial stunning in experimental models. To evaluate combined therapy, <b>rt-PA</b> (100 mg 3 h) and IIoprost (2 ng/kg per min for 48 h) were administered to 25 patients and then <b>rt-PA</b> alone (same dose) was given to an additional 25 patients with evolving myocardial infarction. At 90 min after drug administration, infarct-related vessel patency was observed in 11 (44 %) of 25 who received <b>rt-PA</b> plus Iloprost compared with 15 (60 %) of 25 who received <b>rt-PA</b> alone (p = 0. 26). At 1 week, reocclusion had occurred in 3 (14 %) of 21 patients who received combined therapy compared with 6 (26 %) of 23 patients treated with <b>rt-PA</b> alone (p = 0. 46). Ejection fraction increased significantly from baseline to 7 days for <b>rt-PA</b> alone whereas it decreased with combined therapy (<b>rt-PA</b> alone: 47. 3 ± 11. 5 % at baseline to 50. 4 ± 9. 8 % at 7 days; <b>rt-PA</b> plus Iloprost: 51. 3 ± 10. 1 % at baseline to 49. 0 ± 9. 4 % at 7 days; difference between groups p = 0. 05). At 4 h after therapy, fibrinogen decreased 33 % for <b>rt-PA</b> plus Iloprost compared with a 52 % for <b>rt-PA</b> alone (p = 0. 001).

40|$|Dynamic {{coronary}} vasoconstriction {{may play}} a role in coronary artery reocclusion after successful thrombolysis. The effect of nitroglycerin on the thrombolytic effects of recombinant tissuetype plasminogen activator (<b>rt-PA)</b> was examined in dogs with an electrically induced occlusive coronary artery thrombus. Eleven dogs were randomly given <b>rt-PA</b> alone and seven <b>rt-PA</b> with nitroglycerin. The dose of <b>rt-PA</b> was 0. 75 mg/kg body weight given over 20 min and the dose of nitroglycerin was 125 μg/min for 40 min. The reperfusion rate in the dogs given <b>rt-PA</b> alone was 73 % (8 of 11 dogs) and that in the <b>rt-PA</b> plus nitroglycerin group was 57 % (four of seven dogs) (p = NS). The time to thrombolysis (or reperfusion) in dogs receiving <b>rt-PA</b> plus nitroglycerin was 70 % greater than in those receiving <b>rt-PA</b> alone (means ± SD/ 29. 8 ± 9. 9 versus 17. 6 ± 5. 9 min, p < 0. 02), and the duration of reperfusion much shorter (11 ± 17 versus 42 ± 16 min, p < 0. 02). Peak coronary blood flow after reperfusion in dogs receiving <b>rt-PA</b> plus nitroglycerin was also less than in those receiving <b>rt-PA</b> alone (36 ± 52 versus 63 ± 20 ml/min, p < 0. 02). Reocclusion occurred in all dogs given <b>rt-PA</b> with nitroglycerin and in six of eight given <b>rt-PA</b> alone (p = NS). Plasma concentrations of <b>rt-PA</b> were lower when nitroglycerin was given with <b>rt-PA</b> alone (427 ± 279 versus 1, 471 ± 600 ng/ml, p < 0. 01). In addition, whole blood platelet aggregation decreased significantly with administration of <b>rt-PA</b> alone, but not with administration of <b>rt-PA</b> with nitroglycerin (0. 23 ± 0. 57 and 5. 26 ± 6. 23 Ω, respectively, p < 0. 02). Peripheral blood platelet count decreased during thrombus formation in all dogs; with administration of <b>rt-PA</b> alone, platelet counts stabilized but continued to decrease with concurrent administration of nitroglycerin with <b>rt-PA</b> (mean platelet counts at the end of <b>rt-PA</b> infusion 7. 23 ± 1. 68 and 4. 78 ± 3. 00 × 108 /ml, respectively, p < 0. 02), suggesting continued sequestration of platelets in the intracoronary thrombus. In four additional dogs nitroglycerin was given after rt-PA-induced thrombolysis, but nitroglycerin failed to sustain coronary artery reperfusion. This study shows that 1) nitroglycerin given concurrently with <b>rt-PA</b> may have a detrimental effect on the thrombolytic potential of <b>rt-PA,</b> probably because of the reduction in plasma t-PA concentrations, and 2) nitroglycerin given after rt-PA-induced thrombolysis does not prevent coronary artery reocclusion...|$|E

By continuously counting over both lung fields with a mobile gamma camera, we correlated rate and extent of pulmonary thrombolysis with corresponding pulmonary hemodynamics. Treatment with heparin, over a 3 -hour interval, {{did not result in}} significant thrombolysis or in a decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). In contrast, <b>rt-PA</b> caused marked pulironary thrombolysis. While total clot lysis was similar when 1 mg/kg <b>rt-PA</b> was infused over 15 (<b>rt-PA</b> 15) or 90 (<b>rt-PA</b> 90) minutes (47 % and 42 %, respectively), rate of lysis during infusion was markedly increased with <b>rt-PA</b> 15 (56 % vs. 27 %/hr, p<O.

Infarct size, neurological deficit scores, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, brain hemorrhage, and expression of endogenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI- 1) were assessed. For both paradigms, hypothermia reduced infarct size and neurological deficits compared to normothermia, regardless of whether <b>rt-PA</b> was given. <b>rt-PA</b> treatment increased brain hemorrhage and BBB disruption compared to normothermia, and this was prevented by cooling. However, mortality was higher when <b>rt-PA</b> and cooling were administered at the same time, beginning 1 – 2 hours post MCAO. Endogenous tPA expression was reduced in hypothermic mice, whereas PAI- 1 levels were unchanged by cooling.

40|$|The {{formation}} and release of covalent complexes between {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) limits the application of equilibrium radioligand binding analysis to characterize the interaction between t-PA and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers. To avoid this difficulty, we used a recombinant mutant of t-PA, S 478 A <b>rt-PA,</b> in which alanine has been substituted for the active-site serine. Although the mutant is incapable of covalently reacting with PAI- 1, 125 I-labeled S 478 A <b>rt-PA</b> binding to HUVEC monolayers is specific and reversible and {{is characterized by a}} high affinity (Kd of 1. 5 nM) and a large number of sites (1. 5 x 10 (6) /cell). This binding was shown to occur through noncovalent interaction with PAI- 1 in the HUVEC monolayer by the fact that a monoclonal anti-PAI- 1 antibody (MA- 7 D 4) completely blocked S 478 A <b>rt-PA</b> binding. Two solution-phase assays with recombinant PAI- 1 (rPAI- 1) confirmed this noncovalent interaction: complexes between 125 I-S 478 A <b>rt-PA</b> and rPAI- 1 could be isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-PAI- 1 antibodies, and S 478 A <b>rt-PA</b> competed with <b>rt-PA</b> for inactivation by rPAI- 1. In contrast diisopropylphosphate <b>rt-PA</b> (in which the active site serine is chemically modified) showed minimal binding to HUVEC monolayers, as a result of impaired interaction with PAI- 1, in the two assays. Thus, both wild-type <b>rt-PA</b> and S 478 A <b>rt-PA</b> interact with the HUVEC monolayer through PAI- 1. With <b>rt-PA</b> this results in the formation of covalent <b>rt-PA.</b> PAI- 1 complexes that are released from the monolayer into the supernatant.

40|$|Background. Thrombolytic therapy (<b>rt-PA)</b> is {{approved}} for ischemic stroke presenting within 4. 5 hours of symptoms onset. The {{rate of utilization}} of <b>rt-PA</b> is not well described in developing countries. Objectives. Our study examined patient characteristics and outcomes in addition to barriers to <b>rt-PA</b> utilization in a tertiary care center in Beirut, Lebanon. Methods. A retrospective chart review of all adult patients admitted to the emergency department during a one-year period (June 1 st, 2009, to June 1 st, 2010) with a final discharge diagnosis of ischemic stroke was completed. Descriptive analysis was done followed by a comparison of two groups (IV <b>rt-PA</b> and no IV <b>rt-PA).</b> Results. During the study period, 87 patients met the inclusion criteria and thus {{were included in the}} study. The mean age was found to be 71. 9 years (SD[*]=[*] 11. 8). Most patients arrived by private transport (85. 1 %). Weakness and loss of speech were the most common presenting signs (56. 3 %). Thirty-three patients (37. 9 %) presented within 4. 5 hours of symptom onset. Nine patients (10. 3 %, 95 % CI (5. 5 – 18. 5)) received <b>rt-PA.</b> The two groups (<b>rt-PA</b> versus non <b>rt-PA)</b> had similar outcomes (mortality, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, modified Rankin scale scores, and residual deficit at hospital discharge). Conclusion. In our setting, <b>rt-PA</b> utilization was higher than expected. Delayed presentation was the main barrier to <b>rt-PA</b> administration.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Thrombolytics such as {{recombinant}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (<b>rt-PA)</b> have advanced the treatment of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. OBJECTIVE: To improve the efficacy of this thrombolytic therapy, the synergistic effect of <b>rt-PA</b> and 120 kHz or 1. 0 MHz ultrasound was assessed in vitro using a porcine clot model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fully retracted whole blood clots prepared from fresh porcine blood were employed to compare <b>rt-PA</b> thrombolytic treatment with and without exposure to 120 -kHz or 1 -MHz ultrasound. For sham studies (without ultrasound), clot mass loss was measured {{as a function of}} <b>rt-PA</b> concentration from 0. 003 to 0. 107 mg/ml. For combined ultrasound and <b>rt-PA</b> treatments, peak-to-peak pressure amplitudes of 0. 35, 0. 70 or 1. 0 MPa were employed. The range of duty cycles varied from 10 % to 100 % (continuous wave) and the pulse repetition frequency was fixed at 1. 7 KHz. RESULTS: For <b>rt-PA</b> alone, the mass loss increased monotonically as a function of <b>rt-PA</b> concentration up to approximately 0. 050 mg/ml. With ultrasound and <b>rt-PA</b> exposure, clot mass loss increased by as much as 104 % over <b>rt-PA</b> alone. Ultrasound without the presence of <b>rt-PA</b> did not significantly enhance thrombolysis compared to control treatment. The ultrasound-mediated clot mass loss enhancement increased with the square root of the overall treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: Both 120 -kHz and 1 -MHz pulsed and CW ultrasound enhanced <b>rt-PA</b> thrombolysis in a porcine whole blood clot model in vitro. No clear dependence of the observed thrombolytic enhancement on ultrasound duty cycle was evident. The lack of duty cycle dependence suggests a more complex mechanism that could not be sustained by merely increasing the pulse duration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{association}} of increasing serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products after recombinant {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (<b>rt-PA)</b> therapy with bleeding and early coronary patency was assessed in 242 patients with acute myocardial infarction. After administration of 5, 000 IU heparin, a median of 40 mg (range 35 to 60) of double chain <b>rt-PA</b> was given intravenously in 90 min. Bleeding occurred in 62 patients; in 73 % of patients it was observed within the 1 st 24 h and 84 % of events consisted of hematoma or prolonged bleeding, or both, at puncture sites. Bleeding events occurred 2. 12 times as often in patients with serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products > 85 mg/liter as in patients with serum levels < 22 mg/liter (95 % confidence interval 1. 01 to 4. 43). The infarct-related coronary vessel was patent in 65 % of patients at 90 min {{after the start of}} <b>rt-PA</b> infusion. In patients with high serum levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, coronary patency at 90 min after the start of <b>rt-PA</b> infusion was not better (13 % less, 95 % confidence interval − 33 %, 13 %) than in patients with low serum levels. This uncoupling of thrombolytic effect in terms of coronary patency and systemic fibrinogenolysis confirms the experimentally demonstrated fibrin specificity of double chain <b>rt-PA</b> in human subjects. Because fibrin specificity of single chain <b>rt-PA</b> is at least similar to that of double chain <b>rt-PA,</b> the observations in this analysis most likely hold also for single chain <b>rt-PA.</b> These findings suggest that a dose of <b>rt-PA</b> just below the threshold that causes systemic fibrinogenolysis might be optimal in terms of bleeding and coronary patency. Measurements of fibrinogen degradation products during <b>rt-PA</b> infusion might help to titrate <b>rt-PA</b> dosing in individual patients...|$|E
40|$|Acute kidney injury (AKI) {{increases}} the risk of death in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy (iv. <b>rt-PA)</b> seems to be the most effective treatment for AIS patients. The effects of AKI on iv. <b>rt-PA</b> treated AIS cases is less studied. Our paper addresses this issue. 45 consecutive stroke patients treated with iv. <b>rt-PA</b> (median age = 64 years; 29 male) and 59 age and sex matched controls not eligible for iv. <b>rt-PA</b> have been enrolled in our study. Subjects were followed-up until hospital release or death (median follow up time = 12 days). The prevalence of AKI did not differ between iv. <b>rt-PA</b> treated patients and controls (35. 5 % vs. 33. 89 %). In both groups, AKI was associated with increased in-hospital mortality: 50. 0 % vs. 3. 4 % p< 0. 0001 (in the <b>rt-PA</b> treated), and 45 % vs. 30. 7 % (in controls). AKI iv. <b>rt-PA</b> treated patients had a significantly higher risk of in hospital mortality as compared to the no-AKI iv. <b>rt-PA</b> treated (HR = 15. 2 (95 %CI [1. 87 to 124. 24]; P = 0. 011). In a Cox-multivariate model, the presence of AKI after iv. <b>rt-PA</b> remained a significant factor (HR = 8. 354; p = 0. 041) influencing the in-hospital mortality even after correction for other confounding factors. The independent predictors for AKI were: decreased eGFR baseline and elevated serum levels of uric acid at admission, (the model explained 60. 2 % of the AKI development). The risk of AKI was increased in AIS patients. Thrombolysis itself did not increase the risk of AKI. In the iv. <b>rt-PA</b> patients, as compared to non-AKI, those which developed AKI had a higher rate of in-hospital mortality. The baseline eGFR and the serum uric acid at admission were independent predictors for AKI development in the iv. <b>rt-PA</b> treated AIS patients...|$|E
40|$|A mutant of {{recombinant}} {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (<b>rt-PA),</b> {{obtained by}} deletion of residues Lys 296 to Gly 302 [rt-PA del(K 296 -G 302) ], was previously shown to be resistant to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) (Madison et al, Nature 339 : 721, 1989). This mutant was obtained by expression of its cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purification to homogeneity from conditioned cell culture medium. It was obtained as a single chain molecule with amidolytic activity, specific fibrinolytic activity, and binding to fibrin and lysine, which were comparable or somewhat {{lower than those of}} wild-type <b>rt-PA</b> obtained in the same expression system. The plasminogen-activating potential of <b>rt-PA</b> del(K 296 -G 302) in the presence of CNBr-digested fibrinogen was about twofold lower than that of wild-type <b>rt-PA.</b> The inhibition rate of <b>rt-PA</b> del(K 296 -G 302) by recombinant PAI- 1 (rPAI- 1) was more than 500 -fold lower than that of wild-type <b>rt-PA.</b> In a human plasma milieu in vitro, <b>rt-PA</b> del(K 296 -G 302) induced dose-dependent lysis of a 125 I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot; equi-effective concentrations (causing 50 % clot lysis in 2 hours) were 0. 28 micrograms/mL and 0. 36 micrograms/mL for mutant and wild-type <b>rt-PA,</b> respectively. In this system, addition of rPAI- 1 to the plasma resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of the fibrinolytic potency of <b>rt-PA</b> del(K 296 -G 302) and of rt-PA; a 50 % reduction required 2. 4 micrograms/mL and 0. 15 micrograms/mL rPAI- 1, respectively. Continuous infusion of mutant or wild-type <b>rt-PA</b> over 60 minutes in hamsters with a 125 I-labeled plasma clot in the pulmonary artery resulted in dose-dependent clot lysis, with a thrombolytic potency (percent clot lysis per milligram of compound administered per kilogram of body weight) and a specific thrombolytic activity (percent clot lysis per microgram per milliliter steady state rt-PA-related antigen level in plasma) that were not significantly different. Bolus injection in hamsters of 1 mg/kg rPAI- 1 followed by bolus injection of 1 mg/kg <b>rt-PA</b> del(K 296 -G 302) or wild-type <b>rt-PA</b> resulted in neutralization of the thrombolytic potency of wild-type <b>rt-PA,</b> while the mutant retained approximately half of its thrombolytic potency. These results indicate that <b>rt-PA</b> del(K 296 -G 302), with a known resistance to inhibition by rPAI- 1 in purified systems, maintains this property both in a plasma milieu in vitro and in an experimental animal model of thrombolysis in vivo.

40|$|Objective: This paper {{identified}} barriers {{which prevent}} rural {{health care providers}} from utilising <b>rt-PA</b> in acute ischaemic stroke and proposes possible support mechanisms to increase its utilisation. Methods: This descriptive study uses data from anonymous surveys distributed to health care providers involved in acute stroke patient care in three rural hospitals with <b>rt-PA</b> pathways. Saturation sampling was used. Surveys gathered self assessed ratings of experience, practice environment, attitudes, existing support, barriers and possible enablers regarding <b>rt-PA</b> use in acute stroke. Results: Physicians reported the strongest barriers {{to the use of}} <b>rt-PA</b> in acute stroke as pre-hospital delays (91 %), risk of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) (73 %) and clinical diagnostic uncertainty (60 %). They reported high levels of confidence in the support received from their stroke units (90 %). Nurses identified a poor level of stroke education and knowledge on <b>rt-PA</b> utilisation in acute stroke. A third of nurses could correctly list six different stroke signs. The risk of ICH following <b>rt-PA</b> administration in stroke was also a significant barrier for nurses. Response rate from physicians was 26 % (10 / 38) and 19 % (13 / 69) for nurses. Conclusions: To reduce barriers to <b>rt-PA</b> utilisation in rural facilities physicians require education on the calculated risk of ICH as well as exposure and experience to improve their ability to confidently diagnose stroke patients who are eligible for <b>rt-PA</b> treatment. Education for nurses on symptoms of stroke and <b>rt-PA</b> utilisation and administration is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (<b>rt-PA)</b> is used to restore patency and avoid inadvertent removal of peripheral and central venous catheters. <b>rt-PA</b> was reconstituted (1 mg/mL) then cryopreserved at &# 8722; 30 &# 176;C for 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 12 months and, then its stability was determined.

40|$|In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, {{randomized}} trial {{the long-term}} (+/- 3 months) effects of intravenous administration of recombinant {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (<b>rt-PA)</b> versus placebo were compared in relation to left ventricular function, coronary patency rate and antigenicity in 28 patients with a first myocardial infarction. Patency rate of the infarct-related coronary artery {{at the end of}} the rt-PA/placebo infusion and after 3 months of medical treatment (including oral anticoagulant agents) was 86 and 71 %, respectively, in the <b>rt-PA</b> group, and 21 and 58 %, respectively, in the placebo group. Regional wall motion of the infarct-related area was quantitated with digital subtraction angiography. Intrapatient comparisons revealed significant improvement in regional wall motion after 3 months in both the <b>rt-PA</b> and placebo groups. The improvement in the <b>rt-PA</b> group was not significantly greater than that in the placebo group. Thirteen patients (10 with <b>rt-PA</b> and 3 with placebo) with persistent patency (both early and late) of the infarct-related coronary artery showed a significant improvement of both global and regional left ventricular function, while 8 patients (2 with <b>rt-PA</b> and 6 with placebo) with persistent occlusion showed no changes.

40|$|Coagulation and {{fibrinolysis}} {{were studied}} {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction during intravenous infusion of recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (<b>rt-PA)</b> (0. 75 mg/kg over 90 min, n = 101), streptokinase (1, 500, 000 IU over 60 min, n = 61), or placebo (n = 40). In the <b>rt-PA</b> group, the plasma level of <b>rt-PA</b> antigen was 1. 2 +/- 0. 6 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SD) and the euglobulin fibrinolytic activity (EFA) was 910 +/- 735 IU t-PA/ml. In the streptokinase group, the EFA was equivalent to 430 +/- 435 IU t-PA/ml. At {{the end of the}} infusion, the plasma fibrinogen level measured with a coagulation rate assay was decreased to 57 +/- 33 % of the preinfusion value in the <b>rt-PA</b> group, to 7 +/- 10 % in the streptokinase group, and remained unchanged in the placebo group. Fibrinogen-fibrin degradation products increased to 0. 75 +/- 0. 54 mg/ml in the streptokinase group but to only 0. 10 +/- 0. 13 mg/ml in the <b>rt-PA</b> group. The plasma levels of alpha 2 -antiplasmin, plasminogen, and factor V decreased to between 30 % and 45 % in the <b>rt-PA</b> group but significantly more in the streptokinase group (to between 15 % and 25 %). Thus <b>rt-PA</b> induced much less systemic fibrinolytic activation than streptokinase.

40|$|In five {{patients}} with venous thromboembolic disease treated with recombinant {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (<b>rt-PA),</b> there was a marked increase in the mean concentrations of fibrinopeptide A (from 0. 6 to 5. 9 nM; P less than 0. 0001) and desarginine fibrinopeptide B (from 5. 6 nM to 24. 1 nM; P less than 0. 01) 30 min after a bolus of <b>rt-PA</b> (0. 6 mg/kg). Thrombin was unlikely to be responsible because the levels of desarginine fibrinopeptide B exceeded those of fibrinopeptide A and the changes occurred despite concomitant heparin therapy. The {{purpose of this study}} therefore, was to determine whether <b>rt-PA</b> directly releases the fibrinopeptides from fibrinogen. Incubation of <b>rt-PA</b> with heparinized plasma or purified fibrinogen resulted in time and dose-dependent release of both fibrinopeptide A and B. Contaminating thrombin was not responsible for this activity by the following criteria: the rate of <b>rt-PA</b> mediated fibrinopeptide B release was considerably faster than that of fibrinopeptide A, and fibrinopeptide release was unaffected by heparin, hirudin, or a monospecific antithrombin IgG. Aprotinin also had no effect on fibrinopeptide release, indicating that this activity was not plasmin mediated. Fibrinopeptide release was shown to be due to <b>rt-PA</b> because this activity was completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody against the enzyme. Further, the specificity of <b>rt-PA</b> for the thrombin cleavage sites on fibrinogen was confirmed by the demonstration that <b>rt-PA</b> released fibrinopeptide A or fibrinopeptide B from fibrinopeptide A or B-containing substrates, respectively. These studies thus demonstrate that (a) <b>rt-PA</b> releases fibrinopeptides A and B from fibrinogen thereby indicating that this enzyme is not specific for plasminogen, and (b) plasma fibrinopeptide A and desarginine fibrinopeptide B levels are not specific markers of thrombin action on fibrinogen in patients receiving <b>rt-PA...</b>|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the efficacy and safety of intravenous <b>rt-PA</b> therapy for patients over 80 years old. Of 13, 521 stroke patients registered in the Fukuoka Stroke Registry in Japan from June 1999 to February 2013, 953 ischemic stroke patients who were over 80 years old, hospitalized within 3 h of onset, and not treated with endovascular therapy were included in this study. Among them, 153 patients were treated with intravenous <b>rt-PA</b> (0. 6 mg/kg). For propensity score (PS) -matched case-control analysis, 148 patients treated with <b>rt-PA</b> and 148 PS-matched patients without <b>rt-PA</b> therapy were selected by 1 : 1 matching with propensity for using <b>rt-PA.</b> Clinical outcomes were neurological improvement, good functional outcome at discharge, in-hospital mortality, and hemorrhagic complications (any intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], symptomatic ICH, and gastrointestinal bleeding). In the full cohort of 953 patients, <b>rt-PA</b> use was associated positively with neurological improvement and good functional outcome, and negatively with in-hospital mortality after adjustment for multiple confounding factors.
