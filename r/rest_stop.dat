5|$|The Norwegian {{saturation}} decompression {{tables are}} similar, but specifically {{do not allow}} decompression to start with an upward excursion.

According to Lukić, a total of 727 children were liberated from the camp, but at the first <b>rest</b> <b>stop</b> at Svetojanska, medical examinations by Davila identified about 400 weak and sick children who could no longer walk, and they were returned to Jastrebarsko. Davila estimates {{the number of children}} actually liberated from the camp at around 400.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, festival-goers {{crowded the}} Interstate 70 <b>rest</b> <b>stops</b> {{to catch up}} on sleep lost during the weekend. Tents, cots and {{sleeping}} bags were spread throughout <b>rest</b> <b>stops</b> all along the highway.|$|R
50|$|Many rest {{areas have}} the reputations of being unsafe {{with regard to}} crime, {{especially}} at night, since they are situated in remote areas. California's policy is to maintain existing public rest areas, but no longer build new ones due to the cost and difficulty of keeping them safe, although many California <b>rest</b> <b>stops</b> now feature highway patrol quarters.Some of this reputation may be exaggerated, {{since the advent of}} lighting and security cameras in <b>rest</b> <b>stops.</b> Nonetheless, many <b>rest</b> <b>stops</b> continue to warn of theft, and advise those who park to keep doors locked (despite the fact that camping is now disallowed in some <b>rest</b> <b>stops).</b>|$|R
5000|$|As of 2008, Virginia {{operated}} 42 <b>rest</b> <b>stops</b> and visitor centers {{along its}} interstate highways. In response to budget pressures, the Board sought public input {{and determined to}} reduce costs by closing 19 <b>rest</b> <b>stops</b> and expanding the truck parking lots at the remaining stops to accommodate the trucks that would other park and sleep at the stops designated for closing. [...] The Board also removed the two-hour limit on truck parking. The closures began on July 21, 2009 [...] The Board's funding options were limited, because Federal law 23 U.S.C. §111 prohibits commercialization of interstate highway <b>rest</b> <b>stops.</b> The closing resulted in a $9 million annual saving. At the Board's first meeting in January 2010, it reversed the decision to close the <b>rest</b> <b>stops</b> and reassigned $3 million in highway maintenance funds to keep the 19 <b>rest</b> <b>stops</b> open {{until the end of}} the fiscal year. No long-term funding source was identified.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, {{a project}} to restore the old gas station began. The village of Dwight applied for and {{received}} a US$10,400 federal cost-share grant from the U.S. National Park Service and its Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program. The grant required the village to present matching funds {{in the amount of}} the grant. The restoration's ultimate goal was to reopen the station as a <b>rest</b> <b>stop</b> and interpretive center along the historic roadway.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{tradition}} within the Australian Army for soldiers' recreational clubs on military bases to be named after a particular recipient of the Victoria Cross. Australia has a unique means of remembering recipients of the Victoria Cross. Remembrance Drive is a path through city streets and highways linking Sydney and Canberra. Trees were planted in February 1954 by Queen Elizabeth II in a park near Sydney Harbour and at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, marking {{either end of the}} route, with various plantations along the roadsides in memory of the fallen. Beginning in 1995, 23 <b>rest</b> <b>stop</b> memorials named for Australian recipients of the VC from World War II onwards have been sited along the route, providing picnic facilities and public amenities to encourage drivers to take a break on long drives. 23 of the 26 memorial sites have been dedicated, with a further three reserved for the surviving VC recipients, including two of the newer Victoria Cross for Australia awards. Edward Kenna, VC, was honoured with the most recent <b>rest</b> <b>stop</b> on 16 August 2012, having died in 2009.|$|E
5|$|A {{segment of}} I-94 in Battle Creek between the exits for Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) and I-194 {{was named the}} 94th Combat Infantry Division Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature in 2002. The name honors the US Army's 94th Infantry Division, which was {{activated}} at the nearby Fort Custer in 1942 and served with distinction in the European theatre of World War II. Because the unit originated in Battle Creek, and its number matched that of the freeway, the Legislature added the designation by passing Public Act305 of 2002. The name was dedicated in ceremonies at a <b>rest</b> <b>stop</b> along the section of I-94 on September 28, 2002.|$|E
5000|$|Along the Pacific Flyway, {{there are}} many key <b>rest</b> <b>stops</b> where birds of many species gather, {{sometimes}} in the millions, to feed and regain their strength before continuing.

5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important <b>rest</b> <b>stop</b> for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|On a field trip, Veronica meets Gia (Krysten Ritter). On the bus home, Veronica {{talks to}} Meg one more time, {{but she is}} still passive-aggressive. Veronica {{explains}} to the audience that she and Duncan are dating. At a <b>rest</b> <b>stop,</b> Veronica sees Weevil and they debate about the stabbed gang member. Meanwhile, Veronica's bus drives away without her. Instead, Weevil takes Veronica on his motorcycle before they run across the limo with Duncan, Gia, and the others in it. They tell Veronica that the bus full of students drove off the cliff and into the sea, and they look over at the crashed bus.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May 1947, Beryl Derrick {{attended}} an investiture {{ceremony at the}} Government House, Adelaide, where she was presented with her late husband's Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal by the Governor of South Australia, Lieutenant General Sir Charles Norrie. Derrick's Victoria Cross and other medals are now displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, along with a portrait by Sir Ivor Hele. A street in the neighbouring suburb of Campbell and a <b>rest</b> <b>stop</b> in the Remembrance Driveway between Sydney and Canberra were also named in his honour. In 1995, a public park was named the Derrick Memorial Reserve on Carlisle St, Glanville in his honour, and his VC citation is displayed on a plaque there. In June 2008, a newly built bridge over the Port River on the Port River Expressway was named the Tom 'Diver' Derrick Bridge following a public campaign.|$|E

5|$|Lincolnshire, {{despite its}} {{relatively}} small size, {{is home to}} nine local public parks. Spring Lake Park, which is centered on an eponymous lake and sports a small beachhead, hosts Lincolnshire's festivities during the Fourth of July. North Park, a major sporting field and nature reserve in northeastern Lincolnshire, collaborates with Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 to meet both the growing need for youth sports teams and extra recreational public park space; School District 103 also collaborated with the village of Lincolnshire to create an educational nature center called Rivershire Park, which is located in southeastern Lincolnshire. The nature center runs programs to educate district students and other visitors about the local ecology, alongside the natural fauna and flora of the Lake County area, and Memorial Park is a <b>rest</b> <b>stop</b> for pedestrians and cyclists traversing eastern Lincolnshire; Florsheim Nature Preserve, which sports an unusually high Floristic Quality Index rating, is shelter to endangered and threatened species of flora rarely found elsewhere in the county. Whytegate Park, an athletic complex overshadowed by nearby North Park, sports several sports courts and a fitness course, and Balzer Park {{is home to a}} short hiking trail and sports facilities. Lincolnshire's other two parks, Bicentennial Park and Olde Mill Park, are little more than playgrounds for local children.|$|E
