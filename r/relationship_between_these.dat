5|$|Resolution was {{provided}} by the same 1989 study that confirmed the link between Xenopsaris and Pachyramphus. In it, Xenopsaris and six other genera previously held in the three families were found to actually form a fourth family, later named Tityridae. This new family is where the genus is now placed by the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society. A 2007 study of mitochondrial DNA confirmed the white-naped xenopsaris' place in the Tityridae, and its close relationship to Pachyramphus, as well as the genus Tityra. These three genera were found to be more distantly related to a fourth genus Iodopleura (the purpletufts), although further studies are needed to understand the complete <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> four genera.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> ideas suggested that {{it might be possible to}} construct an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|The oldest volcano in the chain, Meiji Seamount, {{perched on}} the edge of the Aleutian Trench, formed 85 million years ago. At its current velocity, the {{seamount}} will be destroyed within a few million years, as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate. It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> features is still being investigated.|$|E

5|$|With a few exceptions, {{the farther}} a planet or belt {{is from the}} Sun, the larger the {{distance}} between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun.

Attempts {{have been made to}} determine a <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> orbital distances (for example, the Titius–Bode law), but no such theory has been accepted.

5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
