5|$|Nicole and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought great rainfall {{to much of}} Jamaica over {{a period}} of several days. A maximum of 37.42inches (940mm) was recorded in Belleisle, Westmoreland Parish, from September26 to 30; most other parishes received more than 12in (300mm) during the same period. With a <b>return</b> <b>period</b> of 30years, these quantities tripled the monthly rainfall average for September at several locations. Though the broad-scale wind regime over the island remained gentle, the storm's intense convective bands produced three microburstssmall downdrafts of intense winds. With dozens of river banks and waterways blocked, the worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities primarily in southern parishes.|$|E

40|$|Spatially dense {{observations}} of gust speeds {{are necessary for}} various applications, but their availability is limited in space and time. This work presents an approach to help to overcome this problem. The main objective is the generation of synthetic wind gust velocities. With this aim, theoretical wind and gust distributions are estimated from 10 yr of hourly observations collected at 123 synoptic weather stations provided by the German Weather Service. As pre-processing, an exposure correction is applied on measurements of the mean wind velocity to reduce the influence of local urban and topographic effects. The wind gust model is built as a transfer function between distribution parameters of wind and gust velocities. The aim of this procedure is to estimate the parameters of gusts at stations where only wind speed data is available. These parameters {{can be used to}} generate synthetic gusts, which can improve the accuracy of <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> at test sites with a lack of observations. The second objective is to determine <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> much longer than the nominal length of the original time series by considering extreme value statistics. Estimates for both local maximum <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> and average <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> for single historical events are provided. The comparison of maximum and average <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> shows that even storms with short average <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> may lead to local wind gusts with <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> of several decades. Despite uncertainties caused by the short length of the observational records, the method leads to consistent results, enabling a wide range of possible applications...|$|R

5|$|September 16, 1999- Tropical Storm Floyd crosses {{over the}} southeastern {{portion of the}} state. The storm {{produces}} strong wind gusts of up to 64mph (103km/h) in Sussex County and heavy rainfall peaking at 10.58inches (269mm) in Greenwood, a 24-hour state record. The flooding, which exceeds the 100-year flood <b>return</b> <b>period,</b> kills two and causes record-breaking river levels across the state. Hundreds of roads, railroad lines, and bridges are closed or destroyed, trapping dozens due to flooded vehicles. The winds uproot hundreds of trees, leaving 25,000 homes and businesses without power for 3days. Floyd damages 171 homes, 44 severely, and destroys 33 in New Castle County. Damage is minimal near the ocean, and amounts to minor beach erosion and tidal flooding. Throughout the state, damage totals to $8.42million (1999USD, $10.9million 2008USD). In response to the damage, President Bill Clinton declares {{the state as a}} disaster area, which allows for federal funding to rebuild and cleanup after the storm.|$|E

The study is based on 23 sites of rainfall which are divided into three homogeneous regions. The collective results of L-moment ratio diagram, Z-statistic and AWD values show the GLO, GEV and GNO to be best fit for all three regions and in addition PE 3 for region 3. On the basis of relative RMSE, for region 1 and region 2, GLO, GEV and GNO are producing approximately the same relative RMSE for <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> upto 100. While GNO is producing less relative RMSE for large <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> of 500 and 1000. So for large <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> GNO could be best distribution. For region 3 GLO, GEV, GNO and PE 3 are having approximately the same relative RMSE for <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> upto 100.

Hydrological processes are multivariate, however multivariate analyses are needed. Copula function {{can be used for}} multivariate modelling. Classical univariate flood frequency analyses are a precondition for the copula analyses. Flood frequency analyses were made on the annual maximum series data from gauging station Litija on the Sava River. Three copulas from the Archimedean family were used; parameters were estimated with method of moments (based on the Kendall correlation coefficient). Some joint <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> were calculated and compared with the univarite <b>return</b> <b>periods.</b> Differences between <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> were not negligible. In the case of a flood event in 1990, which was the largest in the observed period, TAND was 92 years and TOR was 17 years. Univariate <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> lay between these two values.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis concerning the effectiveness of a criterion proposed by the writers to identify the most suitable probability distribution to model the historical series of annual maxima of peak flood discharges, with special reference to high <b>return</b> <b>periods.</b> This criterion is based on the analysis of a large amount of data referring to peak flows recorded in about 12000 gauging stations located in different geographical areas of the earth. The analysis shows that the usual goodness of fit tests are in agreement with the proposed method for <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> comparable with the lengths of the historical series but do not provide reliable information for the higher <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> that are usually involved in flood protection problems.

25|$|Radar {{estimates}} of rainfall and general weather forecasting techniques {{are also important}} components of good flood forecasting. In areas where good quality data is available, the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time. The output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway, and it also may allow for the computation of the likely statistical <b>return</b> <b>period</b> of a flood. In many developed countries, urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood – that is a flood that has a probability of around 63% of occurring in any 100-year period of time.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1950, the Bogotá River meandered {{through the}} middle of the basin with wide {{riparian}} areas, extensive flood plains, and thriving ecosystmes such as the La Conejera, Juan Amarillo, and Jaboque wetlands. Rapid urbanization has resulted in the channelization of the river, destruction of wetlands and settlements along the river making the river increasingly prone to flooding. In response, CAR has incorporated a flood works program to widen and protect riparian zones, restore the natural meander of the river, and hydraulically connect the river to its flood plains. In one particular component of a World Bank loan (see Multi-stakeholder assistance below) to CAR, EAAB, and the District Government; the Flood Control and Environmental Works project finances a comprehensive river recuperation program that incorporates best practice in urban river restoration. This component consists of improving flood control from an existing 10-25-year <b>return</b> <b>period</b> to a 100-year period, restoring part of the river flood plain, creating and enhancing wetlands and multifunctional parks, and complementing wastewater infrastructure with existing wastewater treatment when possible.|$|E

The study area was the Bahookalat River located in the southeast of Sistan and Baluchistan Province. The river has a mild sloping and stretches over mountainous and plain terrains. The errors due to map scales are determined through floodplain zoning over various <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> using base maps with scales of 1 / 1000 (field surveying) and 1 / 25000 (topographic). In the present study, the Arcview environment was used for GIS analyses and the HEC-RAS software was used for hydraulic simulation.

The floodplain zone for various <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> and {{on the basis of}} the above base maps for different terrains have been determined. The analysis of the results was accomplished using relative error index and normalized floodplain zone. Comparison of overall and average relative errors for mountainous and plain terrains showed that the errors in these terrains were almost the same as those in the Bahookalatr River ranging over 19 to 35 % for different <b>return</b> <b>periods.</b> The relative error showed a higher sensitivity within the dominant discharge but in mountainous terrains it showed a declining trend for floods with <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> of more than 10 years.

40|$|Abstract – Uniqueness of the {{relationship}} between the <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> of the annual maximum series (AMS) and the partial duration series (PDS) are evaluated in light of the actual data. Rainfall intensities with durations of 15, 30, 60, and 360 minutes are calculated for seven stations representing a variety of climatic conditions (humid, cold, desert, and hot desert), and the corresponding AMS and PDS values are considered. PDS values are evaluated in view of annual exceedance series (AES), up to the minimum one observation (MOO). The two-parameter gamma distribution is found to be the most suitable to provide various <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> for the calculated rainfall intensities. A comparison of the results suggests that a unique relationship does not exist between <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> of AMS and PDS. Indeed, length ratio (ratio of record length of PDS series to that of AMS) should be considered as an additional independent variable. Therefore, any further attempts to extend the uniqueness of {{the relationship}} between AMS and PDS for the computation of hydrological variables such as rainfall depth are shown to be inappropriate. Finally, it is concluded that any relationship between AMS and PDS <b>return</b> <b>periods</b> is actually a function of rainfall duration as well as station location...|$|R

500|$|The high {{rainfall}} {{caused many}} rivers {{to rise above}} their banks across Virginia, becoming among the top three highest crests on record along several rivers in the state. The flood set the highest river stage on record along the Roanoke River at Roanoke, Tinker Creek near Daleville, the Calfpasture River at Goshen, the Craig Creek at Parr, and the James River at Buchanan, Holcomb Rock, and Bent Creek. At Holcomb Rock, the James River crested at , {{the highest in the}} state, and was about [...] above flood stage; based on the observations and the associated discharge, the <b>return</b> <b>period</b> was estimated as greater than a 1 in 500 year event.

Across the state, about 3,500 houses were destroyed. Overall, the storm system caused 22 deaths and $753 million, greater than the devastating hurricanes Camille and Agnes, and making it the costliest flood in the state's history.|$|E
500|$|Due to easterly {{wind shear}} and the {{convection}} along the storm's western periphery, the tropical depression dropped heavy rainfall {{in the states}} of Puebla, Tabasco, Hidalgo, and Veracruz, peaking at [...] in Jalacingo, Veracruz. This was the highest rainfall total in Veracruz from 1981 to 2010; statewide record peaks were also reported in Puebla and Hidalgo. The depression was the third wettest tropical cyclone in Mexico from 1983 to 2006, after Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and Tropical Storm Frances in 1998. The heaviest of the rainfall occurred along the Sierra Madre Oriental, which is a mountain range in eastern Mexico and the source for several regionally important rivers. Tuxpan, Veracruz recorded 6.2in (157.7mm) in a 24‑hour period on October4, which was greater than the average October rainfall there and was about one-ninth of the annual total. A station in Hidalgo reported 4.02in (102mm) on October4, which was also greater than the average October rainfall and was about one-eighth of the annual total. The <b>return</b> <b>period</b> was estimated {{as high as a}} 1in 67year event at Xicotepec, Puebla, and it was estimated that such floods in Mexico occur only twice per century; similar floods occurred in September 1944 in the same region, although the area was less populated then.|$|E

2500|$|The most studied {{earthquake}} faults (such as the Nankai megathrust, the Wasatch fault, and the San Andreas fault) {{appear to}} have distinct segments. [...] The characteristic earthquake model postulates that earthquakes are generally constrained within these segments. As the lengths and other properties of the segments are fixed, earthquakes that rupture the entire fault should have similar characteristics. These include the maximum magnitude (which {{is limited by the}} length of the rupture), and the amount of accumulated strain needed to rupture the fault segment. [...] Since continuous plate motions cause the strain to accumulate steadily, seismic activity on a given segment should be dominated by earthquakes of similar characteristics that recur at somewhat regular intervals. For a given fault segment, identifying these characteristic earthquakes and timing their recurrence rate (or conversely <b>return</b> <b>period)</b> should therefore inform us about the next rupture; this is the approach generally used in forecasting seismic hazard. UCERF3 is a notable example of such a forecast, prepared for the state of California.
