50|$|Silver Surfer: Highspeed <b>RS232</b> <b>Interface</b> for Amiga 1200 and 600 (with adapter). Fits onto Retro Replay, MMC64/Replay {{compatibility}} unknown.|$|E
5000|$|Ronja Lopipe: The {{original}} (discontinued) design using red {{visible light}} and a <b>RS232</b> <b>interface</b> for a max 115 kbit/s PPP/SLIP link.|$|E
5000|$|The EZ-232 <b>RS232</b> Serial <b>Interface</b> {{provides}} a low-speed serial port for Commodore 8-bit computers. It can operate at speeds {{of up to}} 2400 bit/s, when configured as a standard interface, and at speeds of up to 9600 bit/s, when configured as a UP9600 <b>interface.</b> The EZ-232 <b>RS232</b> Serial <b>Interface</b> was designed by Jim Brain.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a large}} {{variety of}} {{adapters}} for C64 disk/tape emulation and data transfer, and an even larger variety of compatible software. Many of the adapters interface with the original serial bus disk drive plug or the C2N tape. Others connect to either the user port or the cartridge expansion port using either standardized <b>RS232</b> <b>interfaces</b> or proprietary adapters. In combination with software (or firmware), the adapters can either fully support the original communication protocols, provide partial support or apply proprietary communication protocols. Different solutions allow for letting the C64 access programs stored on another computer or the Internet, and for accessing the C64 disk station and tape deck from other computers.|$|R
50|$|The same {{mechanism}} {{was used}} in Xerox's 850 display typing system and 860PDS word processor, and was also sold to OEMs. One notable user was Digital Equipment Corporation who resold the printer as the LQP01 (with a parallel interface) and the LQPSE (with an <b>RS232</b> serial <b>interface)</b> and supported by Digital's WPS-8 word processing software.|$|R
50|$|DF-1 / DF1 {{protocol}} is an asynchronous byte-oriented protocol {{that is used}} {{to communicate}} with most Allen Bradley <b>RS232</b> <b>interface</b> modules. DF1 protocol consists of link layer and application layer formats. DF1 works over half duplex and full duplex modes of communication.|$|E
50|$|A third mode {{was entered}} {{with a special}} boot floppy which turned the Aster into a Videotex {{terminal}} with a 40x25 display and a Videotex character set, The software used the built in <b>RS232</b> <b>interface</b> of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.|$|E
5000|$|LUnix, {{short for}} [...] "Little Unix", is a Unix-like {{operating}} {{system designed to}} run natively on the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 home computer systems. It supports TCP/IP networking (SLIP or PPP using an <b>RS232</b> <b>interface).</b> Unlike most Unix-like systems, LUnix is written in 6502 assembly language instead of C.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{automation}} protocols implemented on user <b>interfaces</b> (<b>RS232,</b> RS485, RS422, Ethernet) of RACOM equipment. The implementation is optimized for radio narrow band {{in terms of}} maximum throughput and for GPRS/EDGE/UMTS in terms of minimum data volume, which is charged by networks providers.|$|R
50|$|DECtape II was {{introduced}} around 1978 {{and has a}} similar block structure, but uses a much smaller 0.150 in tape (the same width as an audio compact cassette). The tape is packaged in a special, pre-formatted DC150 miniature cartridge consisting of a clear plastic cover mounted on a textured aluminum plate. Cartridge dimensions are 2+3/8 x 3+3/16 x 1/2 in. The TU58 DECtape II drive has an <b>RS232</b> serial <b>interface,</b> allowing it {{to be used with}} the ordinary serial ports that are very common on Digital's contemporary processors.|$|R
50|$|XV-21 and XV-25 {{models were}} {{reported}} in early 2013 having an improved air exhaust directed upwards (though through side located vents), instead of sideways, to reduce disturbance of room dust {{before it can be}} vacuumed up.Internal electronics improvements included stronger cabling between the LCD display panel and the main PC board, but eliminated a hidden <b>RS232</b> serial <b>interface</b> inside the machine; only the external USB interface for firmware updates and troubleshooting remained. Electronics hobbyists had been using the internal serial connection for various radio control devices not compatible with USB interfaces.|$|R
5000|$|RS232 {{expansion}} port adapters: Expansion port cartridges provides a high-speed connection to an external computer and/or the Internet. The output interface is a <b>RS232</b> <b>interface</b> for connecting to an external computer. Internet connection {{can be obtained}} through the external computer or via a series to Internet adapter. Some adapters also have separate Ethernet interface for connecting to Internet. The most common cartridges for external connection is listed below.|$|E
50|$|The TRS-80 Model I used three {{identical}} 5-pin DIN connectors for its AC adapter, video output, {{and tape}} recorder, {{making it easy}} to destroy the unit if the plugs were confused. Almost the same could be seen on Soviet Elektronika BK home computers, where four 5-pin DIN connectors were used for tape recorder, B/W video output, RGB video output and AC adapter. The Geneve 9640 uses an 8 pin DIN for its composite video, analog RGB, audio, and +12 V for an RF modulator. On the Colour Genie, three 5-pin DIN connectors were used for the cassette recorder interface, the lightpen interface and the <b>RS232</b> <b>interface.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Today, a {{muffle furnace}} is (usually) a {{front-loading}} box-type oven or kiln for high-temperature {{applications such as}} fusing glass, creating enamel coatings, ceramics and soldering and brazing articles. They are also used in many research facilities, for example by chemists {{in order to determine}} what proportion of a sample is non-combustible and non-volatile (i.e., ash). Some digital controllers allow <b>RS232</b> <b>interface</b> and permit the operator to program up to 126 segments, such as ramping, soaking, sintering, and more. Also, advances in materials for heating elements, such as molybdenum disilicide, can now produce working temperatures up to 1800 C, which facilitate more sophisticated metallurgical applications.|$|E
50|$|As of August 2010, {{the company}} makes over 7500 products, which they {{organize}} into seven product categories: data conversion (analog to digital converters, digital to analog converters), signal conditioning (operational amplifiers, comparators, voltage references), power management (switching regulators, linear regulators, battery management, led drivers), <b>interface</b> (<b>RS232,</b> RS485), radio frequency (mixers, quadrature modulators), oscillators, and space and military ICs.|$|R
50|$|With {{electronic}} (indicating) torque wrenches, measurement is {{by means}} of a strain gauge attached to the torsion rod. The signal generated by the transducer is converted to the required unit of torque (e.g. N·m or lbf·ft) and shown on the digital display. A number of different joints (measurement details or limit values) can be stored. These programmed limit values are then permanently displayed during the tightening process {{by means of}} LEDs or the display. At the same time, this generation of torque wrenches can store all the measurements made in an internal readings memory. This readings memory can then be easily transferred to a PC via the <b>interface</b> (<b>RS232)</b> or printed straight to a printer. A popular application of this kind of torque wrench is for in-process documentation or quality assurance purposes. Typical accuracy level would be +/- 0.5% to 4%.|$|R
50|$|Although Timex Computer Corporation {{folded in}} February 1984, the {{independent}} Portuguese division continued {{to sell the}} machine in Portugal as the Timex Computer 2068, and Poland until 1989, as the Unipolbrit Komputer 2086. Although the Portuguese-made TC2068 was also sold in Poland, only the UK2086 was actually made there.Timex of Portugal sold 2 versions of TC2068: the Silver TC2068 version came with a ZX Spectrum emulator cartridge and a black TC2068 version sold with TimeWord word processing cartridge plus the Timex <b>RS232</b> <b>Interface</b> to use TimeWord with a RS232 printer. Strangely the black version came with a silver keyboard template with TimeWord commands {{to be used with}} the program. It can be removed because it is not glued to the black keyboard template.|$|E
50|$|A {{tube furnace}} is an {{electric}} heating device used to conduct syntheses and purifications of inorganic compounds and occasionally in organic synthesis. One possible design {{consists of a}} cylindrical cavity surrounded by heating coils that are embedded in a thermally insulating matrix. Temperature can be controlled via feedback from a thermocouple. More elaborate tube furnaces have two (or more) heating zones useful for transport experiments. Some digital temperature controllers provide an <b>RS232</b> <b>interface,</b> and permit the operator to program segments for uses like ramping, soaking, sintering, and more. Advanced materials in the heating elements, such as molybdenum disilicide offered in certain models can now produce working temperatures up to 1800 °C. This facilitates more sophisticated applications. Common material for the reaction tubes include alumina, Pyrex, and fused quartz.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{communications}} link {{used by many}} people is the asynchronous start-stop, or just [...] "asynchronous", serial link. If you have an external modem attached to your home or office computer, the chances are that the connection is over an asynchronous serial connection. Its advantage {{is that it is}} simple [...] - [...] it can be implemented using only three wires: Send, Receive and Signal Ground (or Signal Common). In an <b>RS232</b> <b>interface,</b> an idle connection has a continuous negative voltage applied. A 'zero' bit is represented as a positive voltage difference with respect to the Signal Ground and a 'one' bit is a negative voltage with respect to signal ground, thus indistinguishable from the idle state. This means you need to know when a 'one' bit starts to distinguish it from idle. This is done by agreeing in advance how fast data will be transmitted over a link, then using a start bit to signal the start of a byte [...] - [...] this start bit will be a 'zero' bit. Stop bits are 'one' bits i.e. negative voltage.|$|E
5000|$|Wire is {{versatile}} in its nature. Thus a {{paper clip}} {{is a useful}} accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force. Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need. This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an [...] "emergency eject" [...] should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh). Various smartphones {{require the use of}} a long thin object such as a paper clip to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device. The track ball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel. A paper clip bent into a [...] "U" [...] can be used to start an ATX PSU without connecting it to a motherboard (connect the green to a black on the motherboard header). One or more paper clips can make a loopback device for a <b>RS232</b> <b>interface</b> (or indeed many interfaces). A paper clip could be installed in a Commodore 1541 disk-drive as a flexible head-stop. A paper clip can be used (unsafely) to temporarily bridge a blown fuse. The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post.|$|E
