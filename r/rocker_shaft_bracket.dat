50|$|Because these engines {{needed a}} less {{sophisticated}} rocker setup, {{with only a}} single <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> in each head, they were also cheaper and lighter than their Hemi counterparts. In the Chrysler literature, the Poly engines were also called single <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> (SRS), while the Hemi engines were called dual <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> (DRS).|$|R
5000|$|... the {{camshaft}} is secured to the cylinder {{head with the}} camcase. An oil passage in the cylinder head provides the passageway in the camcase with oil {{that leads to the}} intake <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft.</b> Oil from {{the camshaft}} is collected {{on the opposite side of}} the passageway leading to the intake <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> to provide oil to the exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first Y-block on Ford {{automobiles}} was the 1954 239 in³ (3.9 L) Ford engine, {{known for}} its deep skirting, which causes the engine block to resemble a Y. Rated at [...] and 193 ft-lbs of torque at 2200rpm, it replaced the [...] 239 in³ (3.9 L) flathead. The Y-block was considered a major advancement over the flathead. It is known for having oiling problems in the <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts</b> because the oil first went to the crankshaft bearing, then to the camshaft bearings, then to the <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> This problem plagued the entire Y-block family and could be remedied by running a copper line from the oil pump to the <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Both engines had alloy {{cylinder}} heads with twin <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts</b> and inlet valves angled at 45 degrees ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{the intake}} rocker arms are marked {{so they are}} {{correctly}} placed on the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> when servicing. An IN1 or IN2 will be embossed on each rocker arm. As viewed {{from the front of}} the engine the Number 1 intake valve of each cylinder and the number 2 intake valve have an IN1 marked and IN2 marked rocker arm that mates with it. New IN1 rocker arms can also be identified by a Green painted mark on the top of the rocker arm. The IN2 rocker arms have a white mark. Proper positioning is maintained through the use of a wave washer located between the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> arm and <b>rocker</b> arm <b>shaft</b> support.|$|R
50|$|The {{drive cam}} {{is driven by}} the camshaft. This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the {{trunnion}} pin or <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft.</b> Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller tip. A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller tip to a second rocker arm. This rotates about the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft,</b> and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve. In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head.|$|R
40|$|A {{flexible}} and robust overlapping structured grid method is introduced {{and applied to}} the computation of the flow around two ship hulls with appendages. The ships are a frigate with sonar dome, bilge keels, propeller <b>shafts,</b> <b>brackets,</b> nozzles and rudder and a hopper-dredger with head-box, <b>shafts,</b> <b>brackets</b> and nozzle. Results are presented both for model and full scale and compared to experimental data...|$|R
50|$|The oiling {{problem was}} caused by the passage from the center cam bearing to the {{cylinder}} head being offset by an inch and too small. The motor oils of the era were low in detergents, but high in petroleum coke; when combined with short trips and infrequent oil changes, this led to blockage of this passage. This left the lower end with ample oil while the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> assemblies literally burned up. The external oiler kit essentially provided oil to the <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts</b> from the oil pressure port {{on the outside of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|The primary exhaust {{rocker arm}} {{contacts}} a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the oil pressure flowing from the exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> into the primary {{exhaust rocker arm}} forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary exhaust rocker arm, thereby locking both exhaust rocker arms together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary exhaust rocker arm alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both exhaust rocker arms together which are locked as a unit. The same occurs for the intake <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft,</b> except that the high-profile camshaft lobe operates the primary rocker arm.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{beginning}} with the J37A4 3.7L SOHC V6 engine introduced on all 2009 Acura TL SH-AWD models, SOHC VTEC was incorporated for use with intake and exhaust valves. The intake and exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts</b> contain primary and secondary intake and exhaust rocker arms, respectively. The primary rocker arm contains the VTEC switching piston, while the secondary rocker arm contains the return spring. The term [...] "primary" [...] does not refer to which rocker arm forces the valve down during low-RPM engine operation. Rather, {{it refers to the}} rocker arm which contains the VTEC switching piston and receives oil from the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their {{cylinders}} were inclined {{and arranged}} outside the 7/8 in plate frames. The steam chests were arranged between the frames and the unbalanced slide valves were actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the bar frame while the slide valves, arranged above the cylinders, were actuated by Stephenson link motion through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> Two sandboxes were mounted atop the boiler, {{fore and aft}} of the steam dome.|$|R
50|$|The worm and {{sector was}} an older design, used for example in Willys and Chrysler vehicles, and the Ford Falcon (1960's). To reduce {{friction}} the sector {{is replaced by a}} roller or rotating pins on the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> arm.|$|R
50|$|The engine used Richardson slide valves, {{arranged}} {{above the}} cylinders and actuated by the Stephenson motion and <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The eccentrics were fitted to the trailing coupled wheel axle, {{which resulted in}} exceptionally long valve connecting rods of 7 ft.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately {{its most}} popular form was an {{hour-glass}} shaped worm which engages with a double-toothed roller follower on the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> for the steering arm. The {{result is that}} substantially the same leverage is provided from one steering lock to the other.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} a number of the other BR Standard Classes, the chassis design used a number of LMS-designed {{components}} including Brake Hanger Brackets, Flexible Stretcher <b>Brackets</b> and Reversing <b>Shaft</b> <b>Brackets.</b>|$|R
50|$|A pair of opposed cams or cam {{surfaces}} {{connected to}} the steering column operate a transverse <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> carrying the vehicle's steering arm. The point of difference {{was the use of}} purely rolling contact and not sliding contact in the meshing elements of a worm-and-follower steering gear.|$|R
50|$|No {{detachable}} tonneau {{to make it}} a four-seater was available. The arched {{front axle}} was tubular. The axle was given a truss and added mid-year was a <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> between it and the spring. Single cylinder 98.2 cu. inch engine with an advertised output of 9 horsepower.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Chrysler's {{contemporaneous}} hemi V8 engines, the Hemi-6's {{rocker arms}} are mounted on individual studs (similar to the Chevrolet [...] "big block" [...] V8), {{rather than on}} 2 separate <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts</b> as in all 1951-58 Hemis—Dodge, DeSoto, Imperial, and Chrysler [...] "Firepower" [...] and 1964-'71 426 V8s.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the bar frame, with balanced slide valves above, actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The locomotives were delivered with type XF tenders, which rode on 2-axle bogies {{and had a}} capacity of 10 lt t coal and 3000 imp gal water.|$|R
5000|$|The engine had {{inclined}} cylinders, arranged {{outside the}} plate frames. Its balanced slide valves were arranged above the cylinders and were actuated by Stephenson link motion through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The locomotives {{were the first}} in South Africa to have [...] "H" [...] section coupling rods and connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|In the {{overhead}} valve (OHV) design, the cylinder head contains the poppet valves and the spark plugs, along with tracts or 'ports' for the inlet and exhaust gases. The {{operation of the}} valves is initiated by the engine's camshaft, which is sited within the cylinder block, and its moment of operation is transmitted to the valves' pushrods, and then rocker arms mounted on a <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> - the <b>rocker</b> arms and <b>shaft</b> also being located within the cylinder head.|$|R
50|$|Engine: In-line 6-cylinder, {{overhead}} pushrod operated {{valve engine}} with 3699cc capacity. Separate cast iron block and aluminum crankcase with detachable cast iron 6-plug head. It has an 82 mm bore with a 114 mm stroke. 7-bearing crankshaft with vibration damper. Pressure fed lubrication with relief valve feeding <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> and timing gears.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had bar {{frames and}} used saturated steam. They had balanced slide valves, arranged above the cylinders and actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The firebox was fitted with Stroudley's flexible stays {{and the back}} casing plate was flanged outwards to facilitate {{the removal of the}} internal firebox for renewals.|$|R
50|$|For {{improved}} accessibility, {{the steam}} chests were mounted outside the frames instead of between them. The slide valves, operated by Stephenson Link motion, were {{on top of}} the cylinders and employed <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The balance weight for the Stephenson motion was seldom used on American locomotives and was replaced by a powerful coiled spring.|$|R
40|$|Outdoor {{photograph}} {{of young women}} in Bulgarian traditional costumes, some of them holding coppers and pitchers in their hands, {{one of them has}} a <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> with two coppers on it. Hand-written date and inscriptions in Bulgarian and French: "Foutaine de Vetren. / Département de T. Bazardjik. "The same photograph is published in the Bulgarian Almanac of 1894...|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} used {{saturated steam}} and had flat [...] "D" [...] type slide valves, placed above the cylinders {{and operated by}} Stephenson Link valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The leading wheels were mounted in a spring control bogie {{which was designed to}} overcome the problems of excessive flange wear on the coupled wheels and rail cutting on curves.|$|R
50|$|Bristol {{produced}} a straight-six until 1961, {{based on a}} BMW design, that was also used by many small automakers such as AC Cars and Frazer Nash. The Bristol engine had a distinctive valvegear arrangement. The hemispherical combustion chambers meant that the inlet and exhaust valves had to be mounted on separate <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts,</b> giving the engine the appearance of having double overhead camshafts. In fact the engine used {{a variation on the}} overhead valve layout, with a camshaft mounted in the engine block driving the inlet rocker arms via traditional vertical pushrods. The inlet <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> had additional cams which drove horizontal pushrods acting on the exhaust rockers on the opposite shaft. The result was an engine with very efficient gas flow due to the placement of the valves and the shape of the combustion chamber but the numerous interfaces between cams, pushrods, rockers and valves required dedicated maintenance to maintain and a lot of noise when the clearances were allowed to be become excessive.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the bar frames, with balanced Richardson type D slide valves arranged above the cylinders and actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The hind {{frame of the}} engine was of the plate type and was widened out to receive the Belpaire firebox, which itself was a notable departure from the usual practice of the CGR to use round-topped fireboxes.|$|R
5000|$|The locomotive's {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the frame, while the slide valves were arranged between the frames and actuated by Stephenson valve gear link motion through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The boiler dome was arranged above the firebox, with two Salter safety valves which were adjusted {{to blow off}} at [...] The locomotive was equipped with a No. 40 combination ejector and two vacuum brake cylinders, each 15 in in diameter.|$|R
50|$|On 12 February 1945 she was {{attacked}} by German explosive motorboats in the harbour at Split, Croatia, where she had, three months beforehand, hosted the German surrender. The attack missed Delhi and struck LCF-8, a Landing Craft Flak. The force of the resulting explosion damaged Delhi's rudder and a propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>bracket.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had inside cylinders, arranged at an incline, with slide valves {{which were}} actuated by Stephenson valve gear through <b>rocker</b> <b>shafts.</b> The cylinders and valve gear were placed between the plate frames and {{hidden from view}} by the wheels, which were coupled with external connecting rods. Together with the Cape Town Railway & Dock’s Blackie of 1859, these were the only two-cylinder locomotives with an inside cylinder and valve gear arrangement to see service in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|Strictly speaking, the tappet, also {{termed a}} cam follower, or lifter, {{is that part}} that runs on the {{camshaft}} and is made to move vertically {{by the action of}} the rotating cam. In an overhead valve engine, this tappet is fitted low down in the engine block. From there it drives a long thin pushrod, {{up to the top of}} the engine, above the cylinder head. Here the rockers, arranged on a <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> beneath the <b>rocker</b> cover, reverse the direction of the valve movement to press the valves downwards to open them.|$|R
5000|$|The E16 is a 1.6 L (1,597 cc) engine {{produced}} from 1982 through 1988. It has a 76 x 88 mm {{bore and stroke}} and produces [...] in the [...] "S" [...] (carbureted) variant and [...] in the [...] "i" [...] (throttle-body injected) variant. The first generation of this engine used a valve cover that bolted to the <b>rocker</b> <b>shaft</b> studs. This design was replaced in September 1986 with a valve cover that bolted to the head. Note that the E16 is an engine with [...] "interference valve gear".|$|R
50|$|In {{more modern}} installations, {{with more than}} one screw, a fitting {{supports}} each propeller shaft just ahead of its screw. This is usually called a <b>shaft</b> <b>bracket</b> but the part of it which extends below the shaft bearing to protect {{the lower part of the}} propeller is also a skeg. Similarly, the protective projection of the drive casing, below the rotational axis of the propeller of an outboard motor is another form of the skeg.|$|R
50|$|The Vahu ni Vav is entered {{from the}} south by {{climbing}} four steps while the well is in the north. The west wall of the first kuta has Dashavatara. The second kuta has a sculpture of Sheshayin Vishnu on the right while Saptamatrika is on the left. It has carved <b>shaft</b> <b>brackets</b> and is deeper than the other stepwell suggesting the underground flow following {{the slope of the}} site. The lower two kuta are narrower than the previous ones.|$|R
