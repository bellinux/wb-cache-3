40|$|A model {{capable of}} {{predicting}} the minimum content of Aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) in Iranian while brine cheese {{has been developed}} using a chemometric approach to determine the optimum processing conditions. <b>Renneting</b> <b>temperature,</b> cut size, stirring time, press time, curd size and saturated brine pH were all regarded as process variables. Three-dimensional response surface and contour plots were drawn. The minimum content of AFM 1 (116. 9 ng kg- 1 dry matter) was predicted when the processing variables were: Ren-neting temperature = 40 °C, Cut size = 0. 5 cm, Stirring time = 10 minutes, Press time = 20 minutes, Curd size = 64 cm 3, Saturated brine pH = 4. 6. These values predicted for opti-mum process conditions were in good agreement with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of visible-near infrared spectra, obtained using a light backscatter sensor, {{in conjunction with}} chemometrics, to predict curd moisture and whey fat content in a cheese vat was examined. A three-factor (<b>renneting</b> <b>temperature,</b> calcium chloride, cutting time), central composite design {{was carried out in}} triplicate. Spectra (300 – 1, 100 nm) of the product in the cheese vat were captured during syneresis using a prototype light backscatter sensor. Stirring followed upon cutting the gel, and samples of curd and whey were removed at 10 min intervals and analyzed for curd moisture and whey fat content. Spectral data were used to develop models for predicting curd moisture and whey fat contents using partial least squares regression. Subjecting the spectral data set to Jack-knifing improved the accuracy of the models. The whey fat models (R = 0. 91, 0. 95) and curd moisture model (R = 0. 86, 0. 89) provided good and approximate predictions, respectively. Visible-near infrared spectroscopy was found to have potential for the prediction of important syneresis indices in stirred cheese vats...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the effect of adding different biopolymers (κ-Carrageenan, xanthan gum, guar gum, high-methoxyl pectin and gelatin) on the properties of rennet skim milk gels. A collection of techniques, namely strain-controlled rheometery, spontaneous whey separation measurements, confocal laser scanning microscopy and diffusing wave spectroscopy, were used. The effects of these biopolymers were investigated for rennet skim milk gels made under model system and cheesemaking conditions. However, only rheological measurements were performed for samples made under cheesemaking conditions. For samples made under model system conditions, the concentration of the biopolymer was varied from 0 wt% to 0. 1 wt%. Experimental conditions, such as <b>renneting</b> <b>temperature</b> (30 °C), total milk-solids (10 wt% reconstituted skim milk), pH 6. 7 and rennet concentration (200 µL per 100 g sample) were kept constant. The rheological behaviour of these samples was affected by the addition of κ-carrageenan, xanthan, guar, high-methoxyl (HM) pectin and gelatin. Both rheology and diffusing-wave spectroscopy (DWS) showed that the aggregation and gelation time and the gel strength was affected by the addition of these biopolymers. It was also shown that the syneresis behaviour, as well as the microstructure of rennet gels as imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), was altered upon adding these biopolymers. The rheological and microstructural properties of model renneted skim milk systems improved by adding small amounts (0. 025 wt%) of κ-carrageenan, guar, HM pectin and gelatin, but not xanthan. Renneted skim milk containing HM pectin and gelatin had higher G*, decreased aggregation time and gelation time and lower syneresis values as the concentration of biopolymer was increased. On the other hand, lower G* and higher syneresis values were obtained for samples containing higher concentrations (> 0. 025 wt%) of κ-carrageenan, xanthan and guar gum. Higher syneresis index was a consequence of the presence of larger pores in these samples, as shown from the CLSM micrographs. The effects caused by the addition of κ-carrageenan, xanthan and guar gum were believed to be due to phase separation in rennet skim milk gels containing polysaccharide, and was explained in termsof a depletion-flocculation mechanism. For rennet gels made under cheesemaking conditions (pH 6. 2 with addition of 0. 68 mM CaCl 2), {{it was found that the}} addition of xanthan, guar, HM pectin and gelatin had similar effect to that when added to samples made under model system conditions. This was due to the fact that the differences in pH and salt were known to not affect the properties of the biopolymers. However, the addition of κ-carrageenan, which was very sensitive to ions such as calcium, improved the viscoelastic properties of rennet skim milk gels made under cheesemaking conditions. Overall, this work provides useful information on the effects of adding κ-carrageenan, xanthan, guar, high-methoxyl pectin and gelatin on the properties of rennet-induced gels...|$|E
40|$|The {{individual}} and interactive effects of four production factors (amount of vegetable <b>rennet,</b> <b>temperature</b> of coagulation, pressing and salting {{of the fresh}} cheese) and two ripening factors (temperature and relative humidity) on microbiological, physico-chemical, biochemical, textural and sensory characteristics of Serra cheese were simultaneously studied using a 2 vi 6 - 1 factorial design. Highly significant effects of salting and ripening relative humidity upon {{the characteristics of the}} cheese were detected. Addition of salt {{to the surface of the}} fresh cheese reduced microbial growth, water activity, moisture and lactic acid contents, proteolysis, lipolysis, aroma and softness of the cheese. Conversely, increase of the relative humidity during ripening increased these charactereristics. Pressing had no statistically significant effect on cheese characteristics...|$|R
50|$|Fresh, {{whole milk}} is set with <b>rennet</b> at a <b>temperature</b> of 90°F. When the curd is very firm, it is cut coarsely, then {{put in a}} sieve to allow the whey to drain off. The curd is {{collected}} in a cloth and kneaded to expel more whey. Whisky is mixed with the curd, then the curd is packed in a basket and salt is sprinkled on the surface. Curing is done in a cool, moist cellar. The cloth covering is changed daily for 3 days, and the cheese is washed with whisky after the third day.|$|R
50|$|On the farms, about 5% of {{buttermilk}} may {{be added}} to the milk, and it is set with <b>rennet</b> at a <b>temperature</b> of 28 C to 30 C. About 30 minutes later, the curd is cut with a harp, stirred, and warmed to about 33 C by pouring in hot whey. The curd is dipped with a cloth and kneaded. Cumin seeds are added to a portion of the curd, and the curd is then put into cloth-lined hoops in three layers, with the spiced curd as the middle layer. The cheese is pressed for about three hours, then it is redressed, inverted, and again pressed overnight. It may be salted with dry salt, or it may be immersed in a brine bath. It is cured in a cool, moist cellar. If the rind becomes too hard, it is washed with whey or salty water.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} partial <b>renneting</b> at low <b>temperature</b> on the casein micelle (CM) {{size and the}} storage {{stability}} of milk were investigated. Low chymosin concentrations (≤ 0. 03 IMCU mL) was applied to pasteurised skim milk at 4 °C and enzyme activity was terminated by thermal application at 60 °C/ 3 min and 85 °C/ 30 min, referred to as low heat (LHT) and high heat (HHT) treatment milk, respectively. The addition of rennet with concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 02 and 0. 03 IMCU mL for 15 min resulted in κ-casein hydrolysis of 10, 20 and 25 %, respectively. Moreover, mean CM size of milk was reduced by up to 10 nm. For LHT milk, the renneted micelles appeared to be stable for up to 17 days, especially {{in response to the}} application of 0. 01 IMCU mL and at a storage temperature of 4 °C. Severe heating at 85 °C/ 30 min to inactivate the enzyme caused an increase in CM size...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{initiate}} development of a nonrefrigerated dairy dessert product. Milk was concentrated by pressure-driven filtration and then sterilized using ultra-high temperature (UHT) processing. Following sterilization, samples were aseptically inoculated with rennet to coagulate the milk, which was then stored at room temperature. These processing steps produced a dairy dessert that did not require refrigeration. I investigated the influence of total solids, milk fat, <b>rennet</b> dosage, storage <b>temperature,</b> and storage time on curd firmness and syneresis. I investigated the effect on curd firmness and syneresis of giving the concentrate a heat treatment prior to UHT processing. Chocolate and vanilla dairy desserts were prepared, and a taste panel was conducted to compare the dairy dessert with a ready-to- eat starch-based pudding. Milk concentrate obtained by reverse osmosis did not form a gel, whereas concentrate obtained by ultrafiltration did gel. Increasing the solids content of the milk concentrate increased curd firmness, but increasing the fat content of the concentrate decreased curd firmness. Curd firmness and syneresis increased as the concentration of rennet was increased. Products stored at 21 °C yielded firmer gels with more syneresis than products stored at 4 °C. Moreover, products stored {{for longer periods of}} time produced firmer gels and greater amounts of syneresis. Concentrate that received a batch heat treatment prior to sterilization reduced syneresis. The addition of cocoa to the concentrate inhibited coagulation. Taste panelists preferred the commercial pudding over the dair...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{consumption}} of cheese has {{increased over the}} years. The average Swede consumes somewhere around 20 kilograms of cheese per year, which is an increase of a 100 % over the past 50 years. One {{of the most popular}} kinds of cheese during the past decades is mozzarella, due to its’ use as pizza cheese. Flavor and consistency differ between the traditional kind, made out of buffalo’s milk, and the industrially made kind, made out of cow’s milk. Both the techniques as well as the kinds of milk used have a huge impact on the final product. The authors had access to fresh ewe’s (sheep’s) milk from a local farmer. Could it be used to produce a new type of mozzarella? The main purpose of this paper was to develop a technique to produce fresh hand-made mozzarella made out of ewe’s milk using starter bacteria. The second purpose was to perform a sensory evaluation of the produced cheese in order to compare cheese made out of ewe’s milk with cheese made out of cow’s milk. In a series of experiments we examined how cheese production was affected by <b>rennet,</b> starter cultures, <b>temperatures</b> and pH-levels. The sensory evaluation was performed using a group of respondents who were asked to perform a simple ranking test where one sample was mozzarella made out of ewe’s milk, one sample was mozzarella made out of cow’s milk and one sample was store-bought mozzarella made out of cow’s milk. Ewe’s milk turned out to be unsuitable for production of mozzarella using the procedure we developed. The proteins in ewe’s milk behaved differently from the proteins in cow’s milk when the cheese curd was stretched in hot water, resulting in a less stringy and more porous texture. The most suitable bacterial starter was a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, both of which you find in yoghurt. Results from the sensory evaluation showed that the respondents preferred the fresh mozzarella made out of cow’s milk. The method that we developed did not produce the desired texture in mozzarella made out of ewe’s milk. However, it is well adjusted for the production of mozzarella made out of cow’s milk.
