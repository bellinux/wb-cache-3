5|$|After his Test debut, Hunt was {{expected}} to be the Queensland fullback in the first match of the three game State of Origin series. However, Queensland selectors decided to stay with incumbent Origin fullback Matt Bowen. The selectors reconsidered after Queensland lost the first game, selecting Hunt for the second match. In his State of Origin debut, Hunt <b>ran</b> <b>with</b> the ball seventeen times, making 196 metres. He missed the third Origin game because of a foot injury, sustained in the Broncos' Round 15 match, and was replaced by Clinton Schifcofske.|$|E
5|$|Fox <b>ran</b> <b>with</b> {{an unusual}} gait, {{as he was}} {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E
5|$|Gay activists, newly {{alarmed at}} {{the threat to}} their rights, confronted vice {{president}} Walter Mondale at a political rally in San Francisco {{two weeks after the}} announcement of Proposition 6.

When gay activists interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.|$|E
