An exhaustive set of <b>reference</b> <b>accident</b> sequences are defined in order to evaluate plant response in the most challenging events and compliance with safety requirements. The Functional Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FFMEA) has been chosen as analytical tool, as it is a suitable methodology to define possible accident initiators when insufficient design detail is available to allow for more specific evaluation at component level. The main process, safety and protection functions related to the DEMO plant are defined through a functional breakdown structure (FBS). Then, an exhaustive set of high level accident initiators is defined referring to loss of functions, rather than to specific failures of systems and components, overcoming the lack of detailed design information. Nonetheless reference to systems or main components is always highlighted, as much as possible, in order to point out causes and safety consequences.

40|$|Events {{which could}} be {{considered}} a "major accident to the environment" are very diverse in nature. The UK Department of the Environment (DoE) has published a "Green Book" giving the definitions of such events. UK AEA Technology has attempted to define tolerability criteria for accidents to the environment in terms of an environmental severity index (ESI) which is the ratio of the severity of the accident to that of the most appropriate <b>reference</b> <b>accident</b> from the DoE Green Book. These criteria were proposed only for releases to rivers. This paper describes the development of risk assessment framework based on an environmental risk index (ERI) proposed (in tradition of the ICI Mond Index method for flammable hazards). The ERI {{is a measure of the}} total severity and probability of a wide range of possible environmental consequences which could result from any particular release. The tolerability criteria developed for the ESI method can also be used with the ERI. The ERI method is designed to facilitate rapid screening of the environmental risks from a variety of release scenarios. The effects of various methods for prevention and mitigation of the release can be taken into account. The framework will be described with reference to a hypothetical case study involving an accidental release of a pesticide into the River Don in Sheffield from a manufacturing plant. This has led to a number of improvements to the method, including a revision of the tolerability criteria proposed by AEA Technology. As for Malaysia, a similar approach could be proposed and adopted, as necessary...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the impact of natural hazards on process plants as well as on infrastructures for energy supply may cause severe accidents involving the release of significant quantities of hazardous substances. These so-called "Natech" disasters deserve particular attention as they can result in multiple and simultaneous releases of hazardous materials. A further complication comes from the different consequences that may be related to different types of natural events that result in important differences in the expected damage to process equipment. Currently, there is only limited data available on Natech disasters, their prevalence, their triggering mechanisms, and the vulnerability of the various types of industry exposed. The present contribution is devoted to exploring the characteristics of different categories of Natech disasters, in particular those triggered by floods and earthquakes. Available data on Natech accidents were retrieved from several industrial accident databases in Europe and in the US. The analysis of accident data gives an indication of the expected damage of process equipment caused by the impact of natural events. Information was obtained on the expected loss of containment (LOC) events. The scenarios following the LOC events were related to substance hazard and to the intensity of LOCs. The presence and the role of safety barriers was investigated as well. The results allowed the identification of the critical equipment items with respect to the different Natech events and the definition of <b>reference</b> <b>accident</b> scenarios likely to be triggered by natural events in industrial plants.

This paper deals with the second stage of a global methodology aiming at better assessing benefits gained from safety devices and safety management systems, through accident scenarios selection.

40|$|Abstract. A National Emergency Plan {{was set up}} in Italy {{after the}} Chernobyl accident, to cope with the {{following}} nuclear risk sources: accidents in foreign nuclear power plants or aboard nuclear- propelled ships, falling of satellites using nuclear power units, transportation of radioactive materials. Moreover, this plan gives the general requirements of the emergency preparedness and response to be implemented into the local planning (Provincial Emergency Plan), on the basis of <b>reference</b> <b>accidents</b> for research reactors, nuclear power and reprocessing plants (shut down) in Italy. However in the National Emergency Plan are not considered, neither for local scale nor for the national one, the accidents with radiation sources, used {{for a wide variety of}} purposes in industry, medicine and research. Besides, after the events of 11 September 2001, it is raised the awareness of the risks created by radiation sources, because of their potential use for malevolent purposes (exposure of public to radiation or use of a source in a radiological dispersion device, commonly referred to as “dirty bomb”). Moreover, for a terrorist action, the personal danger from handling powerful radiation sources can not be seen as an effective deterrent. It is clear that a re-evaluation of risks involved and a planning of the interventions to protect the public is needed as also stated by the requirements set up in the new standard proposed by the IAEA. In this paper the radiological consequences of radioactivity dispersion by using conventional explosive have been evaluated for the main applications of radioactive sources. 1...|$|R
40|$|Incineration {{of urban}} solid waste accidentally {{contaminated}} by orphan sources or radioactive material {{is a potential}} risk for environment and public health. Moreover, production and emission of radioactive fumes can cause a heavy contamination of the plant, leading to important economic detriment. In order to prevent such a hazard, in February 2004 a radiometric portal for detection of radioactive material in incoming waste has been installed at AMSA (Azienda Milanese per i Servizi Ambientali 2) “Silla 2 ” urban solid waste incineration plant of Milan. Radioactive detections performed from installation time up to December 2006 consist entirely of low-activity material contaminated from radiopharmaceuticals (mainly 131 I). In this work {{an estimate of the}} dose that would have been committed to population, due to incineration of the radioactive material detected by the radiometric portal, has been evaluated. Furthermore, public health and environmental effects due to incineration of a high-activity source have been estimated. Incineration of the contaminated material detected appears to have negligible effects at all; the evaluated annual collective dose, almost entirely conferred by 131 I, is indeed 0. 1 man mSv. Otherwise, incineration of a 3, 7 1010 Bq (1 Ci) source of 137 Cs, assumed as <b>reference</b> <b>accident,</b> could result in a light environmental contamination involving a large area. Although the maximum total dose, owing to inhalation and submersion, committed to a single individual appears to be negligible (less than 10 − 8 Sv), the environmental contamination leads to a potential important exposure due to ingestion of contaminated foods. With respect to “Silla 2 ” plant and to the worst meteorological conditions, the evaluated collective dose results in 0, 34 man Sv. Performed analyses have confirmed that radiometric portals, which are today mainly used in foundries, represent a valid public health and environmental protection also in urban waste incineration plants...|$|E
40|$|Open access articleThe {{objective}} of an accident-mapping algorithm is to snap traffic accidents onto the correct road segments. Assigning accidents onto the correct segments facilitate to robustly carry out some key analyses in accident research including {{the identification of}} accident hot-spots, network-level risk mapping and segment-level accident risk modelling. Existing risk mapping algorithms have some severe limitations: (i) they are not easily ‘transferable’ as the algorithms are specific to given accident datasets; (ii) they do not perform well in all road-network environments such as in areas of dense road network; and (iii) the methods used do not perform well in addressing inaccuracies inherent in and type of road environment. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop a new accident mapping algorithm based on the common variables observed in most accident databases (e. g. road name and type, direction of vehicle movement before the accident and recorded accident location). The challenges here are to: (i) develop a method that takes into account uncertainties inherent to the recorded traffic accident data and the underlying digital road network data, (ii) accurately determine the type and proportion of inaccuracies, and (iii) develop a robust algorithm that can be adapted for any accident set and road network of varying complexity.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the background}} and current status of the information basis leading {{to the definition of}} risk and emergency zones around nuclear power plants (NPPs) in different countries in Europe and beyond. Although dependable plant-specific probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) of level 2 and/or level 3 could in principle provide sufficiently detailed input to define the geographical dimension of a NPP s risk and emergency zones, the analysis of the status in some European and other countries shows that other, deterministic approaches using a <b>reference</b> <b>accident</b> are actually used in practice. Regarding use of level 2 PSA for emergency planning, the approach so far has been to use the level 2 PSA information retrospectively to provide the justification for the choice of reference accident(s) used to define the emergency plans and emergency planning zones (EPZs). There are significant differences in the EPZs that are defined in different countries, ranging from a few up to 80 km. There is a striking contrast in the extent of using probabilistic information to define emergency zones between the nuclear and other high risk industry sectors, such as the chemical process industry, and the reasons for these differences are not entirely clear, since the risk of chemical industry is similar as that of the nuclear sector. The differences seem to be more related to risk perception than to the actual risk potential. Therefore, there is a strong {{need to be able to}} communicate risk information to the Public both before and following an accident. In addition, there is a need to educate the Public so that they can understand risk information in a comparative sense. Finally, based on the consensus discussions at a recent JRC/OECD International Seminar on Risk And Emergency Zoning around NPPs, a set of recommendations is given in the areas of a more comprehensive use of the available risk information for risk zoning purposes, risk communication; comparative (energy) risk assessment.

The <b>reference</b> <b>accident</b> LLOCA (Large Loss of Coolant Accident) is the rupture of a pipe in the primary circuit of a nuclear plant. In this case, the pressure and temperature can reach 5 bar and 180 °C in 20 seconds. The national project ‘Non-destructive testing of the containment structures of nuclear plants’ aims at studying the non-destructive techniques capable to evaluate the concrete properties and its damaging or progression of cracks. This 4 -year-project is segmented into two parts. The first consists in developing and selecting the most relevant NDEs (Non Destructive Evaluations) in the laboratory to reach these goals. These evaluations are developed in conditions representing the real conditions of the stresses generated during ten-yearly visits of the plants or those related to an accident. The second part consists in applying the selected techniques to two containment structures under pressure. The first (technique) is proposed by the ONERA (National Office for Aerospace Studies and Research of France) and the second is a mock-up of a containment wall on a 1 / 3 scale made by EDF (Electricity of France) within the VeRCoRs program.
