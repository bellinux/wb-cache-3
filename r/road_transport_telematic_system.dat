40|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>telematic</b> <b>systems,</b> {{also known}} as {{intelligent}} transportation systems, can be expensive to implement but the services they provide may offer substantial benefits. However, what services the system can provide depends on the architectural choices made, which also affects {{the cost of the}} system. We propose an optimization model to support a more informed decision before investing in a multiple service <b>transport</b> <b>telematic</b> <b>system.</b> The model evaluates the possible choices of services and architectures, and aims to maximize the total net societal benefit. We argue that the optimization model can provide support for strategic decisions by highlighting the consequences of adopting different system architectures, including both societal value and cost. This can be useful for decision makers, such as governments, <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>telematic</b> service providers, and commercial <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> operators...|$|R

This article presents an optimization perspective for evaluating conceptual options of <b>transport</b> <b>telematic</b> architecture in relation to benefits to the society. These benefits are evaluated in the context of multiple services and provide one way for comparing between alternative conceptual options for <b>telematic</b> <b>system</b> architectures that can support multiple services.

40|$|The rapid growing of {{applications}} of Advanced <b>Transport</b> <b>Telematic</b> (ATT) <b>systems</b> {{in recent years}} is generating an increasing request for tools to help in system design and assessment. Microscopic traffic simulation has proven {{to be one of the}} most useful tools to achieve these objectives, and thus microscopic traffic simulation has become an ever increasing field of research and development. The development of a microscopic traffic simulator represents a double challenge: traffic and network modeling on one hand, and how to embed the models in a software platform interfacing the user in a friendly and efficient way. This paper summarizes the most relevant concepts in microscopic traffic simulation, and how they have been implemented in AIMSUN 2. Other applications of microscopic traffic simulation can be envisaged provided the computing time can be shortened properly. For large scale models parallelization appears to be a natural way to achieve such speeding-up objectives. The paper concludes by describing the parallelization approach used and presenting the first computational results of the parallelization of AIMSUN 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{assessment}} of <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> for <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> from a planning perspective. The aim is to support strategic decisions related to architectural choices for such systems, with the possibility to achieve synergies by supporting multiple telematic services. The past decade has witnessed enormous growth in cargo volumes resulting in increasing demand for transport capacity. To match this increasing demand only with expansion of infrastructure, e. g. road and vehicles, {{does not seem to}} be a sustainable strategy. One of the few approaches with the potential to improve the use of current transport capacity is the integrated use of modern information and communication technology, otherwise known as <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> for <b>road</b> <b>transport,</b> an important component within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). This type of systems can deliver multiple services that can be used to improve the efficiency and safety of <b>road</b> freight <b>transport.</b> However, attempts to unleash the potential of <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> and make maximum possible use of the available transport capacity have been hindered by several challenges ranging from planning and design to development and deployment. Considering the large scope of possible telematic services that can potentially be deployed in <b>road</b> freight <b>transport,</b> this thesis suggests a framework in order to enable structured assessment of <b>telematic</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on the suggested framework, a set of potential <b>transport</b> <b>telematic</b> services are identified and a method for quantifying the value of the services to society is developed. The suggested method takes into account the expected impact on different transportation challenges, such as accidents, fuel consumption, and infrastructure maintenance. Quantitative methods are provided for studying the value of services sharing a common infrastructure. Using quantified benefits of services and costs of various functionalities required by telematic services, the concept of a multi-service architecture is investigated using optimization methods, which handles the multi-dimensional relations between different services that are otherwise difficult to analyze with traditional cost-benefit analysis. The analyses show which telematic services can be achieved with different approaches, such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, etc. Although multi-service architectures are promising, several challenges need to be overcome, including security, service quality, privacy, and business models. The knowledge gained from the work presented in this thesis can be valuable for different stakeholders, such as governments, service providers, and transport service users, in fostering the planning, design, development, and deployment of <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> in <b>transport...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{assessing}} potential synergies among {{different sets of}} <b>transport</b> <b>telematic</b> services (TTSs) is suggested. An Intelligent Transport System enhances transport by delivering one or more TTSs. The ability to deliver multiple TTSs to address {{a wide range of}} stakeholder needs is gaining momentum, not only from a marketing perspective but also from a technological perspective. The total cost of TTSs can be reduced if they share functionalities (i. e., sub-services provided by <b>telematic</b> <b>systems).</b> We show how this synergy can be assessed with the help of clustering methods. Knowledge about possible synergies of functionalities is useful in the (re) design and eventual deployment of TTSs, especially when the underlying <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> are able to support multiple TTSs. To adapt the clustering method for this purpose, we suggest a mathematical formulation of synergy among functionalities of TTSs. By applying the method to a set of 32 TTSs, we obtain a cluster formation of these TTSs according to their synergy measures. Overall, the results suggest that the joint implementation of TTSs targeted toward some problem domains can lead to significant cost savings, for example, Road User Charging, Infrastructure Repair and Maintenance, and Information on the Transport of extra large goods for the management of <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{tested the}} merits of 9 common workload assessment techniques with relatively short periods of workload in a car-driving task. Twelve participants drove an instrumented car and performed a visually loading task and a mentally loading task for 10, 30, and 60 s. The results show that 10 -s periods of visual and mental workload can be measured successfully with subjective ratings and secondary task performance. With respect to longer loading periods (30 and 60 s), steering frequency {{was found to be}} sensitive to visual workload, and skin conductance response (SCR) was sensitive to mental workload. The results lead to preliminary guidelines that will help applied researchers to determine which techniques are best suited for assessing visual and mental workload. In recent years, major research programs in Europe, the United States, and Japan have boosted the development of information systems in road traffic. In Europe, these systems are referred to as transport telematics, but in the United States the term intelligent transport systems (ITS) is more common. It is generally expected that <b>transport</b> <b>telematic</b> applications will change the nature of car driving considerably in the near future. A vast array of telematics systems is currently being considered.

40|$|In this thesis, {{methods for}} using {{computer-based}} models as support tools for assessing <b>Transport</b> <b>Telematic</b> Services (TTSs) are studied. Such assessments provide {{one way to}} understand how TTSs can address problems caused by transportation, such as accidents, emissions, and energy consumption. TTSs are services based on <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> which are Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) involving the integrated use of {{information and communication technologies}} in transport. The focus is on TTSs that are relevant for <b>road</b> freight <b>transport,</b> even though the suggested methods can easily be adapted for TTSs in other areas. We characterize TTSs, e. g., in terms of their functionalities, and apply computer-based modeling for pre-deployment assessment of various TTSs (from an ex-ante perspective). By analyzing information provided by the suggested computer-based models, it is possible to make an informed decision whether to (or not to) deploy a given TTS. A review of previous studies reveals information about relevant TTSs for freight transport in areas such as driver support, administration, safety, traffic management, parking, and goods handling. A hierarchical clustering algorithm and a k-minimum spanning tree algorithm were employed to analyze synergies of TTSs. Synergies can enable identification of sets of TTSs that can lead to cost savings if deployed on a common platform (cf. Multi-Service Architectures). An analytical model inspired by the net present value concept is used to estimate quantified societal benefits of TTSs. An optimization model is formulated and solved using a branch and bound method to determine an optimal combination of TTSs taking into consideration societal benefits, costs, dependencies, and synergies. The optimization model also addresses possible system architectures for achieving multiple TTSs. Dominance rough set approach is used to assess and compare benefit areas for TTSs specific to truck parking. The benefit areas are suggested with the help of conceptual modeling, which describes functional models of a system in terms of states, transitions among states, and actions performed in states. The main scientific contributions of the thesis are in suggesting new quantitative models, extending and applying existing models in the assessments of TTSs, and obtaining results that can help decision-makers select TTSs for medium-to long-term investments. Researchers can employ and build on the proposed methods when addressing different scenarios (geographic or organizational) involving similar TTSs. By studying a range of TTSs and possible Multi-Service Architecture concepts for such TTSs, the thesis contributes to achieving convergence of TTSs in a Multi-Service Architecture environment that will improve cost efficiency, minimize redundancies, and encourage the establishment of standards in the deployment of TTSs in <b>road</b> freight <b>transport.</b> TTSs implemented in such an environment can contribute to optimizing available capacity, accuracy, speed, and efficiency of <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> systems...|$|R
