5|$|Damage to {{buildings}} and structures can range from complete or partial roof collapse to less catastrophic damage of exterior and internal materials. Impacts depend on the thickness of ash, whether it is wet or dry, the roof and building design and how much ash gets inside a building. The specific weight of ash can vary significantly and rain can increase this by 50-100%. Problems associated with ash loading are {{similar to that of}} snow; however, ash is more severe as 1) the load from ash is generally much greater, 2) ash does not melt and 3) ash can clog and damage gutters, especially after <b>rain</b> <b>fall.</b> Impacts for ash loading depend on building design and construction, including roof slope, construction materials, roof span and support system, and age and maintenance of the building. Generally flat roofs are more susceptible to damage and collapse than steeply pitched roofs. Roofs made of smooth materials (sheet metal or glass) are more likely to shed ash than roofs made with rough materials (thatch, asphalt or wood shingles). Roof collapse can lead to widespread injuries and deaths and property damage. For example, the collapse of roofs from ash during the 15 June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption killed about 300 people.|$|E

Occasionally flooding occurs, but it is usually caused by a large spring run-off as opposed to heavy <b>rain</b> <b>fall.</b> The last flood in the Willow Bunch area occurred in 2011 when Highway 36 was washed out.|$|E

25|$|The Bangladeshi wickets {{receive a}} lot of <b>rain</b> <b>fall</b> in little time which {{reflects}} the soggy nature. The conditions vary from grounds like Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium and Chittagong Divisional Stadium. The basic idea of producing wickets in Bangladesh is to avoid using grassroots when they are building up the layers of soil. The roots hold the water and retain moisture for an extended period. It helps bind the wicket better, making it a harder surface eventually. It also slows the process of wearing down.|$|E
25|$|As per Köppen-Geiger climate {{classification}} system the climate in Guntur is tropical (Aw). The average temperature is warm to hot year-round. The summer season (especially during May/June) {{has the highest}} temperatures, but these are usually followed by monsoon rains. The winter season (from November to February) is the most enjoyable with a pleasant climate. Winter months are usually dry, with little to no rainfall. The wettest month is July. The average annual temperature is 28.5 C and annual <b>rain</b> <b>fall</b> is about 905mm. Rain storms and cyclones are common in the region during the rainy season, which starts with the monsoons in early June. Cyclones may occur {{any time of the}} year, but occur more commonly between May and November.|$|E
25|$|The building's roof is {{accessed}} {{through an}} interior wooden stair. Made of thin bricks, three layers deep, {{as it was}} the practice by the 1860s, and surrounded by a three-foot high parapet, the roof contains various elements of architectural interest. First, there are the ventilation structures described previously. In addition, the engineering techniques applied {{in the design of the}} roof's drainage speaks well of the craftsman quality at the time. The flat roof slopes slightly towards the western edge, pushing any rainfall into that direction, while, at the same time, at the foot of the parapet, the deck was slightly raised in an arrow shape, dividing the incoming water current and forcing it directly into the drainage holes. The <b>rain</b> <b>fall</b> capture at the roof, according to historic documentation, finds its ways into a well located at the patio.|$|E

25|$|The River Wansbeck Valley is {{narrow and}} steep {{and as a}} {{consequence}} has exaggerated amounts of surface runoff. Based on three storm events, a reliable flow gauge located upstream of Morpeth at the confluence of the Wansbeck and Font showed that 56% of <b>rain</b> <b>fall</b> is converted into surface runoff. Because the soil was already saturated {{as a result of the}} wet summer, the effect of surface runoff was greatly enhanced. Furthermore, increased urbanisation since the 1960s in Morpeth meant that most water falling on the town would have drained directly to the river channel. Other tests investigating the catchment lag time (time lapse between the midpoint of storm rainfall and peak river level) indicate that the Wansbeck has a LAG time of only 8 hours. This means that any water falling in the catchment area would have been rapidly converted into channel flow by surface runoff and to a lesser extent by throughflow. This is due to the steepness of the valley and the soil composition.|$|E
