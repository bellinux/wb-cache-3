40|$|Regulators try {{to change}} consumers’ {{behaviour}} by issuing advice. This regulatory approach is built on a particular, normative theory of social action that assumes that individuals are unable to make rational decisions when they have imperfect knowledge about risk, and that this deficiency can be overcome by advice that offers them proper information. This paper examines the question, can a regulatory tool based on rational choice theory be efficient in reducing risky behaviours? After considering the debate within the risk-communication community {{about the use of}} this kind of a regulatory tool, we analyse (using the example of fish consumption advice) the risk assessment that the advice is derived from. Then we analyse the public response to the advice through the implementation of a five-month experiment among 200 French households. We show that individuals did not change their consumption to comply with the advice. We conclude that the advice transfers the initial uncertainty onto consumers turning it into ambiguity and complexity. La réglementation essaye de changer le comportement des consommateurs en diffusant des recommandations de consommation. Cette approche réglementaire présuppose que les individus puissent rationnellement modifier leur comportement après la révélation d’information. Les auteurs analysent la réaction à une <b>recommandation</b> révélée à 200 ménages français dans le cadre d’une expérience de cinq mois. Les auteurs montrons que les ménages ne changent pas leur consommation à la suite de la révélation de la <b>recommandation.</b> Ils concluent que la <b>recommandation</b> transfert l’incertitude initiale vers les consommateurs en amplifiant l’ambiguïté et la complexité de l’information scientifique...|$|E

40|$|The {{context of}} this thesis work is dynamic recommendation. Recommendation is the action,for an {{intelligent}} system, to supply a user of an application with personalized content so as toenhance what is refered to as ”user experience” e. g. recommending a product on a merchantwebsite or even an article on a blog. Recommendation is considered dynamic when the contentto recommend or user tastes evolve rapidly e. g. news recommendation. Many applications thatare of interest to us generates {{a tremendous amount of}} data through the millions of online usersthey have. Nevertheless, using this data to evaluate a new recommendation technique or evencompare two dynamic recommendation algorithms is far from trivial. This is the problem weconsider here. Some approaches have already been proposed. Nonetheless they were not studiedvery thoroughly both from a theoretical point of view (unquantified bias, loose convergencebounds [...] .) and from an empirical one (experiments on private data only). In this work we startby filling many blanks within the theoretical analysis. Then we comment on the result of anexperiment of unprecedented scale in this area: a public challenge we organized. This challengealong with a some complementary experiments revealed a unexpected source of a huge bias:time acceleration. The rest of this work tackles this issue. We show that a bootstrap-basedapproach allows to significantly reduce this bias and more importantly to control it. Ce travail de th`ese a ́et ́e r ́ealis ́e dans le contexte de la <b>recommandation</b> dynamique. La recom-mandation est l’action de fournir du contenu personnalis ́e `a un utilisateur utilisant une ap-plication, dans le but d’am ́eliorer son utilisation e. g. la <b>recommandation</b> d’un produit surun site marchant ou d’un article sur un blog.
