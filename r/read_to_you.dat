Pearce was no exception, moving to HSV Channel 7 in Melbourne working as a newsreader and quiz show host. Pearce provided the first TV news report for that channel on 4 November 1956. The Argus reviewer F. Keith Manzie described Melbourne's first TV broadcast [...] "I liked Eric Pearce as a compere. His easy-mannered, genial personality came right through the viewing screen in the quiz show, I've Got a Secret ... reading of the news was illustrated with appropriate newsreel shots". In 1956 he was also co-host of the series Eric and Mary, and in 1957 he was host of Be My Guest. Pearce resigned from HSV-7 in the late 1950s. He believed that newsreaders required credibility and that doing anything other than news for a job was ill-advised. When GTV Channel 9 offered him employment as chief news reader without him having to do any other shows, he took it. In 1961, he appeared in Let Me <b>Read</b> <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> {{in which he would}} read from popular works.|$|E

6000|$|... "Humble, by Jove!" [...] exclaims the husband. [...] "No gammon of that sort, Polly. You {{know well}} {{enough that you}} are a {{superior}} woman. I ain't a superior man. I know that: one is enough in a family. I leave the <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> my dear. Here comes my horses. I say, I wish you'd call on Lady Anne to-day. Do go and see her, now that's a good girl. I know she is flighty, and that; and Brian's back is up a little.

6000|$|... 'Then here,' {{said the}} old gentleman, 'is a little manuscript, which I had hoped to have the {{pleasure}} of <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> myself. I found it {{on the death of}} a friend of mine--a medical man, engaged in our county lunatic asylum--among a variety of papers, which I had the option of destroying or preserving, as I thought proper. I can hardly believe that the manuscript is genuine, though it certainly is not in my friend's hand.
