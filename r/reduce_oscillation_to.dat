Oscillation will occur in electric vehicle drivetrains when drivers tip in/out or are shifting. In order to improve vehicle response to transients, reduce vehicle jerk and reduce wear of drivetrain parts, torque step changes should be avoided. This article mainly focuses on drivetrain oscillations caused by torque interruption for shifting in a Motor-Transmission Integrated System. It {{takes advantage of the}} motor responsiveness, an optimal active control method is presented <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>oscillations</b> by adjusting motor torque output dynamically. A rear-wheel-drive electric vehicle with a two gear automated manual transmission is considered to set up dynamic differential equations based on Newton’s law of motion. By linearization of the affine system, a joint genetic algorithm and linear quadratic regulator method is applied to calculate the real optimal motor torque. In order to improve immediacy of the control system, time consuming optimization process of parameters is completed off-line.

40|$|Sliding-mode {{observers}} (SMOs) offer {{a promising}} solution for sensorless control of interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs) {{due to their}} excellent robustness to system structure and parameter uncertainty. However, in practical applications, it is challenging for an SMO to achieve a perfect estimation for the back electromagnetic force (EMF) using a finite or relatively lower sampling frequency, especially for high-speed applications. Phase shift, magnitude variation, and heavy noise in the estimated back EMF will cause unexpected errors in rotor position extraction. Thus, advanced rotor position extraction methods are needed to obtain position information from the estimated back EMF. This paper proposes a novel estimated speed feedback algorithm to work together with the conventional inverse tangent method and angle tracking observer (ATO) to extract the rotor position from the extended back EMF obtained from a discrete SMO. The extracted position has <b>reduced</b> <b>oscillations</b> compared <b>to</b> that obtained from traditional methods.

In this paper, a method based on Slave-Master Feedback (SMF) to suppress unstable radial oscillations of contrast agents is presented. In the proposed control process, the encapsulated microbubbles as the slave system is coupled with a dynamical system as the master, so that the output of the coupled system is able to produce a stable oscillation. A great virtue of this control technique is its flexibility. In comparison with existing techniques, the present dynamical chaos control method does not need to know more than one variable.

The field similarity of bump magnets was also improved by replacing them with newly designed ones, where the effects of eddy current at the end plates were reduced. These countermeasures suppressed the horizontal oscillation by about one order.

40|$|Acoustic {{cavitation}} bubbles {{are known}} to exhibit highly nonlinear and unpredictable chaotic dynamics. Their inevitable role in applications like sonoluminescence, sonochemistry and medical procedures suggests that their dynamics be controlled. <b>Reducing</b> chaotic <b>oscillations</b> {{could be the first}} step in controlling the bubble dynamics by increasing the predictability of the bubble response to an applied acoustic field. One way to achieve this concept is to perturb the acoustic forcing.

40|$|Most {{assembly}} {{tasks in}} industry require the manipulator end effectors {{to come into}} contact with the work piece. Hence force sensing and feedback can be used to ensure contact between two mating parts, and can be used to monitor the forces of interaction to ensure that they are within a safe limit. As demand for advanced contact control increases, a growth of interest in force regulation and impact control has resulted. Force control technology has not been commonly practiced in the current generation of die and wire bonding machines. To regulate the impact force, one has to rely on an accurate position control and low bonding movement. This limits the performance and productivity of the bonding machines. To improve this situation, a force feedback control becomes necessary. Force feedback control has several advantages over the accurate position control in most die and bonding machines: (1) Regulation of impact force with even wide variations in die size. (2) Maintenance of constant contact forces to any desirable levels after impact. (3) Substantially <b>reducing</b> <b>oscillation</b> period <b>to</b> enhance the bonding rate. To verify and analysis the force control technology, force control has been implemented on an industrial vertical wire bonding machine.

40|$|Continuous {{combustion}} systems {{common in}} propulsion and power generation applications {{are susceptible to}} thermoacoustic instability, which occurs under lean burn conditions close to the flammability where most emissions and efficiency benefits are achieved, and near stoichiometry where often high power density can be realized. This instability is undesirable because the accompanying large pressure and heat release rate <b>oscillations</b> lead <b>to</b> high levels of acoustic noise and vibration as well as structural damage. Active control is one approach using which such instabilities can be mitigated. Over the past five to ten years, {{it has been shown}} conclusively through several lab-scale studies that active control is highly successful in suppressing the pressure oscillations. This success has set the stage for transition of the technology from laboratories to large-scale applications in propulsion and power generation. This thesis provides some of the building blocks for enabling this transition. The first building block concerns the modeling of hydrodynamics and its interactions with the other components that contribute to combustion dynamics. The second is the impact of active control on emissions even while suppressing the pressure instability. The third is the evaluation of model-based active controllers in realistic combustors with configurations that include swirl, large convective delays and unknown changes in the operating conditions. The above three building blocks are investigated in the thesis experimentally in three different configurations. The first is a 2 D backward facing step combustor, constructed at MIT, with the goal of investigating the flame-vortex interactions and the impact of active control on emissions. The second(cont.) is a dump combustor, constructed at University of Maryland, so as to reproduce more realistic ramjet conditions. The third is an industrial swirl-stabilized combustor, constructed at University of Cambridge, to mimic realistic industrial gas combustor configurations which typically include large convective time delays, swirl, and on-line changes in the operating conditions. Results obtained from these three configurations show that through an understanding of the underlying physics and reduced-order modeling, one can design an appropriate actuation, sensing and control algorithm, all of which lead to model-based active control that <b>reduces</b> pressure <b>oscillations</b> <b>to</b> background noise. by Sungbae Park.

40|$|Computational {{aeroacoustics}} {{often use}} finite difference schemes optimized to require relatively few points per wavelength; such optimized schemes are often called Dispersion Relation Preserving (DRP). Similar techniques {{are also used}} outside aeroacoustics. Here the question is posed: what {{is the equivalent of}} points per wavelength for growing or decaying waves, and how well are such waves resolved numerically? Such non-constant-amplitude waves are common in aeroacoustics, such as the exponential decay caused by acoustic linings, the O(1 /r) decay of an expanding spherical wave, and the decay of high-azimuthal-order modes in the radial direction towards the centre of a cylindrical duct. It is shown that optimized spatial derivatives perform poorly for waves that are not of constant amplitude, under performing maximal-order schemes. An equivalent criterion to points per wavelength is proposed for non-constant-amplitude <b>oscillations,</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>to</b> the standard definition for constant-amplitude oscillations and valid even for pure growth or decay with no oscillation.
