5|$|A {{delicate}} rose {{color in}} Navajo rugs comes from fermented {{prickly pear cactus}} fruit, Opuntia polyacantha. Navajo weavers also use <b>rainwater</b> and red dirt to create salmon-pink dyes.|$|E
5|$|A drain {{near the}} {{northeast}} corner of Pyramid B3 carries runoff <b>rainwater</b> from the Group B plaza and channels it outside the retaining wall to the area between Groups B and D.|$|E
5|$|Leo James <b>Rainwater</b> {{was born}} on December 9, 1917, in Council, Idaho, {{the son of a}} former civil {{engineer}} who ran the local general store, Leo Jaspar <b>Rainwater</b> and his wife Edna Eliza née Teague. He never used his first name and was always referred to as James or Jim. His father died in the great influenza epidemic of 1918 and <b>Rainwater</b> and his mother moved to Hanford, California, where she married George Fowler, a widower with two sons, Freeman and John. In time he also acquired a half-brother, George Fowler, Jr., who became naval officer. At high school he excelled in mathematics, chemistry and physics and was admitted to the California Institute of Technology on the strength of a chemistry competition. He received his Bachelor of Science degree as a physics major in 1939.|$|E

5|$|The <b>rainwater</b> which {{falls on}} Poh Ern Shih is {{collected}} from surface run-offs and rain gutters {{and used to}} irrigate the temple grounds, {{as well as to}} generate electricity used for charging the batteries of in-house motorised wheelchairs. The electricity is produced by water from the highest floor of the temple passing through hydroelectric-generators. A purification system is also being installed, so that the collected <b>rainwater</b> can be filtered and made potable.|$|E
5|$|There {{are limited}} natural fresh water {{resources}} on Nauru. Rooftop storage tanks collect <b>rainwater.</b> The islanders are mostly dependent on three desalination plants housed at Nauru's Utilities Agency.|$|E
5|$|An air well {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a dew pond. A dew pond is an artificial pond intended for watering livestock. The name dew pond (sometimes cloud pond or mist pond) derives from the widely held belief that the pond was filled by moisture from the air. In fact, dew ponds are primarily filled by <b>rainwater.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leo James <b>Rainwater</b> (December 9, 1917 – May 31, 1986) was an American {{physicist}} {{who shared}} the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 {{for his part}} in determining the asymmetrical shapes of certain atomic nuclei.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} of the Classic Maya cities, Tikal had no water other than what was {{collected}} from <b>rainwater</b> and stored in ten reservoirs. Archaeologists working in Tikal during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use.|$|E
5|$|The library {{incorporates}} many {{energy and}} water saving design features such as <b>rainwater</b> harvesting for flushing water, computerized building management, use of local species in landscape design, and automatic lighting control. Low-emission interior finishes {{have been used to}} improve indoor air quality, and a green housekeeping policy seeks to reduce exposure of occupants to contaminants.|$|E
5|$|The northwestern and {{northern}} {{portions of the}} Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall {{than the rest of}} the peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. This limestone geology results in most <b>rainwater</b> filtering directly through the bedrock to the phreatic zone, from whence it slowly flows to the coasts to form large submarine springs. Various freshwater springs rise along the coast to form watering holes. The filtering of <b>rainwater</b> through the limestone has caused the formation of extensive cave systems. These cave rooves are subject to collapse forming deep sinkholes; if the bottom of the cave is deeper than the groundwater level then a cenote is formed.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{abruptly}} {{changes to}} the house {{from the beginning of}} the film. Two figures that appear to be Kelvin and his father embrace at the doorstep. However, after showing <b>rainwater</b> in the house, the camera pans out and reveals that the two men are on an island in the Solaris ocean.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the main}} central shrine there are slab {{coverings}} which have perforations in them to drain <b>rainwater</b> {{to a large}} underground storage. The pipe lines from the roof lead the rain water to the storage are also visible. The temple needs conservation measures to preserve the ancient monument in good shape.|$|E
5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking <b>rainwater</b> from these plants.|$|E
5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic <b>rainwater</b> dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|His wartime {{experiences}} led Fitch {{to decide}} to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, {{the head of the}} physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James <b>Rainwater</b> became his academic supervisor. <b>Rainwater</b> gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and {{there was no evidence that}} they existed, but it made a good thesis topic.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, Wu {{joined the}} Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University. She lived in {{dormitory}} there, returning to Princeton on the weekends. The {{role of the}} SAM Laboratories, headed by Harold Urey, was to support the Manhattan Project's gaseous diffusion (K-25) program for uranium enrichment. Wu worked alongside James <b>Rainwater</b> in a group led by William W. Havens, Jr., whose task was to develop radiation detector instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the construction of}} the works, trunk sewers were built to convey sewage from the city to the works. These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are also expected to handle <b>rainwater,</b> a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on <b>rainwater</b> for their {{drinking}} water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, <b>rainwater</b> generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rainwater</b> {{collapsed}} after {{a lecture}} at the Pupin Laboratories in 1985 but was revived {{by a student}} {{who knew how to}} administer CPR. In declining health, he retired and became a professor emeritus in February 1986. He died from cardiopulmonary arrest at St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers, New York on May 31, 1986. He was survived by his wife, three sons and half-brother George.|$|E
5|$|Service on {{the subway}} system is {{occasionally}} disrupted by flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. <b>Rainwater</b> can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified third rail to be shut off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 {{million gallons of water}} when it is not raining. Since 1992, $357 million has been used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.|$|E
5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow <b>rainwater</b> to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of <b>rainwater</b> to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E
5|$|Thatched or tiled roofs were {{supported}} by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof. Stone and plaster were also used for domestic architecture. Tiled eaves projecting outward were built to distance falling <b>rainwater</b> from the walls; they {{were supported}} by dougong brackets that were sometimes elaborately decorated. Molded designs usually decorated the ends of roof tiles, as seen in artistic models of buildings and in surviving tile pieces.|$|E
5|$|The Cruachan station {{temporarily}} stores {{energy at}} times of low demand, and releases it {{at times of}} high demand, when electricity prices are higher, reducing the maximum power that must be provided by power stations. It {{is also used to}} cope with sudden surges in the demand for electricity, such as at the end of television programmes. Despite the use of some <b>rainwater,</b> Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water and spinning its turbines than it generates.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{architectural}} planning authorities {{continue to}} take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling <b>rainwater,</b> green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving.|$|E
5|$|The north facade has a gabled porch bay which {{includes}} an arched doorway with a stone monogram above. On {{each side of}} the entrance bay, there are two gables, with bays where the wings are set at an angle. The north-west wing includes a chapel, with a twin-arched loggia and its own porch. The east wing was previously the service wing. The building's <b>rainwater</b> pipes are embossed with animals and flowers.|$|E
5|$|The {{windward}} {{side of the}} Kohala mountains is dissected by multiple, deeply eroded stream valleys in a southwest-northeast alignment, cutting into the flanks of the volcano. North of Kohala's summit the volcano's northwest-southeast trending rift zone separates rainfall into two streams, going southeast, into Waipio Valley, or northwest, into Honokane Nui Valley. When the volcano was still active, vertical sheets of magma, arranged in {{what is known as}} dikes, forced {{their way out of the}} magma reservoir and intruded into the rift zone, which was weakened by the collapse. As the dikes forced their way up, they formed fractures and faults parallel to the rift zone. The exertion caused by the dikes produced a series of faults along its length, forming horsts and grabens (fault blocks). Northeast of the Kohala summit, where the most rainfall occurs, the faulted structure prevents summit <b>rainwater</b> from naturally flowing northeast down the mountain slope. Instead, the <b>rainwater</b> flows down laterally and empties into the back of what have thus become the largest valleys (Waipio and Honokane Nui).|$|E
5|$|Tourist {{accommodation}} {{ranges from}} luxury lodges to apartments and villa units. The currency is the Australian dollar, {{and there are}} two banks. There are no camping facilities on the island and remote-area camping is not permitted. To protect the fragile environment of Ball's Pyramid (which carries the last remaining wild population of the endangered Howe Island stick insect), recreational climbing there is prohibited. No pets are allowed without permission from the Board. Islanders use tanked <b>rainwater,</b> supplemented by bore water for showers and washing clothes.|$|E
5|$|After {{their own}} house was {{destroyed}} in the Great Kantō earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic {{in their use of}} this new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses. The house itself had metal fenestration, tubular steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than <b>rainwater</b> downpipes. The interior too was well in advance of other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered tubular steel furniture.|$|E
5|$|Capable {{of growing}} at a {{multitude}} of angles {{on a variety of}} surfaces, Physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes from the high temperatures of desert locations to the low temperatures of the Antarctic. It grows on both dry stone and that moistened by seepage, and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater. Like many lichens that grow on rock, Physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from the substrate upon which it grows, as well as from <b>rainwater</b> and atmospheric dust. It is threatened by habitat loss through development, as well as trampling or overgrowth of its location. A number of lichenicolous species are known parasites.|$|E
5|$|Electricity in {{the island}} is {{supplied}} by a 0.326 MW diesel power plant of the Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO). However, electricity service is only available in early morning, from 4:00 to 6:00a.m. and at night, from 5:00 to 11:00p.m., due to limited fuel supplies. As for water supply, potable water for drinking and washing comes from water pumps, artesian wells, springs, and <b>rainwater</b> collection tanks in individual homes. The island has access to cellular phone and Internet service through Smart and Globe. Terrestrial and cable television service are also available.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, {{in many areas}} of the city, due in part to an {{increase}} in the amount of <b>rainwater</b> discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb <b>rainwater,</b> causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. <b>Rainwater</b> {{collected}} within the city was not enough {{to meet the needs of}} its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult by the end of the 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At the time, there were also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water supply to the capital was a priority for the military authorities in the case of a siege.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} <b>rainwater</b> tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and <b>rainwater</b> is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
