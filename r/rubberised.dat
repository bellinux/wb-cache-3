They used alternating strips of red and white silk, but the <b>rubberising</b> varnish yellowed the white silk.|$|R
50|$|In 1836, Sievier {{patented}} {{a process}} for <b>rubberising</b> fabrics and formed a ‘patent’ company (the London Caoutchouc Company - caoutchouc being the original name for India rubber). The company became large-scale manufacturers of elastic driving bands for machinery, rope for mines, waterproof cloths and garments, and waterproof canvas, as well the first rubber-insulated wire. His interests in manufacturing took over from the early 1840s onwards. Sievier's factory was situated close to his home, the Old Manor House, in Upper Holloway, at the south corner of Red Cap Lane (later Elthorne Road). Sievier also carried out experiments in electrical telegraphy there. The house was demolished in 1897.|$|R
25|$|A {{flash drive}} {{consists}} of a small printed circuit board carrying the circuit elements and a USB connector, insulated electrically and protected inside a plastic, metal, or <b>rubberised</b> case, which can be carried in a pocket or on a key chain, for example. The USB connector may be protected by a removable cap or by retracting {{into the body of}} the drive, although it {{is not likely to be}} damaged if unprotected. Most flash drives use a standard type-A USB connection allowing connection with a port on a personal computer, but drives for other interfaces also exist. USB flash drives draw power from the computer via the USB connection. Some devices combine the functionality of a portable media player with USB flash storage; they require a battery only when used to play music on the go.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 14 {{vehicles}} underwent this conversion. Like many M3 medium tanks in Australia, the Yerambas were normally fitted {{with an additional}} cast armour plate of between 38mm to 44mm thickness bolted over the transmission housing and final drives on {{the nose of the}} vehicle. All of the Yerambas produced were issued to the 22nd Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery between 1950 and 1952 and based at Puckapunyal. The regiment subsequently adopted the Royal Australian Armoured Corps black beret with the Royal Australian Artillery cap badge, and were issued with AFV crewman's <b>rubberised</b> canvas soled boots. However, it was subsequently disbanded in 1957 and the Yerambas disposed of after being declared obsolete. They were never used operationally. Despite the gruelling labour associated with maintaining them, the Yeramba was considered a very good weapon by its crews.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a three-bay biplane with a biplane elevator and central fin mounted on {{two pairs of}} converging booms in front. The chord of the outer bay of each wing was extended aft to form flexible extensions to effect lateral control: between the tips of these extensions, four balanced rudders were pivoted. The undercarriage consisted {{of a pair of}} ash skids extending forward, almost as far as the elevators. No wheels were fitted, as it was intended to use a launching rail for takeoff. Apart from the skids, the entire airframe was built of spruce, and was covered with Continental brand <b>rubberised</b> fabric. The engine, originally intended to be a version of the Wright's engine made by Bariquand et Marre, drove a pair of pusher propellers, mounted slightly above mid-gap using a chain drive. This was arranged so that both propellers revolved in the same direction, since crossing them to make them revolve in opposite directions might have infringed patents held by the Wright brothers.|$|E

40|$|As mobile {{devices and}} {{networks}} become more data-centric, text messaging requires {{an extension of}} co-presence capabilities for better interactive discussion between input/output handicapped handheld users and their free form desktop counterparts. Given some degree of co-presence (online presence and awareness) in text-based Instant Messaging, we hope to increase this co-presence on a handheld with fast-track feedback (FF) mechanisms. These are user-defined gestures, such as emoticons, and prioritised messages. We are building a system that facilitates gesture input within an interactive text-based chat over a wireless network running Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The chat bridges a robust desktop environment and {{a small number of}} handhelds. This work in progress looks into the SIP Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions as a platform to provide fast-track interactive and co-presence feedback. The aim is to <b>rubberise</b> a hitherto plastic and limited instant messaging conversation. We shall measure co-presence levels between FF and standard IM environments in and without desktop and handhelds by engaging two groups of users in chats session. We expect to demonstrate that there exists high co-presence notion in open (work by Sun Research Awarenex Group and AT&T Hubbubme in similar domain were in closed systems) FF text messaging open environment as we would like to show that this higher presence brings a much more enhanced interactive discourse. The envisaged results are intended to extrapolate to online aware co-presence in the up and coming smart phones on 3 G packet networks. Telkom, Cisco, THRI...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScText {{communication}} is often perceived as lacking some components of communication {{that are essential}} in sustaining interaction or conversation. This interaction incoherency tends to make text communication plastic. It is traditionally devoid of intonation, pitch, gesture, facial expression and visual or auditory cues. Nevertheless, Instant Messaging (IM), a form of text {{communication is}} on the upward uptake both on PCs and on mobile handhelds. There {{is a need to}} <b>rubberise</b> this plastic text messaging to improve co-presence for text communications thereby improving synchronous textual discussion, especially on handheld devices. One element of interaction is gesture, seen as a natural way of conversing. Attaining some level of interaction naturalism requires improving synchronous communication spontaneity, partly achieved by enhancing input mechanisms. To enhance input mechanisms for interactive text-based chat on mobile devices, {{there is a need to}} facilitate gesture input. Enhancement is achievable in a number of ways, such as input mechanism redesigning and input offering adaptation. This thesis explores affective gesture mode on interface redesign as an input offering adaptation. This is done without a major physical reconstruction of handheld devices. This thesis presents a text only IM system built on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE). It was developed with a novel user-defined hotkey implemented as a one-click context menu to "fast-track" text-gestures and emoticons. A hybrid quantitative and qualitative approach was taken to enable data triangulation. Results from experimental trials show that an Affective Gesture (AG) approach improved IM chat spontaneity/response. Feedback from the user trials affirms that AG hotkey improves chat responsiveness, thus enhancing chat spontaneity...|$|R
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, the {{carriers}} {{were used as}} testbeds for new aircraft and technology. Throughout late 1945, Ocean {{was used to test}} several new aircraft: the Hawker Sea Fury and de Havilland Sea Hornet piston-engine fighters during August, and the de Havilland Sea Vampire jet-propelled fighter-bomber in December. On 3 December 1945, a de Havilland Sea Vampire became the first jet aircraft to land on a carrier—two months before, Oceans flight deck saw the last landing of a Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber. The angled flight deck concept (which would later be installed on several of the Majestic-class carriers) was first trialled aboard Triumph: the straight-line deck markings were removed, and markings for an angled landing painted on. After a two-year loan to Canada, Warrior served as a testbed for <b>rubberised</b> flexible decks and skid-like landing gear during 1948 and 1949. During 1951 and 1952, Perseus was used as a trials ship for the under-development steam catapult.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the man-carrying machine known as a Rotachute, {{also known as a}} Hafner H.8, evolved from November 1940 and {{throughout}} 1941. In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of <b>rubberised</b> fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the rotor hub. Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled rolling movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was issued retrospectively to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} cope with the extreme altitudes flown at, the pilot was {{provided}} with a specially-developed two-piece suit. This suit, which was principally composed of <b>rubberised</b> fabric, was joined at the waist using a form of pipe-clip. It was provided with a helmet, which featured a large forward window to provide view. It is complete with closed-circuit breathing apparatus, the oxygen jet being delivered via a small injector for circulation purposes. Once exhaled, the gas would travel via an external tube to a canister containing carbon dioxide-absorbing chemicals to restore it to a pure oxygen state prior to being re-circulated. The 138 had an internal capacity of 82 gallons, spread across 70 gallons in the lower tank and 12 gallons in the upper tank. A specially-developed fuel, known as S.A.F.4, was used for the altitude record flight, derived from standard grade Shell Ethyl aviation gasoline. Of note, this fuel has a high anti-knock value; the high degree of supercharge involved results in the fuel mixture reaching high temperatures, which generally increases the potential for detonation, thus a high anti-knock value was viewed to be of critical importance.|$|E
40|$|Hermit crabs {{are known}} to {{participate}} in non-injurious fights over the ownership of gastropod shells. Bouts of fighting are considered successful if an exchange of shells occurs {{after a period of}} shell rapping. Shell rapping involves the attacking crab bringing its shell rapidly and repeatedly into contact with the shell of the defending crab in a series of bouts. Many studies have investigated how the repeated pattern of shell rapping may convey information about the relative resource holding potential (RHP) of the attacker to the defender and also the attacker’s motivation to win the fight. However, no studies to date have investigated whether attacking hermit crabs can assess the impacts their own shell rapping activities are having on the defending opponent. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether attacking Pagurus bernhardus hermit crabs assessed the effectiveness of shell rapping at causing the eviction of the defending crab. This was achieved by <b>rubberising</b> the surface of the defending crab’s shell so that the impacts of shell rapping were dampened. The subsequent behaviour of attacking crabs was then analysed to determine if attackers were altering their behaviour to win the contest based on the information gathered regarding how successful shell rapping was at causing the defender to give up the fight. The results {{of this study indicate that}} attackers may assess the impacts of rapping on their opponents. The results overall, however, were inconclusive as the changes in behaviour and the pattern of rapping by the attacking crab may also have occurred due to a loss in motivation or fatigue. Suggestions for further work include analysing the startle response times and lactate concentrations of the attacking crabs at various 4 intervals throughout the fight to determine if losses of motivation or fatigue are the most likely explanation as to why attackers change their behaviour.

500|$|In April 1982 Bravo November was loaded, {{along with}} three other Chinooks, aboard the {{container}} ship MV Atlantic Conveyor bound for the Falkland Islands.

Whilst en route to the Falklands the Chinooks had their rotor blades refitted by the small party of nine technicians of 18 Squadron RAF on board, the first time such a feat had been attempted at sea. On 25 May 1982 the second of two of the Chinooks had just undergone this refitting process when the Atlantic Conveyor was attacked and sunk by an Argentine Navy Dassault Super Étendard that had fired an Exocet sea-skimming missile. One of these Chinooks, Bravo November, was airborne on a task at the time, picking up freight from HMS Glasgow. It thus avoided the ship's destruction and later landed on the aircraft carrier , gaining the nickname [...] "The Survivor".
