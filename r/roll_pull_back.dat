50|$|NIOSH Mining Safety and Health Research {{recommends}} {{using the}} <b>roll,</b> <b>pull,</b> and hold method when using memory foam earplugs. The process involves the user rolling the earplug into a thin rod, <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> on the ear, {{and holding the}} earplug deep in the canal with the finger. To get a complete seal, the user must wait about 20 to 30 seconds for the earplug to expand inside the canal.|$|R
25|$|Reading {{the control}} yoke {{data from the}} FDR {{revealed}} that the pilots made a crucial error by <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> on the control yoke throughout the dive with the stick-shaker audible on the CVR from {{the onset of the}} dive. This raised the aircraft's angle of attack, removed all aileron authority, prevented recovery from the roll induced by the rudder, and caused an aerodynamic stall. Because the aircraft had entered a slip, <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> on the yoke only aggravated the bank angle further. Boeing's test pilots reenacted the fatal dive in both a simulator, as well as a test 737-300 by flying the same parameters on the accident FDR, and found that recovery from a fully deflected rudder at level flight, while at 190 knot crossover speed, was accomplished by turning the wheel to the opposite direction of the <b>roll,</b> and not <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> on the yoke to regain aileron authority. The NTSB remarked that no airline had ever trained a pilot on the proper recovery technique for the situation experienced by the pilots and that the pilots had just 10 seconds from the onset of the roll to troubleshoot before recovery of the aircraft was impossible. The FDR revealed that after the aircraft stalled, it along with the crew and passengers were subjected up to a 4g load throughout the dive until impact with the ground in an 80 degree nose-down attitude traveling at approximately 300mph under significant sideslip.|$|R

40|$|To solve {{real-world}} {{problems by}} Genetic Algorithms (GAs), GAs {{that have a}} strong searching capability are needed. In this paper, Distributed Probabilistic Model-Building Genetic Algorithm (DPMBGA) is applied to solve the problems. The DPMBGA is an extended algorithm of Probabilistic Model-Building GA (PMBGA) and {{it also has a}} strong searching capability. In realworld problems, constraints often exist. As such, mechanisms that can treat the constraints should be added to the GAs. Two mechanisms for treating constraints are the penalty method and <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method. The DPMBGA with the penalty method and <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method is applied to truss structural optimization problems. Through a simulation, the searching capability and efficiency of the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method and penalty method are discussed. From the discussion, it is concluded that the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method can derive the solutions even if the problem is difficult. Compared to the penalty method, the number of the individuals that violate the constraints is smaller in the <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> method. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{these notes}} we survey the {{tropical}} intersection theory on R^n by deriving the properties for tropical cycles from the corresponding properties in Chow cohomology. For this we review the stable intersection product introduced by Mikhalkin and the push forward of tropical cycles defined by Allermann and Rau. Furthermore we define a <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> for tropical cycles {{based on the}} <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> of Minkowski weights. This <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> commutes with the tropical intersection product and satisfies the projection formula. Our main result is to deduce the latter from the corresponding projection formula in Chow cohomology. Comment: Correction of some typo...|$|R
