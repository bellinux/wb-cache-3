40|$|Abstract. Minor {{and random}} slip between <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> and races in <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> {{bearings}} makes vibration signals have periodically time-varying ensemble statistics, {{which is known}} as cyclostationarity. Two second-order cyclostationary methods, the spectral correlation density (SCD) {{and the degree of}} cyclostationarity (DCS), are talked about in this paper based on a statistical model of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings. The SCD provides redundant information in bi-frequency plane and cyclic frequency domain embodies the majority of it, which is a series of non-zero discrete cyclic frequencies completely reflecting the fault characters of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings. The DCS has virtues of less computation and clearer representation, at the same time keeps the same characters with SCD in cyclic frequency domain. And the DCS is also proved to be resistant to the additive and multiplicative stationary noise. Simulation and experiential results from three <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing faults: outer race defect, inner race defect and <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> defect, indicate practicability of the DCS analysis in <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing condition monitoring and fault diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to carry out the {{research}} of rotation frequency influence and technical state condition of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings upon the level of vibration spectrum components which corresponds to the frequencies of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing failure exposures. The research was being carried out on the basis of experimental planning by means of experimental board enabling to assign frequency and to record vibration signal. Different types of bearings have been subjected to the experiment. Those were: regular <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings as well as <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings having artificiality created failures and the bearings with failures which have been received during long-term utilization. The results obtained show the availability of direct dependence between the level of spectrum components which corresponds to the frequencies of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing failure exposures and rotation frequency. It should be noted that the responsiveness of the given dependence is directly connected with the technical state of the <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing being investigated. These results were taken into account while comprising mathematical models of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings vibration used in automatic expert diagnostic system series...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear dynamic {{model of the}} contact forces and vibration generated in <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings due to a surface defect in a raceway. A rectangular shape defect with sharp edges is selected for modelling because previous models {{were not able to}} predict the low frequency vibration event that occurs when a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> enters the defect. Simulations are presented for two defect sizes. In the first simulation, the defect length is small such that the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> do not strike the bottom of the defect. The simulated results compare well with experimental results, and predict the low and high frequency events that occur when a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> passes through the defect observed in the experimental results. In the second simulation, the defect length is increased such that a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> strikes the bottom of the defect. This simulation demonstrates the benefits over models that do not consider the mass of the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements.</b> The benefits are illustrated by a detailed analysis of the contact forces that occur as a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> passes through the defect. The developed model can be used to simulate the vibration response of bearings with a defect in the raceway to aid in the development of new diagnostic algorithms.

40|$|The <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing is a core {{component}} of many {{systems such as}} aircraft, train, steamboat, and machine tool, and their failure can lead to reduced capability, downtime, and even catastrophic breakdowns. Due to misoperation, manufacturing deficiencies, {{or the lack of}} monitoring and maintenance, it is often found to be the most unreliable component within these systems. Therefore, effective and efficient fault diagnosis of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings has an important role in ensuring the continued safe and reliable operation of their host systems. This study presents a trace ratio criterion-based kernel discriminant analysis (TR-KDA) for fault diagnosis of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings. The binary immune genetic algorithm (BIGA) is employed to solve the trace ratio problem in TR-KDA. The numerical results obtained using extensive simulation indicate that the proposed TR-KDA using BIGA (called TR-KDA-BIGA) can effectively and efficiently classify different classes of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing data, while also providing the capability of real-time visualization that is very useful for the practitioners to monitor the health status of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings.

40|$|In slewing bearings, a {{great number}} of contact pairs are present on the contact {{surfaces}} between the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> and raceways of the bearing.

40|$|For the {{quantitative}} fault diagnosis of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings, a nonlinear vibration model for fault severity assessment of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings is established in this study. The outer race defect size parameter is {{introduced into the}} dynamic model, and vibration response signals of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings under different fault sizes are simulated. The signals are analyzed quantitatively to observe the relationship between vibration responses and fault sizes. The impact points when the ball rolls onto {{and away from the}} defect are identified from the vibration response signals. Next, the impact characteristic that reflects the fault severity in <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings is obtained from the time interval between two impact points. When the width of the bearing fault is small, the signals are presented as clear single impact. The signals gradually become double impacts with increasing size of defects. The vibration signals of a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings test rig are measured for different outer race fault sizes. The experimental results agree well with the results from simulations.

40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} {{are widely}} {{used in rotating machinery}} across various industries and their failure is a dominant factor that contributes to machinery breakdown, consequently causing significant economic losses. Numerous experimental and analytical studies have been conducted in the past to understand the vibration response of non-defective and defective <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings, which have localised, extended, and distributed defects. Previous models have focused on simulating the defect-related impulses, which are generally observed in practice in measured vibration signals, and they implement envelope analysis to predict the significant defect-related frequency components. The work presented in this thesis is focused on developing an understanding of the underlying physical mechanism by which defect-related impulses are generated in defective <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings. A novel explicit dynamics finite element (FE) model of a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing having a localised outer raceway defect, line spall, was developed and solved using a commercially available FE software package, LSDYNA. In addition to simulating the vibration response of the bearing, the dynamic contact interaction between the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> and raceways of the bearing were modelled. An in-depth investigation of the rolling element-to-raceway contact forces was undertaken and variations in the forces, as the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> traverse through the defect, were analysed. The contact force analysis has also {{led to the development of}} an understanding of the physics behind the low- and high-frequency characteristic vibration signatures generated by the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> as they enter and exit a defect. It was found that no impulse-like signals are generated during the gradual de-stressing or unloading of the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> as they enter into a defect, which explains the low-frequency characteristics of the de-stressing event. In contrast, a burst of multiple, short-duration, force impulses is generated as the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> re-stress between the raceways in the vicinity of the end of a defect, which explains the high-frequency impulsive characteristics of the re-stressing event. Based on the results of the FE analysis of the <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing, a mathematical model was developed to predict the gradual de-stressing of the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> as they enter into a raceway defect. Experimental testing on a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing, commonly used in the railway industry, and having a line spall machined on its outer raceway was undertaken. The numerically modelled vibration response obtained using the FE model of the <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing was compared with the experimentally measured data, and a favourable agreement between the modelled and measured results was achieved. Numerical rolling element-to-raceway contact forces were compared with corresponding analytical results calculated using a quasi-static load distribution analytical model presented in this thesis. A parametric study to investigate the effects of varying radial load and rotational speed on the vibration response of the bearing and rolling element-to-raceway contact forces was undertaken. It was found that the magnitude of the defect-related vibration impulses and contact forces generated during the re-stressing of the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> increases with increasing load and speed. The modelled contact forces were correlated with bearing vibration signals, and it was found that the amplitude of the contact forces and acceleration produced during the re-stressing of the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> is much greater than when the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> strike the defective surface. In other words, although a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> can impact the surface of a defect and generate a low amplitude acceleration signal, a much higher acceleration signal is generated when the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> are re-stressed between the raceways as they exit from the defect. These higher acceleration signals, generated during the re-stressing phase, are the ones that are generally observed in practice, and subsequently used for bearing diagnosis. The work presented in this thesis has provided definitive physical and quantitative explanations for the impulsive acceleration signals measured when a bearing element passes through a defect.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an elasto-dynamic {{model of a}} {{defective}} sphere bearing is presented. This two-dimensional model can simulate local faults on the bearing races and <b>rolling</b> <b>elements,</b> and {{it is based on}} the non-linear Hertzian contact deformation of the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements.</b> In the model the outer race is supposed to be fixed, and the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> are supposed to roll without slipping. These assumptions yield a total of z + 4 Degrees of Freedom (DOF), where z is the number of rolling ele-ments: three DOF come from the inner race (two displacements and one rotation), one DOF from the cage (rotation) and one DOF from each <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> (i. e., z radial displacements). Each contact between the spheres and the races is modelled by a non-linear spring (Hertz contact theory) and a damper proportional to the spring stiffness (Palmgren). The model uses a kinematic approach to calculate the trajectory of the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> when passing over the defect. This trajectory is introduced into the equations of motion for the calculation of the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> deformations; subsequently, the internal bearing forces are calculated.

40|$|Rocket engine turbopumps often employ <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> {{bearings}} for rotor support. These bearings frequently {{provide the}} primary mechanical interface between the stationary and rotating parts, and are relied upon {{to provide an}} adequate stiffness characteristic to ensure small rotor deflection due {{to a variety of}} sources of radial load. The rotordynamic design of a turbopump, however, requires a more detailed understanding of the bearing's load-deflection characteristic, to accurately predict critical speed location and response. Accordingly, engineers have developed tools to predict the load-deflection relationship for <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings.

To determine these, the methods available to date are applicable only for <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> with the profiles {{defined by a}} second degree curve (termed as Hertzian geometry). However in real engineering applications such as roller bearings, wheels of locomotives, rollers in traction drives, the profiles of the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> deviate considerably from a simple second degree curve (termed as non-Hertzian geometry). Under such circumstances the currently available methods are not adequate. ^ The present research develops Computer Aided solutions to the following two problems: (1) Longitudinal creepage. In this case, the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> having an arbitrary profile is subject to a normal force (force normal to the contact interface) and as well, a transverse force (a force {{in the direction of}} rolling). The solution {{is in the form of}} a computer program called CREEP-L (CREEPage in the Longitudinal direction). This can determine the relationships between longitudinal creepage, longitudinal force, interface tractions and interface slips (also called microslips). (2) Subsurface stresses. Here the solution for the general state of stress (viz. the six independent components of the stress tensor) in the <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> loaded by a set of arbitrary tractions (normal, longitudinal and transverse) is developed. The solution is in the form of a computer program called SUBSIG (SUBsurface SIGmas). The program also calculates an equivalent stress.
