Existing stadiums with retractable roofs are reviewed, and lessons learned {{are used to}} present theoretical structural engineering design for a roof truss and recommendations for carriers. The presented concept likely requires light-weight structural systems and closely-spaced roof trusses to minimize loads on <b>roof</b> <b>carriers.</b> Actual mechanical designs of the <b>roof</b> <b>carriers</b> are quite complex as they {{must be able to}} roll in two directions and pivot about a third. The design herein is incomplete for real-world application but can inform future designers about considerations for the presented architecture...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{projecting}} a horizontal floor diaphragm in a precast concrete structure in a reinforced concrete construction and designing {{all the elements}} wich {{are part of the}} floor pannel construction on a limit state of carrying and limit state of serviceability according to European standard Eurocode with an exception of prestressed hollow core concrete slabs. Ground plans of the structure are 36, 0 m per 15, 5 m, and the height is 9, 7 m. The staircase core is eccentrically positioned through the floor construction. Vertical carrying elements are reinforced concrete columns with dimensions 50 / 50 cm which are installed in the reinforced concrete point pocket foundation. For the roof supporting construction we have positioned reinforced concrete double-pitch <b>roof</b> <b>carriers.</b> Floor panel construction consists of two fields of prestressed hollow core slabs whose length is 7, 5 m and thickness 0, 2 m. Slabs are supported by the L circumferential beams of dimensions 65 / 45 cm and by the mid T beams of dimensions 80 / 60 cm. The building location is in Ljubljana, with projecting ground acceleration 0, 25 g. The ground category is B with carrying capacity of 250 kN/m 2. Wind zone in the area is 1, for projecting wind speed we have taken 25 m/s, and the ground category is 3. Useful load is 3, 0 kN/m 2 and is the same for all the surfaces.

40|$|This thesis has {{resulted}} in a concept- and prototype development of a new car <b>roof</b> mounted bike <b>carrier.</b> The design problem was assigned by Thule Group and was intended be performed alongside the company’s own project of updating their different <b>roof</b> mounted <b>carriers.</b> What Thule wanted to gain from this project was to obtain concepts produced with a different approach than their usual course of action. This could lead to concepts consisting of solutions not before thought of. The solution should answer to three major problems: 1. How the bike could be attached to the carrier. 2. How the mechanism could tighten. 3. How the user could be given feedback when enough force had been applied. This report explains the approach to the problem and how the used design process has been implemented. The solution to the problem are presented successively of how the front holder of a bike carrier is developed, from idea into prototype. The applied design process “Produktutveckling - Effektiva metoder för konstruktion och design” have an iterative structure. An iterative process does not occur in a straight line, but rather in a spiral that repeat its steps over and over again to achieve better results. The different phases and methods of the design process are explained to clarify the approach of the implementation. These methods includes Benchmarking, User study, Quality function deployment, 6 - 3 - 5 Brain writing method, PUGH and Validity and Reliability. To give this thesis a theoretical foundation, theories about the design process, semantics and intuition been applied. The generated ideas resulted in two concepts that were further developed and presented. One of the concepts was decided by Thule to undergo a patent research, which was not completed before this thesis was finished. This concept has therefore not been explained in detail. The other concept has been presented in its complete state, explaining its solutions to the design problem. The report explains all features the prototype of the product resulted in. The design process is presented in a chronological way and contribute with an easy traceability throughout this report...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Salmonella in four layer farms in eastern Japan was investigated between 2004 and 2006 {{to determine the}} role of roof rats (Rattus rattus) in the epizootology of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis). Persistent S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis {{contamination of the environment}} and pooled egg samples were detected in three out of four layer farms. A total of 113 (13 · 3 %) and 158 (18 · 6 %) out of 851 rats examined were positive for S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis, respectively. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, only one indistinguishable pulsed-field pattern was yielded by S. Enteritidis strains from rats, eggs and environmental samples from each of the two contaminated layer farms. Although, a variety of pulsed-field patterns were generated by S. Enteritidis isolates from rats, eggs, and the environment of the other contaminated farms, there are, however, some S. Enteritidis strains that are closely related clones. These results suggest that <b>roof</b> rats are <b>carriers</b> of S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis and that persistent S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis infections in a rat population may {{play an important role in}} the spread and maintenance of these pathogens inside the layer premises...|$|R

40|$|The residance {{is rather}} than a space that meets the {{physical}} needs of human being, but also an envoirement which consistsabstract meanings of social, cultural and emotional needs have been met. In the history of thousand of years human beings, {{one of the most}} important objectives of is constructing the naturalhabitation based on their needs. Just like all the living things in nature, mankind also effort a lot to protect themselves from thenatural envoirement conditions. In the history of residence which originated with the humanitarian history, starting from thedwellings carved into the rocks, the residence culture brought from Central Asia survived at the residence of Ottoman era and thevery best samples of Turkish Residence Architecture builted during this age. Residental Architecture in late period of OttamanEmpire has gained a new dimension with the foreign decoration style. The traditional identity shaped by the cultural values brought from Central Asia that are melted togetwer with the severalcultures in Anatolia as well as the the influence of Islam. The urban architecture and ornamentation effected by the provincialcapital style has never been studied so far. The folk architecture has survived as a matter of distictive subject. Our study of OldTurkish Houses covers Ilvat and neighborhood villages also consist of the village houses in Buyuk Ilvat, Belen Ilvat, Bucak Ilvatand Sarihacilar. The regional houses,feature more traditional characteristic, are explored and evaluated for the first time with this studyemerged as the best samples of folk architectured displayed. The houses in our study evaluated by taking into considerataion the material, construction technique, project and ornamentstyles. The main raw material in the construction of these regional housed are stone and timber. Metals as raw metarial is notcommon. Metals can be seen on window fences, door knobs, lock and hinges. Brick almost never used at any houses explored. The top cover of the houses are Turkish Style roof tiles. The plaster used in coating the oven and the fixture of illuminant. The soil only used in grout which is no longer available. The building structures constructed by the matarials widely available in theregion. While all the walls in the house builted with the groutless dry wall technique that is wooden beams mounted between therubble stones and compressed peşdunavs, in the resort part of the houses wooden curtain walls can be seen. The upper cover ofthe house is pitched roof and coated with Turkish Style <b>roof</b> tiles. <b>Carriers</b> such as console units, hands in hips and wooden pillarsused in the ascent, eaves, restrooms and summerhouses. Soil and Stone furnishings can be seen in the courtyard and ground floorof the house whereas the upper floors completely made of timber. Almost all the doors of the houses in the region made ofwooden. The courtyard and main entences doors are double-winged, room doors are single and multilayer. The sighseeingwindows of the regional houses are latticed inside and shuttered outside. The room Windows ar evice versa (latticed outside andshuttered inside). The connection between the floors done by the wooden stairways. The houses in Akseki Ilvat and Sarihacilar village can be classified into three groups according to project types. As well as the climate and natural conditions the influential folk architecture has a great effect on formation of the projecttypes. The basic spaces form the project are hall and the rooms. The first type houses are the most comman ones with outer hall. Those houses are also divided into 2 groups as ouetr hall with eyvan and outer hall without eyvan. Ouetr hall with eyvan projecttype houses are generally constructed by highly welfared individuals and regulated for crowded families. Compared to the otherhouses the number of rooms and the ornamentary increased. Second type houses are the ones with iner halls. Third types are theones with middle hall. The last two types are not comman in practice in the region. The execution of those two project types areseen only in one sample. Generally the basic element forms the front-line in the region is the overhangs. These overhangs areembodied according the direction of the halls. Can be grouped as overhangs on the right, overhangs on the left and overhangs inthe middle acording to the location of the averhangs based on the enterence door. The overhangs are carried by wooden pillarsand hand in hips. The cover of the overhangs are laid with tiles regardless of the roof. The windows of the overhangs aregenerally latticed with outer shutter. The windows of the overhangs decareted with lattices are distinguished with different typesof lattices. Some lattices divided into four trays and an observation window is built. Some lattices are built complete and there areskylight windows above. Room windows are rectangular lattice form and shuttered inside. The double-wing and multilayerenterence door of the houses placed under the overhangs. Eaves of the houses is made of timber and the outside ornaments areplain. One of the important element in the front-line is the chimneys. The chimneys are squared stone masonry and conical hat. The summerhouses is another element that activates the front-line. The summerhouses are open air places that are carried bywooden pillars. In the explored houses the interior decoration has wider application area, the outside ornament is more modest. The outerornament is concentrated on overhangs and windows, the interior ornament can be seen on pavilion, room doors, ceilings,cupboards and wardrobes as an accurate samples. Almost every room of the regional houses has a cupboard closet. Generally the top of the cupboard and closets are divided bytimber trays and the inside of the trays left blank. The bigger houses constructed by higher income individuals the timber trays ofcupborad and closet are filled with herbal charesteristic decorative motives. In interior decoration specifically the room doors has accurate ornament features. These single-wing doors are divided bytimber trays on top. The insdie of the timber trays are decorated by geometric and herbal forms ornament motives. Just like in the cupboards there is timber tray ornament in the open cabinets in the top of the rooms. The inside of the traysare sometimes kept blank and sometimes decorated with rose motifs and four leaf clover. One of the most important areas in theornament of the room is ceilings. The room ceilings in the regional houses are generally flat timber with lower hammerset. A hubin the shape of eight or rarely six armed star form placed in the middle of the ceiling which is perpendicularly divided to squaresby timber laths. In the middle of the hub there are motives of eight armed star narrowing throught the center, branch and rarelystylized tulip. In the center heaven fruit pomegranate, the symbol of abundance and blessing, appliquied as embossed. It can beseen ellips and round ceilings in some houses, howevere the comman ones are the flat ceilings hubbed with eight armed star. Round ceilings generally filled with timber strips in a shape of sun disc motive. When compared to plain and sloppy constructed urban houses, the regional houses built highly ornate and elaborate. Althought the regional houses are a product of folk architecture, refletcs the capital fashion in project type, front line allignment,glamorious and ornaments. The main reason is because of the finacial power and the status of the owners. The local craftsmen,lived in the region and experinced the capital fashion, had a great role in evolving this synthesis architecture. Houses mostlyconstructed in early 20. Centuryare being restored along with the Akseki-Ibradi Disctrict Development Plan. The restored housedare really in good conditions. Only the repairs done by the owners do not resulted succesfully. Those repiars cause the loss oforiginality. Nowadays, those houses, especially the non resident ones, which have great importance in Traditional ResidentArchitecture are abandoned to the wild circumtances of nature...|$|R
