5|$|An {{additional}} {{solution was}} to fit twin balanced <b>rudders</b> behind each inner shaft, {{in contrast to the}} single central rudder used on earlier ships. This greatly increased the effectiveness of the rudder and substantially decreased the turning circle of the Invincibles in comparison to earlier ships of their size.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1966, XB-70A No. 2 was {{in close}} {{formation}} {{with four other}} aircraft (an F-4 Phantom, an F-5, a T-38 Talon, and an F-104 Starfighter) for a photoshoot {{at the behest of}} General Electric, manufacturer of the engines of all five aircraft. After the completion of the photoshoot, the F-104 drifted into contact with the XB-70's right wing, flipped over and rolled inverted {{over the top of the}} Valkyrie, striking the vertical stabilizers and left wing of the bomber. The F-104 exploded, destroying the Valkyrie's <b>rudders</b> and damaging its left wing. With the loss of both <b>rudders</b> and damage to the wings, the Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow, California. NASA Chief Test Pilot Joe Walker (F-104 pilot) and Carl Cross (XB-70 co-pilot) were killed. Al White (XB-70 pilot) ejected, sustaining serious injuries, including one arm crushed by the closing clamshell-like escape crew capsule moments prior to ejection.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} ships {{equipped}} a shilling <b>rudder</b> has increased recently. It is easy comparatively to estimate {{a performance of}} a <b>rudder</b> that has a section as a normal wing section. But {{it is not easy}} to estimate a performance of a shilling <b>rudder,</b> theoretically with conventional methods, had inverse-wedge-shape. Therefore we have started from checking a situation of a surrounding flow of a <b>rudder.</b> And models of shilling <b>rudder</b> and of normal <b>rudder</b> with rectangle were made. Experiments were carried out in the circulating water tank of Kagoshima University. Experiment on visualization of 2 -dimensional flow fields in mid-span section of each <b>rudder</b> was done by depth tuft method. Furthermore the lift and the drag acting on the <b>rudder</b> and moment of the <b>rudder</b> shaft were measured. The influences that the <b>rudder</b> tail wedge angle of the shilling <b>rudder</b> effected these forces and moment were examined. As a result the following understood. When a <b>rudder</b> angle is 0, especially one of a shilling <b>rudder,</b> a flow of behind <b>rudder</b> was unstable in a flow immediately, after trailing edge. To calculate the forces acting on a shilling <b>rudder</b> theoretically, especially a situation of a flow around the tail part of a <b>rudder</b> needs to be grasped. We knew to be necessary to make visibility of the position where parted more from a relation. It is able to say that a shilling <b>rudder</b> is excellent in turning even from a normal <b>rudder</b> obviously. A value of drag of a shilling <b>rudder</b> is always larger than a normal redder. Wedge angle of the shilling <b>rudder</b> tail might make a turning performance conversely worse when the angle is greater than 20 °. As one of methods to calculate numerically the performance of a shilling <b>rudder,</b> we conceive that to add an influence of wedge angle α to one after determining the performance of a shilling <b>rudder</b> of wedge angle α= 0, first. ...|$|R
50|$|Bellcranks {{are often}} used in {{aircraft}} control systems to connect the pilot's controls to the control surfaces. For example: on light aircraft, the <b>rudder</b> often has a bellcrank whose pivot point is the <b>rudder</b> hinge. A cable connects the pilot's <b>rudder</b> pedal {{to one side of}} the bellcrank. When the pilot pushes on the <b>rudder</b> pedal, the <b>rudder</b> rotates on its hinge. The opposite <b>rudder</b> pedal is connected to the other end of the bellcrank to rotate the <b>rudder</b> in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rudder</b> is {{typically}} {{mounted on the}} trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer, part of the empennage. When the pilot pushes the left pedal, the <b>rudder</b> deflects left. Pushing the right pedal causes the <b>rudder</b> to deflect right. Deflecting the <b>rudder</b> right pushes the tail left and causes the nose to yaw to the right. Centering the <b>rudder</b> pedals returns the <b>rudder</b> to neutral and stops the yaw.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with three <b>rudders,</b> and the armored {{pilothouse}} was mounted {{on top of}} the gun turret. The officers' staterooms were built on deck out of light pine, and a hurricane deck was positioned between the turret and the deckhouse, between the two funnels. The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal watertight bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ship}} arrived in Invergordon, Baden was {{carefully}} examined by Royal Navy technicians. Naval engineers inspected the hull, including the screws, bilge keels, and <b>rudders,</b> {{to determine the}} water resistance of the hull form. The ship {{was found to have}} been approximately as efficient as the British s. The ship's armor system was extensively investigated; the British team concluded that the ship had not been modified to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May– 1 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|Bayern and Baden were {{regarded}} as exceptional sea boats by the German navy. Bayern and her sisters were stable and very maneuverable. The ships suffered slight speed loss in heavy seas; with the <b>rudders</b> hard over, the ships lost up to 62% speed and heeled over 7degrees. With a metacentric height of , larger than that of their British equivalents, the vessels were stable gun platforms for the confined waters of the North Sea.|$|E

The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, <b>rudders</b> on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the <b>rudders</b> but only the screws, Bismarck was almost impossible to steer.|$|E
5|$|Moveable sails: By {{the time}} of the Zhou Dynasty ship {{technologies}} such as stern mounted <b>rudders</b> were developed, and by the Han Dynasty, a well kept naval fleet {{was an integral part of}} the military. The Chinese used the complex moving technology behind the kite allowed then to develop the worlds first moving sails (in comparison with the mounted sails used in the West) around 200 AD. These moving sails allowed ships to sail into the wind for the first time in human history. Civilizations around the world soon emulated the Chinese technology and eventually moving sails became the standard on ships.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese of the Song dynasty were adept sailors who {{traveled}} to {{ports of call}} {{as far away as}} Fatimid Egypt. They were well equipped for their journeys abroad, in large seagoing vessels steered by stern-post <b>rudders</b> and guided by the directional compass. Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner's magnetic needle compass, the earlier military treatise of the Wujing Zongyao in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence compass. This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, and placed in a bowl of water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 V1, {{powered by}} a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V12 {{cylinder}} liquid-cooled engine, and with a twin tail, crashed on 24 January 1936 at Kleutsch near Dresden, killing Junkers' chief test pilot, Willy Neuenhofen, and his engineer, Heinrich Kreft. The square twin fins and <b>rudders</b> proved too weak; they collapsed and the aircraft crashed after it entered an inverted spin during the testing of the terminal dynamic pressure in a dive. The crash prompted a change to a single vertical stabiliser tail design. To withstand strong forces during a dive, heavy plating was fitted, along with brackets riveted to the frame and longeron, to the fuselage. Other early additions included the installation of hydraulic dive brakes that were fitted under the leading edge and could rotate 90°.|$|E
5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap shrouds, elevators, <b>rudders</b> and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB {{ruled that}} the {{probable}} cause was a [...] "fatigue fracture of the lower <b>rudder</b> power control module manifold, {{which resulted in a}} lower <b>rudder</b> hardover."

5000|$|In cases, when a pure servo {{pendulum}} self-steering gear is not usable (Hydraulic <b>rudder</b> gear, {{very big}} force needed {{to turn the}} <b>rudder),</b> auxiliary <b>rudder</b> systems are used.

The software uses the fundamental physical processes which control <b>rudder</b> and propeller interaction coupled with a large set of wind tunnel test data to produce accurate and workable results for design. Rather than curve fitting, the correction algorithm applies a change to the force on the <b>rudder</b> to the nearest known set of data. This ensures that the software experimental database is utilised fully.

5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the <b>rudders,</b> elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.|$|E
5|$|Following Rösselsprung, the Germans moved Tirpitz to Bogenfjord near Narvik. By this time, {{the ship}} needed a major overhaul. Hitler had {{forbidden}} {{the ship to}} make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to Fættenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were erected around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, such that Tirpitz would remain partially operational {{for the majority of}} the overhaul. A caisson was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's <b>rudders.</b> During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two Chariot human torpedoes, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused the human torpedoes to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them. By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and Tirpitz began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4 January 1943 in Trondheim Fjord. On 21 February, Topp was promoted to Rear Admiral and was replaced by Captain Hans Meyer; five days later the battleship Scharnhorst was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral Oskar Kummetz was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.|$|E
5|$|The dromons that Procopius {{describes}} were single-banked {{ships of}} probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger (parexeiresia), these extended {{directly from the}} hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter <b>rudders</b> at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around {{the sides of the}} ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their <b>rudders</b> are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

After conducting patrols off China and in the East China Sea during World War I, Hiei was placed in reserve in 1920. After undergoing minor reconstructions in 1924 and 1927, Hiei was demilitarized in 1929 to avoid being scrapped {{under the terms of}} the Washington Treaty; she was converted to a training ship in Kure from 1929 to 1932. All of her armour and most of her armament were removed under the restrictions of the treaty and carefully preserved. In 1933, she was refitted as an Imperial Service Ship andfollowing further reconstruction in 1934became the Emperor's ship in late 1935. In 1937, following Japan's withdrawal from the London Treaty, Hiei underwent a massive reconstruction along lines similar to those of her sister ships. When the reconstruction was completed on 31 January 1940, Hiei was reclassified as a battleship. Hiei sailed in November 1941 as an escort of Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's carrier force which attacked Pearl Harbor. Hiei provided escort cover during carrier raids on Darwin in February 1942, before a joint engagement with Kirishima that sank an American destroyer in March. She participated in carrier actions against Ceylon and Midway Island, and was subsequently drydocked in July. Following carrier escort duty during the Battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa-Cruz, Hiei departed as the flagship of Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe's Combat Division 11 to bombard Henderson Field on the night of 1213 November 1942. When the fleet encountered Rear Admiral Daniel Callaghan's Task Group in Ironbottom Sound, the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal ensued. In an extremely confusing melee, Hiei disabled two American heavy cruiserskilling two rear admirals in the processbut was hit by about 85 shells from the guns of cruisers and destroyers, rendering her virtually unmaneuverable. Abe transferred his flag to Kirishima, and the battleship was taken under tow by the same ship, but one of her <b>rudders</b> froze in the full starboard position. Over the next day, Hiei was attacked by American aircraft many different times. While trying to evade an attack at 14:00, Hiei lost her emergency rudder and began to show a list to stern and starboard. Hiei was scuttled northwest of Savo Island on the evening of 13 November by Japanese destroyers.|$|E
