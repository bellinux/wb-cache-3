Yield levels on the Saïs Plateau between Meknès and Fez in the semi-arid zone, however, remain low possibly because of sub-optimum water use due to inefficient tillage systems. A study was carried out to investigate the effect of soil tillage operations on water infiltration. Two systems of seedbed preparation on a silty clay soil were compared: traditional disc harrow (‘cover crop’) versus reduced tillage using a <b>spring</b> <b>tined</b> cultivator (‘vibrocultor’). Infiltration processes were studied using a rainfall simulator applying rainfall typical for aggressive events in the region. The effect of tillage and rainfall on the structure of the soil was assessed by both quantitative and descriptive methods.

40|$|Within organic farming, {{chemical}} {{weed control}} is prohibited and is generally being replaced by different tillage practices. At {{the same time the}} supply of sufficient amounts of nitrogen is often a problem within organic fanning. In cereal crops, harrowing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important mechanical weeding techniques. The loosening and aerating of the soil produced by harrowing should potentially enhance nitrogen mineralization. Furthermore, harrowing could enhance the soil structure and water content, since tillage is generally known to positively affect these soil factors through mechanisms such as crust breaking and enhanced tillering in cereals. This study investigated the effects of mechanical weed control in the spring on weeds, nitrogen mineralization and yield of winter wheat. Weed control was carried out when the crop had 2 - 3 leaves. Three different implements were tested on two soils differing in clay content for three consecutive years: A Väderstad Crosskill roller, an s-tine harrow and a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow, and compared with untreated controls. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers and total nitrogen content of the crop were determined on several occasions for calculations of net nitrogen mineralization in the soi 1. The numbers and weight of weeds were recorded one month after harrowing and at the time of harvesting. Grain yield was measured at harvest. The amount of dicotyledonous weeds was reduced by harrowing. On the soils with the lower clay content, weed numbers were reduced to between 50 and 82 % of those in the control, while on the soil with the higher clay content they were reduced to between 42 and 82 % of those in the control. On average, the best effect on the lighter clay soils was achieved by use of the s-tine harrow, while on the heavier clay soils the Väderstad Crosskill roller and the spring-tine harrow had the best weed control effect. In the harrowed treatments, the average mineral N content in the 0 - 30 cm layer was enhanced by only 0. 4 kg ha⁻¹. At the same time the N uptake in the crop was reduced by approximately the same amount due to the crop suffering mechanical damage, and calculations of net nitrogen mineralization showed no increase in N mineralization after harrowing. Despite annual variations, harrowing in general had a positive effect on grain yield. Comparing the different implements, the best yields on the lighter clay soil were achieved by use of the <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow, which increased the yield compared with the control by an average of 5 % in two years out of three (2002 - 2005). The best results on the heavier clay soils were achieved by use of Väderstad Crosskill roller, which gave a 5 % yield increase compared with the control, while the use of <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow and s-tine harrow caused a yield reduction of about the same magnitude. On both soil types, the use of an s-tine harrow had a negative effect on wheat yield, probably due to a high degree of mechanical damage to the crop...|$|R

Effects of three different tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage on penetration resistance, emergence time, shooting degree and yield were investigated. Conventional tillage used a moldboard plough for primary tilling and a combined <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator-spike tooth harrow for consecutive secondary tilling. Reduced tillage included only a cultivator-tooth harrow combination. No-tillage was accomplished by a direct (stubble) drill.

40|$|Tillage {{practices}} influence physical, chemical, {{and biological}} soil properties, which also affect soil quality and consequently plant growth. In this study, the main {{objective was to}} evaluate the effect of different tillage systems on soil physical properties by using geophysical methods, namely, ground-penetrating radar (far-field and near-field GPR), capacitance probes (ThetaProbe and 5 TE), electromagnetic induction (EMI) (Profiler and EM 38), soil sampling, and by soil penetrometer. Since 2005, three contrasting tillage systems were applied on different plots of an agricultural field: i) conventional tillage (CT) with mouldboard ploughing to 27 cm depth, ii) deep loosening tillage (DL) with a heavy tine cultivator to 30 cm depth, and iii) reduced tillage (RT) with a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator to 10 cm depth. The geophysical and soil strength measurements were performed in April 2010. We observed that tillage influences the soil resistance (deeper tillage decreases soil resistance), which could be partly seen in the radar data. Soil water content reference measurements (capacitance probes and soil sampling) were in a relatively good agreement with the water content estimates from far-field GPR. We also observed that the tillage influences surface water content. Mean surface water content was significantly lower for CT than for DL and RT, which was partly explained by lower macropore connectivity between the topsoil and the deeper layers after conventional tillage. This study confirms the potential of GPR and EMI sensors for soil physical properties determination at the field scale and for the characterization of agricultural management practices...|$|R

Firstly, the strategy of physical weed control of carrot in the Fucino Valley was defined and included the realization of the false seed-bed technique, a flame treatment before crop emergence and one or more mechanical (precision hoeing) and manual interventions in post-emergence. False seed-bed technique was performed by means of a specific <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrow two meters wide, while flaming was performed by means of an operative machine equipped with four “open flame” rod burners 50 cm wide. A specific precision hoe with eleven units (inter-row of about 18 cm) was built, tested, improved and set up to perform weed control both between (by means of a rigid tine supporting a 9 cm wide horizontal blade) and in rows (by means of vibrating teeth or torsion weeder). During the testing period the evolution of weed flora (both presence and biomass) was monitored and carrot root yield was recorded. Moreover work chains characteristics, manpower use and physical weed control cost were determined. The results were quite good and put in evidence that physical weed control in organic carrot cultivated in the Fucino Valley can be performed, obtaining relevant and high quality yields, without the need of too many hours of manual labour and with fully acceptable costs, taking also into account that in Italy the market price of “biological” carrot is quite high...|$|R
40|$|Controlling weeds {{in spring}} cereals grown under organic {{conditions}} is mostly done by post emergence weed harrowing, where <b>spring</b> <b>tines</b> of the weed harrow control weeds by uprooting and/or covering small weeds plants with soil. In situations with relatively large weed plants and relatively small crop plants, there are increased risks for crop damages by soil coverage or other mechanical damages {{of the crop}} leaves. These damages are increasing with increasing weed control intensity, and are resulting in reduced crop growth immediately after weed harrowing. There are risks that the reduced growth reduces final crop yield too. However, {{there is some evidence}} that there are varietal differences in the tolerance to weed harrowing. The aim of this study was to estimate the damages by weed harrowing in four pure genotypes and three two- or one three-component mixtures of spring barley, and to analyze if there were differences in tolerance to weed harrowing between the genotypes and mixtures. Results from a two-year field study showed that there were varietal differences in the tolerance to mechanical weed control in the immediate effect as well as the short term effect, however there were marked differences in the immediate and short term effect between the two years. Regarding the long term effect of weed harrowing on yield, there were no significant differences in 2003 but in 2004, Brazil and the three component mixture suffered significantly from weed harrowing while Modena, Otira and Modena+Orthega mixture, seems to benefit from weed harrowing. The reason for these differences is probably due to differences in growth habit at the time for weed harrowing. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} use (8 years) {{of two different}} tillage systems were assessed on a Luvisol, under temperate climate (Belgium). The tillage treatments were (i) conventional tillage (CT) with moldboard ploughing to 27 cm depth and (ii) reduced tillage (RT) with a <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> cultivator to 10 cm depth. The measurements included bulk density (BD) and precompression stress (Pc) chosen as indicators of mechanical strength, and the pore size distribution (PSD) measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The tillage systems, the depth and their interaction {{had a significant effect}} on BD, Pc and PSD. In CT, in the topsoil, the soil strength was low and the total porosity n was about 50 %. In the subsoil, n decreased to 43 %. The PSD of CT was uni-modal in topsoil and subsoil in the MIP measurement range. The mean value of the mode rmax diminished from the topsoil toward the subsoil (from 2. 5 microns to 1. 9 microns). In RT, in the topsoil, the soil strength was higher than CT. BD did not vary much according to the depth. The total porosity n of RT was comprised between 40 - 45 % in the soil profile. The PSD was uni-modal and rmax increased from topsoil (around 2 microns) to subsoil (> 3 microns). This suggested the agglomeration of fine particles under the long-term action of mechanical loads, climatic agents, biological organisms or clay minerals acting as cementing agents. These phenomena could be at the origin of the increase of Pc with the depth without significant modification of BD. Such high values of Pc could be responsible of negative effects on root-growth leading to a more superficial root lateral development...|$|R

40|$|A web-based {{digital image}} {{analysis}} tool (IMAGING Crop Response Analyser) has been developed, tested and made public (www. imaging-crops. dk). This new technology makes possible objective estimations of crop-soil cover (i. e. how much crop is buried with soil) associated with post-emergence weed control with <b>spring</b> <b>tine</b> harrows, rotary hoes and other weeders. Objective estimation of crop-soil cover offers new possibilities to improve decision support of physical weed control practises with low selectivity because trade-offs between weed control and resulting injury to the associated crop now may be quantified, communicated and incorporated into models. The objective of this resentation is to suggest key parameters and research priorities for future research and to suggest standards for estimation and statistical test of the analytical parameters. The overall aim is to help researchers deliver reliable parameter estimates that may help to predict the optimal intensity and timing of physical weed control with low selectivity and, thereby, contribute to the theoretical and methodological framework of physical weed control. Selectivity and crop recovery are suggested as key parameters because they are crucial in predictive models and are less influenced by site-specific soil conditions and implement settings than other parameters. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} ratio between weed control and crop-soil cover and crop recovery is defined as the ability of the crop to recover from soil coverage. Both parameters depend on the intensity of tillage. To facilitate comparisons between different studies, it is suggested that the crop soil cover associated with 80 % weed control and the relative crop yield loss associated with 25 % crop-soil cover are calculated with 95 %-confidence intervals. Experimental protocols needed to make such calculations are outlined and factors that influence - or may influence - selectivity and recovery are listed and research priorities are given. Crop tolerance has previously been used to express the susceptibility of the crop to physical weed control, but crop recovery is shown to be more useful in decision support models than crop tolerance. Recent studies using the new {{digital image analysis}} tool and the above suggested parameter estimation procedure show that timing of weed harrowing is of lesser importance if the intensity of tillage is correctly adjusted to the growth stage compared with prediction of the optimal intensity in sitespecific conditions. This latter issue remains the major challenge for future development...|$|R

40|$|Many weeds {{occur in}} patches but farmers {{frequently}} spray whole fields {{to control the}} weeds in these patches. Given a geo-referenced weed map, technology exists to confine spraying to these patches. Adoption of patch spraying by arable farmers has, however, been negligible {{partly due to the}} difficulty of constructing weed maps. Building on previous DEFRA and HGCA projects, this proposal aims to develop and evaluate a machine vision system to automate the weed mapping process. The project thereby addresses the principal technical stumbling block to widespread adoption of site specific weed management (SSWM). The accuracy of weed identification by machine vision based on a single field survey may be inadequate to create herbicide application maps. We therefore propose to test the hypothesis that sufficiently accurate weed maps can be constructed by integrating information from geo-referenced images captured automatically at different times of the year during normal field activities. Accuracy of identification will also be increased by utilising a priori knowledge of weeds present in fields. To prove this concept, images will be captured from arable fields on two farms and processed offline to identify and map the weeds, focussing especially on black-grass, wild oats, barren brome, couch grass and cleavers. As advocated by Lutman et al. (2002), the approach uncouples the weed mapping and treatment processes and builds on the observation that patches of these weeds are quite stable in arable fields. There are three main aspects to the project. 1) Machine vision hardware. Hardware component parts of the system are one or more cameras connected to a single board computer (Concurrent Solutions LLC) and interfaced with an accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) supplied by Patchwork Technology. The camera(s) will take separate measurements {{for each of the three}} primary colours of visible light (red, green and blue) in each pixel. The basic proof of concept can be achieved in principle using a single camera system, but in practice systems with more than one camera may need to be installed so that larger fractions of each field can be photographed. Hardware will be reviewed regularly during the project in response to feedback from other work packages and updated as required. 2) Image capture and weed identification software. The machine vision system will be attached to toolbars of farm machinery so that images can be collected during different field operations. Images will be captured at different ground speeds, in different directions and at different crop growth stages as well as in different crop backgrounds. Having captured geo-referenced images in the field, image analysis software will be developed to identify weed species by Murray State and Reading Universities with advice from The Arable Group. A wide range of pattern recognition and in particular Bayesian Networks will be used to advance the state of the art in machine vision-based weed identification and mapping. Weed identification algorithms used by others are inadequate for this project as we intend to collect and correlate images collected at different growth stages. Plants grown for this purpose by Herbiseed will be used in the first instance. In addition, our image capture and analysis system will include plant characteristics such as leaf shape, size, vein structure, colour and textural pattern, some of which are not detectable by other machine vision systems or are omitted by their algorithms. Using such a list of features observable using our machine vision system, we will determine those that can be used to distinguish weed species of interest. 3) Weed mapping. Geo-referenced maps of weeds in arable fields (Reading University and Syngenta) will be produced with advice from The Arable Group and Patchwork Technology. Natural infestations will be mapped in the fields but we will also introduce specimen plants in pots to facilitate more rigorous system evaluation and testing. Manual weed maps of the same fields will be generated by Reading University, Syngenta and Peter Lutman so that the accuracy of automated mapping can be assessed. The principal hypothesis and concept to be tested is that by combining maps from several surveys, a weed map with acceptable accuracy for endusers can be produced. If the concept is proved and can be commercialised, systems could be retrofitted at low cost onto existing farm machinery. The outputs of the weed mapping software would then link with the precision farming options already built into many commercial sprayers, allowing their use for targeted, site-specific herbicide applications. Immediate economic benefits would, therefore, arise directly from reducing herbicide costs. SSWM will also reduce the overall pesticide load on the crop and so may reduce pesticide residues in food and drinking water, and reduce adverse impacts of pesticides on non-target species and beneficials. Farmers may even choose to leave unsprayed some non-injurious, environmentally-beneficial, low density weed infestations. These benefits fit very well with the anticipated legislation emerging in the new EU Thematic Strategy for Pesticides which will encourage more targeted use of pesticides and greater uptake of Integrated Crop (Pest) Management approaches, and also with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive to reduce levels of pesticides in water bodies. The greater precision of weed management offered by SSWM is therefore a key element in preparing arable farming systems for the future, where policy makers and consumers want to minimise pesticide use and the carbon footprint of farming while maintaining food production and security. The mapping technology could also be used on organic farms to identify areas of fields needing mechanical weed control thereby reducing both carbon footprints and also damage to crops by, for example, <b>spring</b> <b>tines.</b> Objective i. To develop a prototype machine vision system for automated image capture during agricultural field operations; ii.
