5|$|The update <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration. This condition is obviously implied by {{the assumption that the}} update <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> a bijection. In the other direction, the Garden of Eden theorem for cellular automata implies that every injective update <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> bijective.|$|E

5|$|George Mackey {{had asked}} whether Born's <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> a {{necessary}} {{consequence of a}} particular set of axioms for quantum mechanics, and more specifically whether every measure on the lattice of projections of a Hilbert space can be defined by a positive operator with unit trace. Though Richard Kadison proved this was false for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, Gleason's theorem (published 1957) shows it to be true for higher dimensions.|$|E
5|$|If the {{designated}} hitter (DH) <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> in effect, each {{team has a}} tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH {{takes the place of}} another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.|$|E
5|$|Symbols {{are written}} in upright (Roman) type (m for metres, s for seconds), so as to {{differentiate}} from the italic type used for quantities (m for mass, s for displacement). By consensus of international standards bodies, this <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> applied independent of the font used for surrounding text.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} well-behaved {{inference}} <b>rules</b> <b>is</b> developed in first-order polynomial based theorem proving.

50|$|In rules-based SDC, a rigid set of <b>rules</b> <b>is</b> used to {{determine}} whether or not the results of data analysis can <b>be</b> released. The <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> applied consistently, which makes it obvious what kinds of output are acceptable. However, because the <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> inflexible, either disclosive information may still slip through, or the <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> overrestrictive and may only allow for results that are too broad for useful analysis to be published.|$|R
50|$|In Indian Railways {{operating}} <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> called 'The General Rules'. The General <b>Rules</b> <b>are</b> {{common for}} all zonal railways of Indian Railway {{and can be}} amended only by the Railway Board. Subsidiary <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> added to the General Rules by zonal railways, which does not infringe the general <b>rule.</b> Corrections <b>are</b> brought about {{from time to time}} through correction slips.|$|R
5|$|The Critters <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> a block {{cellular}} automaton in which, at each step, {{the cells of}} the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks. Its transition function flips the state of every cell in a block that does not have exactly two live cells, and in addition rotates by 180° blocks with exactly three live cells. Because this function is invertible, the automaton defined by these rules is a reversible {{cellular automaton}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the Libellus (notwithstanding Boniface's suspicions, on which see below) was not called into serious question until the mid-twentieth century, when several historians forwarded {{the hypothesis that the}} document had been concocted in England in the early eighth century. It has since been shown, however, that this hypothesis was based on incomplete evidence and historical misapprehensions. In particular, twentieth-century scholarship focused on the presence in the Libellus of what appeared to be an impossibly lax rule regarding consanguinity and marriage, a rule that (it was thought) Gregory could not possibly have endorsed. It is now known that this <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> not in fact as lax as historians had thought, and moreover that the <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> fully consistent with Gregory's style and mode of thought. Today, Gregory I's authorship of the Libellus is generally accepted. The question of authenticity aside, manuscript and textual evidence indicates that the document was being transmitted in Italy by perhaps as early as the beginning of the seventh century (i.e. shortly after Gregory I's death in 604), and in England {{by the end of the}} same century.|$|E
5|$|This {{restriction}} {{and kind}} of state monopoly {{on the use of}} national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government. It became customary – and still is – for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on strike. This is why the Polish flag, as a symbol of patriotism and resistance against the Communist <b>rule,</b> <b>is</b> part of the Solidarity trade union logo.|$|E

5|$|When the Indian flag is flown on Indian {{territory}} {{along with}} other national flags, the general <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> that the Indian flag should be {{the starting point of}} all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be {{in front of the other}} flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{counsel is}} {{retained}} or appointed, the defendant {{has a right}} to counsel without a conflict of interest. If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal. The general <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived, but some conflicts are un-waiveable.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E

30|$|The use of {{association}} <b>rules</b> <b>is</b> a popular technique of mining data; the technique shows {{the correlation between}} sets of items {{in a series of}} data or transactions. Association <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> an “IF antecedent THEN consequent” type of rule that guarantees, with a certain probability (confidence threshold), that whenever the antecedent happens, the consequent will follow. These <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> generated from sets of elements (itemsets) that appear together with at least some frequency (support). The most popular algorithm for obtaining association <b>rules</b> <b>is</b> Agrawal’s apriori (Agrawal and Srikant 1994). Considering a fixed confidence value, the setting of the support threshold will determine whether too many association <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> set or important relationships in the data are missed.|$|R
40|$|Maternal {{monitoring}} and play <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> examined as correlates of children’s friendship quality, social behavior, and depression in 6 th grade (N 88). Maternal reports of <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> categorized into three types: supervision rules, peer rules, and restriction rules. Each type of <b>rule</b> <b>was</b> {{characterized by the}} number of rules mothers established. Results indicated that monitoring was not significantly correlated with the three types of play rules. Girls who experienced more monitoring had friendships with less conflict and higher positive qualities. Supervision <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> positively related to boys’ prosocial behavior and depression. Peer <b>rules</b> <b>were</b> significantly correlated with peer-rated behavior but not with friendship quality. The importance of distinguishing among various aspects of maternal management is discussed...|$|R
5|$|Although both Futurama and The Simpsons {{were created}} by Matt Groening, overt {{references}} to the latter are mostly avoided in Futurama. One of the few exceptions to this <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> the appearance of Blinky, a three-eyed orange fish seen on The Simpsons, as Fry is going through the tube. A running gag of the series is Bender's fondness for Olde Fortran malt liquor, named after Olde English 800 malt liquor and the programming language Fortran. The drink was first introduced in this episode and became so {{closely associated with the}} character that he was featured with a bottle in both the Rocket USA wind-up toy and the action figure released by Moore Action Collectibles.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla is {{presented}} in ancient sources as a tyrant and cruel leader, an image that has survived into modernity. Dio Cassius and Herodian present Caracalla as a soldier first and emperor second. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth started the legend of Caracalla's role as the king of Britain. Later, in the 18th century, Caracalla's memory was revived {{in the works of}} French artists due to the parallels between Caracalla's apparent tyranny and that of King Louis XVI. Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as a psychopathic and evil ruler. His <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> remembered as being one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors.|$|E
