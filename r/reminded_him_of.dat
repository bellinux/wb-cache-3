5|$|Gröning {{claims that}} this {{disrupted}} the relative tranquility his job gave {{him and he}} claims he yet again complained to his superior. His boss, an SS-Untersturmführer, listened but <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the pledge {{that he and his}} comrades made. Gröning thus returned to work. He has declared that he manipulated his life at Auschwitz so as to avoid witnessing the camp's most unpalatable aspects.|$|E
5|$|Rewrites of {{the script}} {{gradually}} {{moved away from the}} ensemble of comedians and began to focus on two central characters, at which point Murphy left the project.

5|$|Iron Maiden {{were formed}} on Christmas Day in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris {{shortly after he}} left his {{previous}} group, Smiler. Harris attributes the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the iron maiden torture device. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland Point, Stratford.|$|E
5|$|Narcissi {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular garden plants in Islamic culture. Prior to the Arab conquest of Persia, the Persian ruler Khosrau I is said to have not been able to {{tolerate}} them at feasts because they <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> eyes, an association that persists to this day, as described by the poet Ghalib. The eye imagery is also found in a number of poems by Abu Nuwas. Another poet who refers to narcissi, is Rumi. Even the prophet Mohammed is said to have praised the narcissus.|$|E
5|$|The role of Lord W. C. Jackson {{was portrayed}} by C. R. Parthiban, while M. R. Santhanam played the minister, Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai. Kattabomman's {{daughter}} in the film, Meena, was a fictional character created by Krishnasamy. She was based on Krishnasamy's own daughter, Mynavathi, who {{died when she was}} five years old. Krishnasamy initially refused to include the scene involving Meena's death as it <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his daughter, but finally did so reluctantly. The character was played by Baby Kanchana.|$|E

5|$|William Anderson, {{surgeon and}} naturalist on Captain James Cook's third voyage, {{collected}} the first superb fairywren specimen in 1777 while traveling {{off the coast}} of eastern Tasmania, in Bruny Island's Adventure Bay. He named it Motacilla cyanea because its tail <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the European wagtails of the genus Motacilla. Anderson did not live to publish his findings, although his assistant William Ellis described the bird in 1782. The genus Malurus was later described by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816, giving the bird its current scientific name.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{considered}} {{a number of}} titles for the story; his first choice had been The Moonraker, until Noël Coward <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> a novel {{of the same name}} by F. Tennyson Jesse. Fleming then considered The Moonraker Secret, The Moonraker Plot, The Inhuman Element, Wide of the Mark, The Infernal Machine, Mondays are Hell and Out of the Clear Sky. George Wren Howard of Jonathan Cape suggested Bond & the Moonraker, The Moonraker Scare and The Moonraker Plan, while his friend, the writer William Plomer, suggested Hell is Here; the final choice of Moonraker was a suggestion by Wren Howard.|$|E
5|$|Holloman {{began his}} {{professional}} baseball career by recording a 20–5 {{record and a}} 2.33 ERA for the Packers as a rookie in the Class D Georgia–Florida League in 1946. He played winter baseball in Cuba, then had a record of 18–17 for the Macon Peaches of the Sally League the next year. He started the 1948 season with Macon, then after winning eight games {{he was promoted to}} the Nashville Volunteers of the Class AA Southern Association, where he posted seven wins and two losses. While there, Volunteers owner Larry Gilbert gave him the nickname Bobo because the pitcher <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> Bobo Newsom; the nickname stuck with him the rest of his career.|$|E

5|$|In late 1922, Boyce {{departed}} {{on another}} expedition to Africa, {{this time for}} six months. Morocco <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the Dakotas, Kansas, Texas, Florida, and Arizona. In Egypt he visited the tomb of Tutankhamun, which had been discovered {{just a few months}} earlier. His expedition then went to Luxor and sailed up the Nile River to Edfu, where the houses had no roofs and while he was there it rained and hailed {{for the first time in}} decades. Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa, he had shot at least one of every game animal.|$|E
5|$|Pandora– An {{animated}} {{creation of}} Hephaestus who became like a {{daughter to the}} god, and was neither living nor dead. Pandora was imprisoned in the labyrinth by Zeus when he was infected by the fear released from Pandora's Box. Kratos rescued Pandora after he learned {{that she was the}} key to pacifying the Flame of Olympus that surrounded Pandora's Box. Kratos reluctantly allowed Pandora to sacrifice herself to open the Box and mourned her death, as Pandora <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his deceased child Calliope. Pandora reappeared in Kratos' psyche and helped him find the power of hope locked deep inside himself, which allowed him to overcome and kill Zeus. The character was voiced by Natalie Lander in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} {{towards a}} war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at Constantinople, {{in attempts to}} obtain military support from Justinian or at least, {{in the case of}} Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> their long tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies and promised to provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in the larger context of the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|After his expulsion, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Surakarta and studied Western history and {{political}} literature, {{which led to}} an interest in socialism. Some figure that affected him besides Karl Marx were Ortega y Gasset and Jan Romein. While in Surakarta he also worked at his father's hospital. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko was asked to become Deputy Head of the Foreign Press Department in the Ministry of Information. In 1946, {{at the request of}} Prime Minister Sjahrir, he and two friends established a Dutch-language weekly, Het Inzicht (Inside), as a counter to the Dutch-sponsored Het Uίtzicht (Outlook). The next year, they launched a socialist-oriented journal, Siasat (Tactics), which was published weekly. During this period Soedjatmoko dropped the name Mangoendiningrat, as it <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the feudal aspects of Indonesian culture.|$|E
5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers {{of what was to}} lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
5|$|King Kalākaua trusted Rosenberg's {{skill as}} a fortune teller, {{perhaps because the}} way Rosenberg chanted in Hebrew <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> ancient Hawaiian rites. In January 1887, the king—who had become {{increasingly}} autocratic and was facing several scandals—granted Rosenberg a private audience at the palace. The king and Rosenberg became close, and routinely visited each other for several {{days at a time}} and held long conversations. During the audiences, Rosenberg told Bible stories and read from the Talmud. He began to teach the king basic Hebrew, and gave him an ornate Torah and yad that he had brought with him to Hawaii. He also claimed to have found references to Hawaii in ancient Hebrew texts, a statement that encouraged the king to restore aspects of Hawaiian religion. The king had previously sought instruction from several people he regarded as prophets and had established a society dedicated to the revival of native Hawaiian traditions. Finally, the king declared Rosenberg his kahuna-kilokilo, a royal soothsayer.|$|E

5|$|According to Jain {{traditional}} accounts, he {{was born}} to King Nabhi and Queen Marudevi in north Indian city of Ayodhya, also called Vinita. He had two wives, Sunanda and Sumangala. Sumangala is described {{as the mother of}} his ninety-nine sons (including Bharata) and one daughter, Brahmi. Sunanda is depicted as the mother of Bahubali and Sundari. The sudden death of Nilanjana, one of the dancers of Indra, <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> the world's transitory nature and he developed a desire for renunciation. After renouncing, the Jain legends state he wandered without food for a whole year. The day on which he got his first ahara (food), is celebrated as Akshaya Tritiya by Jains. He is said to have attained Moksha on Mount Kailash. The text Adi Purana by Jinasena is an account of the events of his life. His iconography includes colossal statues such as Statue of Ahimsa, Bawangaja and those erected in Gopachal hill. His icons include the eponymous bull as his emblem, the Nyagrodha tree, Gomukha (bull-faced) Yaksha, and Chakreshvari Yakshi.|$|E
5|$|In October 37 AD, Caligula fell seriously ill, {{or perhaps}} was poisoned. He soon {{recovered}} from his illness, but many {{believed that the}} illness turned the young emperor toward the diabolical: he started to kill off or exile those who were close to him or whom he saw as a serious threat. Perhaps his illness <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his mortality and of the desire of others to advance into his place. He had his cousin and adopted son Tiberius Gemellus executed – an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus's mutual grandmother Antonia Minor. She {{is said to have}} committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father-in-law Marcus Junius Silanus and his brother-in-law Marcus Lepidus executed as well. His uncle Claudius was spared only because Caligula preferred to keep him as a laughing stock. His favourite sister Julia Drusilla died in 38 AD of a fever: his other two sisters, Livilla and Agrippina the Younger, were exiled. He hated being the grandson of Agrippa and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually conceived as the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter Julia the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was {{abandoned}} by Gaia when his {{first encounter with}} Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, {{that he needed to}} find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E
