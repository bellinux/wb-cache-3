These very small incomes are mostly derived from manual labor; and, as we now see, any tax imposed on these, either permanently degrades the habits of the laboring-class, or falls on profits, and burdens capitalists with an indirect tax, in addition to their share of the direct taxes; which is doubly objectionable, both as a violation of the fundamental <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality,</b> and for the reasons which, as already shown, render a peculiar tax on profits detrimental to the public wealth, and consequently to the means which society possesses of paying any taxes whatever.|$|E
6000|$|In reality {{there are}} two, and only two, {{foundations}} of law; {{and they are}} both of them conditions without which nothing can give it any force: I mean equity and utility. With respect to the former, it grows out of the great <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality,</b> which is grounded upon our common nature, and which Philo, with propriety and beauty, calls the mother of justice. All human laws are, properly speaking, only declaratory; they may alter the mode and application, but have no power over the substance of original justice. The other foundation of law, which is utility, must be understood, not of partial or limited, but of general and public utility, connected {{in the same manner}} with, and derived directly from, our rational nature: for any other utility may be the utility of a robber, but cannot be that of a citizen,--the interest of the domestic enemy, and not that of a member of the commonwealth. This present equality can never be the foundation of statutes which create an artificial difference between men, as the laws before us do, in order to induce a consequential inequality in the distribution of justice. Law is a mode of human action respecting society, and must be governed by the same rules of equity which govern every private action; and so Tully considers it in his Offices as the only utility agreeable to that nature: [...] "Unum debet esse omnibus propositum, ut eadem sit utilitas uniuscujusque et universorum; quam si ad se quisque rapiat, dissolvetur omnis humana consortio." ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{sensible}} {{that these}} principles, in their abstract light, {{will not be}} very strenuously opposed. Reason is never inconvenient, {{but when it comes}} to be applied. Mere general truths interfere very little with the passions. They can, until they are roused by a troublesome application, rest in great tranquillity, side by side with tempers and proceedings the most directly opposite to them. Men want to be reminded, who do not want to be taught; because those original ideas of rectitude, to which the mind is compelled to assent when they are proposed, are not always as present to it as they ought to be. When people are gone, if not into a denial, at least into a sort of oblivion of those ideas, when they know them only as barren speculations, and not as practical motives for conduct, it will be proper to press, as well as to offer them to the understanding; and when one is attacked by prejudices which aim to intrude themselves into the place of law, what is left for us but to vouch and call to warranty those principles of original justice from whence alone our title to everything valuable in society is derived? Can it be thought to arise from a superfluous, vain parade of displaying general and uncontroverted maxims, that we should revert at this time to the first principles of law, when we have directly under our consideration a whole body of statutes, which, I say, are so many contradictions, which their advocates allow to be so many exceptions from those very principles? Take them in the most favorable light, every exception from the original and fixed <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> and justice ought surely to be very well authorized in the reason of their deviation, and very rare in their use. For, if they should grow to be frequent, in what would they differ from an abrogation of the rule itself? By becoming thus frequent, they might even go further, and, establishing themselves into a principle, convert the rule into the exception. It cannot be dissembled that this is not at all remote from the case before us, where the great body of the people are excluded from all valuable property,--where the greatest and most ordinary benefits of society are conferred as privileges, and not enjoyed on the footing of common rights.|$|E

This concept {{can be applied to}} society by saying that no one has a head start. This means that, for any social equality issue dealing with wealth, social prestige, power, or any of that sort, the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity standard can defend the idea that everyone had the same start. This views society almost as a game and any of the differences in equality are due to luck and playing the [...] "game" [...] to one's best ability.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{territorial}} self-government on the aetivization of the private- -sector economy is noticeable in many spheres. It is regulated by law. However, the actual impact is also conditioned {{by the state}} of development and the character of a commune. The rols of self-government may be particularly important in legal and economic spheres. Therefore, the self-government of economically stronger communes may exert significantly greater impact {{on the development of the}} private sector than the self-government in weaker localities. Usually, the activity of local authorities towards the private sector takes nonimperative forms. The imperative acts of communal organs are exceptional, and are directed at legally guaranteed protection of rights and interests of the local population. Most of the activities carried out by the self-government with respect to the private sector belong to the so-called commune's own tasks. The implementation of such tasks is limited only by law. The present legal regulation providis local authorities with many various instruments of enhancing the development of the private sector. However, any such actions should respect the interests of the local population and should not infringe the principle of freedom of enterprise and the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> before the law.

40|$|The {{reform of}} the nobility in the Kingdom of Poland carried out between 1836 and 1861 by the Russian Empire {{controlling}} its part of Partitioned Poland constituted an element of a wider plan to transform its social and legal systems {{in order to bring}} the structure of the Polish society closer to the Russian one. This plan was part of the anti-Polish policy of the Russian Empire adopted after the defeat of the November Uprising 1830 / 31 the objective of which was to ‘build a united nation of Russians and Poles’. As a result of the reform, the number of Polish nobles was reduced from 300, 000 in 1830 to 84, 800 in 1861, when the nobility accounted only for 17 % of the total population of the Kingdom of Poland. The reform was originally planned for two years but actually lasted 25 years. Following the Russian model, the hereditary as well as personal (life) title was introduced. This principle was overtly contrary to the spirit of the Organic Statute of 1832 and infringed the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> before law, undermining {{at the same time the}} integrity of the civil and criminal codes binding in the Kingdom of Poland.

O instrumento utilizado foram mini-histórias, acompanhadas de desenhos que apresentavam diferentes condições de desempenho dos personagens em diversas situações. Os resultados apontaram três estágios evolutivos, caracterizados pelo uso de regras de autoridade, igualdade e equidade. Como esperado, crianças de cinco a seis anos utilizaram predominantemente regras de autoridade e igualdade, as de nove a dez anos, regras de igualdade e, os adolescentes, regras de eqüidade. Características do uso das regras permitiram também a identificação de sub-estágios em cada estágio. A seqüência evolutiva de níveis no desenvolvimento dos princípios de justiça distributiva encontradas apoiam o modelo piagetiano.

This is a different problem to the content question  whether the law that binds subjects has any necessary connection to the moral purposes that we pursue in our private and public lives.

Another new refinement which appears in this paper is for the elimination rule for the empty type. In all cases, the new feature is that the elimination rule mentions the proof object.
