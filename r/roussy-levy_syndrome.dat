50|$|There is no {{pharmacological}} treatment for <b>Roussy-Lévy</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Roussy-Lévy</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is not a}} fatal {{disease and}} life {{expectancy}} is normal. However, due to progressive muscle wasting patients may need supportive orthopaedic equipment or wheelchair assistance.|$|E
50|$|While the {{clinical}} picture may point towards {{the diagnosis of}} the <b>Roussy-Lévy</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the condition can only be confirmed with absolute certainty by carrying out genetic testing {{in order to identify}} the underlying mutations.|$|E
50|$|To {{create a}} working nerve, neurons, Schwann cells, and {{fibroblasts}} must work together. Molecular signals are exchanged between Schwann cells and neurons to regulate survival and differentiation of a nerve. However, these signals are disrupted {{in patients with}} the <b>Roussy-Lévy</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|As PMP22 {{mutations}} {{are also}} associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and MPZ mutations are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B, it remains the subject of discussion whether the <b>Roussy-Lévy</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a separate entity or a specific phenotype of either disorder.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Roussy-Lévy</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with two genetic mutations: a duplication of the PMP22 gene that carries the instructions for producing the peripheral myelin protein 22, a critical component of the myelin sheath; and a missense mutation in the MPZ gene which codes for myelin protein zero, a major structural protein of peripheral myelin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roussy-Lévy</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{also known}} as Roussy-Lévy {{hereditary}} areflexic dystasia, is a rare genetic disorder of humans that results in progressive muscle wasting. It is caused by mutations in the genes that code for proteins necessary for {{the functioning of the}} myelin sheath of the neurons, affecting the conductance of nerve signals and resulting in loss of muscles' ability to move.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of the <b>Roussy-Lévy</b> <b>syndrome</b> mainly {{stem from}} nerve damage and the {{resulting}} progressive muscle atrophy. Neurological damage may result in absent tendon reflexes (areflexia), some distal sensory loss and decreased excitability of muscles to galvanic and faradic stimulation. Progressive muscle wasting results in weakness of distal limb muscles (especially the peronei), gait ataxia, pes cavus, postural tremors and static tremor of the upper limbs, kyphoscoliosis, and foot deformity.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, {{scientists}} Gustave Roussy and Gabrielle Lévy reported 7 cases {{within a}} same {{family of a}} dominantly inherited disorder over 4 generations. They noticed that prominent features of this disorder were an unsteady gait during early childhood and areflexia, or the absence of reflexes, which eventually lead to clumsiness and muscle weakness. During a nerve biopsy of {{a few of the}} original patients, the demyelinating lesions found led the scientists to believe that the <b>Roussy-Lévy</b> <b>syndrome</b> was a variant of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT-1).|$|E
40|$|We report data on 3 {{members of}} a family {{affected}} by a dominantly inherited disorder closely resembling <b>Roussy-Levy</b> <b>syndrome</b> (RLS). Electrophysiological findings showed a marked decrease of motor and sensory conduction velocities and EMG signs of mild neurogenic damage. Light and electron microscopy of sural nerve biopsy showed a hypertrophic neuropathy with diffuse onion-bulb formations and marked decrease of large size fibers. Teased fiber preparations evidenced reduced internodal lengths and segmental demyelination. Other data from the literature on RLS are reviewed and discussed. The hypothesis that RLS is not a disease entity but a hypertrophic-type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with essential tremor (HMSN type 1) is strongly supported...|$|E
40|$|Postural {{and action}} tremor in {{peripheral}} neuropathy {{is characteristic of}} <b>Roussy-Levy</b> <b>syndrome.</b> A patient with a severe demyelinating neuropathy and disabling neuropathic tremor successfully treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) is reported. Disease onset was at age 63 years with sensory symptoms and slight action tremor. Within the following 9 years a severe, drug resistant, postural and action tremor developed rendering the patient unable to feed himself. At age 72 years the patient was treated by bilateral DBS of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus, with a useful 30 % reduction in tremor. The clinical benefit of the stimulation remained stable over a 1 year postoperative observation period...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensorimotor}} neuropathy of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth type (CMT) is {{the most}} common hereditary disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The X-linked dominant form of CMT (CMTX) is associated with mutations in the gene for the gap junction protein connexin 32. We examined four CMTX pedigrees two of which had potentially novel mutations in the only coding exon of connexin 32. One previously unreported missense mutation, Ala 39 Val, was found in a family displaying a CMT phenotype with additional upper limb postural tremor reminiscent of a <b>Roussy-Levy</b> <b>syndrome.</b> A novel single base insertion, 679 insT, is among the first mutations found in the fourth transmembrane domain of connexin 32. Frameshift and premature stop of translation are supposed to result in a non-functional carboxy-terminus. Two further families had the known missense mutations Arg 15 Trp and Arg 22 Gln. Several female carriers were found normal on clinical presentation, however, the genotype was paralleled by decreased nerve conduction velocities (NCV) and slowed central conduction of brain stem auditory evoked responses (BAER). Median motor NCVs showed mild (in women) to intermediate (in males) reduction, indicating a peripheral neuropathy with a predominating axonal component. Nerve biopsy findings were consistent with the electrophysiological data showing a marked loss of large myelinated fibres and clusters of regenerating axons. Electron microscopy revealed various alterations of the axoglial attachment zone. This suggests defective axon-Schwann cell interactions which may induce the axonopathy in CMTX. Peer reviewe...|$|E
