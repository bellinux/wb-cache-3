5|$|As President of the United States, Rutherford B.

His actions drew heavy criticism from those inside his party, such as Roscoe Conkling of New York and James G. Blaine of Maine. Hayes had known since the dispute over the 1876 election that he was unlikely to win in 1880, and had announced at his 1877 inauguration {{that he would not}} run for a second term. Without an incumbent president in the race, the rival factions within the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds, eagerly anticipated the 1880 presidential election.|$|E

At the national level, Mathias' announcement came shortly after news that Republican Paul Laxalt of Nevada would be retiring as well. The departure of two Republican senators from swing or Democratic-leaning states was treated by <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> leaders as a poor sign of the party's chances in the upcoming elections.
