40|$|Stable phosphanylium salts of [P(NHBut) (C 5 Me 5) ]+ (4) were {{obtained}} via different routes, viz. (i) Al 2 Cl 6 -promoted halide abstraction from a chlorophosphine precursor; (ii) displacement of chloride by the nucleofugic anion, OSO 2 CF 3 -; and (iii) protonation of an iminophosphine precursor. A crystalline product was isolated {{in case of}} the tetrachloroaluminate of (4), and its structure was investigated by x-ray diffractometry. The results confirm the presence of discrete cations, featuring &# 951; 2 attachment of the C 5 Me 5 ligand to phosphorous in the solid state. In solution, according {{to the results of}} NMR spectroscopic studies, the cation exhibits a fluxional structure with all five ring atoms becoming equivalent. Investigations of the chemical reactivity of (4) include acid-base reactions and studies of the coordination chemistry. In addition to activity as both Lewis acid and base, which is a common feature for phosphanylium ions, (4) is the first two-coordinate phosphorous cation which was shown to <b>react</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Broensted <b>acid.</b> Deprotonation initially gives the iminophosphine, P(=NBut) (C 5 Me 5), which further reacts with (4) to yield a polycyclic cation, (14), the structure of which was determined by x-ray diffraction. Reactions of (4) with transition metals involve oxidative addition of complex metal hydrides and coordination to reactive metal centres to give cationic complexes which are isolobal to transition metal carbene complexes. No evidence was obtained in these reactions to indicate any activation of the C 5 Me 5 -phosphorous bonds...|$|R

Treatment of (c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 3 with BI 3 {{in the presence of}} an amine yielded the dimeric {[(c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 12]B} 2 (1). 1 Was also obtained when (c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 3 reacted with LiBH 4, eliminating LiH. However, treatment of LiBH 4 with 2 equiv of (c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 2 OSiMePh 2 gave the solvent-free Li borate salt {[(c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 11 (OSiMePh 2) ] 2 B}-{Li}+ (2). Reaction of GaCl 3 with (c-C 6 H 11) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 3 in the presence of NEt 3 afforded the thermally robust amine adduct [(c-C 6 H 11) 7 Si 7 O 12]Ga. NEt 3 (3). A similar reaction of GaCl 3 with 2 equiv of (c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 2 OSiMePh 2 gave the ammonium gallate {[(c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 11 (OSiMePh 2) ] 2 Ga}-{Et 3 NH}+ (4). Attempts to obtain the corresponding Bronsted acid of 4, as could be obtained for Al, invariably failed. Nevertheless, ammonium salt 4 <b>reacts</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> masked Bronsted <b>acid</b> with the basic GaMe 3 to yield the di-Me Ga gallate [(c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 11 (OSiMePh 2) ] 2 Ga(GaMe 2) (5). The equimolar reaction between GaMe 3 and R 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 3 selectively yielded {[R 7 Si 7 O 11 (OH) ]GaMe} 2 (R = c-C 5 H 9 (6 a), c-C 6 H 11 (6 b)). The fact that in 6 a/b Ga Me and silanol functionalities coexist clearly demonstrates the lower reactivity of Ga-alkyls compared to Al-alkyl groups. The equimolar reaction of GaMe 3 with the monosilylated (c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 2 OSiMePh 2 yielded {[(c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 11 (OSiMePh 2) ]GaMe} 2 (7) <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 5 : 1 : 40 mixt. of three conformational isomers, similar to what was obsd. for the corresponding Me Al silsesquioxanes. The kinetic and thermodn. stability of 7 and its chem. isomer 5 was studied. Isomerization expts. show that both 5 and the main conformer of 7 isomerize to a thermodn. stable mixt. of isomers of 7 with a 2 : 1 : 2 ratio. The di-Me Ga silsesquioxane {[(c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 11 (OSiMePh 2) ] 2 (GaMe 2) 4 } (8) was formed quant. upon treating {[(c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 2 OSiMePh 2]} with 2 equiv of GaMe 3. Likewise, reacting {[(c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 3]} with 3 equiv of GaMe 3 yielded the dimeric {[(c-C 5 H 9) 7 Si 7 O 12] 2 (GaMe 2) 6 } (9). The high tendency of Ga to obtain a tetrahedral coordination results in a crowded structure 9 with remarkable low fluxionality. 2, 4, 5, 6 B, 8, and 9 were structurally characterized by x-ray crystallog...|$|R
