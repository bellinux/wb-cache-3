5000|$|After {{the initial}} {{invasion}} {{the head of}} the Coalition Provisional Authority, Paul Bremer, <b>released</b> <b>Order</b> 69, which established the charter for a new Iraqi National Intelligence Service (INIS). Al-Shahwani was appointed as its first director. [...] He resigned in August 2009, which according to the Washington Post was due to disagreements with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki over Iranian influence in Iraq, and was replaced by General Zuheir Fadel. According to the Iraqi paper Al-Zaman, Shahwani had presented evidence linking Iran to a series of attacks in Iraq including the 19 August 2009 Baghdad bombings, and left when Iraqi leadership refused to publicly implicate Iran in the bombings. Several days later the Iranian mission to the United Nations sent a letter of protest to the Washington Post over the previous article, claiming that Shahwani's statements about Iranian involvement were baseless.|$|E

40|$|On the {{initiative}} of Baan, a global ERP-software supplier, and DAF Trucks, a Dutch truck manufacturer, research was carried out to find the optimal <b>order</b> <b>release</b> decisions. This article describes {{the impact of these}} decisions on the amount of system inventory and the system nervousness. With the use of a simulation tool different scenarios were modelled. In the simulation experiment the following parameters were evaluated: • The use of MRP versus the use of Line Requirements Planning (LRP) for planning orders. • The use of lot-sizes with a fixed order quantity (FOQ) versus a period order quantity (POQ). • <b>Releasing</b> <b>orders</b> with complete series versus <b>releasing</b> <b>orders</b> without complete series. All the scenarios were evaluated for a more deterministic (10 % demand variability) and a more stochastic (100 % demand variability) environment. The first goal was to obtain a predetermined service level, the second goal was to minimise inventory and the third goal was to minimise nervousness. With an equal service level in all scenarios, LRP with <b>releasing</b> <b>orders</b> without complete series outperformed MRP in all scenarios concerning inventory. For minimising nervousness the use of FOQs instead of POQs performed better. So for minimising both inventory and nervousness LRP with <b>order</b> <b>release</b> without complete series and FOQs should be chosen...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} an {{auto parts}} supplier who receives <b>order</b> <b>release</b> updates from its customers and revises its production plan for future periods {{on a weekly}} basis. The inaccuracy of the <b>order</b> <b>releases</b> causes significant costs {{in the form of}} premium expedited transportation, production overtime, and excess inventory. This setting provides a rich context for studying <b>order</b> <b>release</b> variance, because the supply chain has adopted a just-in-time (JIT) approach where ideal inventory levels are kept at zero. This leads to a high reliance on <b>order</b> <b>release</b> accuracy in <b>order</b> to manage production quantities. This paper presents an optimization model that extends previous approaches focused on optimizing production plans to the JIT setting. Furthermore, based on real <b>order</b> <b>release</b> information provided to the supplier, two simple adjustment heuristic methods are developed. The performances of these approaches are compared with relying solely on <b>order</b> <b>releases</b> received from the customers. The simple median-based adjustment heuristic performs the best of all the approaches. Implications of the analysis are also discussed...|$|R
